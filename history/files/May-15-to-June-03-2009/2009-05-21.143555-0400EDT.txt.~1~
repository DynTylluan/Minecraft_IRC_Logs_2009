(15:36:50) Z80__: Awesome, new Wigus.
(15:36:57) fartron: spam is fairly dadaist
(15:37:08) Evil-Ville left the room (quit: Quit: yare yare daze).
(15:37:21) nihilocrat: I wonder what the internet would be like if all the content were in spam-talk
(15:37:25) nihilocrat: or hell
(15:37:28) nihilocrat: just the newspapers even
(15:37:36) Jr: Bloop bleep
(15:37:41) Jr: blip blip beep
(15:37:46) fartron: spam like that would be great if there were no links
(15:37:50) fartron: spam without the pitch
(15:37:57) Z80__: What? What are you penis ehnacments about?
(15:38:00) Z80__: SO CLEVER.
(15:38:09) Siiseli: hrmgh
(15:38:13) nihilocrat: I wonder if you could combat spam with dadaist, pitchless spam
(15:38:22) nihilocrat: like output from dadadodo
(15:38:31) fartron: i don't know.. i think the signal to noise ratio is already as far as it can go
(15:38:35) fartron: adding more noise wouldn't hurt it much
(15:38:35) nihilocrat: fill the internet with meaninglessness
(15:38:36) nihilocrat: yeah
(15:39:21) Cascade: What is it like to accomplish something
(15:39:26) fartron: i don't know

(15:40:47) Z80: Cascade, depends on what you accomplish...
(15:40:51) Z80: I would assume.
(15:41:19) Cascade: Haha, Z80 you are exempt from this question as nobody is expected to accomplish anything at that age
(15:41:25) Z80: Teehee.
(15:41:31) Z80: Fair enough.
(15:41:57) konjak: paiiinnnn
(15:42:06) Xander: For me it was a little uncomfortable
(15:42:23) Xander: Mostly because I accomplished freezing an entire room in awkard silence
(15:42:37) fartron: i didn't know ann margret was swedish
(15:42:50) Udderdude: moo
(15:43:06) fartron: utter dude
(15:43:47) Udderdude: what's up

(15:44:10) doohan: Who still uses inches?
(15:44:16) fartron: me
(15:44:25) fartron: and my three hundred million compatriots

(15:44:28) doohan: I feel for you.
(15:44:33) fartron: psh
(15:44:35) fartron: i feel for you
(15:44:41) fartron: the metric system is a tool of the devil
(15:44:42) Xander: Me
(15:44:45) nihilocrat: I feel... nothing
(15:44:49) doohan: You're missing out on the ease of the metric system
(15:44:55) JohannesG: metric system ftw
(15:44:59) doohan: Yes!
(15:45:03) fartron: my car gets 50 rods to the hogshead and that's the way i likes it
(15:45:23) Ina_: Metric system is incomplete >:
(15:45:27) doohan: No it's not.
(15:45:36) Ina_: It's lacking metric time >:
(15:45:40) doohan: Just divide and multiply by 100s to your hearts content
(15:45:42) doohan: Ahh yes.
(15:45:52) Jr: corpus
(15:45:55) Jr: hello

(15:46:11) Jr: hello
(15:46:15) doohan: So can we :P
(15:46:17) JohannesG: kiloseconds?
(15:46:24) doohan: milliseconds?
(15:46:24) Cascade: Metric time would be great
(15:46:35) Cascade: Who thought up 24 hours, so STUPID
(15:46:38) Jr: much better
(15:46:40) Jr: yeah

(15:46:47) Jr: 10 hours a day
(15:46:49) Jr: awesome
(15:46:52) fartron: metric time is stupid
(15:47:00) Cascade: Months are retarded too
(15:47:08) Z80 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:47:21) fartron: there was a vernor vinge story where everything was kiloseconds and stuff
(15:47:24) fartron: it was fucking annoying
(15:47:25) doohan: Yeah screw those guys
(15:47:30) Jr: I suggest we go by planet rotation
(15:47:39) Jr: things get messed up otherwise
(15:47:52) fartron: yeah if only there were a system that measured time based on the rotation of the planet
(15:47:52) Jr: even better
(15:47:54) Jr: GALAXY ROATIONS
(15:48:18) Jr: I mean for days of the month
(15:48:22) Cascade: Problem is, could you imagine moving from one planetary time zone to another?
(15:48:27) doohan: Chaos
(15:48:31) doohan: You'd just use earth time
(15:48:35) doohan: Infact
(15:48:38) Jr: or
(15:48:39) fartron: "earth time"
(15:48:42) Jr: planetary time
(15:48:45) fartron: what time do you have doohan
(15:48:48) Jr: for each one
(15:48:49) nihilocrat: that's what star trek does
(15:48:51) doohan: Interplanertry british summer time :)
(15:48:57) doohan: -r
(15:49:09) doohan: fartron, I'm in the uk, 20:49
(15:49:12) fartron: funny, cause i think EST should be the interplanetary standard
(15:49:14) Cascade: Recursive interplanetary british summer time?
(15:49:24) fartron: so does cory doctorow btw
(15:49:42) fartron: http://craphound.com/est/download.php
(15:50:05) doohan: You poor people and your inches and off centre time zone
(15:50:15) fartron: you spelled center wrong
(15:50:50) doohan: And your poor spelling
(15:50:59) doohan: Everyone knows the cool kids hang out in BST :)
(15:51:17) fartron: is that different from greenwich time
(15:51:29) doohan: Yeah our clock changes in the summer
(15:51:38) Ina_: Everybody knows the cool kids hang out in CEST*
(15:51:42) fartron: yeah we do that but we don't change the name of the place
(15:51:52) Ina_: fartron, yes you do.
(15:51:55) fartron: no
(15:51:57) fartron: EST or EDT
(15:52:02) fartron: not GMT or BST
(15:52:07) Ina_: fartron, there's also BT
(15:52:12) Ina_: British Time
(15:52:16) doohan: GMT or GMT+1 works too
(15:52:18) fartron: well that's what i was asking about
(15:52:31) Ina_: And there's also WET/WEST for those timezones.
(15:52:49) Ina_: Western European (Summer) Time
(15:53:05) fartron: so you mean you guys have timezones arranged vertically
(15:53:11) fartron: just to assuage your silly nationalistic egos
(15:53:30) doohan: Kinda fits with the rotation of the earth
(15:53:42) doohan: Or something like that
(15:53:49) fartron: no i meant vertically the other way
(15:54:00) Cascade: Guys I need you to explain this to me: http://cascadeup.com/misc/what.png
(15:54:02) Ina_: fartron, Europe is small enough that dividing it into Western/Central/Eastern is good enough.
(15:54:03) fartron: on top of each otheer
(15:54:12) fartron: yeah but part of europe is in GMT
(15:54:16) fartron: but you don't call it GMT?
(15:54:31) fartron: and they call it BT
(15:54:37) fartron: and you call it WET
(15:54:39) Ina_: fartron, GMT and BT and WET are synonyms.
(15:54:44) fartron: yeah that's my point
(15:54:49) fartron: silly nationalistic egos
(15:54:56) Ina_: GMT is the offset
(15:55:21) doohan: Parts of west africa are gmt:0 as well
(15:55:25) Ina_: BT is nationalism, because it's exactly the same as WET, which is also used by portugal and (IIRC) Iceland.
(15:55:28) doohan: Don't know if the bother with bst there though
(15:55:36) fartron: WET is nationalism too because GMT came first
(15:55:47) fartron: and you guys just don't want to talk about the naval observatory
(15:55:52) Ina_: fartron, WET is for regularization.
(15:55:57) fartron: quote unquote

(15:56:57) fartron: non trivial things
(15:57:02) Ina_: point.

(16:03:49) Z80: Wat.
(16:04:05) Xander: heh, I was awful trying to do my essays for the end of the year
(16:04:17) Xander: I could've gotten it done a lot sooner had I not just buggered around so much
(16:04:45) Z80: How many people over there say "buggered around?"
(16:04:46) Cascade: It would not be a waste of time to create some sort of game yes
(16:04:54) Z80: Because that is just awesome.
(16:05:05) Cascade: But what
(16:05:30) Z80: I want to see Cascade make some IF.
(16:05:43) Cascade: I started making an IF
(16:05:54) Cascade: Want to see it? Note that you cannot complete it at this point
(16:06:23) Z80: Send me the link, but I just started playing TF2.
(16:06:44) Z80: No offense.
(16:07:11) Z80: I would have said that if Pixel had just joined and said, "WHO WANTS TO PLAYTEST CAVE STORY 2?!"
(16:07:25) fartron: really?
(16:07:34) tantan: i don't like cs that much
(16:07:37) Z80: Well, I don't like Cave Story all that much.

(16:43:27) Notch_: oh god
(16:43:56) doohan: hahaha
(16:44:22) Xander: oh dear
(16:45:08) Xander: Minecraft encourages the player to indulge in gay orgies between the physically malformed. BAN THIS SICK FILTH
(16:46:14) Z80_: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LImI26d1W6A&fmt=18 | YES.  YMCK is the best.
(16:46:58) jsticker: ymck lets go, lets go
(16:48:07) Jarp: jorbert
(16:48:12) jsticker: JARP
(16:49:06) jsticker: what's the story behind this new nickname, jr?
(16:49:44) Jarp: My end-year paper
(16:49:49) Jarp: that is what I am doing
(16:49:52) Jarp: it is due tomorrow
(16:49:55) Jarp: I have to write
(16:50:12) Jarp: JARP = Junior Argumentative Research Paper
(16:50:13) jsticker: Isn't being on IRC a bad idea then?
(16:50:17) jsticker: :O
(16:50:24) jsticker: Fancy name
(16:50:34) Jarp: yes it is a terrible idea
(16:50:34) Cascade: J...jarp?
(16:50:41) Jarp: Yeah?
(16:50:43) Xander: Irc is the perfect idea
(16:50:52) Xander: we have juvenille arguements all the time!
(16:51:12) Jarp: also known as Junior Anal-Rape Project
(16:51:15) jsticker: :D
(16:51:18) Cascade: yarp
(16:51:19) Cascade: narp
(16:51:21) Cascade: jarp
(16:51:25) Jarp: because that's what it feels like
(16:51:30) Jarp: WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT
(16:51:38) jsticker: what was the movie where the guy only said yarp and yarp and then narp
(16:51:39) C418: isn't the newest team fortress level the anagram of hot anal sex?
(16:51:44) Xander: Hot Fuzz
(16:51:47) jsticker: riiiight
(16:56:29) Parthon: Hot Fuzz
(16:56:43) Jarp: Hot Fuzz
(16:57:04) OEP: Toh Zuff
(16:57:27) Parthon: c418: why do you know that?
(16:58:02) Androu1 left the room (quit: Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by FuckPingOut))).
(16:58:02) FuckPingOut [Androu1@190-76-20-92.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(16:58:31) C418: this irc channel told me
(16:58:40) Parthon: :o
(16:58:44) Parthon: I will have to end them
(16:59:24) Super-Dot left the room (quit: Quit: Super-Dot).
(16:59:40) FuckPingOut is now known as Androu1
(17:00:43) tantan: hot fuzz is good times
(17:00:50) Kobel: He never said narp
(17:01:20) Esquar_ [Leroy@86.85.84.223] entered the room.
(17:01:29) Kobel: Unless you're talking about Simon Pegg's character
(17:01:46) gustav left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(17:02:14) Esquar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:03:00) jsticker: he said norp, didn't he
(17:03:21) Kobel: I don't think the big guy ever said anything except yarp
(17:03:28) C418: he did say narp once
(17:03:34) jsticker: I'm certain he negated something at the end
(17:03:37) sabot|pixelling [Blah@genld-216-038.t-mobile.co.uk] entered the room.
(17:03:39) Cascade: No, that was Angel
(17:03:40) sabot|pixelling left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(17:03:42) Cascade: Pretending to be the guy
(17:03:45) C418: possible
(17:03:46) Kobel: And then when Simon Pegg's character tried to imitate him on the radio he guessed at what the guy would say
(17:03:47) sabot|pixelling [Blah@genld-216-038.t-mobile.co.uk] entered the room.
(17:03:48) Cascade: He didn't know what his version of "no" was
(17:03:55) Dragonmaw [dragonmaw@c-98-247-110-202.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:03:56) Cascade: N... narp?
(17:04:02) sabot|pixelling left the room.
(17:04:07) Kobel: Yeah it surprises me that so many people misremember it, that bit was hilarious
(17:04:39) jsticker: it's been 2 or 3 years :<
(17:04:55) Kobel: You should watch it again then!
(17:04:58) Androu1: Minecraft needs a map :U
(17:05:11) Androu1: or something
(17:05:23) Cascade: Brandon's review of braid on the front page is really terrible
(17:05:34) Kobel: Why?
(17:05:45) Succendo left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:05:55) jsticker: Tig's Brondon?
(17:05:55) Cascade: He says braid "the naturally divergent forces of Story and Gameplay"
(17:05:56) tantan: yeah, why
(17:06:10) tantan: why would you say anythhing of BRONDON's is terrible
(17:06:11) Kobel: Well, Jon Blow argues they ARE naturally divergent
(17:06:14) Kobel: In his lectures
(17:06:17) Kobel: So I think that's fair
(17:06:25) nihilocrat: I didn't see Story enter into braid at all
(17:06:25) Cascade: Not only is that a horrible way to say anything, the story of braid was related in books before any of the actual action happens
(17:06:30) nihilocrat: because you could skip it all
(17:06:39) Cascade: It's embarassing
(17:06:54) Cascade: watching people kiss Jon Blow's ass
(17:06:55) Kobel: The story of Braid is mostly related in gameplay
(17:06:57) gustav [none@90-231-190-155-no124.tbcn.telia.com] entered the room.
(17:07:10) nihilocrat: yeah there's this talk that Blow gave, I saw the slides
(17:07:11) El_Shamro [Shamro@c-67-184-96-210.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:07:12) Kobel: Yes I'm sure that's why people like Braid.
(17:07:19) nihilocrat: the challenge of gameplay works against story and vice versa
(17:07:22) Kobel: To kiss the ass of some guy most of them will never meet. 
(17:07:24) nihilocrat: think of it this way...
(17:07:27) Kobel: You are a transcendant genius.
(17:07:31) nihilocrat: if it's really challenging to finish level 3
(17:07:41) nihilocrat: most people will never see the story past level 3
(17:07:43) nihilocrat: however
(17:07:48) nihilocrat: if you make it so that everyone could beat the game
(17:07:54) nihilocrat: it's probably not too challenging
(17:08:10) nihilocrat: I believe that's sort of a poorly worded interpretation of his argument
(17:08:15) Kobel: I liked where he talked about why challenge has been used in games
(17:08:31) Kobel: Because if it's hard that makes it seem significant and worthwhile, which is engaging
(17:08:38) Kobel: But then not everyone finishes
(17:08:53) Kobel: And to resolve that they make a lot of games seem hard when they actually aren't
(17:09:02) Kobel: That made sense to me.
(17:10:29) tantan: I didn't finish braid
(17:10:35) tantan: i had fun though
(17:10:47) jsticker: Braid was fun but it also was too easy
(17:10:48) fartron: the problem is linearity
(17:10:51) Kobel: It's worth finishing, the ending sequence is pretty great
(17:10:52) fartron: "finishing" a game is stupid
(17:10:55) tantan: it's mainly because i don't like using walkthroughs on puzzle games
(17:11:03) tantan: i almost never beat games
(17:11:06) tantan: true story
(17:11:11) jsticker: but braid is easy
(17:11:14) Jarp: I often give up at the last boss
(17:11:15) tantan: :(
(17:11:15) jsticker: you don't need walkthroughs
(17:11:20) tantan: :(
(17:11:23) jsticker: just try it again, tantan
(17:11:25) Kobel: It's not very easy, it's just short (imo)
(17:11:31) Jarp: it's true, tantan
(17:11:32) tantan: no, i have
(17:11:35) Kobel: Some of the ring puzzles are pretty fucking tricky, or were for me
(17:11:38) Jarp: it's a different kind of thinking
(17:11:43) jsticker: Kobel, you are right too
(17:11:46) Jarp: and you have to ruminate a little bit
(17:11:47) jsticker: it is short AND easy
(17:11:47) Kobel: But with all of them, you know, once they click they ARE easy
(17:11:58) Kobel: But until then they aren't
(17:11:59) tantan: i get stuck on the ghost tim levels
(17:12:08) Kobel: So a lot of it seems easy in retrospect
(17:12:11) fartron: http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080623/stevens
(17:12:20) tantan: i think that's unique to braid, really
(17:12:30) jsticker: it was a good decision to allow the player to skip levels as they liked
(17:12:47) Kobel: The ghost tim levels pissed me off a little because there was one puzzle I solved but for some reason there was some weird timing thing that was fucking me up
(17:12:57) Kobel: So even though I solved it it took me forever to SOLVE it
(17:13:08) jsticker: because you have hands like a donkey
(17:13:16) Jarp: LIKE A DONKEY
(17:13:21) Z80_: Have we all seen http://www.inbflat.net/ ?
(17:13:30) Kobel: Not it's because I didn't understand why it was being so fucking uncooperative and still don't XD
(17:13:43) Kobel: My ghost's continuity kept getting broken
(17:13:57) Cascade: Yeah, that happened to me, too
(17:14:04) Cascade: Probably the only puzzle I had "trouble" with
(17:14:33) Kobel: I had a lot more trouble with the later ring puzzles
(17:14:38) Cascade: Those were easy, just boring
(17:14:43) Kobel: But it didn't bother me because it was the right kind of trouble
(17:15:02) Kobel: Okay I'm going to stop talking now because I'm getting annoyed.
(17:15:20) jsticker: *annoying
(17:15:45) C418: feel the love
(17:15:46) Kobel: Hohohoho yes I'm terribly annoying.
(17:15:51) jsticker: :(
(17:15:54) Cascade: Agreed
(17:15:55) Kobel: Such cleverness in here today.
(17:15:56) jsticker: i luv you Kobel
(17:16:03) Z80_: FUCK.
(17:16:15) Z80_: Someone posted a site in the Mancrib.
(17:16:18) Cascade: Kobel is having a fit because we said bad things about a game he likes.
(17:16:33) jsticker: it happens, Z80_
(17:16:35) nihilocrat: ig'zo!
(17:16:37) Z80_: It was a mixing of this stupid cat video and the Psycho theme.
(17:16:43) Kobel: No I'm just realizing that basically everything I've heard out of you has pissed me off and maybe I should stop talking to you
(17:16:55) Z80_: It was a site for putting two YouTube videos together.
(17:17:00) Z80_: *side by side
(17:17:01) jsticker: you have the patience of a donkey
(17:17:12) Z80_: I cannot find this site anymore.
(17:18:02) Z80_: Does anyone know what it is?
(17:18:21) Kobel: I remember seeing it once but that's all
(17:18:23) tantan: http://www.youtubedoubler.com/
(17:18:28) tantan: boom, headshot
(17:18:46) Z80_: Thank you.

(17:21:19) Jarp left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(17:22:10) Kobel: TBH what makes me really mad is the way he made a game and people said it was good but he didn't respect it at all and treated it as a joke. I don't know, I feel like our games and creations deserve better.
(17:22:25) Kobel: That's all. Fuck it.
(17:22:25) Jr [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:22:43) jsticker: I can't follow you on this one, kobler
(17:22:46) fartron: MY HANDS ARE SHAKIN MY HANDS ARE SHAKIN
(17:23:23) Kobel: I just feel like it's a really shitty thing to do, when someone tells you something you made is enjoyable to them, to say "NO IT ISN'T" and then piss all over it
(17:23:27) Jr: fartron: lay off las drugas
(17:23:34) jw: why is that S:
(17:23:37) fartron: AND I'M STILL SHOOTIN
(17:23:41) fartron: AND I'M STILL GETTIN HEADSHOTS
(17:23:42) jw: if you need to get rid of the shakin
(17:23:43) Siiseli: Kobel, yeah 
(17:23:44) jw: get some more
(17:23:47) Jr: SHOOTIN' UP
(17:23:57) jsticker: did blow do that, koblr?
(17:24:00) Siiseli: fartron, grats.
(17:24:08) Kobel: Part of the reason I'm into making games is that I think they're worthy of respect
(17:24:13) Kobel: No, Cascade did :\
(17:24:27) jsticker: cascade made something you enjoy?
(17:24:28) Kobel: IMO
(17:24:39) nihilocrat: part of the reason I'm into making games is because it gets me mad chicks
(17:24:45) Jr: I don't make games
(17:24:50) Kobel: He made that little Chessminer game which everyone agreed was pretty solid and enjoyable
(17:24:54) Jr: I am a real artist
(17:25:02) Jr: :D
(17:25:07) Kobel: And he said "No it's shitty" and proceeded to make it look stupid in every way possible
(17:25:10) JohannesG: you don't make games, you make interactive paintings :P
(17:25:11) Z80_: http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWEyCjN9riiY&video2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4InqZVJoJD8 | AAAW YEAH.
(17:25:19) nyarla [nyarla@203.219.94.251] entered the room.
(17:25:20) Jr: JohannesG: pah
(17:25:23) Jr: as if
(17:25:28) jsticker: Jr is not satisfied with this childish crap
(17:25:35) Jr: yeah, really
(17:25:47) Jr: hahaha
(17:26:07) JohannesG: the reason i'm into making video games is because i grew up in the middle of nowhere with no people around (except my family) in like 10-40km radius.
(17:26:11) JohannesG: there was nothing else to do
(17:26:16) JohannesG: :P
(17:26:17) Kobel: Anyway, sorry, it happened like a month ago, but it bothered me then and this has just reminded me that it bothered me
(17:26:30) Jr: Kobel: yes
(17:26:31) Kobel: Because it's the same attitude at work. Dismissiveness
(17:26:35) Jr: it's not a good thing to do
(17:26:52) Jr: You've got to be proud of what you succeed at
(17:26:54) jsticker: heh, Z80_
(17:27:00) Jr: and recognize what you fail at
(17:27:04) Jr: and get better
(17:27:05) Kobel: I should probably get lunch, right now I'm overcaffeinated and haven't eaten and it's making me jittery XD
(17:27:06) jsticker: it's not just about being proud, Jr
(17:27:15) jsticker: it's about not ruining other people's experiences
(17:27:19) Kobel: Yeah, I think it's that cynicism that's so popular now
(17:27:20) Jr: that too
(17:27:29) Jr: and that too
(17:27:33) jsticker: :D
(17:27:37) Jr: I am ahead of the curve
(17:27:40) Kobel: It's a really unpleasant thing, and fortunately cynicism is finally falling out of fashion
(17:27:44) Jr: Cynical beyond my years
(17:27:52) Kobel: Which Obama is a symptom of
(17:27:55) fartron: cynicism is the best
(17:28:00) jsticker: cynicism is fucking awful, yeah
(17:28:02) InaVegt [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(17:28:04) Jr: it is
(17:28:07) jsticker: it ruins everything it touches
(17:28:10) Kobel: Skepticism good, cynicism bad
(17:28:10) fartron: no no
(17:28:24) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:28:34) Kobel: Hi Beemer
(17:28:37) jsticker: we're not talking about cynical comments, Kobel
(17:28:46) jsticker: but more like cynicism as a view on the world
(17:28:48) gsoto_ [gsoto@r190-135-166-162.dialup.adsl.anteldata.net.uy] entered the room.
(17:28:55) jsticker: being cynic is also a character trait
(17:28:56) Kobel: Yeah jsticker I know, what I say still stands
(17:29:08) Kobel: Skepticism is a healthy outlook, cynicism is not
(17:29:11) nihilocrat: attitude at work here is pretty terrible because we have no influcence over the actual development of the game
(17:29:14) jsticker: Oooh, Kobel, I meant to highlight fartron
(17:29:15) jsticker: Sorry
(17:29:17) Kobel: Ah
(17:29:23) nihilocrat: it was absolutely shit around post-launch, and the layoffs
(17:29:27) gsoto left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:29:28) fartron: i am talking about cynicism as a worldview also
(17:29:28) Kobel: But a lot of people get those two mixed up
(17:29:29) BMcC: Howdy
(17:29:31) gsoto_ is now known as gsoto
(17:29:31) fartron: and it is awesome
(17:29:39) fartron: They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, or fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.
(17:29:43) fartron: the cynics
(17:29:43) C418: http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuAUPt9SX2qk&video2=http://www.youtube.com/v/Q46JTAGRE6w
(17:29:44) Kobel: So with the rise of proper skepticism, cynicism rode its coattails
(17:29:45) Jr: hm
(17:29:47) C418: not safe for work.
(17:29:50) Jr: my cynicism is narrow
(17:29:53) Jr: limited to school
(17:29:53) BMcC: HEY GUYS remember how the internet is full of assholes?
(17:29:56) BMcC: Sometimes I forget
(17:29:58) Jr: and the internet
(17:30:02) Ina_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:30:06) fartron: my cynicism has no limits!
(17:30:09) Kobel: I get reminded pretty regularly
(17:30:10) Jr: but otherwise I think things are great
(17:30:12) fartron: all of life is disappointing!
(17:30:16) SwaggeringSycophant [ijiero@d54C02A91.access.telenet.be] entered the room.
(17:30:32) jsticker: to find cynicism awesome is already working against cynicism
(17:30:34) Kobel: What reminded you BMcC?
(17:30:35) Jr: I want to be a classical cynic
(17:30:36) fartron: psh
(17:30:39) jsticker: sup BMcC
(17:30:44) SwaggeringSycophant: hello there
(17:31:04) InaVegt left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:31:08) Jr: Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a life free from all possessions.
(17:31:13) jsticker: BMcC, i noticed with joy that you're still up for euro-tigging
(17:31:15) fartron: i just said that
(17:31:20) Jr: They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.
(17:31:36) Kobel: Yeah that sounds like a good outlook. Too bad the word's been taken over by assholes
(17:31:36) Jr: oh, hey there cynicism
(17:31:45) Jr: worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society
(17:31:48) Jr: that sounds bad
(17:31:50) SwaggeringSycophant left the room.
(17:32:06) Jr: I should start a philosophy
(17:32:11) jsticker: what's bad about this is that they had all this 2200 years ago
(17:32:15) jsticker: and they noticed it's a problem
(17:32:18) jsticker: and we're still here
(17:32:22) jsticker: with the same stuff
(17:32:37) fartron: you know what the answer is
(17:32:38) Kobel: Well, some of them are worthless. It's what skepticism is good for, culling out the bad parts
(17:32:48) jsticker: it can only be terrorism and suicide, fartron
(17:32:48) Kobel: I would like a tuna sammich. I've been making those
(17:32:55) fartron: you are close!
(17:32:58) fartron: it comes from berlin!
(17:32:58) Kobel: I chop up a green onion into them
(17:33:06) fartron: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bivsP_h6l0s&fmt=18
(17:33:26) jsticker: that's horrible music :(
(17:33:33) fartron: no yo uare

(19:33:54) RinkuHero: the book names are longer to type
(19:33:54) Jrafk: I have read that one
(19:34:02) Jrafk: and seen A scanner darkly
(19:34:03) fartron: so is The transmigration of Timoth Archer
(19:34:12) nyarla: they are rather
(19:34:28) fartron: anyway, Dr Bloodmoney: Or How We Got Along After The Bomb features this little weasely character who is an ayn rand fan
(19:34:37) fartron: and he gets all excited when the bombs start falling
(19:34:55) fartron: because he is excited that things will be like how she says they should in the post-apocalypse
(19:35:20) Rosetta left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).

(19:37:57) Jrafk: but easter eggs are awesome
(19:38:01) RinkuHero: yes, i twont' be something mandatory
(19:38:05) RinkuHero: just something optional/fun

(19:47:53) fartron: i want to make my car look like it was actually on fire
(19:47:56) Jrafk: I wish I could suspend
(19:47:57) PFawkes: so it doesn't look retarded anymore
(19:47:59) Jrafk: but nooooo
(19:48:01) fartron: with scorch marks and swirly oil colors
(19:48:01) Jrafk: I can't
(19:48:05) PFawkes: why not?
(19:48:09) Jrafk: my hardware does not work after a resume
(19:48:10) PFawkes: most computers can now
(19:48:13) Jrafk: it suspends
(19:48:15) PFawkes: hm
(19:48:20) PFawkes: odd
(19:48:20) Jrafk: but then nothing works
(19:48:25) fartron: so who watches Lost??
(19:48:25) Jrafk: no keyboard, mouse, monitor
(19:48:28) PFawkes: this being a laptop, it's better set up I guess?
(19:48:30) PFawkes: I don't know
(19:48:42) Jrafk: fartron: DUMB PEOPLE
(19:48:46) PFawkes: but I am happy that I can have it suspend on close ONLY when unplugged
(19:48:48) PFawkes: and not when plugged in
(19:48:51) PFawkes: that is a nice touch

(19:49:17) PFawkes: so I can download and so on

(19:49:56) Jrafk: no, Harper's
(19:50:01) Jrafk: and NPR, yes
(19:50:03) ***PFawkes reads skeptical inquirer
(19:50:15) PFawkes: Skeptical Inquirer, which is like the opposite of a tabloid
(19:50:25) Z80: Jrafk if anything ever makes you happy it will be this: http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWEyCjN9riiY&video2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4InqZVJoJD8
(19:50:25) Jrafk: Harper's is like The New Yorker but less fiction
(19:50:29) PFawkes: it's like a tabloid for sciencey people
(19:50:31) fartron: a couple of weeks ago i was telling my friend about something from the internet, i don't remember what, and she goes "oh yeah.. i heard about that on NPR"
(19:50:44) Jrafk: I want to get a New Yorker subscription
(19:50:48) fartron: of course you do
(19:50:54) PFawkes: I love NPR though
(19:50:58) fartron: yeah NPR is okay
(19:51:00) PFawkes: but I don't like the New Yorker
(19:51:03) Z80: My parent's have a New Yorker subscription.
(19:51:08) PFawkes: Wait Wait  Don't Tell Me :D
(19:51:08) fartron: but it made me recognize the growing digital divide between me and my friends

(19:52:13) PFawkes: my friend writes fan fiction
(19:52:17) PFawkes: VIETNAM fan ficiton
(19:52:24) fartron: fan of the country or the war
(19:52:29) Jrafk: best program ever:  This American Life

(19:53:25) fartron: that deaf dumb and blind kid
(19:53:34) PFawkes: sure plays a mean pinball
(19:53:36) Z80: SURE PLAYS A MEAN PINBALL.

(19:54:05) Jrafk: and the economy
(19:54:11) PFawkes: yes, she's a terrible person
(19:54:20) PFawkes: her economics would be a very bad idea

(19:54:38) PFawkes: she hates homeless people
(19:54:44) Z80: What.
(19:55:00) fartron: i was asking people i know recently this question
(19:55:21) fartron: what sort of things, when you find out about someone, makes you turn off complete, and dismiss them
(19:55:22) PFawkes: ?
(19:55:26) fartron: for me it was appreciation of ayn rand
(19:55:32) Jrafk: homosexuality
(19:55:33) PFawkes: I've read a lot of Ayn Rand
(19:55:38) PFawkes: but I don't agree with her
(19:55:40) Jrafk: (not really)
(19:55:45) PFawkes: hmm...
(19:55:47) Jrafk: I don't agree with her at all
(19:55:51) fartron: the second someone tells me they like atlas shrugged i dismiss them
(19:55:52) Jrafk: but she proves a nice point for me
(19:55:57) Jrafk: people are greedy and selfish
(19:55:59) PFawkes: For me: agreeing with Rush limbaugh
(19:56:07) PFawkes: (which is a lot of people)
(19:56:27) fartron: where do you live fawkes?
(19:56:33) Jrafk: I don't have much that makes me dismiss people offhand
(19:56:38) Jrafk: I can't think of anything
(19:56:49) fartron: you don't dismiss objectivists?
(19:56:53) Jrafk: naw
(19:56:54) lansing: i dismiss people who tell me they're in a pyramid scheme

(19:57:46) PFawkes: you know we might secede?
(19:57:50) fartron: hah
(19:57:52) fartron: you tried that once
(19:57:52) Jrafk: Just look at me, becoming increasingly snarky.
(19:57:54) PFawkes: the governor wants to secede
(19:57:55) fartron: it didn't work out so well
(19:57:56) BMcC: Internet connection!  SADNESS!
(19:58:03) Siiseli: aagh I wish I had the skills to make a multiplayer online competitive exploration puzzle platformer :(
(19:58:09) fartron: yeah, it makes me laugh fawkes
(19:58:11) Jrafk: I do not want a passport just to go to Texas.
(19:58:12) fartron: it's like he doesn't know history at all
(19:58:12) Siiseli: with procedurally generated maps
(19:58:14) Jrafk: that would not be nice
(19:58:15) PFawkes: actually, Texas itself did ok in the civil war
(19:58:22) PFawkes: they also didn't have quite so much slavery
(19:58:24) fartron: mainly because it was barely involved
(19:58:24) Z80: But alone...
(19:58:28) Siiseli: where you would be competing with someone else on who finishes the thing first
(19:58:30) fartron: but it still was on the losing side
(19:58:37) fartron: and was forced to unseceed
(19:58:37) Siiseli: and you could kill each other and STUFF
(19:58:39) PFawkes: well, fartron, the thing is
(19:58:41) Z80: If Texas was alone, they'd be fucked.
(19:58:43) PFawkes: Texas was a country for a while
(19:58:44) PFawkes: you know
(19:58:48) fartron: you mean mexico?
(19:58:50) Z80: Yeah.
(19:58:51) PFawkes: no

(19:59:03) Jrafk: mexico
(19:59:07) Jrafk: going to war with texas
(19:59:09) Jrafk: as a country
(19:59:09) PFawkes: Texas had its own revolution
(19:59:10) fartron: yeah, but this whole thing about how "our constitution says we can seceed"
(19:59:12) fartron: is retarded
(19:59:13) BMcC: Puzzles + procedural generation?  Madness!
(19:59:15) PFawkes: and became a country
(19:59:15) fartron: because we say you can't
(19:59:16) lansing: el republico of texico
(19:59:18) Jrafk: fartron yes
(19:59:18) fartron: so fuck your constitution
(19:59:20) PFawkes: and then later joined america
(19:59:24) Jrafk: TEXICO
(19:59:26) Z80: Oh, yeah, that's right, PFawkes.
(19:59:27) Z80: Teehee.
(19:59:30) Z80: I forgot.
(19:59:31) Z80: :P
(19:59:32) PFawkes: when South Dakota wants to be a country
(19:59:35) PFawkes: THEN I laugh :D
(19:59:38) PFawkes: they're so tiny
(19:59:45) fartron: also no ciites
(19:59:46) Jrafk: what 'bout RI?
(19:59:49) Jrafk: THAT's tiny
(19:59:50) JohannesG left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(19:59:52) fartron: i would like to see south dakota survive without federal funds
(19:59:53) PFawkes: yes, Jrafk
(19:59:58) fartron: RI has cities
(19:59:59) fartron: and money
(20:00:00) fartron: and ports
(20:00:01) PFawkes: but I'm saying, Texas has a lot of oil and so on
(20:00:03) fartron: RI could survive
(20:00:03) Z80: If Rhode Island seceeded nobody would notice.
(20:00:10) PFawkes: they might be able to pull it off, if we were lucky
(20:00:12) Z80: (It was a joke.)
(20:00:13) RinkuHero: i thought texas was out of oil
(20:00:18) Jrafk: Also, I found out today via wolfram|alpha that I have never been more than about 220 miles from home
(20:00:23) RinkuHero: that they reached their local peak oil around the 40s or something
(20:00:25) fartron: no, i'm pretty sure they could never pull it off
(20:00:27) PFawkes: also tech
(20:00:33) fartron: it'd be interesting though if they tried
(20:00:36) Z80: It would be interesting...
(20:00:38) Z80: Yeah.
(20:00:39) PFawkes: I'm just saying
(20:00:41) Ina_ [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(20:00:51) PFawkes: it's less ridiculous than, say, Georgia
(20:00:54) lansing: RinkuHero, is oil really necessary anymore?
(20:00:55) PFawkes: which has a higher approval
(20:00:58) RinkuHero: yes
(20:01:02) RinkuHero: for gasoline and plastics
(20:01:03) fartron: yes it is
(20:01:05) PFawkes: yeah
(20:01:08) fartron: for any element of modern society
(20:01:10) PFawkes: it IS profitable here too
(20:01:13) lansing: RinkuHero, ban all non-essential vehicles
(20:01:15) PFawkes: there are still a lot of derricks

(20:02:02) BMcC: That Braid post is waiting for you
(20:02:05) Jrafk: I've seen him like 2
(20:02:08) RinkuHero: what braid post

(20:02:35) Jrafk: Hey you
(20:02:36) PFawkes: making games?
(20:02:37) PFawkes: >.>
(20:02:37) BMcC: http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/05/20/braid-released-for-mac
(20:02:38) Jrafk: Hello
(20:02:38) aB23: hey
(20:02:42) aB23: http://anybutton.blogspot.com/
(20:02:43) InaVegt left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:02:47) aB23: check out the first article
(20:02:50) aB23: its about no quarter
(20:02:53) aB23: http://anybutton.blogspot.com/
(20:03:00) BMcC: Maybe I shouldn't link you to this, cuz you might shoot me down :P
(20:03:00) RinkuHero: why is that post waiting for me
(20:03:11) BMcC: Cuz!  Game design discussion
(20:03:15) RinkuHero: i don't have a mac though
(20:03:18) BMcC: and I'm alone
(20:03:30) RinkuHero: 39 posts to read through D:
(20:03:31) BMcC: Oh, it's the TIGS front page, don't worry -- the comments aren't about the Mac release :P
(20:03:37) RinkuHero: ha
(20:03:37) PFawkes: I don't believe in design, it's like the sasquatch
(20:03:41) RinkuHero: okay, will read
(20:03:43) PFawkes: Mythical!
(20:03:44) BMcC: Heh
(20:03:44) lansing: aB23, nice summary
(20:03:56) BMcC: You don't believe in SASQUATCH?
(20:03:58) aB23: http://anybutton.blogspot.com/2009/05/23-preview-no-quarter.html
(20:04:00) aB23: yea
(20:04:04) aB23: pics up tomorrow
(20:04:05) RinkuHero: malasdair is from the ohrrpgce community
(20:04:08) RinkuHero: he's comment #3
(20:04:19) RinkuHero: he's one of the first people i met in the ohr community, back in '99
(20:04:20) BMcC: Ah, cool
(20:04:33) BMcC: I'm actually surprised how there hasn't been any real trolling
(20:04:57) BMcC: but this one guy... argh... he's all "THIS IS NOT GOOD, YOU ARE WRONG IF YOU THINK IT'S GOOD"
(20:04:58) aB23: btw, ty lansing
(20:05:02) PFawkes: until... now!
(20:05:10) BMcC: anyway
(20:05:11) BMcC: it's whatever
(20:05:17) PFawkes: I think I'll post a troll, maybe
(20:05:23) PFawkes: It'll be my first time
(20:05:27) PFawkes: (ever)
(20:05:35) BMcC: Also!  Exclusive No Quater preview?  Sweet
(20:05:43) aB23: mmhm
(20:05:44) BMcC: ALSO: Why can't I ever spell quarter?
(20:05:45) aB23: http://anybutton.blogspot.com/2009/05/23-preview-no-quarter.html
(20:05:55) aB23: cause u fail
(20:06:02) PFawkes: that's "yuu"
(20:06:08) aB23: yuu
(20:06:20) BMcC: Hrm
(20:06:50) Jrafk: <BMcC> The difference is that they do so through the mechanics of a painting (instead of tacking on a piece of writing), while we haven’t quite figured out how to do that with the mechanics of games yet.
(20:06:52) Jrafk: good point
(20:07:00) BMcC: Aw, thanks
(20:07:05) BMcC: I -hate- arguing
(20:07:11) BMcC: and as a result I'm not good at it
(20:07:17) Jrafk: I thought that was rather lucid
(20:07:43) RinkuHero: so the discussion seems to be about
(20:07:44) BMcC: and people that -are- good at it (not saying this guy is, ha) often think being able to argue a point == right and wrong
(20:07:50) RinkuHero: whether the books in braid add to the game or not
(20:07:55) PFawkes: I don't agree
(20:08:15) Jrafk: Books in the game
(20:08:16) Jrafk: so what
(20:08:17) BMcC: I guess, it got weirder than that, though
(20:08:18) Jrafk: they're there
(20:08:27) Jrafk: they're interesting
(20:08:31) Jrafk: they don't add or remove
(20:08:32) PFawkes: I think we CAN do this in games
(20:08:33) RinkuHero: they're skippable, so i don't see why people would complain abou tthem
(20:08:39) PFawkes: I don't think Johnathan blow knows how, though
(20:08:47) RinkuHero: it's like the story in immortal defense, people can skip it and just play the game if they want
(20:08:48) Jrafk: nope
(20:08:49) PFawkes: so instead he does these inane books
(20:08:50) BMcC: Like, he was like, "They add NOTHING" and I was like "Okay." then it turned into it being bad design, and pretentious, and all that
(20:09:04) Jrafk: but he's getting there, pfocks
(20:09:06) PFawkes: I think they detract from the game
(20:09:14) Jrafk: in the points illustrated by brandon
(20:09:15) PFawkes: to be perfectly honest
(20:09:15) Jrafk: also
(20:09:22) Jrafk: let's not bring this discussion in here
(20:09:22) BMcC: Don't post, PFawkes, hahaha
(20:09:27) Jrafk: I don't think that's a wise idea
(20:09:28) PFawkes: why not?
(20:09:32) Jrafk: uh
(20:09:34) Jrafk: hm
(20:09:36) Jrafk: just a sec
(20:09:46) ***BMcC watches Jrafk run into the distance
(20:09:56) Jrafk: I can only see it creating tension and conflict
(20:10:05) RinkuHero: i think some people don't like stories/reading
(20:10:07) PFawkes: I mean, it's better than the games vs art discussion that the IRC descends into every week
(20:10:07) RinkuHero: which is fine
(20:10:14) PFawkes: RinkuHero, it's not that
(20:10:17) RinkuHero: but they then extend that into saying that game sshouldn't have stories
(20:10:17) Jrafk: pfocks, huh?
(20:10:21) Jrafk: I don't see those
(20:10:23) Jrafk: also yes
(20:10:23) BMcC: It -is- that discussion, PF
(20:10:26) Jrafk: it is better
(20:10:26) BMcC: That's where it will end!
(20:10:28) PFawkes: it's that it doesn't fit with the game
(20:10:30) PFawkes: you see
(20:10:31) Jrafk: also I must write
(20:10:31) BMcC: Don't pull the trigggger
(20:10:46) PFawkes: there's all this symbology, and then he just spurts pages of text instead
(20:10:54) qubodup left the room (quit: Quit: "good night boys and girls").
(20:11:01) BMcC: Anyway, my point was more about Jon pushing forward, trying no thinks, making any amount of progress in the area
(20:11:05) fartron: PENIS
(20:11:13) BMcC: "NO THINKS" whoa FREUDIAN
(20:11:16) BMcC: NEW
(20:11:17) BMcC: THINGS
(20:11:18) BMcC: Wow
(20:11:22) PFawkes: like if, instead of painting Guernica
(20:11:26) PFawkes: and putting the message in IT
(20:11:35) BMcC: Anyway! I think he's done all these things, and I haven't claimed he's done anything more
(20:11:36) lansing: the story at the end of Doom 1 was kind of out of place
(20:11:38) PFawkes: he painted something and wrote fifteen pages to go with it
(20:11:38) fartron: freudian slips are when you say one thing but you mean you'r egay
(20:11:39) PFawkes: you see
(20:11:49) BMcC: I think it will only get better, even just within his games
(20:11:49) JohannesG [Adium@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(20:11:52) PFawkes: it wouldn't fite
(20:11:59) iFire`: fartron or your is engraved on your enemy's computer case
(20:12:00) BMcC: Haha, Fartron
(20:12:03) iFire`: crap
(20:12:09) iFire`: fartron or your mom is engraved on your enemy's computer case
(20:12:16) ***iFire` fails
(20:12:18) RinkuHero: i agree that the story was too abstract for my tastes
(20:12:19) PFawkes: you have conflicting systems of storytelling, which are inherently disparate
(20:12:24) PFawkes: do you see what I mean?
(20:12:28) RinkuHero: but i don't think there's anything wrong with it having books with abstract stuff in it
(20:12:31) RinkuHero: people can skip it
(20:12:43) PFawkes: but that's the point, if you skip it you feel you've missed the story
(20:12:49) RinkuHero: but it isn't really the story
(20:12:51) PFawkes: but if you don't, you have to just sit there reading
(20:13:05) RinkuHero: you can't really piece together a story from those books
(20:13:05) PFawkes: it's like a JRPG
(20:13:12) RinkuHero: yes
(20:13:14) RinkuHero: and i like jrpgs
(20:13:27) PFawkes: no...
(20:13:31) PFawkes: it's like a Hideo Kojima game
(20:13:32) BMcC: Have you played Mothe 3 yet, Rinku?
(20:13:35) RinkuHero: yes
(20:13:35) BMcC: Mother*
(20:13:40) BMcC: What did you think?
(20:13:44) PFawkes: where he's realized that if you let them skip cutscenes, you can make them even longer
(20:13:48) RinkuHero: didn't like it as much as the snes one, but it was fun
(20:13:51) RinkuHero: i got to the end
(20:13:57) BMcC: I played it with my wife, and we really let ourselves get into it
(20:14:08) BMcC: Lemme PM you, haha, don't want to spoil something
(20:14:13) RinkuHero: kk
(20:14:20) RinkuHero: and i like the story in metal gear games
(20:14:29) RinkuHero: i am looking forward to playing mgs4 for the story
(20:14:31) RinkuHero: not for the gameplay
(20:14:56) JohannesG left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:15:17) PFawkes: Well, alright then
(20:15:19) Jrafk: but that's the point, if you skip it you feel you've missed the story
(20:15:21) Jrafk: uh
(20:15:24) PFawkes: I'm just saying that story should be part of the gameplay
(20:15:29) PFawkes: rather than separate
(20:15:31) Jrafk: if you skip it I think you're dismissing the story
(20:15:34) RinkuHero: i disagree
(20:15:37) PFawkes: if you don't mind that, then you don't mind that
(20:15:42) Jrafk: and don't want to hear/read/whatever that
(20:15:52) BMcC: Jon's trying to do that with Braid, and I think he made some progress in that
(20:15:56) RinkuHero: you can't always make the story part of the gameplay
(20:15:59) Jrafk: yeah
(20:16:01) BMcC: Of course, it's less "story" and more "expression"
(20:16:07) Jrafk: I think Riven does a good job of it
(20:16:13) BMcC: Like, he's exploring certain philosophies and ideas through the system of the game
(20:16:16) Jrafk: of the story/game integration
(20:16:21) PFawkes: Jrafk, I skipped it, because I didn't want to spend so much time on reading when the gameplay was entertaining
(20:16:22) BMcC: and books are more, like, arrows pointing at it
(20:16:24) PFawkes: do you see
(20:16:27) Jrafk: no
(20:16:32) Jrafk: Sorry
(20:16:39) Jrafk: wait, maybe
(20:16:43) Jrafk: hm
(20:16:51) Jrafk: yeah, I guess
(20:17:08) Jrafk: you want it to be more, uh, in-line
(20:17:14) Jrafk: so you get everything all at once
(20:17:18) PFawkes: didn't he always used to say that "if something detracts from the game, you don't bend the gameplay, you remove the thing itself"
(20:17:18) Jrafk: or rather
(20:17:21) Jrafk: in one package
(20:17:26) PFawkes: I remember things like that
(20:17:29) Jrafk: yes
(20:17:31) LordMetroid left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(20:17:36) Jrafk: er, actually
(20:17:37) Jrafk: that was a lie
(20:17:43) Jrafk: I have no idea if he said that or not
(20:17:44) PFawkes: Yes, yes it was.
(20:18:04) Jrafk: example: Riven
(20:18:10) Jrafk: that has tons of reading
(20:18:13) Jrafk: tons and tons and tons
(20:18:15) PFawkes: Yes
(20:18:16) RinkuHero: i never played riven
(20:18:17) Jrafk: but
(20:18:19) RinkuHero: was that a sequel to heretic?
(20:18:23) Jrafk: no
(20:18:24) PFawkes: No...
(20:18:27) PFawkes: it was the sequel to Myst
(20:18:30) RinkuHero: oh
(20:18:38) PFawkes: but see, see my point there
(20:18:41) Jrafk: but it also has a crazy amount of story just in the enviroment
(20:18:44) PFawkes: Riven was very... integrated
(20:18:50) Jrafk: well
(20:18:50) PFawkes: you know?
(20:18:53) PFawkes: everything FIT
(20:18:54) Jrafk: it goes for both sides
(20:19:01) PFawkes: whereas in Braid it is NOT integrated
(20:19:04) PFawkes: quite the opposite
(20:19:06) Jrafk: looking at it purely from a story view
(20:19:13) Jrafk: it had huge books to read
(20:19:13) Jrafk: like
(20:19:15) Jrafk: actual books
(20:19:17) Jrafk: BUT
(20:19:18) PFawkes: Yes
(20:19:19) PFawkes: it did
(20:19:29) Jrafk: it also had envronmental storytelling
(20:19:29) PFawkes: but they made sense to be there, for one thing
(20:19:40) RinkuHero: i didn't even really treat the books as story per se
(20:19:40) Jrafk: but they take forever
(20:19:43) PFawkes: i.e. bookshelves
(20:19:43) RinkuHero: they were more like poetry
(20:20:00) Jrafk: The key thing I'm trying to get at
(20:20:03) PFawkes: also, riven being a slowpaced puzzle explory thing it made more sense to have books
(20:20:05) PFawkes: with reading
(20:20:09) Jrafk: is this
(20:20:10) Jrafk: it also had envronmental storytelling
(20:20:15) Jrafk: envronmental storytelling
(20:20:20) RinkuHero: yes
(20:20:23) RinkuHero: but it was an adventure game
(20:20:26) RinkuHero: and braid is a platformer
(20:20:27) Jrafk: yeah
(20:20:31) Jrafk: but that doesn't stop it
(20:20:33) PFawkes: rather than "hey, stop platforming and puzzling to read these inexplicable abstractions for a while"
(20:20:34) Jrafk: I mean
(20:20:34) RinkuHero: it's harder to do environmental storytelling in a platformer
(20:20:37) Jrafk: take a look at like
(20:20:40) PFawkes: yes
(20:20:46) JohannesG [Adium@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(20:20:47) PFawkes: so?
(20:20:52) Jrafk: Rinku, perhaps
(20:20:57) Jrafk: but not too much more
(20:21:01) Jrafk: braid did do it
(20:21:04) Jrafk: somewhat
(20:21:08) Jrafk: but in a different manner
(20:21:10) Jrafk: I'm talking, like
(20:21:12) PFawkes: if you can't pull it off, then that is not an excuse to do a cop out
(20:21:24) Jrafk: architecture
(20:21:24) RinkuHero: i think it is
(20:21:27) RinkuHero: especially for an indie game
(20:21:33) RinkuHero: indie games are built around taking shortcuts
(20:21:35) PFawkes: Like, say, take Passage
(20:21:36) RinkuHero: and getting more done with less
(20:21:44) PFawkes: the maker did an article ON WHAT IT MEANT
(20:21:47) BMcC|away [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(20:21:59) Jrafk: what about metroid prime?
(20:21:59) BRBobo [Blademaste@pool-173-55-168-96.lsanca.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(20:22:02) #tigirc: mode (+o BRBobo) by ChanServ
(20:22:04) Jrafk: that's a good example
(20:22:04) RinkuHero: never played that
(20:22:05) Jrafk: of something
(20:22:09) BRBobo is now known as BlademasterBobo
(20:22:17) BlademasterBobo: My 8 year old brother got an ipod touch
(20:22:18) BlademasterBobo: :L
(20:22:20) BMcC|away: <BMcC> The problem here is not having the language to talk about this area yet
(20:22:25) Jrafk: BOBO PLZ
(20:22:34) BMcC|away: Cuz I'm -not- talking about integrating a narrative, I'm talking about games expressing things, exploring ideas, with the mechanics unique to games
(20:22:35) Jrafk: we are having an Important Discussion
(20:22:35) paul|2: BlademasterBobo: colon letter indeed
(20:22:38) Jrafk: while I procrastinate
(20:22:48) BMcC left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:22:48) BlademasterBobo: I could kick you
(20:22:51) BlademasterBobo: so you could do your paper
(20:22:54) Jrafk: me?
(20:22:57) BlademasterBobo: !~
(20:23:04) PFawkes: I have an iPod, though
(20:23:07) PFawkes: but I have a good reason
(20:23:09) Jrafk: I'm actually doing well right now
(20:23:16) BlademasterBobo: you're on irc
(20:23:19) BlademasterBobo: so I think you're lying
(20:23:20) Jrafk: crap
(20:23:21) Jrafk: you
(20:23:23) Jrafk: are right
(20:23:23) PFawkes: iPods have huge storage, you see
(20:23:31) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(20:23:34) Jrafk:  Cuz I'm -not- talking about integrating a narrative, I'm talking about games expressing things, exploring ideas, with the mechanics unique to games
(20:23:35) PFawkes: I would never get an iTouch, that's just pointless
(20:23:36) Jrafk: that is true
(20:23:37) BlademasterBobo: Hi Brandon_2
(20:23:49) Jrafk: itouch is great
(20:23:49) BMcC: oh my sweet internet connection
(20:23:51) Jrafk: real good
(20:24:14) Jrafk: Anyway, bobo is right
(20:24:15) PFawkes: jrafk, I agree with that statement
(20:24:19) Jrafk: ilu, bobo
(20:24:19) PFawkes: that's what I am trying to SAY
(20:24:24) Jrafk: you're the best
(20:24:29) BMcC: THEN WE ALL AGREE :\
(20:24:31) BMcC: hahaha
(20:24:34) Jrafk: that's what brandon said, pfox
(20:24:35) Jrafk: heh
(20:24:37) PFawkes: hooray
(20:24:41) BMcC: PARTY TIME
(20:24:46) BMcC: I mean, yeah, that's a good example, though
(20:24:50) ***BlademasterBobo blows a party favor
(20:24:50) ***PFawkes segways to games v art discussion
(20:24:56) BMcC: this is a difficult area to discuss!
(20:25:01) Jrafk: examples of something
(20:25:03) PFawkes: segues*
(20:25:07) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: What area?
(20:25:08) Jrafk: [I don't know what]
(20:25:12) Jrafk: Metroid Prime
(20:25:13) BMcC: seques, yes, best spelling EVER
(20:25:16) Jrafk: Riven
(20:25:21) PFawkes: I loves me some segues
(20:25:22) Jrafk: uh
(20:25:26) BMcC: Like... expression through game mechanics
(20:25:27) BlademasterBobo: What the fuck you chaps talking about
(20:25:28) PFawkes: or do I mean seagulls
(20:25:31) BlademasterBobo: Oh
(20:25:31) Jrafk: bobo
(20:25:32) BMcC: whatever the heck
(20:25:33) PFawkes: they're so similar
(20:25:33) lansing: hey guys, i found the best website on the internet
(20:25:34) BMcC: ART GAMES, aah
(20:25:36) lansing: http://xkcdsucks.blogspot.com/
(20:25:38) BlademasterBobo: I had an idea about that
(20:25:38) BMcC|away left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:25:43) BMcC: Yes?

(20:25:55) BlademasterBobo: The idea is something along the lines of your character breaks his knees pretty easily

(20:26:01) PFawkes: My thoughts can be summed up easily
(20:26:01) BlademasterBobo: etc
(20:26:19) BlademasterBobo: So the controls would actually add to a certain atmosphere/paranoia
(20:26:20) PFawkes: if your story is so complex that it can't be told in a way that makes sense
(20:26:26) PFawkes: then you need to trim back
(20:26:29) PFawkes: so it WILL fit
(20:26:30) BlademasterBobo: because you'd be trying to not snap the poor dudes legs

(20:27:26) Kobel: Okay good. It seemed parodic, but I'm so often disappointed by things that seem parodic

(20:32:45) PFawkes: What do you think of piracy?
(20:32:54) RinkuHero: what specifically about it
(20:33:02) paul|not: bit vague
(20:33:14) RinkuHero: that's like saying 'what do you think of computers'
(20:33:32) PFawkes: I mean
(20:33:43) PFawkes: Is it really as sinister as fearmongers make out
(20:33:58) RinkuHero: what does sinister mean
(20:34:02) lansing: piracy: discuss

(20:34:49) fartron: i am trying to score some danks
(20:34:51) RinkuHero: bobo, you could join a sc irc channel

(20:35:00) BlademasterBobo: and then be whipped

(20:35:46) PFawkes: I assume they must at least SOME but...
(20:36:08) RinkuHero: i'd imagine so, but that's the cost of releasing something on an open platform
(20:36:09) RinkuHero: like the pc

(20:36:28) paul|not: my god

(20:36:39) paul|not: needs more updates derek
(20:36:39) PFawkes: you know?
(20:36:39) BlademasterBobo: does it matter whether or not piracy hurts sales?
(20:36:52) BlademasterBobo: like, if you can't even fix it regardless
(20:36:53) fartron: piracy is free advertising
(20:36:57) BlademasterBobo: it doesn't matter
(20:36:57) RinkuHero: i think piracy's main effect is to casualize games
(20:37:06) PFawkes: I just hate how people lie
(20:37:09) RinkuHero: since game developers are gradually making games for people who don't pirate
(20:37:12) RinkuHero: like old women
(20:37:12) PFawkes: to enforce draconian laws
(20:37:18) PFawkes: which don't stop pirates

(20:38:33) RinkuHero: what thing
(20:38:40) PFawkes: it's kind of old, but
(20:38:49) BlademasterBobo: The gamasutra thing?

(20:41:38) RinkuHero: i don't think such analysis are possible
(20:41:40) PFawkes: it's like 3 pages long I think
(20:41:46) PFawkes: what do you mean?
(20:41:58) RinkuHero: they rely on an extended line of deductive reasoning
(20:42:01) RinkuHero: and i distrust deduction
(20:42:03) PFawkes: well, sometimes
(20:42:14) PFawkes: other times they track down the things people refer to
(20:42:21) PFawkes: which contradict (!) their claims
(20:42:28) PFawkes: that's not deductive
(20:42:47) RinkuHero: deduction is necessarily irrational
(20:42:49) RinkuHero: so i'd say it is
(20:43:02) PFawkes: What?
(20:43:15) PFawkes: How is trying to see if the claims are proven irrational?
(20:43:18) RinkuHero: but that's going into epistemology, would take forever to explain
(20:43:28) RinkuHero: no, i mean any extended line of reason is necessarily irrational

(20:45:20) RinkuHero: actually

(20:45:45) fartron: that's how deduction works
(20:45:49) RinkuHero: but it wasn't an extended line of reasoning
(20:45:52) PFawkes: Well, the people writing the PR statement actually cite Interpol
(20:45:53) RinkuHero: was a short line

(20:47:20) Jr: that makes sense
(20:47:27) Siiseli: etc
(20:47:30) PFawkes: I think the main point is that groups are perfectly willing to lie and obbfuscate to enact laws like the DMCA
(20:47:34) Jr: "...watching the sunrise"
(20:47:44) RinkuHero: yes
(20:47:44) Jr: DMCA sucks donkey wang
(20:47:47) RinkuHero: that's obvious
(20:47:49) PFawkes: which surely sheds a poor light on their plight
(20:47:50) Jr: in all sorts of creative ways
(20:47:52) RinkuHero: but everyone lies and obfuscates
(20:47:56) RinkuHero: nothing special about them
(20:47:59) Jr: Siiseli: SNEAK OUT
(20:48:03) PFawkes: and that this is PROVABLE, rather than just being "obvious"
(20:48:11) Cow: is DMCA anything like the YMCA?
(20:48:19) Siiseli: Jr, with our door.. no
(20:48:22) RinkuHero: many lies are easily found out
(20:48:23) Siiseli: it makes one fuck of a racket
(20:48:24) PFawkes: only if the YMCA took away peoples rights
(20:48:28) PFawkes: and arrested old ladies
(20:48:32) PFawkes: if it is, then yes :D
(20:48:36) Cow: for what
(20:48:41) Siiseli: it's the kind you have to kick to get closed
(20:48:41) Cow: this sounds kind of biased
(20:48:46) PFawkes: ?
(20:48:49) Jr: Pfft
(20:48:54) Jr: doors are for tools
(20:49:01) PFawkes: the DMCA makes breaking copyright protection in any way illegal
(20:49:09) Cow: okay
(20:49:13) PFawkes: it's easy to break without even really knowing
(20:49:30) fartron: Siiseli, THE WINDOW
(20:49:30) PFawkes: like, say, CSS on dvds
(20:49:32) fartron: GO OUT IT
(20:49:32) PFawkes: that counts
(20:49:39) fartron: haven't you ever seen a movie
(20:49:45) Cow: I think copywrites and patents are slowing down mankind
(20:49:47) Siiseli: fartron, I'm not on the first floor and the window is too small
(20:49:47) Cow: also capitalism
(20:49:55) PFawkes: well, yeah
(20:50:00) RinkuHero: copyright law is unrelated to piracy though
(20:50:03) PFawkes: the odd thing about DMCA
(20:50:06) RinkuHero: law doesn't affect behavior that much
(20:50:12) BMcC: DCMC is the band in Mother 3
(20:50:14) Cow: perhaps if we were to go into overdrift and enter the d-dimension...
(20:50:16) PFawkes: is that it really doesn't make sense even with the copyright laws
(20:50:18) PFawkes: in America
(20:50:24) PFawkes: it contradicts fair use
(20:50:58) RinkuHero: i haven't read the law though, it's not that important to me
(20:51:04) BMcC: I need to lay off TIGS for a bit and get some of this EXTRA TEDIOUS work done
(20:51:09) fartron: plenty of shit we do contradicts other shit
(20:51:11) fartron: like torturing people

(20:51:48) Cow: Higgins, who is this
(20:51:54) PFawkes: this might, and I think actually is going to with this whole RealNetworks thing
(20:51:59) Fraeon: UrineFawkes, up for some jarate? :(

(20:52:02) fartron: downhill battle and al
(20:52:05) RinkuHero: what realnetworks thing
(20:52:05) fartron: all
(20:52:11) PFawkes: actually, have you seen the thing RealNetworks is being sued for? :D
(20:52:18) PFawkes: they want to sell a DVD Player with a Hard Drie
(20:52:20) PFawkes: Drive*
(20:52:32) Higgins: Kenji Eno is an interesting game developer with alotta history
(20:52:39) RinkuHero: if they're the people who make that 'real' player
(20:52:46) RinkuHero: then they annoy me, since that video player is terrible
(20:53:07) PFawkes: actually, RealPlayer for linux is pretty useful
(20:53:11) RinkuHero: hm
(20:53:16) PFawkes: it's an easy way to get free proprietary codecs
(20:53:29) PFawkes: also it's based on helix so it's only sort of made by them
(20:53:56) lansing: I don't think I've ever needed a realpalyer codec
(20:53:57) PFawkes: basically, they pay to license all these codecs, some of which even mplayer can't handle, and stick the label on helix player

(20:56:43) PFawkes: I like how the studios and mpaa are suing realnetworks while they at the same time sue the studios and mpaa
(20:56:43) Higgins: there's a windows media "pro"?
(20:56:55) PFawkes: well, it's a newer audio codec for videos

(22:13:21) El_Shamro: should be cheaper than the game
(22:13:23) BlademasterBobo: you'd go on ebay, check it out
(22:13:34) BlademasterBobo: or get the megapack things from the store, which aren't too bad
(22:13:42) BlademasterBobo: or get the megapack thing on ebay

(23:51:34) Dragonene: BackInAction: definitely.  But it'd likely require some programming
(23:51:44) Dragonene: and I writing an AI would be tricky.
(23:52:01) Dragonene: PFawkes: oooh, that one
(23:52:05) Dragonene: I've only heard a song or two
(23:52:12) Dragonene: I'd like to listen to it but I don't have it.
(23:52:42) KareemK: its not very good
(23:52:43) BackInAction: Dragonene, it's a start.  Now imagine a player character who can move around the board in any direction, whilst facing any direction
(23:52:47) KareemK: except harrowdown hill
(23:53:06) Z80_: But including harrowup hill.
(23:53:09) PFawkes: I like some of the other songs
(23:53:15) PFawkes: It's all a matter of taste though
(23:53:16) BackInAction: Enemy unit behavior would be limited to simply moving towards the player, nothing more.  No pathfinding, nothing fancy like that
(23:53:52) Z80_: This sounds vaguely similar to Chessmine.
(23:53:57) Z80_: But different enough.
(23:54:02) Z80_: So go on.
(23:54:04) PFawkes: Harrowdown Hill is pretty dark, even by normal album standards
(23:54:19) lansing: I wonder what non-turn based chess would be like and on an infinite board, with base building.
(23:54:21) BackInAction: Of course, I WOULD ultimately have pathfinding and more strategic behavior, but for simplicity's sake, all I want to present is player movement and basic enemy movement.
(23:54:28) fartron: the update?
(23:54:30) fartron: it's out?
(23:54:34) Z80_: Yes.
(23:54:36) lansing: fartron, a few hours ago
(23:54:40) fartron: so i have it?
(23:54:40) Z80_: Has bee-
(23:54:52) fartron: sweet
(23:54:53) lansing: if steam checked for updates and downloaded it, you do
(23:54:54) Z80_: As long as you've had Steam up, yes.
(23:55:01) fartron: i also just saw the largest nugget of weed i have ever seen
(23:55:03) Z80_: LANSING, YOU DIRTY BASTARD/
(23:55:07) Dragonene: BackInAction: Yeah, well... I haven't actually *used* any game creation tools, I do the programming myself. But given what I've seen come out of GM and Construct and the like, it sounds like it should be more than possible.
(23:55:08) BackInAction: One of the game artists where I work recommended usign RPG Maker XP - apparently there's a mod to create games ala FFTactics
(23:55:09) fartron: so this has been a good night
(23:55:26) BackInAction: But RPG Maker makes me

(00:01:18) BackInAction: hmmmm
(00:01:23) BackInAction: Reading "http://www.rpgrevolution.com/tutorials/ruby-game-scripting-system.html"
(00:01:38) lansing: fartron, yeah, I stopped when the comments started to get to me by about 2002
(00:01:56) BackInAction: Y'know, if this was top-down and grid-based, rather than isometric...
(00:02:08) BackInAction: (isometric also being grid-based, obviously)
(00:02:35) PFawkes: See, RPG Maker has gotten a lot better
(00:03:04) PFawkes: it's just still got that whole rpgmaker95 final fantasy ripoff game thing floating around it
(00:03:32) BackInAction: My game concept involves projectiles, but no hit points or anything of that sort
(00:03:38) BackInAction: Player moves, enemies move.
(00:03:51) PFawkes: like chessroguelike?
(00:03:59) BackInAction: Link?
(00:04:08) PFawkes: well, it doesn't have projectiles

(01:44:35) Jr is now known as Jrafk
(01:44:39) Jrafk: It is impossible to avoid conflict: it is human nature to be selfish, and personal selfishness is contrary to the nature of a society. The very idea of self-preservation, the idea that one's own life is more important than anything else is the most basic of philosophic musings. Selflessness is an artifact of the society we live in.
(01:44:50) Jrafk: that basically sums up my paper

(01:45:12) Dragonene: ok.
(01:45:19) SlayerXL: just so you know.

(01:46:38) Jrafk: it is my final for both lit and history
(01:46:46) Jrafk: 20% of my final grade
(01:46:54) Jrafk: for both classes
(01:47:06) Dragonene: 20% doesn't sound very much
(01:47:15) Dragonene: But yeah, I'd still do it of course.
(01:47:32) Dragonene: I'm working on a peer review thingy now, 5% of the marks in this class
(01:47:42) Jrafk: 20% is quite a bit
(01:47:46) Dragonene: 5% is *nothing*, but I think they expect you to do each task if you want to pass
(01:47:59) Jrafk: it's about as much as all the tests combined all year long
(01:48:08) Dragonene: Stargoat: australia has the weirdest grading system.
(01:48:18) Dragonene: Jrafk: hm
(01:48:26) Dragonene: I guess I'm used to some other grading system.

(01:50:07) Dragonene: is that a place?
(01:50:15) nyarla: TAFE is all like.. not complete, not competent, competent, highly competent
(01:50:41) Dragonene: my uni in sweden recently switched grading systems
(01:51:09) Dragonene: we used to have fail, 3, 4, 5 (3 is pass, 4 is good, 5 is excellent)
(01:51:18) Dragonene: which is a bit strange too, I guess.
(01:51:32) Dragonene: oh, and also "komplettering", which means you fail but can do some extra work to pass.
(01:51:49) Dragonene: now we have F, Fx, E, D, C, B, A
(01:52:11) Dragonene: F = fail, Fx = fail, "komplettering" allowed, E-A = passing grades, A is the highest
(01:52:12) The_Doctor: fx
(01:52:28) Stargoat: that sounds like conceded pass at my uni. You may only take one conceded pass for the whole course.
(01:52:35) Dragonene: huh, okay
(01:52:44) Dragonene: well, they don't automatically pass you
(01:52:45) The_Doctor: I thought it would be varying degrees of fail
(01:52:48) nyarla: when i was at uni in Darwin it was so slack.. if you didn't hand in your assignments you could just do them after the course finished and go in and give them to the teacher next year
(01:53:14) Stargoat: that sounds awesome, nyarla
(01:53:18) Stargoat: I want that system
(01:53:28) Dragonene: basically Fx means "You are one or two marks on the exam from passing, but go take an oral test and you might pass."
(01:53:35) Dragonene: (oral test? don't know what the term is there)
(01:53:48) nyarla: admittedly that was for a music course run by a total slacker :D
(01:53:49) Stargoat: give the convenor a blow job and you pass
(01:53:51) Dragonene: nyarla: That's pretty common in sweden
(01:53:55) Dragonene: but depends on the class.
(01:53:58) nyarla: i suspect it may have been a bit more strict in more serious courses
(01:54:08) Dragonene: If you fail the exam, you're allowed to re-take it as many times as you want
(01:54:13) nyarla: yeah
(01:54:15) Dragonene: and you're guaranteed that there will be at least two more chances.
(01:54:30) Dragonene: is how it works in sweden
(01:54:38) Stargoat: at swinburne, fail the exam, no more chances, you have to repeat the subject
(01:54:41) Stargoat: it's ridiculous
(01:54:53) Stargoat: :(
(01:54:53) nyarla: and now i must go and "fix" someone's computer because they got a virus. :S bbl
(01:54:56) Dragonene: that is, after they no longer give a certain class, they still have to give exams for it.
(01:54:59) Dragonene: bye nyarla
(01:55:01) nyarla: stargoat: that is a bit ridiculous really
(01:55:13) Dragonene: Stargoat: Well
(01:55:18) nyarla: especially if you just got a couple things wrong or something, but pretty much knew your stuff
(01:55:20) Dragonene: What does "repeat the subject mean"?
(01:55:25) nyarla left the room (quit: Quit: glurk).
(01:55:29) Dragonene: Do you have to attend lectures and redo all the assignments?
(01:55:32) Stargoat: yep
(01:55:35) Dragonene: Ouch
(01:55:58) Dragonene: In sweden, you can often gather "bonus points" for the exams by doing optional assignments throughout the year
(01:56:10) Stargoat: if you get over 70% on the practical work requirements, you can skip them, however
(01:56:24) Stargoat: sweden's system sounds a lot more relaxing
(01:56:26) Stargoat: can I move there?
(01:56:32) Dragonene: and those points are only valid for that year's exam and the second exam that's always given a few weeks later ("re-exam period", sorta)
(01:56:43) Dragonene: but after that, you lose the bonus points
(01:56:54) Dragonene: you usually don't have to re-do assignments though (it happens, but it's very rare)
(01:57:03) Dragonene: usually you can just take the exam again
(01:57:05) Stargoat: hmm
(01:57:48) Dragonene: what the bonus points give you varies from exam to exam
(01:57:56) Dragonene: uh
(01:58:00) Dragonene: from subject to subject*
(01:58:03) Stargoat: right
(01:58:21) Dragonene: they may say something like "You get 5 bonus points out of 60 for the exam, but they can't take you above 60"
(01:58:32) Stargoat: oh, okay
(01:58:36) Dragonene: Or "You get 5 bonus points, but they cannot help you pass the exam, only get a higher grade"
(01:58:46) Stargoat: so the bonus points are only there to push you over the threshold of pass/fail
(01:58:49) Dragonene: or "You get 5 bonus points, but they can only help you pass - you can't get a high grade with them"
(01:59:00) Dragonene: Sometimes
(01:59:02) Dragonene: Sometimes not
(01:59:17) Stargoat: hmm
(01:59:38) Stargoat: attending lectures isn't necessarily mandatory
(01:59:41) Dragonene: In other cases, they'll say something like "If you have gathered all possible bonus points throughout the semester, you automatically pass, but you still have to attend the exam (although you don't have to write anything)"
(01:59:49) Stargoat: and considering most material learnt is available on the public domain...
(02:00:02) Dragonene: yeah, I've only had one or two classes where attending lectures is mandatory in sweden
(02:00:05) Dragonene: it's rare.
(02:00:54) Dragonene: In maths subjects, for example, there are usually smaller tests throughout the year, three or so, and if you pass them you get bonus points for the final exam
(02:01:05) Dragonene: if you pass all three, you might automatically pass the exam
(02:01:15) Dragonene: if you fail them, you can still make up for it in the exam
(02:01:36) Dragonene: often, a specific test corresponds to a specific exam question
(02:01:50) Dragonene: something like "If you passed test 2, you don't have to do question 2 in the exam, you get full marks for it."
(02:02:24) Dragonene: It varies a lot from subject to subject, as you can tell, but the teachers usually make it very clear how it works in their subject.
(02:04:42) lansing: darn, missed scibotic again

(02:05:34) Dragonene: I'm going to sydney again in the end of july, not sure for how long tho

(02:08:48) lansing: to remind them of europe and such things

(02:16:00) Dragonene: Awesome idea
(02:16:14) Dragonene: you can enter your own custom ascii swords into a text field

(02:44:39) Dragonene: maybe not
(02:44:44) Dragonene: it sounds icelandic to me.
(02:44:49) Jr: dunno
(02:44:59) Dragonene: I'm just going by the swedish pronounciation of "?" here
(02:45:04) Jr: right
(02:45:14) Dragonene: which is the same as an o with a slash in it in danish and norwegian
(02:45:44) Dragonene: The thing is, it's not quite possible to give a good english pronounciation of that word as I would pronounce it
(02:45:50) BlademasterBobo: Hi Jr
(02:45:53) Dragonene: just using english words as an example
(02:46:17) Dragonene: But "Rehksopp" would be close enough, I guess

(02:50:23) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: I haven't implemented relief mapping and
(02:50:29) SnakeyAtWork: silhouette mapping yet
(02:50:31) Dragonene: Jr: do note
(02:50:36) SnakeyAtWork: When those two are also implemented its even cooler.
(02:50:37) Dragonene: Mot?rhead is pronounced "motorhead"
(02:50:45) Dragonene: because their two dots are just silly decoration
(02:51:02) Dragonene: Snakey: I'm not sure what those are
(02:51:31) Dragonene: We implemented bump mapping and a couple of different lighting models and stuff for a graphics class
(02:51:42) Dragonene: relief mapping rings a bell but I can't quite place it
(02:51:44) SnakeyAtWork: Relief mapping adds actual depth to a texture by using ray casting methods.
(02:51:48) Dragonene: silhouette mapping I don't think I've heard of
(02:52:15) SnakeyAtWork: Silhouette is a step above relief mapping and it discards fragments that aren't visible due to the height map.
(02:52:40) SnakeyAtWork: With relief mapping, you still wind up with the same polygonal shape of the mesh you're drawing.
(02:52:56) Dragonene: yeah
(02:52:57) SnakeyAtWork: With silhouette mapping, you actually alter the polygonal mesh by discarding fragments 
(02:53:02) Dragonene: oh, okay
(02:53:12) Dragonene: that sounds pretty cool
(02:53:15) SnakeyAtWork: So it a bumping surface actually looks bumpy at arbitary angles
(02:53:20) Dragonene: yeah
(02:53:26) Dragonene: that's what always bothers me about bumpmapping

(02:55:39) SnakeyAtWork: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/gpu_gems_3/samples/gems3_ch18.pdf, reading this paper now
(02:55:42) Dragonene: I used a very neat visual shader editor once
(02:55:50) Dragonene: But it's not made available to the public
(02:55:56) SnakeyAtWork: pretty neat optimization to relief mapping also developed by the same people
(02:56:02) Dragonene: We got to use it because it was developed by a researcher at my uni
(02:56:07) SnakeyAtWork: Theres quite a few free ones around
(02:56:13) SnakeyAtWork: I believe nVidia has one called fx composer
(02:56:13) Dragonene: Yeah
(02:56:20) SnakeyAtWork: brb
(02:56:23) Dragonene: yeah, that sounds familiar

(02:58:29) konjak: hut!
(02:59:35) Dragonene: hut hut hut
(02:59:42) Notch: hut hut
(02:59:58) Dragonene: They must think we're crazy
(03:00:04) Dragonene: bunch of swedes going "hut" arbitrarily
(03:00:19) konjak: vet hut
(03:00:22) Pepe [pepe@72-56-187-78.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(03:00:24) Dragonene: Let's not disappoint them!
(03:00:26) Dragonene: hut hut hut
(03:01:09) konjak: I wish I felt I had reason to update my site more, because once I do nobody notices :D

(03:03:17) BlademasterBobo: konjak
(03:03:22) BlademasterBobo: they stop looking because you never update
(03:03:27) BlademasterBobo: it's a vicious cycle
(03:03:28) konjak: I know
(03:03:30) Dragonene: that's what he meant
(03:03:35) konjak: touch me, Bobo
(03:04:01) BlademasterBobo: No homo
(03:04:04) ***BlademasterBobo touches konjak
(03:04:27) konjak: feels like velcro
(03:04:36) Dragonene: I've been pixeling lately.
(03:04:42) Dragonene: It's not going very well :D
(03:05:00) konjak: sweet :D
(03:05:13) Dragonene: bunch of ludumdarers are doing "daily sketches"
(03:05:20) Dragonene: I'm trying to join them with pixelly stuff
(03:05:27) Dragonene: But I'm rather fail at pixelation
(03:05:47) Dragonene: (not the forum, the art of pixeling)
(03:06:45) Dragonene: http://www.x2d.org/categories/daily-sketches <-- also has links to the others. I think DrPetter's stuff is pretty cool.
(03:06:51) Parthon: have you done pixelling before?
(03:07:20) Parthon: stupid question
(03:07:21) konjak: Hah, I love this Kojima teaser shit he's doing. First it didn't have a count down, then it had one for three days, now he updates again and it's for 200 hours!
(03:07:23) Parthon: that's some really good work there
(03:07:34) varmint left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:08:25) Dragonene: kojima?
(03:08:35) Dragonene: Parthon: Not really.
(03:08:46) SnakeyAtWork: konjak: Perhaps pimp stuff, or setup a RSS feed?
(03:08:49) Dragonene: A few attempts with years in between really.
(03:09:19) konjak: SNakeyAtWork, it's not that important. I get tens of thousands of downloads each month still, probably from outside sources
(03:09:27) konjak: and some of those downloads I can't track
(03:09:28) Dragonene: I hate you
(03:09:43) Dragonene: I have tens of thousands of downloads *in total*
(03:09:52) Dragonene: :'(
(03:09:57) Dragonene: No, I don't hate you.
(03:09:57) konjak: aw :(
(03:10:06) Dragonene: I had like 40k downloads this april \o/
(03:10:09) Dragonene: was a good month for me
(03:10:14) konjak: :D
(03:10:24) konjak: m... my record is 100,000 in a week
(03:10:31) konjak: Legend of Princess, of course
(03:10:32) Dragonene: sweet.
(03:10:43) konjak: brand name
(03:10:44) Dragonene: yeah, those 40k downloads were in like 3 days.
(03:10:45) Dragonene: actually.
(03:10:51) Stargoat left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:10:57) konjak: oh yeah?!
(03:11:01) konjak: My penis is bigger!
(03:11:04) Dragonene: end of the java4k contest boosts my download count every year :P
(03:11:06) SnakeyAtWork: konjak: ahh indeed. :) I don't have too much to offer right now so my site tends to be quite quiet
(03:11:09) Stargoat [Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(03:11:12) Dragonene: Notch gets the same thing, only with bigger 
(03:11:13) Dragonene: numbers
(03:11:34) Dragonene: this reminds me tho
(03:11:43) konjak: Now if I just could ever get STARTED with something
(03:11:47) BlademasterBobo: ok
(03:11:51) BlademasterBobo: I beat the underground guy
(03:11:53) Dragonene: I got an e-mail from some random french company asking for the right to distribute one of my games yesterday
(03:11:55) BlademasterBobo: nothing really happened
(03:11:58) Dragonene: I should answer.
(03:12:10) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: You should.
(03:12:16) konjak: Bobo, you're looking for your bird, really, and it flew away! Just go back.
(03:12:31) SnakeyAtWork: Even a simple answer would be nice, like "Cool"
(03:12:34) konjak: It's was pretty embarrasing to replay some of the parts yesterday
(03:12:38) SnakeyAtWork: I try to reply to every email I guess.
(03:13:15) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork: Yeah, I'll definitely answer
(03:13:23) Dragonene: I just haven't decided on what to say yet
(03:13:26) BackInAction: Hallelujah!
(03:13:27) Dragonene: I mean
(03:13:34) Dragonene: they can basically distribute it whether I like it or not
(03:13:38) Dragonene: because that's what the txt file say
(03:13:40) Dragonene: says*
(03:13:41) thewreck_Away left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:13:42) Dragonene: with the license
(03:13:43) BlademasterBobo: ahahaha
(03:13:45) BackInAction: Game Maker seems certainly capable of making my concept!
(03:13:47) BlademasterBobo: that was awesome
(03:13:52) Dragonene: BackInAction: :)
(03:13:55) BackInAction: And it seems super ridculously easy
(03:14:00) konjak: the cutscene?
(03:14:01) BackInAction: ridiculously, even
(03:14:15) BlademasterBobo: yes
(03:14:26) konjak: :D
(03:14:37) konjak: And you will never see him again!
(03:14:49) BlademasterBobo: :(
(03:14:52) konjak: ah, the wonders of abandonment
(03:15:06) BackInAction: I'm also surprsied that cactus has made just about ALL of his games with Game Maker as well
(03:15:11) BackInAction: hype hype hype
(03:15:18) gandhi_ left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(03:15:19) BackInAction: sorry, just excited
(03:15:27) konjak: His dialogue icon is supposed to indicate he has three pairs of glasses
(03:15:39) konjak: One on the head, one wearing, one around his neck
(03:16:08) konjak: I was gonna use it for fighting him and looking for his glasses to change color
(03:16:11) The_Doctor: I think I just pissed someone off.
(03:16:44) jsticker: Hello!
(03:16:59) The_Doctor: Sup
(03:17:07) squiggly_p: you just pissed me off
(03:17:11) lansing: hmm, I don't like TF2.
(03:17:38) BackInAction: Did you were you on the receiving end of jarate?
(03:18:46) lansing: I don't even know what that is, I just played 3 deaths and I give up.
(03:19:03) Dragonene: That's... too fast
(03:19:04) squiggly_p: I'm gonna be working up some graphics this weekend for a game idea I'm kicking around :D
(03:19:08) Dragonene: It's a rather neat game once you get the hang of it
(03:19:11) lansing: glad this is a free trial otherwise I would have been disappointed
(03:19:28) squiggly_p: I have a friend who's currently obsessed with TF2
(03:19:44) squiggly_p: I tried it...  prefer the older incarnations
(03:19:57) Dragonene: squiggly_p is squirting out historical facts
(03:20:08) Dragonene: Wait, no
(03:20:14) Dragonene: "I'm gonna be working up..." wasn't historical
(03:20:16) Dragonene: the rest of it was :)
(03:20:24) Dragonene: No, wait
(03:20:31) Dragonene: The friend who's currently obsessed wasn't either
(03:20:48) squiggly_p: are you sure you took your meds?
(03:20:49) Dragonene: I'm clearly malfunctioning.
(03:20:49) lansing: why does one of the tf2 classes say they are the ubermensch?
(03:21:21) lansing: it makes no sense
(03:22:10) lansing: yes, nietzsche was a medic in the franco-prussian war but the utterance is meaningless
(03:22:17) SMRobot [littleripp@CPE-60-229-1-142.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.
(03:22:21) SMRobot: hey all
(03:22:24) lansing: this annoys me, so i am deleting it
(03:22:25) Dragonene: hi
(03:22:34) KareemK: hah lansing 
(03:22:45) konjak: Wow, I have never realised that Mario 3 is supposed to be like a play
(03:22:50) KareemK: ubermensch is sorta = superman in l33t fake german
(03:22:53) Dragonene: huh
(03:22:59) Dragonene: what konjak
(03:23:05) lansing: KareemK, superman is a bad literal translation
(03:23:16) KareemK: yea
(03:23:22) konjak: The title screen has the curtain rise, the background stuff like the blocks with screws are props and the end of a level is running off the stage to prepare for the next scene
(03:23:24) KareemK: TF2 is not a philosophy thesis
(03:23:28) KareemK: its a multiplayer FPS
(03:23:29) KareemK: :P
(03:23:30) konjak: And when the game ends the curtain comes down
(03:23:42) Dragonene: konjak: Huh, I guess
(03:23:44) lansing: KareemK, I disapprove :P
(03:24:01) konjak: It's a nice theme, and makes the black end to levels make more sense
(03:24:04) SMRobot: I just DL'd the Sniper V Spy update for TF2
(03:24:05) ***lansing clicks delete
(03:24:35) BlademasterBobo: konjak
(03:24:40) BlademasterBobo: is the city the end?
(03:24:58) konjak: Speak to some people then go back to the leftmost house
(03:25:03) BlademasterBobo: oh, ok
(03:25:46) Dragonene: interesting fact
(03:26:08) Dragonene: My daily hits and daily kilobytes graphs do not at all match up for april
(03:26:23) Dragonene: the reason is that I have tens of thousands of downloads of my 4kb games in early april
(03:26:36) Dragonene: but in late april, I have perhaps a hundred downloads of my several-megabytes ludumdare entry

(03:30:59) Notch: i kind of watched it. =D
(03:31:12) pyl: i watched it all the way
(03:31:17) Dragonene: wtf
(03:31:25) Dragonene: squiggly_p: we all did
(03:31:25) Dragonene: now
(03:31:26) pyl: fourth base, baby
(03:31:26) Dragonene: wtf
(03:31:30) Dragonene: I'm reading this paper thingy
(03:31:33) squiggly_p: sorry, I'm late to the party
(03:31:41) Dragonene: and somebody's analyzing memory complexity of something
(03:31:48) SMRobot: possumgryffon?
(03:31:56) Dragonene: no, cat-dragon
(03:32:01) squiggly_p: or cat-dragon?
(03:32:04) SMRobot: possumgryffon!
(03:32:24) konjak: I am considering buying Punch-Out today, but then I've never played the old ones
(03:32:25) Dragonene: goes "well yeah, the complexity is O(e^2*n), but since e^2 has an upper bound of 64kb we can treat it as a constant and the complexity becomes O(n)"
(03:32:36) Dragonene: wtf!
(03:32:46) Dragonene: did he just dismiss a 64kb memory multiplier just like that
(03:32:49) Dragonene: "nah, means nothing"
(03:33:07) Dragonene: 6mb ~= 6m * 64kb, no worries
(03:33:26) konjak: that jerk!
(03:33:35) Dragonene: :'(
(03:33:41) Dragonene: You're clearly not interested.
(03:33:42) varmint [varmint@S0106001195539758.vs.shawcable.net] entered the room.
(03:33:50) Dragonene: This means you will make a new game.
(03:33:53) Dragonene: OR ELSE
(03:34:04) SnakeyAtWork: Hmm I just thought of a random game, opinions please:
(03:34:13) SnakeyAtWork: Tower defense + Tower building
(03:34:15) squiggly_p: I like it
(03:34:19) Dragonene: I don't like it
(03:34:23) Ciahnensy: Fruit + Collectible
(03:34:38) squiggly_p: so you build the towers and then defend them?
(03:34:45) Orestes [Mibbit@IGLD-84-228-177-49.inter.net.il] entered the room.
(03:34:46) nyarla: Ciahnensy knows what's great.
(03:34:48) Dragonene: I... don't see the difference to a normal TD
(03:34:53) SnakeyAtWork: Something (Hamsters) with guns are trying reach the top of somewhere
(03:34:58) SnakeyAtWork: so you stack them on top
(03:35:09) SnakeyAtWork: and projectiles are coming at them from the sides
(03:35:28) squiggly_p: wait wait.  Stack them on top of what?
(03:35:32) Dragonene: lemmings are more likely to come in large multitudes
(03:35:35) SnakeyAtWork: on top of each other.
(03:35:38) Dragonene: throw away those hamsters
(03:35:39) squiggly_p: ok
(03:35:50) SnakeyAtWork: well, something, it could be blocks for all I care
(03:36:02) SnakeyAtWork: I might make a prototype in my weekend
(03:36:03) squiggly_p: no, lemmings are overused, and they don't behave the way most people think
(03:36:17) BlademasterBobo: ahahahaha
(03:36:19) squiggly_p: hmm
(03:36:20) BlademasterBobo: konjak nice ending
(03:36:29) SnakeyAtWork: Either that or you just have this thing that blows things up or something and you have to build a huge tower
(03:36:41) BlademasterBobo: That could be an art game, if you just left it like that
(03:36:42) BlademasterBobo: :P
(03:36:46) KonamiCode: here's a random question
(03:37:03) KonamiCode: anyone have any idea how the maps were generated in X-Com?
(03:37:03) Dragonene: Snakey: ...you didn't participate in LD12, did you?
(03:37:07) Dragonene: theme: "The Tower"
(03:37:12) konjak: thanks Bobo
(03:37:19) Dragonene: building and or destroying towers were pretty much what the contest was all about :D
(03:37:27) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: No, I couldn't come up with any ideas 
(03:37:28) Ciahnensy: No more destruction.
(03:37:31) SnakeyAtWork: wait, they had another one?
(03:37:33) konjak: It could, but then I am not pretentious
(03:37:39) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(03:37:42) SnakeyAtWork: I couldn't come up with ideas for the Advancing wall of Doom
(03:37:45) squiggly_p: they have two or thre LD's a year
(03:37:48) squiggly_p: i think

(03:38:16) konjak: Bobo, now that you mention it, it has pretty much then ending of Fathom
(03:38:16) squiggly_p: go for it
(03:38:26) konjak: Blown up in a white flash
(03:38:48) squiggly_p: I'm still trying to wrap my brain-goo around pointers, so I'm worthless with programming :(
(03:39:08) SnakeyAtWork: squiggly_p: Ahh pointers :)
(03:39:11) SnakeyAtWork: Pointers are fun.
(03:39:14) SnakeyAtWork: Especially when they get complex
(03:39:17) Ciahnensy: Konjak enjoys Ecco the Dolphin precursors.
(03:39:24) BlademasterBobo: konjak: haha, yeah
(03:39:27) SnakeyAtWork: such as pointers pointing to pointers that are pointing to other pointers
(03:39:39) BlademasterBobo: only in fathom there's no soldier yelling "huzzah"
(03:39:44) squiggly_p: I get a lot of C++ stuff, but the whole concept of pointers is throwing me for a loop.  I have no clue when to use them or not
(03:39:53) BlademasterBobo: protip
(03:39:55) BlademasterBobo: if you're not sure
(03:39:56) BlademasterBobo: don't
(03:39:56) konjak: more like "huhu"
(03:40:00) squiggly_p: heh
(03:40:13) konjak: Soldiers with trucker hats
(03:40:16) BlademasterBobo: haha
(03:40:21) Dragonmaw: guys
(03:40:23) Dragonmaw: freeware games
(03:40:23) Dragonmaw: go
(03:40:24) Dragonene: Snakey: yeah, advancing wall of doom was LD14
(03:40:27) squiggly_p: I'd rather do all my coding with my wallet, anyway
(03:40:28) Dragonmaw: NAME SOME GOOD ONES
(03:40:30) Dragonene: LD12 was older
(03:40:31) BlademasterBobo: SHUT THE FUCK UP
(03:40:33) Dragonmaw: also hi konjak

(03:40:42) squiggly_p: :P
(03:40:46) Dragonmaw: no to minecraft
(03:40:46) BlademasterBobo: Minecraft isn't even an alpha yet
(03:40:47) konjak: hi Dragonmaw
(03:40:48) Dragonene: Dragonmaw: What about that contest
(03:40:53) Dragonene: it's been a week now
(03:40:57) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: It is in alpha
(03:41:00) Dragonmaw: I extended it
(03:41:02) Dragonene: Not in beta tho.
(03:41:05) Dragonmaw: With my extension powers
(03:41:10) SnakeyAtWork: Theres no rule to when you should use pointers
(03:41:16) BlademasterBobo: I'm gonna win right dragonmaw
(03:41:17) BlademasterBobo: ;D

(03:41:21) Dragonmaw: IDK
(03:41:22) Dragonmaw: maybe
(03:41:24) Dragonene: You shouldn't use pointers!
(03:41:25) Dragonmaw: depends
(03:41:29) BlademasterBobo: that'd be pretty damn hilarious
(03:41:32) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: There are times when you need to
(03:41:34) Dragonmaw: might win if you give me a freeware game
(03:41:37) Dragonmaw: hint hint
(03:41:40) BlademasterBobo: haha
(03:41:42) BlademasterBobo: fathom
(03:41:42) SnakeyAtWork: for example, when the lifespan of an object is undetermined
(03:41:43) Dragonene: What's the judging criteria? Random? :)
(03:41:49) SlayerXL [Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.

(03:44:06) Dragonene: it's a great game.
(03:44:23) Dragonmaw: i'm stealing it
(03:44:28) Dragonmaw: the price to not do it
(03:44:32) Dragonmaw: is a copy of NL2
(03:44:33) Dragonmaw: ;o
(03:45:00) BlademasterBobo: Don't do it konjak
(03:45:13) BlademasterBobo: Why would he pay you for anti-publicity
(03:45:15) BlademasterBobo: doesn't make sense
(03:45:27) konjak: I'm not sure what you're trying to do at all
(03:45:28) BlademasterBobo: also dragonmaw your article is pretty far behind the times
(03:45:32) xe0n [jake@adsl-75-21-77-48.dsl.chcgil.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(03:45:38) Dragonmaw: also bobo shush
(03:45:59) Dragonene: konjak: freeware friday on bigdownload
(03:46:01) Dragonene: is what he's trying to do
(03:46:04) SnakeyAtWork: Linkage to the article?
(03:46:29) Cosmic_Fool [chatzilla@CPE-139-168-124-243.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.
(03:46:39) Ina_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:46:59) Cosmic_Fool: and now to download the TF2 update on capped net
(03:47:08) Cosmic_Fool: so i can play at 2 this morninh
(03:47:21) SnakeyAtWork: IRC takes precious bandwidth
(03:47:30) Cosmic_Fool: eh
(03:47:33) iFire`: SnakeyAtWork lies irc takes nothing
(03:47:36) u5|xeon` left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:47:37) konjak: TF twoooo
(03:47:41) SnakeyAtWork: :P
(03:47:43) iFire`: and it's free for the weekend
(03:47:44) FoxBoy left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:47:56) Cosmic_Fool: yeah, TF2 seems to be the unofficial game that loads of tiggers play
(03:48:01) Dragonene: or L4D
(03:48:05) Dragonene: but it's not only tiggers.
(03:48:08) Dragonene: Everybody plays them
(03:48:09) iFire`: tf also locks the screen up for me
(03:48:11) Dragonene: They're all the hype
(03:48:12) SnakeyAtWork: Well, they're both fun games
(03:48:16) iFire`: valve is a great company
(03:48:18) Dragonene: That they are, Snakey
(03:48:27) Dragonene: Sadly I can't play them on my laptop here
(03:48:31) SnakeyAtWork: Sigh, I wish UT3 was a fun game.
(03:48:32) Cosmic_Fool: valve is good for gaming
(03:48:33) Dragonene: I own both of them but this lappy is too crud
(03:48:37) Dragonene: Snakey: I think UT3 *is* a fun game.
(03:48:42) Dragonene: :)
(03:48:50) Dragonene: It's not half as bad as people say to it
(03:48:50) SnakeyAtWork: It's not as fun compared to UT2004 and then UT
(03:48:59) Dragonene: And I don't think they removed its soul or anything like everybody says
(03:49:07) Dragonene: It shows they put a lot of effort into it if you ask me.
(03:49:09) SnakeyAtWork: So I just usually stay with UT2004
(03:49:19) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork: I don't know, I like all of the UT games.
(03:49:22) KonamiCode left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(03:49:23) Dragonene: UT2003 was meh
(03:49:25) Ciahnensy [pyx@24-119-17-103.cpe.cableone.net] entered the room.
(03:49:26) Dragonene: but apart from that
(03:49:34) Cosmic_Fool: Painkiller
(03:49:34) SnakeyAtWork: I enjoy UT then UT2004 and then ... nothing
(03:49:44) Cosmic_Fool: Painkiller overkill
(03:49:47) Dragonene: This is because you're broken
(03:49:48) SnakeyAtWork: I liked UT2004 for its vast quantities of stuff
(03:49:52) Cosmic_Fool: this is a game i look forward to
(03:49:56) Dragonene: UT2004 is truly a great game
(03:49:57) SnakeyAtWork: UT3 had a really small map count.
(03:50:04) Dragonene: The thing I really don't like about UT3 is this:
(03:50:11) Dragonene: 1. No bombing run.
(03:50:12) Dock [Dock@cpc1-cmbg3-0-0-cust834.cmbg.cable.ntl.com] entered the room.
(03:50:16) Dragonene: 2. No bombing run :'(
(03:50:22) Dragonene: 3. No bombing run! *wagh*
(03:50:28) Ciahnensy: I also enjoy that mode.
(03:50:35) Dragonene: the things* I really don't like rather
(03:50:44) Dragonene: Me and a friend has this tradition
(03:50:49) SnakeyAtWork: Dragoene: I made a mod called 'Keg Bombing' once.
(03:50:50) ***Cosmic_Fool puts his hand up to say that I have never played a UT game
(03:51:01) Pepito [pepe@72-56-61-195.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(03:51:02) SnakeyAtWork: Back when it was actually easy to mod the UT series
(03:51:07) Dragonene: every LAN we go to, we do a few bombing run games with us two against some 3-4 godlike bots on pretty much all the bombing run maps
(03:51:07) Dock: hello chaps
(03:51:12) Dragonene: Hi Dock
(03:51:17) Dock: helloo
(03:51:18) Ciahnensy: A fine tradition.
(03:51:22) Dragonene: Innit? :)
(03:51:38) Dock: my game is running quite smoothly on iphone today. I'm quite glad of this! :)
(03:51:40) SnakeyAtWork: We used to play my crazy mods at lans.
(03:51:58) Cosmic_Fool: good for you dock
(03:52:01) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: I had this mod that was like GTA in a round destruction derby map
(03:52:03) Dock: thanks :) 
(03:52:07) SnakeyAtWork: It was fun making it
(03:52:07) Pepe left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:52:10) Dragonene: Strangely, I find godlike a bit too easy.
(03:52:11) Cosmic_Fool: what is this game
(03:52:16) mklee left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:52:16) iFire`: Dock congrats
(03:52:21) Cosmic_Fool: is it in Devlogs?
(03:52:23) SnakeyAtWork: Everyone had these big bull dog vehicles
(03:52:30) Dragonene: Not as in "I always win against godlike", because I lose pretty often
(03:52:38) Dock: I'm now much more enthusiastic about releasing this game. 
(03:52:38) Dragonene: I just *want* a mode that's all but impossible
(03:52:46) Dragonene: so that when you win after 50 tries, you're really happy about it
(03:52:48) iFire`: Dragonene got l4d?
(03:52:49) Dragonene: grats Dock :)
(03:52:50) Cosmic_Fool: Gears insane is hard
(03:52:58) SnakeyAtWork: and there were lots of civilians running around (all Gorge models shouting "YARGH!")
(03:52:59) Dragonene: iFire`: Yes
(03:53:01) iFire`: they have a survival mode
(03:53:04) Dragonene: You already know this
(03:53:05) Cosmic_Fool: however, Gears 2 horde mode on insane is truly and utterly impssible
(03:53:15) Dragonene: iFire`: Heh, but that's not the same thing
(03:53:17) SnakeyAtWork: When you killed them candy would pop out
(03:53:25) SnakeyAtWork: some candy that popped out had special effects
(03:53:25) konjak: Haven't played Survival in a while
(03:53:26) Dragonene: Snakey: you know the sandstorm map in UT3?
(03:53:30) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: Yep
(03:53:40) Dragonene: That one, in the campaign, on the hardest difficulty
(03:53:48) iFire`: Dragonene how's your progress on l4d expert?
(03:53:48) Dragonene: Is pretty damn hard
(03:53:51) Ina_ [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(03:54:10) Dragonene: iFire`: Dunno, I've completed all but one I think
(03:54:11) iFire`: pretty easy?
(03:54:21) Dragonene: But I didn't get the achievements for any of them
(03:54:23) Dock: anyone else here doing iPhone development?
(03:54:26) konjak: I haven't beaten a single level on Expert :(
(03:54:30) konjak: Haven't tried much though
(03:54:32) Dragonene: every time I've died *just* before the end and my friends got out, or it bugged
(03:54:37) iFire`: Dock PoV is but he's not in this channel
(03:54:40) Dock: ah
(03:54:48) Dragonene: It really does bug out with the achievements now and then for me
(03:54:51) SnakeyAtWork: Dock: I would but owning an iPhone in New Zealand is absurdly expensive
(03:54:55) Cosmic_Fool: Dock, what is this game?
(03:54:56) Dragonene: also iFire`, I haven't played L4D all that much
(03:54:57) Dock: snakey, shame
(03:55:02) Dragonene: since it doesn't work for me here in australia
(03:55:11) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: I made this mod in UT2004 where the gun would shoot out a shock ball
(03:55:17) Dock: my game? it's an iphone 'sequel' to my game Tumbledrop
(03:55:21) iFire`: Dragonene it's really fun on expert as one wrong move dooms
(03:55:25) Cosmic_Fool: AH YES
(03:55:26) Dragonene: Well, just last week I managed to *start it* without it giving me BSOD for the first time, but it runs at like 3fps
(03:55:27) Cosmic_Fool: tumbledrop
(03:55:28) SnakeyAtWork: After firing ten of these shock balls (which would travel for a short distance then hover in mid air)
(03:55:31) iFire`: and there's microphones
(03:55:32) Dragonene: no, 0fps would be more like it
(03:55:32) Cosmic_Fool: i get it now its cool
(03:55:38) konjak: Dragonene, you don't get full-campaign achievements if there's just a slightest hitch in your connection on the play-through
(03:55:39) Dragonene: iFire`: I only play on Expert.
(03:55:40) SnakeyAtWork: you then got a single shot with the normal shock beam
(03:55:48) Dragonene: konjak: Yeah, I know, it's silly
(03:55:58) iFire`: Dragonene actually tf2 is doing that for me :/
(03:56:03) Dragonene: But once there wasn't any for me, and I was the only one to survive
(03:56:03) SnakeyAtWork: when you shocked a shock ball, it would do the standard shock ball explosion, but it would then jump to a near by shock ball too
(03:56:06) iFire`: I can't play it without stuttering
(03:56:09) Dragonene: but it still didn't give me an achievement
(03:56:10) iFire`: and crashing
(03:56:11) SnakeyAtWork: It was STUPID amounts of fun with 16 players
(03:56:20) Dragonene: iFire`: Oh, it's because of my computer, nothing else
(03:56:26) Dragonene: gah,I can't keep up with this conversation
(03:56:31) SnakeyAtWork: Hitting a shock ball against another shock ball would bounce it
(03:56:37) Dragonene: iFire`, SnakeyAtWork and others are talking to me at once
(03:56:40) Dragonene: about different things
(03:56:44) SnakeyAtWork: It was as if the whole map was exploding
(03:56:52) Dragonene: Snakey: Oh, cool
(03:56:53) iFire`: SnakeyAtWork did you crash the game with recursive loops?
(03:56:59) Dragonene: sort of like that big vehicle
(03:57:02) Dragonene: whatever it's called?
(03:57:06) Dragonene: that has chain reaction shocks
(03:57:13) SnakeyAtWork: iFire`: No, 
(03:57:26) SnakeyAtWork: the simple way to prevent that was to just destroy said shock balls after they were shocked
(03:57:28) Cosmic_Fool: hey TIGS
(03:57:41) SnakeyAtWork: Some people were holding down the fire button
(03:57:55) SnakeyAtWork: and then they realized that the balls they were launching were being shocked and the shock wave was closing in on them
(03:57:57) Cosmic_Fool: if any australians are online about 11 who own a copy of TF2
(03:57:57) Dragonene: iFire`: So yeah, I'm not very good at L4D, but I do like it's difficulty
(03:57:57) SnakeyAtWork: it was lolz
(03:58:00) Dragonene: it's rather well-balanced
(03:58:05) Dragonene: both expert and hard are enjoyable
(03:58:19) iFire`: expert and advanced
(03:58:20) Dragonene: hard for the action, expert in a sort of sneaky-take-cover manner
(03:58:22) Dragonene: right
(03:58:27) Dragonene: terminology pfah
(03:58:33) iFire`: normal is suprisingly really easy
(03:58:38) Dragonene: normal isn't fun
(03:58:43) SnakeyAtWork: well home time
(03:58:44) SnakeyAtWork: bbl
(03:58:48) Movius [simba@ppp59-167-51-163.lns1.cbr1.internode.on.net] entered the room.
(03:58:52) SnakeyAtWork left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(03:58:53) iFire`: it's not fun, I agree
(03:58:53) Arne [chatzilla@h42n2fls34o984.telia.com] entered the room.
(03:58:58) Cosmic_Fool: im not looking forward to playing Medic during the sniper and spy update
(03:58:59) konjak: Me and my brother play Advanced a whole lot with two CPUs, expert is such a fucking impossible leap with CPUs
(03:59:10) Dragonene: yeah
(03:59:14) Dragonene: expert is lots of fun with friends
(03:59:19) konjak: Why do they even have a Single Player if the CPUs are programmed to do retard decisions
(03:59:22) Dragonene: but advanced is probably better with cpus
(03:59:32) konjak: heh
(03:59:57) Dock: I sometimes forget that this room is such a PC FPS lobby
(04:00:37) doohan left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(04:00:42) Cosmic_Fool: not really, theres not enough swearing and trashtalk
(04:00:50) Cosmic_Fool: and my name would be different
(04:01:09) Cosmic_Fool: lots more unnecessary symbols and numbers
(04:01:23) squiggly_p: i'm not a FPS fan
(04:01:28) Cosmic_Fool: woot
(04:01:34) Cosmic_Fool: 11 hours until i can play TF2
(04:01:36) Cosmic_Fool: sweet
(04:01:41) Pongball left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:01:50) squiggly_p: except CS: Source which I used to worship as a pagan god
(04:02:14) konjak: Apparently I have the free weekend right now
(04:02:19) konjak: Never played TF2 though
(04:03:09) squiggly_p: played TFC?
(04:03:24) konjak: I don't like "deathmatch" gaming, sort of
(04:03:36) squiggly_p: yeah, I'm the same way
(04:03:38) konjak: WHich is why L4D is so great (and versus less great)
(04:03:57) Cosmic_Fool: 12 and a half hours actually
(04:03:58) Cosmic_Fool: woot
(04:04:00) Dragonene: konjak: have you played swat 4?
(04:04:06) Dragonene: You might enjoy it if you like L4D
(04:04:07) Cosmic_Fool: im off
(04:04:08) Movius: TF2 is rad
(04:04:09) Dragonene: it has a really great coop mode.
(04:04:14) konjak: I don't play PC really other than L4D
(04:04:14) Cosmic_Fool left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(04:04:17) squiggly_p: remember when a lot of multiplayer games had coop?
(04:04:21) Dragonene: L4D and Swat 4 are actually pretty similar
(04:04:29) squiggly_p: like old console games?...   those were the days...
(04:04:43) konjak: coop is the best multiplayed
(04:04:45) Dragonene: konjak: There's criminals instead of zombies in swat 4
(04:04:49) Dragonene: but apart from that they're very similar
(04:05:01) konjak: I know of Swat 4
(04:05:01) Dragonene: Also you get to choose your own equipment in swat 4, and there's more sneaking.
(04:05:07) squiggly_p: they run at you and climb up buildings to kill you?
(04:05:07) Dragonene: PLAY IT
(04:05:08) konjak: Thanks to the Spoony Experiment
(04:05:18) jsticker: There's also Raven Shield
(04:05:24) jsticker: That has coop too
(04:05:32) jsticker: RS <3
(04:05:47) Dock: you guys really seem to play these things a lot
(04:06:00) konjak: dock, gamers usually play games
(04:06:05) squiggly_p: I haven't played  aton of new games
(04:06:08) jsticker: Yeah, it's only been 7 months since I played raven shield for the last time
(04:06:09) squiggly_p: or new-ish games
(04:06:09) Dock: pff :)
(04:06:16) squiggly_p: like Bioshock... never played it
(04:06:28) Dock: I might sell my copy of bioshock
(04:06:35) Dock: I'm going to have a massive cull soon
(04:06:41) jsticker: You might end up getting 5 quid for it
(04:06:44) Dragonene: Dock: "a lot" is a very relative term
(04:06:44) Dock: get rid of all the shit I've grown to dislike
(04:06:50) squiggly_p: I think HL2 and it's various little add-ons and spawn are the most recent things I've played
(04:06:50) Dock: i would sell Braid if I could! 
(04:07:00) Dragonene: I play them mostly on LAN, and we host a LAN event like one or two times per year
(04:07:09) Dock: ok
(04:07:17) Dragonene: By far my most commonly played game is WC3
(04:07:21) Dock: I've never really known fps people that weren't aggro 
(04:07:31) jsticker: There are ossum FPS games, there's just not been any in the recent past
(04:07:32) Dock: so I have bad experiences with it
(04:07:35) konjak: My most commonly played game is Metroid Fusion   :\
(04:07:41) konjak: I play it over and over, often on the can
(04:07:44) konjak: :D
(04:07:45) Dock: I bought that game because you like it
(04:07:50) Dock: haven't played it yet though
(04:07:53) Dragonene: konjak: heh
(04:07:57) jsticker: NDS game?
(04:08:02) Dock: GBA
(04:08:06) jsticker: :(
(04:08:12) squiggly_p: yeah I played the hell outta that back n the day
(04:08:22) squiggly_p: until my sister stole my GBA
(04:08:36) konjak: My best time is 1:20. Not comparable to other speedrunners, but I try to have fun too.
(04:08:41) squiggly_p: no more FF Tactics Advance :(
(04:08:56) Dock: never played a 2D metroid. not a big fan of the art tbh
(04:09:03) Dock: but I feel obliged to 
(04:09:04) squiggly_p: o_0
(04:09:07) konjak: eh
(04:09:14) Dock: I have super metroid on VC
(04:09:14) konjak: the art is great, especially Fusion
(04:09:19) squiggly_p: Super Metroid, SNES, go emulate it right this very minute young man
(04:09:22) konjak: Fusion is so colorful...
(04:09:25) Dock: it's a bit airbrush naff
(04:09:26) Dragonene: This is weird
(04:09:41) Dragonene: I would have thought konjak and Dock had similar tastes
(04:09:42) Dock: looks like a gaudy LP cover from 1982 
(04:09:49) Dragonene: because there's something similar about your art styles.
(04:09:51) konjak: why
(04:10:11) konjak: Zero Mission is ugly
(04:10:20) konjak: The backgrounds are 90% pure black
(04:10:26) squiggly_p: are you talking about the in-game graphics or the box art?
(04:10:30) Dock: I can see the appeal, but maybe it doesn't help that I missed out on metroid 
(04:10:35) Dock: my first metroid was Prime
(04:10:48) Dragonene: actually
(04:10:52) Dragonene: Not all that similar, I guess.
(04:10:53) Drakkar: my first and my favorite was 2
(04:10:59) konjak: Dock: http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/5161/metroidfusionrf7.jpg
(04:11:04) Drakkar: of course the reason for that is..
(04:11:08) Drakkar: THE MOTHA FUCKIN' SPIDER BALL
(04:11:17) Dragonene: also
(04:11:18) Drakkar: also I liked the maps for some reason
(04:11:22) Dock: yeah, that all seems a bit lurid 
(04:11:23) Dragonene: http://www.x2d.org/java/4k/spiderball
(04:11:27) Dragonene: SPIDERBALL
(04:11:33) Drakkar: it really felt like you were in caves
(04:11:34) konjak: lurid..?
(04:11:37) Drakkar: with the occassional ruins
(04:11:47) Dock: garish?
(04:11:50) konjak: But Fusion does't look like Super, and Zero Mission doesn't look much like the others
(04:11:53) Drakkar: super metroid always bugged me because it had a weird combination of maps
(04:11:57) Drakkar: and just bizarre transitions
(04:12:12) konjak: Fusion is the best Metroid, as well as Metroidvania
(04:12:33) squiggly_p: SOTN = best metroidvania....
(04:12:37) Drakkar: I loved fusion haha
(04:12:37) doohan [doohan@cpc2-oxfd7-0-0-cust777.oxfd.cable.ntl.com] entered the room.
(04:12:37) Dock: only completed two metroidvanias
(04:12:39) squiggly_p: i mean...  it's so obvious...
(04:12:48) Dock: couldn't get into SOTN 
(04:12:51) Dock: need to try again
(04:12:52) Drakkar: that was a matter of writing though
(04:13:04) Drakkar: fusion managed to drag me through the storyline
(04:13:06) doohan: metroid + castlevania = metroidvania?
(04:13:16) squiggly_p: i like the swordplay over the missile weapons, too
(04:13:20) squiggly_p: yep
(04:13:35) Dock: doohan, a catch all term for 2D persistent map upgrade based games
(04:13:36) squiggly_p: but really, the whole genre started with Legend of Zelda
(04:13:43) squiggly_p: if you think about it
(04:13:55) Dock: you mean Zelda 2?
(04:14:00) Dragonmaw: so
(04:14:00) konjak: I don't see why so many love SotN still. It's unbalanced and unpolished out the ass. All it has for me is a nice castle atmosphere.
(04:14:00) squiggly_p: the first one
(04:14:03) Dragonmaw: any freeware games
(04:14:16) Dock: yeah, it's born from the Platform RPG games like Wonderboy III 
(04:14:16) squiggly_p: open world you had to backtrack through, upgradeable health and weapons...
(04:14:29) Dock: and xanadu
(04:14:49) Dock: well, sure, if you like
(04:14:53) doohan: <3 wonder boy III dragons trap :)
(04:15:11) Dragonmaw: HEY
(04:15:12) jsticker: hi maw
(04:15:13) konjak: You can kill any boss with a hail of throwing knives in SotN, and the alleged hardest boss you can fly behind and just punch it so it never gets a window to even MOVE
(04:15:13) Dragonmaw: FREEWARE GAMES
(04:15:16) Dragonmaw: SNAP TO IT
(04:15:16) Dock: *high five doohan*
(04:15:23) ***doohan high fives
(04:15:37) Dragonmaw: Konjak: The hardest boss in the game comes after you get the Alucard Shield and Shield Rod
(04:15:44) Dragonmaw: You can finish him without even that.
(04:15:53) konjak: who are you talking about then
(04:15:59) konjak: I am talking about Galamoth
(04:15:59) Dragonene: Dragonmaw: I thought you picked LotP
(04:16:07) Drakkar: legacy of the wizard was pretty great
(04:16:10) Dragonmaw: Naw, it's not long/artsy enough
(04:16:12) Dragonmaw: ;p
(04:16:23) Drakkar: I'm also a gigantic fag for sorcerian
(04:16:24) Drakkar: but
(04:16:30) Drakkar: only the more updated ones
(04:16:33) Dragonmaw: konjak: whichever one is the big centaur thing that takes up like 4 screens
(04:16:34) Drakkar: which unfortunately aren't english
(04:16:35) Drakkar: at all
(04:16:53) konjak: http://www.castlevaniacrypt.com/games/sotn/images/enemies/galamoth.gif  This is Galamoth. He is a pussy if you get behind him.
(04:17:06) konjak: If you use a weapon with knockback and hit his head, he can't do anything
(04:17:07) Dock: konjak's favourite position
(04:17:08) Drakkar: which is a shame with something like 50-60 different scenarios
(04:17:18) Dragonmaw: oh whups
(04:17:30) Dragonmaw: i was mixing him up with the one in order of ecclesia
(04:17:31) Drakkar: huh
(04:17:33) Dragonmaw: yes, him
(04:17:34) Drakkar: you know
(04:17:38) Drakkar: I don't recall seeing him
(04:17:39) Drakkar: once
(04:17:45) Dragonmaw: just gotta use the shield rod
(04:17:46) konjak: Ecclesia's hardest boss was the DAMN SHADOW BOSS
(04:17:51) Dragonmaw: you can beat him in less than a minute
(04:17:54) Drakkar: oh
(04:17:56) Drakkar: thats why
(04:17:57) Drakkar: hurr
(04:17:57) Dragonmaw: and the final boss in less than 30 seconds
(04:17:57) Drakkar: >_>
(04:18:00) konjak: which requires you learn his entire pattern because a hit = 200 hp loss
(04:18:11) slv left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(04:18:12) Dock: I do love this genre but I can't really justify making a metroidvania type game
(04:18:19) jsticker: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IAYlISmJO8&fmt=18 \o/
(04:18:21) squiggly_p: I had a GBA castlevania game and the game just stopped
(04:18:27) konjak: I wanna make a metroidvania game so bad...
(04:18:28) squiggly_p: I couldn't figure out how to continue
(04:18:39) Dock: konjak, you ought to
(04:18:54) konjak: I put up what I had of my last attempt on my site yesterday
(04:19:04) konjak: That was just before I started Chalk
(04:19:14) ***Ciahnensy begins Konjak.
(04:19:37) slv [potatofarm@pool-71-174-186-68.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(04:19:42) konjak: I've been trying to start on games with hand-drawn art the last months but I never get anywhere because it's tiring and boring :(
(04:19:53) konjak: Should I just go back to picksels and feel old-fashioned?
(04:20:09) ***konjak needs a shoulder
(04:20:56) Dock: don't let him get behind you
(04:21:13) squiggly_p: what sort of resolutions are you doing it at?
(04:21:23) Gravious [Leigh@217.33.146.194] entered the room.
(04:21:29) konjak: 800x600 and such
(04:21:46) Dock: what's happening with solar plexus? 
(04:21:54) squiggly_p: so a character would be like 64x64 or so?
(04:21:55) konjak: Still, animation is a part of it, and pixel graphics make that easy as fuck
(04:21:57) Notch: i do pixels mostly because it's all I can draw, hehe
(04:22:14) Notch: and only at looow resolutions, where I can brute force it
(04:22:26) konjak: Dock, I tried working on it yesterday but as I sit down I just can't. It sucks, I want to see it finished but at the same time I hate working on it.  :\
(04:22:29) squiggly_p: yeah, i pixel really low res, too
(04:22:30) Notch: but hand drawn looks niiice if you manage to pull the animations off
(04:22:39) squiggly_p: i like doing 3D and texturing, tho
(04:22:42) squiggly_p: easier
(04:22:48) Dock: konjak, I liked it 
(04:22:55) Notch: 3d. =D I've tried modelling in 3d, but I'm apparently stupid
(04:22:57) konjak: I think hand-drawn is for when you're not making a game alone
(04:23:20) konjak: Dock, several people have said they really like it; doesn't help.
(04:23:29) konjak: I appreciate that, but still :(
(04:23:52) Dragonene: konjak: :'(
(04:23:55) Dragonene: You're making me sad
(04:23:58) Dragonene: saying animations are easy
(04:24:01) Dock: konjak, you need a partner 
(04:24:04) Dragonene: I don't even want to think about doing animations
(04:24:04) konjak: Noitu 2, man, I never lost motivation
(04:24:08) xe0n: who watches avatar?
(04:24:10) Dragonene: I can't even do static pixels :P
(04:24:17) slv left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(04:24:27) konjak: Noitu 2 just flooowed
(04:24:30) slv [potatofarm@pool-71-174-186-68.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(04:24:32) squiggly_p: what sort of game is it you're working on?
(04:24:39) Dock: konjak, I think maybe because this is puzzley?
(04:25:11) konjak: Dock, or it's just because I know I wouldn't play it myself if someone else made it!  :D
(04:25:21) konjak: Sometimes I make games based on what I think will be fun for others
(04:25:34) Dock: ah
(04:25:51) konjak: Chalk was finished but I sort of hurried that too
(04:26:01) Dock: well, yeah, working for a company makes you get used to working on games you wouldn't ever play
(04:26:23) Dock: whilst I'm kinda thankful to be free of that, I'm not just going to make games because I want to play them
(04:26:32) konjak: It would be easier to keep a flow going because I don't have to put all the assets to each idea, making myself think more about if I want to or not
(04:26:36) Dock: equally, I'm not going to choose something I would /never/ play
(04:27:11) konjak: Yeah, but you're not planning on making multi-hour games on your own anytime soon, right? ;)
(04:27:20) konjak: like I always manage to start
(04:27:42) jw [chatzilla@gd-c-7611.adsl.wanadoo.nl] entered the room.
(04:27:44) Dock: actually, puzzle games are artificially lots of hours :) 
(04:27:47) konjak: I love writing dialogue and coming up with fun characters which is why I wanna make a Metroidvania
(04:27:55) konjak: well, you know what I mean
(04:28:06) Androu1 left the room (quit: Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by FuckPingOut))).
(04:28:06) FuckPingOut [Androu1@190-76-16-16.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(04:28:16) Dock: yeah 
(04:28:19) Dock: content heavy games
(04:28:24) Dock: are a bit of a bad idea :)
(04:28:25) Dragonene: I've never made a single content heavy game.
(04:28:28) FuckPingOut is now known as Androu1
(04:28:41) Dragonene: All my games are small and usually puzzly
(04:28:45) Dock: I would love to, but it's a bad idea 
(04:28:47) Dragonene: Or casual.
(04:28:59) Dock: I come from a comic making background, so it's natural for me to want that too.
(04:28:59) squiggly_p: I'm making content for a content heavy game...  just can't actually program the damn thing yet :P
(04:29:04) Dock: (natural for most artists tbh)
(04:29:22) Dragonene: Dock: Yeah, I'd love to as well, but it can take a long time just to make a single graphical thingy or a single level for me
(04:29:22) konjak: I've had lots of ideas for a Noitu 3 lately, but if I start that I feel unorginal
(04:29:30) konjak: so many stupid restrictions on myself
(04:30:05) Dock: I learned a lot from making lostwinds though, I reckon I could do something
(04:30:07) squiggly_p: make a Noitu metroidvania
(04:30:10) Dragonene: You clearly need to make the art for my puzzle game
(04:30:13) Dragonene: It's the only solution.
(04:30:16) Dock: D: 
(04:30:16) Dragonene: I'm just kidding.
(04:30:18) Esquar [Leroy@86.85.84.223] entered the room.
(04:30:20) Dock: haha
(04:30:31) jsticker: He's not really kidding
(04:30:44) Esquar: I think I found a bug in the GDC Vault
(04:31:04) konjak: squiggly_p, I actually had that suggested before
(04:31:07) Dragonene: jsticker: I'm not kidding in the sense that I'd like it to happen
(04:31:09) konjak: not sure if it's the series for it
(04:31:20) Dragonene: I'm kidding in the sense that I know konjak is a professional and I can't afford to pay somebody.
(04:31:25) Esquar: I didn't go to GDC or have a pass or anything
(04:31:30) Esquar: I just made an account on the site
(04:31:52) Esquar: and through some weird way, I'm now able to watch like 150 videos of the last GDC
(04:32:04) PiratePoo [none@sd5116607.adsl.wanadoo.nl] entered the room.
(04:32:12) Dock: I'm sad that my game with increpere is seemingly on hold 
(04:32:17) Dock: I was enjoying that
(04:32:28) Dragonene: I want to work on something collaborative too
(04:32:29) Dragonene: But not quite yet
(04:32:32) Dock: I should work on artwork for one of my next games in my weekends
(04:32:42) Dragonene: I want to wrap up a project or too before I embark on something new.
(04:32:45) Dock: so that I have loads of art for the characters and environments
(04:33:00) Gravious: noitu 3 needs conventional joypad controls, i wanted to like noitu 2 but i couldnt play it because of the controls :(
(04:33:03) konjak: Dock, would you do puppet-animation?
(04:33:16) Dock: that's my brother's field, I wouldn't want to impose
(04:33:20) konjak: Gravious, Noitu 2 is about the controls though
(04:33:25) Gravious: i know
(04:33:31) Dock: (he's a puppet maker and animator)
(04:33:32) Gravious: thats why i'm sad
(04:33:49) Dock: confused by the question tho
(04:34:01) lansing: Gravious, someone was inquiring as to your whereabouts yesterday
(04:34:01) BlademasterBobo: Esquar: How
(04:34:05) BlademasterBobo: you can't sign up without a pass
(04:34:06) BlademasterBobo: o_O
(04:34:14) konjak: you know, made up of pieces that move around, dock
(04:34:14) Esquar: well yeah you can
(04:34:20) BlademasterBobo: how?
(04:34:23) Esquar: @gdconf.com
(04:34:29) BlademasterBobo: ?
(04:34:43) Dock: oh
(04:34:50) Dock: yeah, I intend to do that
(04:34:52) Esquar: I dunno, you need it to watch the free videos normally, right?
(04:34:59) Esquar: I used that account
(04:34:59) BlademasterBobo: ?
(04:35:05) Dragonene: Huh, apparently I need to leave soon
(04:35:07) BlademasterBobo: where did you register though?
(04:35:07) konjak: Dock, that's what I can't let myself do for EVERYTHING :(
(04:35:09) konjak: It looks terrible
(04:35:09) Dragonene: I should get some more studying done first
(04:35:10) mezo [mezo@CPE0018f8d6bd6b-CM001bd7aa18f2.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com] entered the room.
(04:35:10) Dragonene: later.
(04:35:14) BlademasterBobo: because the registration thing says you need to have a pass
(04:35:21) Dock: don't do it for everything then
(04:35:24) Esquar: let me check, been a while ago
(04:35:32) konjak: uh, well, that's where the problem is of too much work
(04:35:40) Dock: then don't use that method
(04:35:48) Dock: you seem to have a good handle on sprites
(04:36:01) Dock: it only suits me because I have experience with the tech 
(04:36:06) konjak: Yeah, I'll probably go back to that...
(04:36:24) Esquar: if the forums would work....
(04:36:25) Dock: it's hard to make it look good, and I might not achieve that either
(04:36:26) konjak: Dock, are you an animator professionally in any way?
(04:36:41) Dock: my game might end up being one of those games that people go "lol, Eternity's Child" 
(04:36:51) Dock: yeah I've done animation pro
(04:37:09) konjak: How can you then accept making characters have that animation?!  :'(
(04:37:10) Esquar: blademasterbobo, can you watch those 3 free vids?
(04:37:10) Dock: not a massive amount though, but enough

(04:37:48) Dock: that's how you do it

(04:38:08) OEP left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:38:23) konjak: Dock, that's not plainly rotating parts. They have lots of parts changing, morphs and even traditional animation sometimes. That's what I'd try, but that's nowhere near the simplicity of rotating parts.
(04:38:26) lansing: Gravious, hm, maybe JohhannesG?  whomever it was they were just checking to see if you were still alive
(04:38:50) Esquar: my classmate got a login somehow 2 days ago, so it should be possible
(04:38:56) Dock: yeah that's my point, you need to do all that mess
(04:38:58) Esquar: try this link http://mygdc.gdconf.com/vault/search/results.php?cid=228&search_by=all&track=all&type=all&keyword=&x=33&y=4
(04:39:04) konjak: Which I can't, DOCK
(04:39:09) Dock: it's not trivial, and it might not be worthwhile
(04:39:10) BlademasterBobo: lol
(04:39:12) konjak: WHAT'S UP, DOCK
(04:39:13) Dock: then don't
(04:39:21) konjak: EEEEEEEH
(04:39:24) Dock: I don't know whether I'll use it either
(04:39:32) ***konjak crunches on a carrot
(04:39:41) Dock: I love carrots
(04:39:46) Dock: I used to eat like six raw a day
(04:39:47) Esquar: see anything blademasterbobo?
(04:39:49) Dock: I miss that
(04:39:57) Dragonene: Carrots are strikingly similar to Parrots.
(04:39:59) konjak: I am allergic to most raw vegetables :D
(04:40:02) BlademasterBobo: esquar: It just pops a white box up for the pay ones
(04:40:05) konjak: And all fruits and some berries :D :D
(04:40:09) BlademasterBobo: when I press play
(04:40:10) lansing: do not try to eat six parrots a day
(04:40:22) Dragonene: Yeah, try not to get them mixed up.
(04:40:26) Dragonene: Raw parrots aren't quite as good.
(04:40:38) Esquar: well I'm telling you, if you can get a registration, that link will do the trick
(04:40:45) BlademasterBobo: but
(04:40:49) BlademasterBobo: you can't register without a pass
(04:40:50) Gravious: lansing: yeah, i'm not around as much nowadays
(04:40:50) BlademasterBobo: :L
(04:40:51) Dock: konjak, seriously, don't bother with that tech
(04:40:56) Esquar: you can
(04:41:03) BlademasterBobo: where
(04:41:03) BlademasterBobo: haha
(04:41:07) Dock: save it for objects that it works on, like robots and such
(04:41:11) konjak: dock, will you forever hate me if I don't get back to Solar Plexus
(04:41:16) konjak: I know that game is your life
(04:41:24) Dock: it would be a shame 
(04:41:27) BlademasterBobo: :C
(04:41:30) BlademasterBobo: :'C
(04:41:37) Dock: I think you should bring on a partner to boss around and make him finish it 
(04:41:47) Dock: find some kid to abuse on the MMF2 forums
(04:41:48) konjak: With MMF code?
(04:41:52) BlademasterBobo: xerus
(04:41:56) Dock: haha
(04:42:14) konjak: Those "kids" don't know much. The people who did have moved on to greener pastures
(04:42:24) konjak: Because when you know stuff you realise the limitations
(04:42:26) BlademasterBobo: maybe you should get a programmer
(04:42:35) BlademasterBobo: and then just move everything over to a real thing
(04:42:38) konjak: But then I'm remaking the game anyway
(04:42:43) BlademasterBobo: not really
(04:42:52) BlademasterBobo: it wouldn't be hard to have mmf output the levels to some sort of file
(04:42:55) BlademasterBobo: and so on
(04:43:32) Dock: seriously, would it be so hard to get help on mmf2?
(04:43:38) Dock: lots of people would be glad to work with you

(04:43:48) BlademasterBobo: hahah
(04:43:49) jstickeur [nnscript@p4FD58105.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] entered the room.
(04:43:57) konjak: I don't... want... to make the game.
(04:44:01) konjak: okay
(04:44:13) Dock: then kill it
(04:44:20) BlademasterBobo: I think it's already dead
(04:44:32) Dock: recycle the mechanic for another game if you ever feel like it 
(04:44:39) Dock: but yeah, no point in working on it
(04:44:43) Dragonene: what's the mechanic
(04:44:51) konjak: it's not that amazing, really
(04:44:52) Dock: some puzzle block swapping stuff
(04:45:15) Dock: like Solomon's Key meets, um... something more restrictive
(04:45:20) konjak: You move blocks into predetermined slots and some blocks have special features
(04:45:24) konjak: ¨coupled with platforming
(04:45:27) Dock: yeah
(04:45:29) Dragonene: oh, okay.
(04:45:50) Dock: so what are you going to make ?
(04:45:56) Dock: are you going toenter igf?
(04:45:56) Dragonene: That's kind of how I feel about my puzzle-block-platformer thingy as well.
(04:45:59) konjak: I. don't.know.
(04:46:01) Dragonene: Perhaps it's how that genre works.
(04:46:02) jsticker left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:46:10) konjak: I keep telling myself whatever I start isn't good enough :D
(04:46:18) Dragonene: I didn't really get anywhere tho
(04:47:16) Dragonene: What happened to that Snapshot game that was all the hype a while back
(04:47:22) Dock: konjak, why not make noitu love 3? 
(04:47:28) Dragonene: The one Dock didn't like
(04:47:42) konjak: I think he's making a new version of it
(04:47:42) Dock: talk to Nifflas or something? would they be interested?
(04:47:56) BlademasterBobo: konjak
(04:47:58) BlademasterBobo: why not
(04:47:59) BlademasterBobo: make
(04:48:00) konjak: bobo
(04:48:10) Dock: they obviously have a MMF2 to Wii pipeline

(04:50:33) Dragonene: minutes*
(04:50:41) Dragonene: I'm going to try a quick poll again
(04:50:59) Dragonene: If I elaborated on / extended the gameplay in pixeloids, what sort of features might make it better?
(04:52:12) Arne: panties

(07:12:40) Jr: yes
(07:12:40) jstickeur: What do you write about?
(07:12:59) Jr:  It is impossible to avoid conflict: it is human nature to be selfish, and personal selfishness is contrary to the nature of a society. The very idea of self-preservation, the idea that one's own life is more important than anything else is the most basic of philosophic musings. Selflessness is an artifact of the society we live in.
(07:13:01) Jr: basically
(07:13:11) jstickeur: Oh crap :D

(07:14:37) Jr: yes
(07:15:10) Kyou: lo tigs
(07:15:13) Kyou is now known as Bigger
(07:15:15) jstickeur: Hello today
(07:15:19) jstickeur: Oh, bigger
(07:15:22) Notch: hey bigger
(07:15:26) Bigger: whoops
(07:15:33) C418: idiotic me
(07:15:36) C418: I deleted a project
(07:15:44) C418: ...luckily I rendered the newest version
(07:15:45) Bigger: hello notch, hello c418
(07:16:17) C418: now is the question
(07:16:27) C418: should I rebuild it from the rendering or should I just move on...
(07:16:41) Bigger: it depends how much you like it
(07:16:57) C418: it is more for a game ._.
(07:17:02) C418: I kinda like it
(07:17:22) Bigger: then you compare that with the effort you put into it and the effort of rebuilding vs the effort of letting go
(07:17:36) KareemK: allo
(07:19:02) jstickeur: hi kareems
(07:19:08) jstickeur: Got any news on the visum?
(07:19:19) Bigger: hi kareem
(07:19:26) KareemK: no
(07:19:32) KareemK: next wed
(07:19:38) KareemK: most probably
(07:19:48) jstickeur: Hope it'll work
(07:20:01) Jr: I hope it does too
(07:20:35) FinDude: hai notch
(07:20:47) Notch: hi FinDude
(07:21:21) FinDude: if its impossible to let liquids pass trough blocks, make the look a bit more liquid-blocking
(07:21:34) FinDude: the blocks*
(07:21:53) Dragonmaw: hey js
(07:21:57) Dragonmaw: GTA2 for freefriday
(07:21:59) Dragonmaw: y/n?
(07:22:25) jstickeur: Why not, right?
(07:22:32) Notch: FinDude: How can I make a half-tile block look like it would block liquid?
(07:22:41) KareemK: http://moblin.org/documentation/moblin-netbook-intro vid .. pretty badass
(07:22:51) jstickeur: I think now's a good time to write about it again, actually, Dragonmaw
(07:23:15) jstickeur: It's been a good enough time since it was released for free, it's still a good game, you can refer to chinatown wars too
(07:26:05) C418: moblin seems nice
(07:28:22) jstickeur: I'm super tired
(07:28:31) KareemK: yea, i'd use it if i had a netbook
(07:28:37) jstickeur: Could instantly fall asleep, but it's just half past one
(07:28:43) C418: back to minecraft!
(07:31:20) C418: I think I'll leave this song as it is
(07:31:30) C418: rebuilding it takes too much time now
(07:32:05) SlayerXL: is saving in yet?
(07:32:16) C418: I have no idea
(07:32:21) Jr: argh
(07:32:32) SlayerXL: notch: what's this about liquid passing through blocks?
(07:32:34) Jr: I underestimated how hard it was going to be to wrap this all up
(07:33:16) mewse: I vote for wire mesh blocks, Notch.
(07:33:31) mewse: Diagonal hatching.
(07:33:48) Notch: ooh
(07:36:21) Cludney [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(07:36:35) Drakkar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:36:51) Notch: SlayerXL: Well, liquid is a tile type. Blocks are a tile type. Each block has 8 bits of data, for maximum not-being-big-in-memory-and-on-disk-ness
(07:37:09) Notch: "blocks are a tile type"? That's nonsense, sorry, haha
(07:37:44) Notch: i COULD add one byte of data per block, that could contain two bits of "liquid type", which would be none, water, lava or oil
(07:37:59) Notch: leaving me with six bits of fancy stuff like block shape
(07:38:15) Notch: but then the level size is suddenly twice as big
(07:38:47) mewse: I've worked out that just my basic terrain by itself is going to use about 24 megabytes on disc.
(07:38:59) mewse: Per saved game.
(07:39:02) Movius: on disc it can be compressed
(07:39:03) Movius: easily
(07:39:20) Movius: you'd only worry about level size in memory
(07:40:04) Notch: one level is 4 mb uncompressed now. The huge one is 16 mb
(07:40:10) Notch: they compress really well at the moment
(07:40:20) Notch: but then again, I only have like eight tile types
(07:40:31) mewse: I imagine that yours would RLE encode a real treat, Notch.
(07:40:57) Notch: yeah. I gzip it with the built in stuff in java
(07:41:09) mewse: "RLE encode" is annoying, and I'm annoyed that I typed it.  It's as bad as "PIN number" and "ATM machine".
(07:41:24) Notch: or TV vision
(07:41:29) Notch: (wait..)
(07:41:47) Notch: damn, I say rle encode all the time.. you're right, though
(07:42:11) Ina_ [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(07:44:13) mezo left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(07:45:02) Xander [chatzilla@5ad7f8f2.bb.sky.com] entered the room.
(07:45:10) Bigger: whoo boy, I just cleared up 18gb of space on my D: drive
(07:45:21) Ina_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:45:30) Notch: you deleted a single microsoft help file?
(07:45:36) Notch: (badum tish)
(07:45:49) Notch: (because they have big files)
(07:46:22) Ina_ [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(07:48:12) Don_Andy: oh darn I completely forgot I logged into here again
(07:52:56) kevglass [avatar@rhubarb.custard.org] entered the room.
(07:53:03) kevglass: lo
(07:53:30) Bigger: hey kevglass
(07:54:03) Notch: kevkev
(07:55:21) Jr: DONE
(07:55:21) Jr: DONE DONE DONE
(07:55:24) Jr: YEAH
(07:55:30) Notch: grats =D
(07:55:39) Jr: and juuust at the page limit too
(07:56:00) Notch: upper or lower?
(07:56:34) ***kevglass yawneth.
(07:56:42) doohan: C418, I'm enjoying your album, quite relaxing.
(07:56:49) C418: =)
(07:57:04) Notch: new album?
(07:57:06) doohan: Thanks for sharing :)
(07:57:33) ***doohan is only on track 3 so far
(07:57:37) C418: nah, not new
(07:58:25) C418: ah notch, I lost the project of the first song. but I rendered the newest version, which is practically final... rebuilding the set would take too much time
(07:58:33) slv [potatofarm@pool-71-174-186-68.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(07:59:41) Notch: ah. If you're happy with it, there's no problem, I guess. =)
(07:59:46) Notch: but losing sources sucks
(08:00:28) C418: yeah, I can rebuild it, it just could take time
(08:02:44) C418: but yes, I'm quite happy with it :D
(08:02:52) C418: uh, uploadan
(08:03:03) Notch: huh?
(08:03:28) C418: well, I did a few polish changes
(08:03:36) Notch: ah
(08:03:57) Notch: am I a bad person for liking Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas?
(08:04:11) doohan: Yes :(
(08:04:32) C418: I don't have anything bad to say against that song
(08:04:34) C418: just
(08:04:35) varmint [varmint@S0106001195539758.vs.shawcable.net] entered the room.
(08:04:40) C418: autotune overuse, stop being popular
(08:05:12) Notch: I should be listening to ?-Ziq, but this keeps nagging me to listen to it
(08:05:17) Notch: this, and rap chop
(08:05:17) Xander: The new Bionic Commando has an asston of load times
(08:05:29) Don_Andy: autotune is that thing that makes your voice all roboty right?
(08:05:30) C418: µ-zig =D
(08:05:31) jstickeur: TF2 is actually a pretty bad game
(08:05:32) Movius: which one
(08:05:37) C418: minus g plus q of course
(08:05:39) jstickeur: It's been completely ruined
(08:05:40) Movius: the the 2d platformer?
(08:05:56) C418: autotune. also know as cher-effect
(08:06:01) Notch: haha
(08:06:03) Bigger: autotune is
(08:06:05) Notch: yeah
(08:06:06) Bigger: autotune
(08:06:15) Xander: No, the 3D weird one
(08:06:19) Don_Andy: autotune is people
(08:06:23) Movius: ah
(08:06:30) Xander: It's actually pretty fun, definitely not as good as the original or its remake
(08:06:42) Movius: the remake has bad loadtimes too
(08:06:47) Xander: but good god does it have a lot of load times. Some levels have a whole 7 bad guys and then a load screen
(08:06:53) Don_Andy: so it's not that good but not broken either?
(08:07:00) Don_Andy: that is enough for me to give it a go
(08:07:27) Don_Andy: I have a flashback to Sonic 360 loading times now
(08:07:28) Xander: It's a decent enough rental. It's fine, and the 3D grappling stuff hasn't been tough to get to grips (groand) with
(08:07:47) Xander: eugh.. that game..
(08:07:56) Xander: How the hell did I finish it with everyone...
(08:08:13) Don_Andy: I didn't manage the last level with the eyes all around that kill you instantly
(08:08:38) Don_Andy: my patience was a bit thin by then
(08:08:47) Don_Andy: overall I liked it though
(08:09:26) Xander: Oddly I actually felt better with it after finishing it
(08:10:16) Xander: For the most part I really wasn't enjoying it but I was still kind of glad I finished it. Mostly because final bosses in the 3D sonic games are usually pretty epic for no apparent reason
(08:10:31) doohan: C418, phleps is a pretty good track
(08:10:35) Xander: Everyone powers up, the best track in the game plays and it all gets awesome. Which didn't happen in Sonic Unleashed weirdly
(08:10:42) C418: :)
(08:10:56) Don_Andy: LIVE AND LEARN
(08:11:03) kevglass left the room.
(08:11:53) Xander: Damn right, that was one of my favourite gaming moments on the Dreamcast. Bearing in mind I was damn young then.
(08:12:12) Xander: Also this loading bollocks with BC also comes off of the game having another mandatory install
(08:13:10) doohan: If you're going to have to install games you might as well have a pc
(08:13:17) Don_Andy: if the next-gen consoles makes us install the games they should at least not require the disk anymore :T
(08:13:35) doohan: Well maybe that's the idea though, to move to full online distribution
(08:13:50) Don_Andy: I have some terribly scratched 360 games which install fine but still fails to play it because of disk read errors
(08:13:57) doohan: More monies for sony, ms and nintendo without the middle man
(08:14:04) doohan: And no buying 2nd hand copies
(08:14:54) Xander: heh
(08:15:17) doohan: I guess rentals would die off too
(08:15:30) Xander: And at least with DVD size games people already do download massive things onto their hardrives
(08:15:41) doohan: Yeah, steam games are pretty big
(08:15:52) doohan: 2-4 gig for most of them
(08:15:57) Don_Andy: I do not dare to think of Bluray games being digitally distributed
(08:16:08) Don_Andy: I mean the ones that actually use the majority of the disk
(08:16:15) doohan: Are there any?
(08:16:23) Don_Andy: I think MGS4 is pretty close
(08:16:55) Don_Andy: I've seen a dump of Lair that was pretty big too
(08:17:10) Don_Andy: but that could just've been padding or something like that
(08:17:17) C418: mgs4 uses more than 30 gigs
(08:17:36) doohan: Is that mostly cutscenes or actually stuff for the game?
(08:17:48) Bezzy [aubrey.hes@82.108.138.49] entered the room.
(08:17:58) Xander: Allegedly it uses the entire 50GB double-layer thing even after they tried to compress things
(08:17:59) C418: well, in the middle part there is a... very long scene
(08:18:01) Don_Andy: I don't think the cutscenes are pre-rendered or are they?
(08:18:02) C418: maybe 15 minutes
(08:18:05) C418: it's prerendered
(08:18:12) Don_Andy: ah, I see
(08:18:13) C418: but in such a good conversion so the player doesn't know it
(08:18:23) C418: in 720p also
(08:18:35) C418: and I think most of the voices are uncompressed
(08:18:36) pekuja: C418: a very long scene? I thought the final cutscene was 45 minutes long
(08:18:40) C418: music too
(08:18:45) C418: well, isn't 15 minutes long too?
(08:18:50) C418: the final isn't rendered
(08:18:53) pekuja: well, 15 minutes is also long
(08:18:54) pekuja: ok
(08:19:07) doohan: See, I don't really get bluray and stuff, my glasses aren't great and my speakers suck :)
(08:19:16) C418: :D
(08:19:18) jstickeur: I don't remember prerendered movies in MGS4
(08:19:24) C418: you see?
(08:19:27) C418: you didn't even notice
(08:19:30) jstickeur: Also, a 1080p movie is just 10 gb
(08:19:38) jstickeur: Well, how about you tell me the scene
(08:19:45) C418: the boat scene
(08:19:57) jstickeur: What makes you think it's prerendered?
(08:20:05) C418: you can't zoom in
(08:20:12) C418: easy, eh? :D
(08:20:23) jstickeur: Actually no
(08:20:26) Notch: that one is prerendered!?
(08:20:33) C418: there are some small compression signs
(08:20:34) Notch: there's live action stuff, though. The eggs.
(08:20:37) Xander: hah, apparently so. You can't zoom in..
(08:20:52) Notch: they fooled me. =) I was impressed and stunned
(08:20:54) C418: you can zoom in everywhere
(08:20:56) C418: in every single scene
(08:20:58) C418: but this one
(08:21:04) Notch: (and the eggs!)
(08:21:07) Notch: (can't zoom on the eggs)
(08:21:13) C418: oh yeah
(08:21:18) C418: but they're obviously live action
(08:21:38) C418: because they didn't invent egg physics
(08:21:45) doohan: Eggs?
(08:21:53) Xander: haha, or the batshit insane intro thing
(08:22:35) Notch: well, then again, I don't know of too many double-yolked eggs..
(08:22:37) Don_Andy: is MSG4 actually good as just a game?
(08:22:46) Notch: and didn't one of the eggs split or something?
(08:22:50) Don_Andy: because I don't think I'd ever be able to understand the story
(08:23:00) C418: even good as just a game
(08:23:01) Notch: Don_Andy: I liked it. It's very tight
(08:23:21) jstickeur: what the heck, tight
(08:23:26) Don_Andy: I will have to give it a go sometime then
(08:23:27) Notch: you can run through it without doing half the stuff you can do
(08:23:29) jstickeur: explain what this word means in the context of a game
(08:23:46) Notch: jstickeur: Small areas, much to do, once you move on, it's gone
(08:23:52) jstickeur: I see
(08:24:08) Notch: opposite of "open", I guess. =)
(08:24:21) Don_Andy: I tried playing Snake Eater once but I wasn't really able to pull the sneaking thing off
(08:24:22) Bigger: or loose
(08:24:29) jstickeur: But yeah, game is fun, too easy on normal mode though
(08:24:52) jstickeur: Not touched it in 8 months though
(08:24:54) Xander: MGS4 is styled in a pretty awesome way that it makes stealth easier but also actual combat much more fun
(08:24:57) jstickeur: Maybe more
(08:24:58) Notch: the game is kind of loose, I think. You can attack many problems in many different ways. But the levels are generally fairly small without too much fluff
(08:25:15) jstickeur: It is fun to load a level again and again
(08:25:18) jstickeur: and dick around
(08:25:30) Don_Andy: I hate when you are moving in for a kill and JUST in that moment the guy turns around and you're in the middle of a gunfight
(08:25:34) jstickeur: especially once you played through it
(08:25:39) jstickeur: and get those emotion bullets
(08:25:40) jstickeur: 8)
(08:25:41) Don_Andy: generally in stealth games
(08:25:45) Notch: i tranqued all the bosses on my first run =D
(08:25:55) Notch: haha yeah =D
(08:26:05) Don_Andy: is it so hard to snap someones neck from the front
(08:26:07) C418: I still have to tranq' them
(08:26:12) Xander: Haha, I remember my first encounter with a 2nd form of the B&B fight
(08:26:16) Notch: i love the photoshoot easteregg
(08:26:19) Xander: I didn't know what to do
(08:26:21) Xander: So.. RPG
(08:26:31) Notch: haha
(08:26:47) Xander: After that killed it in one hit I realised that probably wasn't the idea I should've gone for
(08:26:56) jstickeur: I like the jpop on the ipod
(08:27:18) Xander: I wish there was a way to make every soldier in the game do that dance
(08:27:35) Don_Andy: does MGS4 have these fourth wall-breaking gimmicks like pyscho mantis or this sniper dude who dies when you wait long enough too?
(08:27:36) jstickeur: otacon's dance?
(08:27:51) Xander: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8060082.stm - Discs that store 1.6TB. That'd keep Kojima happy
(08:27:55) Xander: Otacon did a dance?
(08:28:00) jstickeur: you can use the sixaxis pad to juggle boobs, Don_Andy
(08:28:07) jstickeur: Xander, play jpop, contact otacon
(08:28:09) Don_Andy: that sounds good enough
(08:28:33) Xander: haha, really? Dammit.I've played that game some 3 times through now and there's another thing I never knew
(08:29:07) Xander: I knew that sunny did the dance and the photoshoot likewise, but Otacon too? haha.. I'll have to have a play around later
(08:29:24) Xander: It's the gift that keeps on giving
(08:29:40) Xander: I'm playing through recently with the integral podcasts on
(08:30:23) Xander: Just to see if they mention anything amazing, like I had no idea there were vents you could crawl through during the hotel in act 1
(08:31:04) jstickeur: :O
(08:31:23) jstickeur: How' mgo, Xander?
(08:31:32) jstickeur: I enjoyed it at first but then it kinda sucked and I stopped
(08:31:40) jstickeur: The Snake game modes were good though
(08:31:56) Bezzy: I'm really tired so i'm just going to say two words: Dark Rain.
(08:31:59) Xander: It's tough. I'm enjoying it a lot more when I'm not playing it like any other multiplayer shooter
(08:32:02) Bezzy: (and also LOL)
(08:32:12) jstickeur: Bezzy, elaborate :<
(08:32:13) Xander: Just sneaking around and being a dick
(08:32:20) Xander: Dark Rain or Heavy Rain?
(08:32:23) jstickeur: Xander, we should play a match
(08:32:32) Movius: Heavy Rain will never be finished
(08:32:32) jstickeur: You could own me and we'd laugh and have fun
(08:32:41) Xander: Heh, that'd be awesome. Though I don't have a mic or anything
(08:33:03) jstickeur: I don't mind
(08:33:04) Xander: I wonder if the Red Faction MP demo is working yet..
(08:33:19) jstickeur: They just released it for europe, didn't they
(08:33:24) Bezzy: the david cage one
(08:33:27) Bezzy: lol
(08:33:31) Bezzy: lol lol lol
(08:33:37) C418: lolololololol
(08:33:43) jstickeur: Bezzy, at least paste a link or something :(
(08:33:46) Xander: Yeah, the 360 version works fine and the PS3 one.. doesn't do anything
(08:33:49) Xander: At least I don't think it did
(08:33:50) Bezzy: i saw it over someone's shoulder
(08:33:55) jstickeur: oh
(08:34:07) jstickeur: lol as in "ohshit this gonna change everything" or just "LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
(08:34:08) jstickeur: "
(08:34:32) Xander: They really need to do something with the ideas from Nomad Soul
(08:34:51) Bezzy: ohshit this is gonna change everything in 1984 except it didn't then, and it won't now
(08:34:59) Xander: I love the way they worked in the consequences of death. That was awesome..
(08:35:00) jstickeur: heh Bezzy
(08:36:38) MisterX [MisterX@p5DDE663C.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(08:36:54) SlayerXL: Let's all play Oblivion Quest.
(08:37:00) SlayerXL: >>You find yourself in a dark room. There are no obvious exits.
(08:37:06) KareemK: Purple rain.. purple raaiiaiin
(08:37:10) Don_Andy: SCREAM WILDLY

(08:38:00) Xander: Beat Head Against Wall
(08:38:03) SlayerXL: >>You know niether more nor less about your current situation
(08:38:15) SlayerXL: >>You beat your head against the wall. It hurts.
(08:38:15) Nightro left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(08:38:27) jstickeur: from the eg.net preview, cage sounds a fucker deeply in need of a giant hit to the face
(08:38:32) Don_Andy: Beat harder
(08:38:33) jstickeur: +like
(08:38:45) SlayerXL: >>You beat your head harder. You now know less about your current situation.
(08:38:46) jstickeur: I know I'd have slapped him if he pulled that shit off in front of me
(08:38:59) jstickeur: There's limits to being an obnoxious cocksucker
(08:39:18) RinkuHero: cage who
(08:39:30) SlayerXL: >>A warm liquid trickles down the side of your head.
(08:39:38) jstickeur: david cage of quantic dreams
(08:39:47) jstickeur: the dudes who make Heavy Rain, the ps3 exclusive
(08:39:50) Don_Andy: taste liquid
(08:40:05) smn`offline is now known as smn
(08:40:16) SlayerXL: >>You taste the liquid. It is midly salty and not entirely unpleasant. You suspect it to be blood.
(08:40:48) SlayerXL: >>A headache becomes you.
(08:40:54) Don_Andy: smear SOS on the wall with liquid
(08:41:14) SlayerXL: >>You attempt to smear SOS on the wall, but since it's so dark, your writing is terrible.

(08:42:33) Movius: the counter on the next kojima game teaser is back up over 100
(08:42:40) Movius: and flashes a 3 instead of an S
(08:42:43) Bezzy: i feel sorry for people so story starved that they feel they have to laud indigo prophecy as a great story.
(08:42:52) Movius: oooo 3 & an s
(08:42:56) Xander: Wait... a 3?
(08:43:22) Movius: and an E and a g
(08:43:27) Movius: http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro/next/index.html
(08:43:29) Bezzy: it's alright in the first half, and then it turns into an insane blathering mess.
(08:43:37) Movius: and the rain is heavier
(08:43:44) SlayerXL: >>Having lost much blood, you pass out on the floor of the dark room.
(08:43:48) Movius: here I was thinking it was Project S
(08:43:53) jstickeur: Yeah Bezzy
(08:44:03) SlayerXL: >>You wake up some time later in a dark room. There are no obvious exits.
(08:44:09) jstickeur: IP showed promise, but raped all its potential
(08:45:10) Don_Andy: open hidden door
(08:45:20) SlayerXL: >>You cannot find the hidden door, as it is hidden.
(08:45:25) Hachi-Roku [hdsakhjlas@c-76-31-99-98.hsd1.tx.comcast.net] entered the room.
(08:45:50) jstickeur: It flashes a 5 or an S for me too, Movius
(08:46:02) Movius: the letter changes
(08:46:17) Xander: I was hoping it'd be a Project S too, but then Policenauts is almost translated so that's good enough
(08:46:19) Movius: theres S, E , 3 and lower case e or backwards G
(08:46:35) Xander: Maybe it'll be everything?
(08:46:39) jstickeur: haha
(08:46:45) jstickeur: They make every game possible
(08:46:45) Movius: friend and I theorised this is isolated country russia 
(08:46:46) SlayerXL: >>You hear a feint, high pitched buzz
(08:46:47) Xander: ZOE3, Project S AND MGS5: Raiden
(08:46:52) Movius: where the snatchers originated
(08:46:55) SlayerXL: >>Wait, nevermind, that's concussion
(08:47:16) Bezzy: "fahrenheit has story bending technology! Other games do not have this. I think. I haven't actually played many games. The ones I played, I thought they weren't enough like movies. Which is the point, after all"
(08:47:28) jstickeur: heh
(08:47:33) jstickeur: "story bending"
(08:47:40) jstickeur: It was very very linear
(08:47:47) Bezzy: you can choose from some choices!
(08:47:47) Movius: Fahrenheit had a terrible story
(08:47:52) jstickeur: deus ex was story bending
(08:47:53) Movius: and terrible characters
(08:48:03) Bezzy: not like OTHER games, which will rape your hand
(08:48:13) Don_Andy: Sit on floor and wait for something to happen
(08:48:23) SlayerXL: >>You die.
(08:48:23) jstickeur: not that everything sucked about Fahrenheit, though
(08:48:25) Xander: Fahrenheit was good until it all went horribly idiotic at the end
(08:48:25) jstickeur: I liked it
(08:48:30) jstickeur: Yeah, Xander
(08:48:33) InaVegt [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(08:48:35) Movius: it was fun til the giant bugs arrived
(08:48:38) Bezzy: play simon while shit happens in the background, but you can't really tell what because you're playing simon
(08:48:40) SlayerXL: >>Game Over. Restart|Quit
(08:49:08) Movius: you get bored looking through newspapers. THE WORLD ENDS GAME OVER!
(08:49:16) Bezzy: if its main game mechanic wasn't QTEs, it might be interesting.
(08:49:36) jstickeur: but but but but REACTION TESTS are gamey
(08:49:45) Xander: I sodding hate QTE's now
(08:49:46) Movius: I like quick time events
(08:49:52) Movius: RE4 is the greatest game ever
(08:50:00) SlayerXL: I bet Kojima is making STALKER
(08:50:03) jstickeur: You just dismiss the QTEs because you don't like them, Bezzy
(08:50:07) jstickeur: That's not fair
(08:50:26) Ina_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(08:50:57) Bezzy: oh, sorry :)
(08:50:57) jstickeur: I thought we were setting up stupid arguments
(08:51:00) SlayerXL: QTE?

(08:51:59) PiratePoo: quick time events

(08:52:15) jstickeur: oh man, Bezzy,that's gonna be on mags all over the world in a minute
(08:52:17) SlayerXL: I hate quick time.

(08:52:50) SlayerXL: they should call them Reflexive Button Presses
(08:53:08) Xander: Bionic Commando 3D. A questionable travle experience
(08:53:13) SlayerXL: if you hate QTEs, don't play Piglet's Big Game.
(08:53:13) KareemK: "but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."

(08:54:25) Bezzy: in the future, quick time events will load, and immediately tell you there's a new version available, and that you should upgrade to pro
(08:54:38) jstickeur: hahaha
(08:54:39) KareemK: hah hah haaa
(08:54:40) KareemK: :P
(08:54:54) Bezzy: oh man, that was embarassing
(08:55:05) SlayerXL: :S
(08:55:12) Bigger: ZIIIIIIIING
(08:55:16) Bezzy: so, i just overheard the new testers saying "fahrenheit is a great game. You should try it"
(08:55:21) jstickeur: yeah, better tell stuff about the game you work on
(08:55:28) SlayerXL: fahrenheit?
(08:55:31) jstickeur: what's going on at your place, Bezzy?
(08:55:37) KareemK: its top secret
(08:55:45) jstickeur: Got a bunch of game testers flown in?
(08:55:56) Bezzy: and i have two monitors on big articulated arm things, and I pulled them apart in order to face the guys who were talking, and tell them "no. you are fucking idiots. shut up"
(08:56:14) jstickeur: No you didn't
(08:56:16) Bezzy: and when i pulled the monitors apart, the left one knocked over my ps3 devkit
(08:56:20) jstickeur: haha
(08:56:26) jstickeur: Another headline
(08:56:32) jstickeur: Splash Damage working on PS3 game

(08:58:26) KareemK: SS?
(08:58:32) fartron: next to enter?
(08:58:35) jstickeur: Paragraph, used in legal texts, KareemK
(08:58:37) fartron: that's where my ' and " are
(08:58:46) KareemK: oh right
(08:58:53) jstickeur: My " is shift+2, the ' is shift+#
(08:58:53) Bezzy: Splash Station Play Damage 
(08:58:55) KareemK: i recall it from the invitation thingy
(08:58:55) fartron: wait isn't that another way to write the double S in german?
(08:59:02) jstickeur: Nope
(08:59:05) fartron: oh
(08:59:05) KareemK: not that one is like B
(08:59:07) jstickeur: There's no other way :|
(08:59:15) fartron: yeah i know there's the funny B too
(08:59:16) jstickeur: We only have ?
(08:59:31) Bezzy: i am english, but i use american layout because shift ' = " makes sense.
(08:59:31) SlayerXL: I love the Splash Station Play Damage. A great system.
(08:59:49) fartron: is it the other way around on british keyboards bez?
(08:59:56) KareemK: i once had a logitech german keyboard
(08:59:58) KareemK: hated it

(09:00:10) KareemK: all the keys where in the wrong places
(09:00:17) fartron: where is your @ symbol?
(09:00:28) InaVegt [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(09:00:40) Xander: Two right from ENTER in the middle

(09:04:49) KareemK: its always morally wrong to troll
(09:04:51) KareemK: but amusing
(09:04:56) KareemK: because forums are fucking boring
(09:05:04) Movius: ok, just making sure
(09:05:05) KareemK: i mean every post on that thread is TLDR for me

(09:06:01) Bezzy: only problem is, no pound sign :(
(09:06:11) Bezzy: oh
(09:06:26) Bezzy: the @ symbol on the uk keyboard is on the same key as '
(09:06:30) Don_Andy: I have absolutely no idea how to do a pound sign on german layout
(09:06:30) jstickeur: How would you troll, Movius?
(09:06:32) Bezzy: so it's a straight swap
(09:06:41) KareemK: who needs a pound sign rly
(09:06:46) Bezzy: but you lose pound, which becomes # (shift 3)
(09:06:54) KareemK: i use USD instead of $ most of the time
(09:06:55) Bezzy: accountants mainly.
(09:07:00) Movius: I would promote my love of the delicious taste of coca cola (tm)
(09:07:09) Bezzy: good tip kareem!
(09:07:46) Don_Andy: pound is essentially GBP right?
(09:08:17) KareemK: yea
(09:08:29) jstickeur: A pound is 0.5 kg
(09:09:27) OEP: howdy
(09:09:33) SlayerXL: the resolution of forums is way too low, as is the frame rate
(09:09:54) Bezzy: 16 ounces on a pound. 14 pounds in a stone. 12 inches in a foot. 3 feet in a yard. 1760 yards in a mile. It's fucking OBVIOUS and you people are dumb.

(09:10:49) Don_Andy: I think they should introduce achievements

(09:13:05) SlayerXL: it had the only unlockable weapon system that made any sense
(09:13:27) KareemK: but yea its a very hardcore game, tough learning curve
(09:13:58) KareemK: and very bitchy on aiming too

(09:18:49) KareemK: yea, it decreases the funfactor of the game
(09:19:01) Bezzy: especially for basic interactions with thigns
(09:19:14) Bezzy: could be way more forgiving, yeah.
(09:19:57) Bezzy: that learning curve basically forced it to be hardcore-only. Only the hardcore can put up with hostile interfaces.

(09:24:12) Bezzy: I agree arne
(09:24:33) Stargoat: hmm
(09:24:36) Bezzy: people conflate "accessible" with "shallow" far too often for my liking.

(09:24:46) Stargoat: are you not in windows?
(09:24:54) Stargoat: also, any new features today, notch?
(09:24:56) Bezzy: and confuse inaccessibility for depth all the time.
(09:25:07) Notch: Stargoat: Yes, level saving/loading, level sharing
(09:25:15) Stargoat: OOOOOOOHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTT
(09:25:18) Bigger: the harder the controls are the longer it takes to discover all the game's elements
(09:25:22) Stargoat: that's a big plus.
(09:25:23) Bigger: the more depth it has
(09:25:30) Stargoat: will levels made today work "tomorrow"?
(09:25:35) Bezzy: inaccessibility can act a bit like a veil of noise ontop of what could, at its core, be a really simple game mechanic
(09:25:43) Arne: if a designer decreases depth in favour of accessibility he might be incompetent or guided by Satan
(09:25:53) Bezzy: haha
(09:25:59) KareemK: etqw is not a deep game i guess
(09:26:08) KareemK: i mean its well designed and all
(09:26:12) Stargoat: Arne: You should send an email to Ken Levine saying just that.
(09:26:16) Bezzy: etqw is multifaceted, for sure.
(09:26:31) Bezzy: i don't know how deep it really is. haven't played it too much.
(09:26:32) Arne: Will Wright too, perhaps
(09:26:46) Stargoat: yes, perhaps
(09:26:52) Stargoat: but Sim City does have a lot of tasty depth
(09:26:56) Arne: incidently, Will Wright works under the guidance of EA
(09:26:58) KareemK: but it has no story for one.
(09:27:30) Stargoat: KareemK: There may not be a narrative, but there's surely exposition. The story development is on a game-by-game basis.
(09:28:09) KareemK: perhaps
(09:28:10) Arne: I like the first Sim City
(09:28:25) Stargoat: I enjoyed 3000 the most.
(09:28:30) Stargoat: I never played sim city 4
(09:28:35) Arne: I never played the others much
(09:28:43) Bezzy: see, system shock 2 is one of those games where i almost feel like inaccessibility HAS added something, if unintentionally. modern games, you don't have to play inventory tetris, because they figure it out for you (it's a straightforward thing), but the systems were taken on by players, who created their own amusement with them... started sorting things into nice groups to make their own accessibility a bit faster.
(09:29:01) Stargoat: inventory tetris is fun!
(09:29:05) Bezzy: yeah!
(09:29:20) Stargoat: JA2 1.31 has quitea complex inventory system
(09:29:32) Bezzy: i have to wonder, though... if inventory tetris is the most fun thing about your game... um... that might be an issue
(09:29:34) Stargoat: based on what types of backs/pouches/belts/rigs etc. you're wearing
(09:29:39) Arne: hehe
(09:29:44) Stargoat: 1.13*
(09:29:49) Stargoat: packs*
(09:29:50) Stargoat: ack
(09:29:52) Stargoat: typing failure
(09:29:58) Arne: *penis, you meant to say penis
(09:29:58) Bezzy: yeah, the worst/best thing about men of war is how inventories are used
(09:30:07) Stargoat: men of war?
(09:30:23) Bezzy: to plant a bomb on a tank, you have to open your inventory, open their inventory, and then place a bomb in their inventory.
(09:30:34) Stargoat: that's odd/
(09:30:40) paul|not: what
(09:30:42) Bezzy: that's a lovely re-use of a system
(09:30:46) paul|not: is it realtime?
(09:30:47) Bezzy: fallout does it too
(09:30:51) Stargoat: yeah
(09:31:04) Bezzy: if you get a pick pocket screen, you can place a live mine in someone's inventory :)
(09:31:05) Bezzy: fun.
(09:31:20) Bezzy: paul it's time scalable and pausable rts
(09:31:29) Bezzy: and you can take direct control of units
(09:31:44) Bezzy: it's really good, but the interface, again, is not fantastic
(09:31:44) Stargoat: I think the cxomplexity of JA2 1.13's inventory system is a big plus. It makes the player's skill as a leader a game element, too.
(09:32:20) Stargoat: but it's not necessarily badly designed, it makes a lot of sense
(09:32:31) Stargoat: hmm.
(09:32:34) Stargoat: I really love that game.
(09:32:37) Stargoat: :(

(09:33:26) Arne: it's about scalability though, if a game has an inaccessible thing players must do, you can also add a more accessible version of it, or at least making the game playable without doing the inaccessible stuff
(09:34:00) Stargoat: Arne, you totally need to play JA2. I think you'd like it.
(09:34:06) Stargoat: especially if you liked x-com?
(09:34:10) Arne: I've been recommended it

(09:59:16) Dragonene: or turquoise
(09:59:19) Arne: the cyan and blue
(09:59:20) corpus: you need the background colour to be similar

(09:59:29) paul|not: that I can change kinda
(09:59:37) Arne: I'd use a bright gray BG and dark colors
(09:59:41) corpus: the blue kinda works against the dark BG
(09:59:46) paul|not: the cyan and blue are seperate highlighting

(09:59:55) Dragonene: I'd use a white background :P
(09:59:56) corpus: I mean the darker blue

(10:00:35) corpus: cyan*
(10:00:38) paul|not: I think if I change the darker BG color it might be better?
(10:00:45) paul|not: since hte lighter one is forum default

(10:00:55) paul|not: yep
(10:01:01) Dragonene: probably

(10:04:15) paul|not: doesn't seperate enough from the lighter one
(10:04:30) paul|not: or from the BG
(10:04:33) Dragonene: both reds are problematic
(10:04:37) Dragonene: the darker red is too low-contrast

(10:23:43) Bigger: but instead of eyes

(10:35:14) Dragonene: shinygerbil: shine some for me.
(10:35:15) Fraeon: shinygerbil, what was your gamurtagz again? :<
(10:35:25) Jr left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(10:35:32) Dragonene: damn, doohan, but that is one tricky palette
(10:35:38) Dragonene: the two grays are sort of compatible
(10:35:44) Dragonene: all the other colors clash for me :P
(10:36:00) Notch: Dragonene: something more simple than seeing your location displayed on the screen
(10:36:07) Notch: most games don't show your location
(10:37:04) Dragonene: huh, you just confused me
(10:37:11) Notch: =D
(10:37:14) Notch: I'm tired, sorry
(10:37:15) Dragonene: but I didn't say I particularly felt any need for it
(10:37:16) doohan: Dragonene, you let someone slightly colour blind pick your pallete and you'll end up with soemthing like that :P
(10:37:18) Dragonene: it was Stargoat's idea.
(10:37:33) slv left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(10:37:36) doohan: Notch, a mini map would be nice
(10:37:50) doohan: So don't get too lost underground
(10:37:55) Dragonene: doohan: green and blue work relatively well together too
(10:37:59) Stargoat: I'd just like a way to determine where I am, underground, when compared to, say, a water source
(10:38:03) Dragonene: there are a couple of pairs of colors that go well together
(10:38:05) doohan: Yeah the odd one is the reddy colour
(10:38:14) Dragonene: I just have a hard time finding three that go well together
(10:38:16) Notch: I think half the fun is now knowing what you're going to tunnel into =D
(10:38:17) doohan: But I put that in for soemthing different
(10:38:22) Dragonene: which I need for lighting
(10:38:26) fartronomicon: i agree
(10:38:26) doohan: green blue and dark grey
(10:38:29) Dragonene: (one background, too tones for lighting)
(10:38:29) fartronomicon: minecraft is old fashioned
(10:38:30) Notch: but a minimap is way more likely than straight up location presentation
(10:38:45) fartronomicon: would the minimap be centered on you
(10:38:48) fartronomicon: or show the whole area
(10:38:51) doohan: whole area
(10:39:03) doohan: And you need to be able to set waypoints
(10:39:05) Dragonene: Notch: it's the same thing :P
(10:39:09) doohan: Or tag places
(10:39:12) Dragonene: doohan: I guess. Dark blue is low-contrast against that gray tho
(10:39:13) doohan: Like your castle
(10:39:13) fartronomicon: i don't know
(10:39:17) Dragonene: almost same value, just saturation diff

(10:40:03) Dragonene: Notch: This is true.
(10:40:05) Notch: hi SimonTheDigger
(10:41:14) doohan: Dragonene,  that's cheating :P
(10:42:48) Xander: eugh, stupid Bionic Commando.. Massive Building and the objectives guy says you'll have to scale it. Which seems epic
(10:43:06) Xander: and then there's a loading screen and the next thing you know you're at the top. That's one hell of a missed opportunity

(10:52:37) Xander: It's definitely not bad
(10:52:54) Xander: It's decent enough so far, but not as good as the other bionic commando game which was made by the same people
(10:53:01) anosou: I'm not a fan of most action games but the swinging makes me want it
(10:53:14) anosou: Yeah, Swedish developers, since I live in Sweden there's been a lot of hype ;P

(10:54:21) eci [eci@dslb-088-066-038-253.pools.arcor-ip.net] entered the room.
(10:54:22) Xander: Swinging works fairly well, but there don't seem to be that many opportunities to use it
(10:54:23) anosou: Nah, it's what Klingons do when they die.
(10:54:27) anosou: Aww :(
(10:54:33) anosou: That was like my main attraction to that game.
(10:54:41) Xander: I mean you use it a lot, but never really in different ways
(10:54:45) anosou: Meh, I'll go back to playing Senko no Ronde and Virtual-On then..
(10:54:48) Bigger: but what does stovecore mean
(10:54:56) Bigger: who makes stovecore?
(10:55:01) haowan: it is art
(10:55:03) Xander: Like in Spiderman 2 where swinging well meant you had this huge city you could try to cross as fast as you wanted
(10:55:09) Bigger: what IS stovecore
(10:55:12) Bigger: are we stovecore?
(10:55:16) Bigger: if not, then who is?
(10:55:22) Bigger: can we truly be stovecore?
(10:55:33) Xander: Here you just have set areas where you can swing around in, but there's just not much freedom.
(10:55:44) Bigger: or is the stovecore an illusion, an unobtainable goal, only reachable through true enlightenment?
(10:55:45) anosou: That's a big miss imo
(10:56:06) jw: hey the gutter is coming out today guys
(10:56:08) Xander: Yeah, there's nothing bad about it but I can't help but think what should be different as I'm playing it, which is kind of sad
(10:56:21) anosou: because the whole swinging concept is so good in execution (I've heard) it's dumb not to use it more. It's like throwing away the potential of an awesome game for the sake of being linear
(10:56:38) Xander: what's the gutter? oh.. wait, I suddenly have an image of pixellated vomit
(10:56:54) anosou: Ah well. I shouldn't really judge, I like all JRPGs regardless of what the hell they do.
(10:57:31) Xander: Haha, same. I'm a sucker for JRPGs. The megaman one is the only JRPG I haven't at least sunk enough time into to get to a point of no return
(10:58:12) Xander: A final dungeon even, that's a far better analogy..

(10:59:40) Xander: Megaman 2 is the only one that you really -need- to play
(10:59:44) Bigger: did not enjoy it at all
(10:59:54) anosou: Meh, I've got so many other games on my to-play-list that I'm sure I will enjoy more
(10:59:55) Xander: Did you at least rock out to the musics?
(11:00:03) Bigger: the music is great
(11:00:04) anosou: but then again, subjectivity is frowned upon :3
(11:00:07) Arne: megaman is easy
(11:00:08) anosou: Music is decent yeah..
(11:00:12) Arne: Trojan is hard

(12:18:02) Stargoat: bugger, shoe!
(12:18:05) jstickeur: Toca Race Driver working on Vista? That'd be fine
(12:18:15) Movius: I will play this game once I've found out why the earth and the sun are the same size
(12:18:19) jstickeur: I remember buying game #4 and it had problems on XP :O
(12:18:26) Ciahnensy: 4 you say.
(12:18:36) Movius: Science (which is run by freemasons) doesn't have the answers apparently
(12:18:46) jstickeur: Yup, 4 didn't work
(12:18:57) jstickeur: But gog optimize their games before selling, right?
(12:19:04) Ciahnensy: Probably not.
(12:19:10) jstickeur: I thought they do
(12:19:16) jstickeur: So that they all work on VIsta and XP
(12:19:32) Ciahnensy: I know 3 works in XP. I don't think there is a 4.
(12:19:45) jstickeur: I'm pretty sure there's a 4

(12:22:33) fartronomicon: just brilliant
(12:22:45) Xander: I got to play a single game of Red Faction online after a day of trying
(12:22:51) anosou: 'commando' makes it good
(12:22:55) Xander: Go me
(12:22:57) anosou: everything with 'commando' in the title is good
(12:23:07) Xander: What about going commando?
(12:23:09) anosou: Porn, games, music, artists, whatever
(12:23:17) anosou: if you put 'commando' in there, the title sounds awesome
(12:23:20) Xander: The activity of engaging regular life activities without underpants
(12:23:20) fartronomicon: the lead singer is called Demon Lord Sarcofuck 666
(12:23:48) Xander: too many 666's isn't it?
(12:23:49) anosou: 'underpants' is 75% more funny than 'underwear'
(12:23:59) fartronomicon: i don't think you can have too many 666s
(12:24:05) jstickeur: Ciahnensy, you are right. A fourth game in the series was announced - but I guess it was turned into Race Driver GRID later on
(12:24:18) Ciahnensy: I am terrible at GRID.
(12:24:21) jstickeur: I must have written a news about the announcement back then
(12:24:24) Ciahnensy: But the replays are entertaining.
(12:24:42) fartronomicon: i think they're german anyway
(12:25:02) Ciahnensy: Picked up where I left off in Test Drive Unlimited last night. *vroom* *vroom*
(12:25:37) Xander: inFamous is pretty good from how the demo feels. Of course renting has again completely changed my feeling of a games 'worth'
(12:26:31) anosou: GRID, isn't that with cars and stuff?
(12:26:36) Ciahnensy: Yes no maybe.
(12:26:45) anosou: I must say I prefer futuristic hovercrafts of some kind
(12:26:52) Ciahnensy: No don't touch me.
(12:26:52) jstickeur: Ciahnensy! Do you remember whether there was a TDU demo for PC?
(12:26:55) anosou: Fatal Inertia was a sorely missunderstood game
(12:26:57) jstickeur: I was so sure I played one once
(12:27:04) Xander: Yep, its about driving cars that go faster than people can on foot
(12:27:12) Ciahnensy: If there was it was a temporary open beta.
(12:27:25) jstickeur: Aaah, right
(12:27:36) Ciahnensy: Something like that.

(12:34:54) Movius: everyone covers that song
(12:35:08) Movius: the Judas Priest cover is usually mistaken as the original
(12:35:15) fartronomicon: i think kiss did it
(12:35:19) fartronomicon: and melvins covers the kiss version

(12:37:03) anosou: The customization is just an excellent example of replay value
(12:37:08) anosou: also it's fun.
(12:37:18) anosou: Xander: I'm still holding out for Magic: The Gathering XBLA :D
(12:37:30) Xander: I love playing Armored Core and turning every hud element I can on
(12:37:40) anosou: I like you
(12:37:57) anosou: You have great taste in stuff
(12:37:57) Xander: Even if I have no idea what half of it means, I just love the constant stream of information, it just makes me feel like this is the kind of thing piloting a giant robot would require
(12:37:59) Xander: hahaa
(12:38:09) OEP: success. dual monitors.
(12:38:17) anosou: The thing about Armored Core vs. any mech simulator is the sheer speed of the later games
(12:38:25) anosou: AC4 blew me away in multiplayer

(12:39:12) doohan: :)
(12:39:14) doohan: I like that
(12:39:15) anosou: Yeah, I like that too
(12:39:16) doohan: oooh!!
(12:39:19) anosou: gives the option of exploits
(12:39:22) doohan: REminds me of a speecy game
(12:39:27) anosou: and different experiences online
(12:39:37) Stargoat: I totally want a speccy.
(12:39:40) doohan: Dragonene, you have to make that into a game now
(12:39:48) Xander: Yeah, it's like choosing a different seasoning for your game
(12:39:49) anosou: AC:FA just released it's second multiplayer-specific patch so you can have a different kind of "setup" online
(12:40:01) anosou: From Software is a company that makes me all warm inside
(12:40:15) anosou: Looking forward to getting a PS3 so I can get my greasy hands on their latest RPG
(12:40:17) Dragonene: doohan: heh. :)
(12:40:20) Dragonene: No :D
(12:40:23) doohan: Can I?
(12:40:25) Xander: *ahem*
(12:40:34) Xander: I might already have a copy
(12:40:38) Xander: and a 30 hour save file
(12:41:07) Xander: Demon's Soul is awesomesauce
(12:41:19) anosou: Nice :o
(12:41:29) anosou: Like I said, I'm late to the PS3 party but I'm getting it just for that
(12:41:45) Xander: I was pretty late, I only got one this year around febuary time
(12:41:56) anosou: I buy games instead of consoles D:
(12:41:58) Xander: After I started renting games too so I only actually own about 3
(12:42:32) Xander: Yeah, I don't really buy games at all anymore beyond RPG's. I do an online rental thing so I can save my money on imports
(12:42:40) anosou: I'm a collector
(12:42:46) anosou: http://soundscape.escariot.net/games/
(12:42:50) Xander: Like Crimson Gem Saga, Class of Heroes and BlazBlue on this month alone
(12:42:53) anosou: I'm still in the middle of getting all PS2 titles I want
(12:43:03) Xander: I would've gotten Cross Edge too but it's just too much...
(12:43:14) anosou: Imports never appeals to me because my collection would be iffy then :)
(12:43:21) anosou: also I have no region-free console
(12:43:33) Xander: haha, I used to trade in ps2 games and then realised now that some of those games are too great not to own
(12:43:51) anosou: I don't do trade ins because of that very reason
(12:44:00) Xander: Never try to buy a copy of ZOE2. That was expensive pre-owned. It was still about £35 or so
(12:44:05) anosou: Too many nights spent crying over trading in the first nordic edition of ICO
(12:44:13) anosou: Already have ZOE2 :3
(12:44:23) Xander: Good good
(12:44:27) notch [xNotchX@h-77-240.A165.priv.bahnhof.se] entered the room.
(12:44:40) anosou: and I found a first edition of ICO for about $10 or something, that made me happy
(12:44:58) anosou: Since it's about $120 or so sealed and quite expensive unsealed too
(12:45:19) Xander: Ah, with the swanky art box?
(12:45:23) anosou: Yup
(12:45:37) anosou: I actually bought the re-issue before that so now I have two copies ;P
(12:45:41) Xander: haha
(12:45:57) Xander: How sad that I know this is a list of European releases
(12:46:03) Xander: Because there's only Xenosaga Episode II
(12:46:05) anosou: I still need Armored Core: Last Raven so bad but it's IMPOSSIBLE to find.
(12:46:06) anosou: Haha yeah
(12:46:16) anosou: I, for some dumb reason, am only collecting PAL release
(12:46:27) Xander: That's really the worst thing we've had to deal with on the PAL NTSC divide. That was retarded.
(12:46:30) anosou: maybe laziness, maybe something else.. but it's really dumb
(12:46:35) anosou: definitely
(12:46:52) anosou: I'm glad today's games doesn't offer any difference in quality between regions
(12:47:13) Xander: I can understand it, I didn't do it for a really long time except for my psp, but there's a lot of PS2 games which turned out to be awesome omissions
(12:47:28) Xander: Like Tales of the Abyss. That was RAD
(12:47:40) Xander: Also R.A.D. That was also great
(12:47:42) anosou: When I get rich (i.e. never) I'll start getting all the essential imports
(12:47:45) anosou: like R.A.D.
(12:47:47) Dragonene: Somebody else said speccy as well Stargoat.
(12:47:52) Dragonene: I suspect it's the monochrome?
(12:47:53) anosou: I've been eyeing that like.. forever
(12:47:55) Dragonene: I've never used one tho.
(12:47:57) Xander: Heh, Zombie Hunters? I have Zombie Zone
(12:48:07) anosou: Zombie Hunters is the better version I believe
(12:48:12) Stargoat: the speccy has jetpac
(12:48:15) Xander: Yes, I wouldn't argue with that
(12:48:16) anosou: Zombie Zone is the 505 release and that was the not-expanded version of the game
(12:48:22) Fraeon: So
(12:48:34) Fraeon: Should I get Worms XBLA and SF2 HD Remix
(12:48:37) Xander: haha
(12:48:42) anosou: I did some research about what versions were released in Japan and there were "expanded versions" of both Onechanbara 1 and 2, in Europe released as Zombie Hunters
(12:48:53) Fraeon: Or Worms XBLA and Outrun Arcade?
(12:48:55) anosou: Fraeon: in SF2 HD Remix you can hear my music, I vote you get that
(12:49:00) anosou: :D
(12:49:07) Xander: I played the 360 version, but I'm not sure where that falls in with the PS2 games
(12:49:19) anosou: Meh, they're all the same stuff
(12:49:31) Xander: This is kind of like just going through my own catalogue of games really. and then it hits me with 'Wait, I don't own that one!'
(12:49:31) anosou: Fraeon: honestly though, never played Outrun but SF2HDR is good.
(12:49:40) Fraeon: But then again, I have SF4
(12:49:42) anosou: damnit Xander I like you
(12:49:47) Xander: What the hell? Sol Divide was on the PS2?
(12:49:49) anosou: Fraeon: you need both if you like SF
(12:49:52) anosou: YES :D
(12:49:58) anosou: I found some info on a bunch of shmup conversions
(12:50:18) anosou: 505 Games released many before D3 Publisher got the rights for those (and totally ignored them) so they've been taking out of production now
(12:50:57) Xander: Sodding 505. They're the reason I had to import a french version of Guilty Gear Isuka
(12:50:59) anosou: Same with Dragon Blaze, GigaWing Generations, Homura, Raiden II, Samurai Aces and Tengai
(12:51:00) Bezzy: I left a brace off when committing code, and so when i re-committed the fix to svn, I chickened out of leaving this as my commit message: "Frequently, productivity at the end of a crunch is less than would be expected from normal working hours. Quality also suffers as tired developers make more mistakes."
(12:51:15) anosou: Yeah, I've imported Raiden III and a few others because of them
(12:51:27) anosou: still, they're avaliable in PAL region and in english, can't complain
(12:51:34) Xander: Gregory Horror Show! That still scares my ass off..
(12:51:38) Xander: Yeah, it could be worse
(12:51:50) Xander: No Persona 4 yet?
(12:51:50) anosou: now that we're getting Ar Tonelico II through Koei I'm glad I got Ar Tonelico before it went all super-expensive
(12:52:01) anosou: Oh yeah, I've got P4, just haven't uploaded the new file in a while
(12:52:01) Fraeon: If there's something I hate, it's this space bucks system
(12:52:13) Fraeon: I'm not buying 4000 points just so I could spend 2600 of them
(12:52:20) anosou: (keep in mind I haven't even palyed 50% of these games... but I'm getting there!)
(12:52:30) KareemK left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:52:46) Xander: I got the import version, and got shafted
(12:53:09) Xander: Because of that oh so brilliant bug where the final boss had to be killed in 3 turns or he'd unleash an attack that'd 100% of the time crash the game
(12:53:12) Xander: FUN.TIMES.
(12:53:16) anosou: haha yeah, heard that :D
(12:53:26) anosou: btw, you did see Nippon Ichi Europe now exists and is releasing most their stuff through Koei?
(12:53:29) jstickeur: http://viprhealthcare.typepad.com/files/dj_schmolli_-_queen_will_slay_you.mp3

(12:53:35) Xander: whawha? seriously?
(12:53:46) anosou: Yup
(12:53:55) anosou: Mana Khemia is released already because of that
(12:54:00) anosou: Ar Tonelico II is a result of it too
(12:54:02) Xander: That really is great news. Why the hell is this just an indie gaming site, I want to post that..
(12:54:08) anosou: hahaha
(12:54:28) anosou: http://www.koei.co.uk/news/?id=16097
(12:54:33) Xander: ahh, and my favourite titled game ever, which I didn't even buy knowing how great the earlier one was
(12:54:36) Xander: RAW DANGER!!!
(12:54:40) anosou: RAW DANGER!!!
(12:54:52) anosou: Those are so niche I had to get both
(12:54:52) SimonTheDigger: DAW RANGER
(12:54:55) anosou: haven't even played them
(12:55:10) Xander: oh awesome, so Cross Edge'll be coming out here too in August. I'm alright with waiting for that
(12:55:20) anosou: Yeah, another reason to get that blasted PS3
(12:55:24) anosou: I need to work my ass of this summer..
(12:55:35) anosou: at least I'll get SOME dough for these soundtracks I'm scoring atm
(12:55:52) Xander: ooh, soundtracks?
(12:56:00) anosou: ah yeah, I'm one of those blasted composer guys
(12:56:06) SimonTheDigger: oh
(12:56:08) SimonTheDigger: cheers, then
(12:56:10) Xander: Oh you bastards and your TALENT
(12:56:14) anosou: hahaha
(12:56:31) SimonTheDigger: if it weren't for composers like you, I wouldn't have stuff like the Dracula Battle Perfect Selection to listen to
(12:56:43) anosou: all thanks to ocremix.org actually, after I was part of SF2HDR I got a few offers and started from that ( http://www.ocremix.org/artist/4751/another-soundscape )
(12:56:50) anosou: Haha you're welcome Simon? :D
(12:56:51) Dragonene: uh, yes
(12:56:54) Dragonene: I'll be going to bed now
(12:56:55) Dragonene: 'night
(12:56:56) anosou: later
(12:57:19) Xander: {====}
(12:57:23) Xander: That is a brick I just shat
(12:57:31) anosou: Oh, nice, gonna build a house?
(12:57:43) KingAl left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(12:57:53) Xander: There could be enough. You were part of SF2HDR? That's insanely awesome
(12:58:01) SimonTheDigger: you know what Dracula Battle Perfect Selection is, right?
(12:58:02) KingAl [AlKing_@203-214-153-235.perm.iinet.net.au] entered the room.
(12:58:13) jstickeur: That's cool news, yeah
(12:58:14) anosou: Kinda fun yeah, I still think my track sucked donkey balls but it was good fun
(12:58:16) Xander: Holy shit! Voices of the Lifestream too?!
(12:58:17) jstickeur: (NIS thing)
(12:58:28) anosou: Yeah, that one I'm a bit more proud of
(12:58:39) anosou: For soundtracks to games that are actually released we have this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79-ibnVNxSg
(12:58:44) anosou: and this: http://www.gamemp3s.net/2009/02/14/happy/
(12:59:01) anosou: everything being eventually archived (information-wise) here: http://vgmdb.net/artist/1039
(12:59:11) anosou: There, now I'm done with the shameless self-pimping.. I feel dirty..
(12:59:39) Xander: ....
(13:00:07) Xander: How have you accomplished so much and you're younger than me. Right! I've gotta build something right now
(13:00:30) anosou: I am quite aware of my age :/ it's a handicap because people don't take me very seriously when I say I'm born in 1989
(13:00:58) anosou: but hey, I'm glad it makes you wanna be creative, that's all it takes really
(13:01:21) fartronomicon: respect your elders!
(13:01:43) ***anosou respects my elders
(13:01:50) fartronomicon: ok good
(13:01:53) anosou: damnit, HIS elders.. grammar is for jerks.
(13:02:39) Xander: and nazis
(13:03:03) anosou: true story
(13:03:12) Xander: I need to get a copy of Onimusha 2 again. That was so good. If we're talking replayability in games that would be my example piece
(13:03:51) Xander: The whole chart thing that illustrated different scenarios depending on relationships with the cast like an eroge.. that was compelling to fill
(13:03:51) anosou: My copy is not really pretty.. traded it for half a bottle of Jägermeister on a festival.. bad move because the game was apparently used as some kind of washcloth
(13:03:51) fartronomicon: i want to play oni again
(13:04:07) anosou: I do wanna play all those games though so I'll probably get a new copy along with the rest of the games
(13:04:11) anosou: I've heard it's very cinematic
(13:04:26) Xander: Devil Summoner has reminded me lately how much I miss pre-rendered backdrops
(13:04:31) anosou: Ah yeah
(13:04:39) fartronomicon: oni was disappointing but i recall the combat being very solid
(13:04:43) anosou: the single best example of how awesome pre-rendered backdrops are is Jade Cocoon
(13:04:57) anosou: oh really? maybe I shouldn't get onimusha before all those other games then
(13:05:04) fartronomicon: no no
(13:05:05) fartronomicon: oni
(13:05:08) fartronomicon: onimusha reminded me
(13:05:09) anosou: oh ONI
(13:05:11) fartronomicon: that i'd been thinking of oni
(13:05:15) gsoto [gsoto@r190-135-160-157.dialup.adsl.anteldata.net.uy] entered the room.
(13:05:21) anosou: I played that on my friends PC way back
(13:05:24) jsticker [nnscript@p4FD593E5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] entered the room.
(13:05:25) anosou: it looked really cool for it's time
(13:05:33) fartronomicon: it got boring
(13:05:45) fartronomicon: levels were similar
(13:05:47) anosou: didn't play a lot so that might very well be true
(13:06:14) Xander: I really liked it. It was simple but fun
(13:06:26) Xander: The combat is nothing like the Devil May Cry/Ninja Gaidens of the world now
(13:06:29) anosou: I'm still pissed at the developer of Artoon for not synchronizing the jumps to the beat in the music.. 
(13:06:38) anosou: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79-ibnVNxSg - I mean the levels just make your head hurt now
(13:06:54) anosou: Ninja Gaiden.. should pick that up
(13:07:03) Xander: oh right.. I was going to do a thing of XNA games at one point. But I didn't have much luck finding ones that I actually liked
(13:07:05) anosou: I'm not much for brutally hard games but it's getting cheap now
(13:07:15) SimonTheDigger: (sorry about that, was playing Jumpbox)
(13:07:17) anosou: Haha yeah, XNA is filled with crap nowadays
(13:07:27) jw: hey
(13:07:27) SimonTheDigger: Dracula Battle Perfect Selection is Castlevania music done heavy-metal style
(13:07:30) jw: anyone played the gutter?
(13:07:35) anosou: I scored The Perfect Match and apparently the game was really bad D:
(13:07:42) Xander: Artoon was one of the vanguard and just stylistically it stood out. Aside that is Hexothermic and Trino
(13:07:47) fartronomicon: what is the gutter?
(13:07:47) Xander: and.. possibly weapon of choice
(13:07:50) anosou: However the one I'm working on now (also XNA) for Dream Build Play looks fantastic so for
(13:07:55) Xander: ooh, it's out jw?
(13:07:58) anosou: Aww, thanks, I will tell Oscar (the lone developer) that

(13:10:29) Xander: Will it be a music-rhythm-vomit game?
(13:11:09) jw: its a piece of art
(13:11:13) jw: so yes
(13:11:16) jw: if you want it to be

(13:16:00) anosou: ah, there we go
(13:16:27) jsticker: It is down because you didn't finish your vegetables
(13:16:34) Xander: According to the credits there was a cat?
(13:16:40) anosou: it makes me happy that Braid Mac is on the top, it makes me remember that some people sometime do stuff for Mac :3
(13:16:50) ***anosou is being a grade A Mac-wanker
(13:17:01) Dragonene left the room.
(13:17:04) jsticker: Mac-a-wanker

(13:17:49) jw: the gutter has like some diff things you can do
(13:17:54) jw: and endings
(13:17:57) Xander: I did laugh at the end, but that's more because I just laugh as a reaction to any kind of tragic circumstance
(13:18:03) anosou: I should dual-boot or whatever because I wanna play GR+++ when it's released and SYNSOI:SH looks hot too
(13:18:06) michael left the room (quit: Quit: michael).
(13:18:19) Xander: To stop it feeling serious to me
(13:18:26) Kobel: PUPPY MASSACRE
(13:18:32) jw: did you throw up?
(13:18:46) Xander: Once, then I passed out next to a cardboard box
(13:18:50) jw: walk a bit away from the vomit
(13:18:53) fartronomicon: what is synsoi?
(13:18:53) jw: and the cat will come

(13:20:32) jsticker: hahaha, amazing, jw
(13:21:08) Xander: The cat ran away from me..
(13:21:14) jsticker: I'd write about this game just to burn two stupid subtitle headlines on it, "A tragic tale of alcohol abuse" and "Painting the town green"
(13:21:16) Xander: also a seem to have face planted the screen
(13:21:25) OEP left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(13:23:24) Kobel: Next game designer to use the word 'cinematic' gets punched in the teeth
(13:23:29) Kobel: Not the mouth. Just the teeth
(13:23:32) Xander: AGAIN!
(13:23:36) fartronomicon: CINEMATIC VISUALS
(13:23:50) Kobel: Are you a game designer?
(13:23:50) fartronomicon: what about cinemagic
(13:23:53) fartronomicon: in a sense
(13:23:57) Xander: haha, I heard something amazing yesterday
(13:23:59) fartronomicon: in the sense that i design games
(13:24:06) Kobel: Pfffffft
(13:24:13) Xander: Where someone described a garden looking very VISUAL
(13:24:17) Kobel: Haha
(13:24:19) Kobel: Most things do?
(13:24:28) fartronomicon: i've heard people describe bands as having "good acoustics"
(13:24:39) fartronomicon: usually it's dave mathews band
(13:24:54) Kobel: Well, acoustics at least has some connotations that make that kind of make sense...
(13:24:59) Kobel: Like acoustic instruments
(13:25:11) fartronomicon: it would make sense if dave mathews band were a place in which you played music
(13:25:20) fartronomicon: because then it could have acoustics
(13:25:24) Xander: That music is greatness
(13:25:31) Kobel: Well, or it could just be saying they have good acoustic [instruments]
(13:25:37) Kobel: But I don't think it is
(13:25:40) fartronomicon: not in english it couldn't
(13:25:57) Kobel: I'm pretty sure it could?
(13:25:59) fartronomicon: maybe DMBidiotese
(13:26:02) SimonTheDigger: Damn Jumpbox.
(13:26:03) Kobel: But actually don't care
(13:26:25) Stargoat left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).

(13:28:08) fartronomicon: have you been reading about obama's speech
(13:29:17) Kobel: No
(13:29:23) Kobel: Why would I do that?
(13:29:36) Kobel: Reading's for nerds
(13:30:22) fartronomicon: because he says he wants to have the power of "indefinite preventive detention" to lock people up with no evidence against them and without having committed a crime of any sort
(13:30:32) fartronomicon: so that the terrorizers don't get us
(13:30:38) jsticker: jw, is there interaction in your game that goes beyond left/right/up/down, drink and vomit?

(13:35:30) Xander: I'd argue that the best part of The Gutter might be that the T in art is an upside down dick
(13:36:08) Xander: It would be an awkward arguement where no one retorted or ever made eye contact with me, and I'd probably vomit and pass out afterwards
(13:36:10) anosou: I'm still gonna play the gutter first
(13:36:12) jw: the best part is the emotions it gives you
(13:36:15) Xander: but I'd makes it!
(13:36:43) notch: i am svensk!
(13:37:02) Xander: I found it funny and tragic at the same time. Because for some reason a waltzing drunk sleeping in his own vomit covered box with that wacky music playing is enjoyable
(13:37:02) anosou: That's completely magiskt tycker jag!
(13:37:15) Xander: However, if he was actually to not snore I'd be rather sad
(13:37:17) jw: did you vomit on your box D:

(14:03:22) jstickeur: Not on this album, but one or two years ago
(14:03:28) C418: I thought the mix they show there (tits & clits) is good enough already
(14:03:34) C418: oh well
(14:03:47) jstickeur: Yeah, the remixes on the album are pretty good
(14:03:48) C418: something to play as a dj, innit

(14:06:31) InaVegt [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(14:06:38) C418: but personally, I like casual tower defense games more
(14:06:49) Siiseli: I dislike tower defense games
(14:07:12) C418: it's not that it's totally a tower defense
(14:07:23) C418: more a mashup of lot of different games
(14:07:27) C418: even bejeweled at one point
(14:08:38) jstickeur: Damnation is 8 GB on Steam...
(14:08:43) jstickeur: That's gonna take ages
(14:09:05) pekuja: Siiseli: Plants vs. Zombies
(14:09:50) Xander: Eurogamer UK really hammered Damnation

(14:10:20) Siiseli: pekuja, kk
(14:11:23) pekuja: C418: by the way, I recommend playing the Survival Mode before you play tha Last Stand minigame
(14:12:16) pekuja: C418: not that I'm sure because I played Last Stand first, but I think after I beat Last Stand, Surival Mode was too easy :-P
(14:12:26) pekuja: C418: (Last Stand is pretty hard)
(14:12:26) C418: :D
(14:12:36) C418: I keep that in mind
(14:14:25) Xander: I might change my tune on Bionic Commando slightly
(14:14:44) Xander: It could be that I'm fickle. It could also be that I've just encountered a flying robot hurling hadoukens at me
(14:15:16) Kobel: I haven't really played it but MGS3 has a guy who shoots bees from his mouth.
(14:15:26) Xander: That is also pretty rad
(14:15:28) Kobel: BEES.
(14:15:29) fartronomicon: there should be a SoTC level where you grapple up a boss
(14:15:55) fartronomicon: i mean an SoTC level of bionic
(14:16:00) Kobel: Unleash the hounds, or the bees, or the dogs with bees in their mouths so that when they bark they shoot bees at you

(14:18:41) eobet [eobet@c-3f4270d5.032-205-6b6c6d1.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(14:18:58) Xander: That'd be an awesome bonus. It really is lacking in bosses so far
(14:19:19) Xander: There's only been one so far that was pretty sweet. The other was a really basic
(14:19:28) ***anosou desperately tries to somehow understand how to make website, fails and dies
(14:19:32) Xander: It involved a helicopter and rocket launchers. How much more bland can it get?
(14:20:00) anosou: bland can be fun if you do it right
(14:20:04) Xander: when other times it has robots firing hadoukens at me. They seriously do the hand movement and everything!
(14:20:06) anosou: I don't think everything HAS to be innovative
(14:20:49) Xander: I think the helicopter/rocket launcher thing is really overdone though, and when it's a game about a game with a grappling hook for an arm I can't really excuse missed opportunities
(14:20:59) OEP [OEP@c-68-62-133-72.hsd1.al.comcast.net] entered the room.
(14:21:01) anosou: Good point
(14:21:08) fartronomicon: yeah, maybe if you were grappling through the city while the helecopter chased you
(14:21:09) Xander: And as a single boss encounter that would be alright, Ninja Gaiden did it okay
(14:21:10) anosou: as long as he didn't use the grapple arm on said helicopter?
(14:21:18) Xander: It flew away...
(14:21:23) fartronomicon: lame
(14:21:25) anosou: very
(14:21:26) Xander: causing me to hilariously plummet to my death
(14:21:39) ***anosou goes back to hyping Senko no Ronde
(14:21:48) Xander: So, as a one shot joke it was actually pretty funny. But beyond that it had no tactical usefulness
(14:21:57) Xander: hyping it?
(14:22:08) anosou: no one seems aware it exists
(14:22:13) anosou: so I try to hype it a bit
(14:22:15) Xander: Failures
(14:22:43) Xander: of course it doesn't help that it has the most generic robots on the box here with the stupid name of WARTECH
(14:22:52) anosou: True story :(
(14:23:02) anosou: Doesn't make the game less awesome though
(14:23:12) Xander: No one who isn't an animuest was probably going to buy it anyway, so why bugger with it?
(14:23:16) fartronomicon: anosou, did you minecraft yet
(14:23:24) anosou: I did not
(14:23:28) anosou: I guess I should :)
(14:23:30) fartronomicon: minecraft.net
(14:23:31) fartronomicon: get on it
(14:23:34) Xander: See that? That was also a critque of the Star Ocean 4 bullshit where they changed the portraits!
(14:23:35) fartronomicon: new version
(14:23:42) Xander: good times...
(14:23:46) anosou: yeah I saw that and cried
(14:24:03) Xander: minecraft is awesomes.. shamefully I'm crap at constructing anything
(14:24:21) OEP: I made a great bridge across an archipelago last night :P
(14:24:27) Xander: I wonder how the EU version is? I haven't heard if they made any changes or not, though I really doubt they did
(14:24:48) Xander: I just much preferred the style of the anime one to the generic sci-fi
(14:25:28) Xander: oh look, we're science fictiony because we're 3D renders! What kind of sense is that.. and again, no one will be getting Star Ocean if they don't enjoy anime styled things anyway
(14:25:31) Xander: So.. what the fuck?
(14:25:38) anosou: I still don't really know what minecraft IS
(14:25:42) anosou: but it's fun placing out cubes
(14:25:44) OEP: If I were going to play Star Ocean for the first time, am I ruined if I haven't been a fan from day 1?
(14:25:46) Xander: Though I hear you can turn down the voices of each individual character, which sounbds cool
(14:26:07) fartronomicon: anosou, it is a toy that is being developed into a game
(14:26:10) fartronomicon: at the moment think of it like legos
(14:26:11) Xander: Not at all. They revamped the first two a bit for the psp, and the 360 one is a prequel
(14:26:19) anosou: I'm already a fan
(14:26:23) fartronomicon: with water and lava
(14:26:24) OEP: So where's a good place to start?
(14:26:36) Xander: They're pretty much independent of one another except for a couple of things. Even the gameplay feels different
(14:27:01) OEP: Cool.. I wanted to play Persona 3 and then Star Ocean
(14:27:09) shinygerbil: minecraft still crashes opera >:(
(14:27:12) anosou: RUNNING AT A SOLID 6FPS, HELLS YEAH
(14:27:19) anosou: I had like 100fps a second ago D:
(14:27:24) fartronomicon: what browser?
(14:27:30) fartronomicon: also make sure your java is up to date
(14:27:31) anosou: firefox mac
(14:27:38) fartronomicon: and finally the F key will reduce the clipping distance
(14:27:56) OEP: I was using OpenJDK to run it -- could achieve close to 100fps but it was choppy at some points and the mouse wouldn't work
(14:28:04) OEP: going to install Sun Java and see how well it does...
(14:28:14) Xander: Anywhere's fine. I'd say whatever platform you like most. Star Ocean 1 and 2 are best enjoyed on the PSP (or ps1 for SO2 I guess). Till the end of time is a great PS2 game, if a little.. odd sometimes. And the 360 one looks awesome too, not that I've tried it yet
(14:28:35) anosou: I loved Till the end of time
(14:28:41) anosou: Best. Plot-twist. EVER.
(14:28:50) OEP: Cool.. I listened to some of Til The End of Time's music
(14:28:57) OEP: It sparked my interest from there
(14:28:59) Xander: Haha, the plot twist was such a marmite thing
(14:29:05) anosou: definitely
(14:29:10) anosou: but damnit I enjoyed it
(14:29:13) Xander: I know tonnes of people who just dropped it because of that. 
(14:29:23) anosou: They should've explored it more though
(14:29:29) Xander: There was a godly amount of post-game content too
(14:29:38) anosou: yeah, typical tri-ace
(14:29:39) Xander: Yeah, that was a real shame
(14:30:25) Xander: but even for tri-ace standards.. there was the battle collosseum, there was that weird cave thing, then the maze, then Sphere 211, then the bonus battle with the flute
(14:30:37) anosou: (I haven't played any of those tbh)
(14:30:52) Xander: hahaha
(14:31:09) Xander: and of course the Battle Trophies
(14:31:16) anosou: Ah yes
(14:31:18) anosou: that was the hotness
(14:31:24) anosou: makes me wanna play it again now D:
(14:31:35) Xander: and the extra difficulties, and the extra costumes and control styles for getting more and more trophies and...Blaaaaaaarrrggghh!
(14:31:47) anosou: but I should really focus on finding someone I can force into making me a simple WordPress-based website ( much like gamemp3s.net )
(14:31:50) C418: impressive
(14:31:50) Xander: It lacked in the areas that most people like RPG's for, but it was just so much better at being a GAME
(14:31:56) anosou: Yeah
(14:32:00) C418: you can now share minecraft levels with a mere weblink
(14:32:00) anosou: that's what I love about tri-ace
(14:32:04) fartronomicon left the room (quit: Quit: quittin' time).
(14:32:07) anosou: They make GAMES
(14:32:17) anosou: not interactive stories in the same way that most JRPGs does it
(14:32:29) Xander: I refuse to talk about Valkyrie Profile though, as I'll probably just soil my underpants in pleasure again.
(14:32:42) ***anosou calmly agrees to some extent
(14:32:50) ***anosou is listening to North Star by Yasuhisa Watanabe from Senko no Ronde -Sound Tracks- (3:19 / 4:06)
(14:33:11) Xander: VP1 was confusing without at least some guide peeking
(14:33:29) anosou: yeah, that's why I haven't played it like.. at all :D
(14:33:34) Xander: and the DS version I really hate
(14:34:08) Xander: They turned it into a boring tactical RPG. I mean I like them, but Tri-ace games do battle systems that no one else really does
(14:34:28) Xander: and so to just do a generic turn-based game felt like such a kick in the nuts
(14:34:54) anosou: haven't played it at all
(14:35:35) Xander: haha..ah.. I really need to stop thinking about it now. SO4 is still two weeks away, I can't die of high blood pressure before then..

(14:59:50) OEP: I should take this up against my DM for being unrealistic
(14:59:55) Kobel: It probably depends a lot on pulse rate though
(15:00:09) Kobel: If pulse rate's higher you might asphyxiate faster
(15:00:14) OEP: Or whether or not you got a good breath beforehand

(15:00:51) OEP: I dunno.. that's kind of like saying if your metabolism is really good you'll starve faster
(15:00:57) Kobel: 30 seconds is dumb though
(15:01:08) OEP: Yeah. It's ok. I don't like that guy anyway.
(15:01:10) Kobel: Any 12 year old can hold his breath for 30 seconds
(15:01:27) OEP: I was trying to go out like a boss pimp and he killed me in 30 seconds.
(15:01:46) Kobel: And I'm pretty sure that if your metabolism is fast you will starve faster
(15:01:55) Kobel: There's a reason the human body stores fat
(15:02:20) OEP: Metabolism adjusts to what you eat though
(15:02:26) Kobel: Ideally
(15:02:34) Kobel: But if it doesn't you'll starve faster
(15:02:39) OEP: Yes :)
(15:02:54) Kobel: So if your pulse rate doesn't slow down you'd maybe asphyxiate faster, for the same reason
(15:03:33) OEP: Unless your lungs regulate how much oxygen is released into your blood stream according to your amount of intake! :O
(15:05:07) Kobel: Also if you have superpowered alien blood that doesn't require oxygen

(15:05:20) anosou: D:
(15:05:31) OEP: Also, if someone stabs you, you will most likely asphyxiate faster.

(15:36:34) Massena [Massena@bl6-201-197.dsl.telepac.pt] entered the room.
(15:36:51) Xander: gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
(15:37:02) broknecho left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:37:05) Massena: Hwawraw
(15:38:59) kevglass: whats wrong with heavy rain?
(15:39:30) anosou: Hah, so much for figuring out WordPress-based website, screw this :(
(15:40:04) anosou: I will have to pay someone to actually design a website, make a decent banner and layout before I can even think about buying some webspace and a domain
(15:40:51) qubodup [qubodup@brln-4db97474.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(15:40:57) Xander: Heh, it does look interesting, but it will clearly just turn out to be a giant QTE fest again
(15:41:11) anosou: don't hate on QTEs
(15:41:21) anosou: Last Remnant and Ninja Blade pulled them off
(15:41:26) anosou: but then again, I've never been a hater
(15:41:38) OEP: eh? what did you have trouble with?
(15:41:52) Xander: I can't help but hate on them. I will admit that they at least look more sensibly done in Heavy Rain, roughly showing you what the button will coordinate with in terms of the action
(15:42:15) Xander: Well, half the time it seems like they're trying to push attention away from the fact that they just want to do a cutscene
(15:42:44) Xander: It's not really based on any skill you've learnt through the game, rather it's just the most basic of skills of simon says style reaction
(15:43:01) SimonTheDigger: ...I really need to change my alerts
(15:43:12) broknecho [1@h216.94.9.98.rev.fatbanana.ca] entered the room.
(15:43:22) Xander: When it's optional it can be interesting, like Dynamite Deka where you would be at a disadvantage if you screwed up, or you might be in a better position if you do it well
(15:43:33) Massena left the room.
(15:43:34) Xander: Or Last Remnant where you could just turn them off if you wanted critical attacks to be randomised
(15:44:27) anosou: That's gold
(15:44:27) Xander: Ninja Blade had some really awesome looking ones (I surfed a wrecking ball into a giant spiders face), but the actual mechnic is just so annoying
(15:44:38) anosou: Nah, they turned back time if you failed
(15:44:38) fartron: QTE is when it just says "press A" and then you press A and something happens?
(15:44:42) anosou: it was hot
(15:44:45) Xander: Well yeah that too
(15:45:11) Xander: But not really, QTE is where if you press A and you fuck up, you probably have to repeat the section again (certain games excluded)
(15:45:22) shinygerbil: ninja blade's qtes were annoying as hell, if the demo was anything to go by
(15:45:37) shinygerbil: when will people realise PRESS X TO NOT DIE is a stupid idea
(15:45:57) Xander: Like in Devil May Cry if I were to screw up I'd get hit because it's expected that I probably will since I'm not perfect. So at the very least I shouldn't instantly fail if I mess up a QTE
(15:46:36) Xander: Even then it just feels like something everyone's decided to do rather than think up a new better way of getting the player more involved in ..groan.. "cinematic moments"
(15:47:08) Xander: Again what I kind of like about Heavy Rain is the transparency of the icons and how they are focussed around the element you should be watching anyway
(15:48:04) fartron: is the whole game like this?
(15:48:08) fartron: or do you get to play at some point?
(15:48:23) smn: dude, is heavy rain nothing but a quick-time-event-cutscene? 
(15:48:38) smn: *rant*
(15:48:42) BlademasterBobo [Blademaste@pool-173-55-168-96.lsanca.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(15:48:45) #tigirc: mode (+o BlademasterBobo) by ChanServ
(15:48:49) fartron: they might as well have made the game in hypercard
(15:48:57) smn: right
(15:49:20) smn: if i want a game like that with LIKABLE characters, i play dragon's lair.
(15:49:32) Xander: It just feels like a placeholder for a much more interesting mechanic that no one has bothered to think up yet
(15:49:57) fartron: it's a bandaid on a chestwound
(15:50:04) smn: and dragon's lair is from 1983. seriously ._.
(15:50:10) fartron: cut scenes are retarded now matter how you do it
(15:50:18) PiratePoo: It seems like a much more logical QTE system though... Not a pressing of random buttons
(15:50:35) fartron: looks pretty random
(15:50:42) Xander: Kind of.. though the face buttons somewhat spoil that
(15:50:44) fartron: looks like it's not a game
(15:51:03) PiratePoo: Maybe it isn't
(15:51:16) PiratePoo: I don't really care. I'll make up my mind when the demo comes out
(15:51:19) fartron: you could take Citizen Kane and overlay some button moments
(15:51:24) fartron: and have it start over if you fuck up
(15:51:36) PiratePoo: You don't start over in Heavy Rain
(15:51:37) fartron: "press right to be a dick to some guy!"
(15:52:14) fartron: ok but citizen kane is a good story
(15:52:20) fartron: and a movie
(15:52:30) fartron: this can't decide what it is and a i bet the writing sucks
(15:52:57) PiratePoo: What's your point
(15:53:20) fartron: this game will suck
(15:53:24) Xander: I just don't like whatever consequence occurs to be because I messed up pushing a button at the right time
(15:53:41) PiratePoo: Hatorade
(15:53:47) Xander: Which sounds stupid because that's basically any game that exists..
(15:54:18) basro_ [basro@186.136.46.12] entered the room.
(15:54:20) Arne: Every game is Dragons Lair
(15:54:21) PiratePoo: I'm going to take it for what it is
(15:54:42) Arne: http://androidarts.com/gamedev/space_barnacle_mockups2.gif
(15:54:44) fartron: me too, which is lame
(15:54:45) Arne: slight update
(15:54:53) Xander: I don't see a better way they could've done it in heavy rain, but I also don't see why it needed to be done at all as a game. I suppose it'll all be down to the overall concept of the game
(15:55:02) PiratePoo: WELL, OPINIONS DIFFER
(15:55:26) Xander: Like the gameplay elements of Nomad Soul really sucked
(15:56:08) Xander: but conceptually it had some neat ideas, and I'd like to see if Heavy Rain fleshes them out. I think I'd rather just be given a choice. 
(15:56:17) Xander: Like a flat out 'Block it. Don't block it' choice
(15:56:24) basro__ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:56:51) PiratePoo: Yea, I was wondering if you'll be able to get choice QTE's
(15:56:56) Xander: Like a Visual Novel really. Fate Stay/Night simply gives you a number of options you could choose to do at the time, and then there could be a major consequence or just a minor alteration to events
(15:57:18) Soron [Soron@adsl17-80.qualitynet.net] entered the room.
(15:57:18) PiratePoo: Like, make a split second decision to do something
(15:57:34) PiratePoo: Though I'm a bit afraid that the writing will suck
(15:57:40) PiratePoo: Which'd be a shame
(15:57:47) Soron: I heard that taking a lighter and heating it up over the stove is good fun
(15:57:56) Soron: but you really shouldn't try it o_o
(15:58:06) Xander: I'm hoping they learnt from Fahrenheit
(15:58:14) PiratePoo: Yea. I'm guessing yes
(15:58:28) PiratePoo: That game went insane in the last bit
(15:58:55) PiratePoo: The hobo's are a secret group and AI wants to take over the world MATRIX FIGHT
(15:59:07) Xander: hahaha
(15:59:14) Xander: god damn that game
(15:59:25) Xander: It was really good till that weird ass point
(15:59:29) PiratePoo: Yea.
(15:59:40) PiratePoo: Basically immediately after you save that girl from the thing
(16:00:01) fartron: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX1H1ykm2oU&fmt=18
(16:00:08) fartron: offensive spy now
(16:00:10) PiratePoo: It was like "Shit, I don't know how it ends... I MUST DO SOMETHING DRASTIC!"
(16:00:31) Xander: which is fine, it's happened to a lot of games
(16:00:44) Xander: But to a game that's so little of a 'game', that's an insane thing to do
(16:01:04) Soron: I heard that taking pure water ,heating it up in a microwave for a few mintues and dropping a sugar cube in tastes real swell
(16:01:06) Xander: The story should've been what was driving everything
(16:01:09) Soron: but it may be dangerous

(16:09:45) Kobel: it's most of the anything demographic
(16:10:14) PiratePoo: For a racing game they spend an awful little amount of time talking about the actual racing...

(16:10:19) PiratePoo: It looks nice though
(16:10:38) DragonSix [DragonSix@ivr94-4-82-229-164-12.fbx.proxad.net] entered the room.
(16:10:39) Arne: yeah, I'm sure it's interesting to drive around
(16:10:47) Arne: and just look at stuff
(16:10:49) Arne: for a while
(16:11:05) Arne: then you want to do something else, like masturbate
(16:11:08) PiratePoo: Would be nice if you can set your custom tracks
(16:11:19) PiratePoo: like, layout a race and all that
(16:11:24) Kobel: So what you're saying Arne is that it's a flawless simulation of actual driving
(16:11:54) fartron: KOTAKU EXCLUSIVE!
(16:12:00) Xander: Fucktaku
(16:12:28) PiratePoo: Gaming blogs? FACT CHECKING IS FOR WIMPS!
(16:12:30) Arne: huh?
(16:12:42) Arne: I said it might be fun to explore the environment
(16:12:45) fartron: KOTAKU EXCLUSIVE: GAME WILL BE AWESOME
(16:13:22) Xander: Did you catch that? Arne said he thinks the game is going to be flawed!
(16:13:30) Arne: ._.
(16:13:34) Xander: TIGSOURCE EXCLUSIVE: DAMNING CRITICISM!
(16:14:01) Arne: no I meant.. uh... I meant something else
(16:14:07) PiratePoo: Did anyone see that Iwata of Nintendo quote on iPhone? :\
(16:14:13) fartron: why are these foreign guys putting their game in the US
(16:14:17) Kobel: I just meant it's a flawless simulation because after an hour or two you'd rather be masturbating
(16:14:22) Arne: I don't know, I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYMORE!
(16:14:25) Xander: eugh.. I'm so lazy at taking screenshots
(16:14:25) Arne: LEAVE ME ALONE!
(16:14:34) Xander: see, that's why I play eroge
(16:14:53) Xander: Even if it's a bad game, at least I'm masturbating
(16:15:00) Kobel: And that's why you speak in retarded half-japanese pidgin?
(16:15:10) fartron: that's why i play consoles because the controlers vibrate
(16:15:35) Kobel: I wonder how the used market is on Rez trance vibrators
(16:15:41) Kobel: I bet it depends on who owned it before

(16:24:41) Xander: jw; As I'm front paging this I thought it might be interesting to ask. Clearly there's a similarity to 'The Graveyard' and this in terms of the paying for death thing. What exactly prompted this?
(16:25:09) jw: : )
(16:25:11) jw: ewll

(16:25:50) jw: but people paying for a thought is messed up

(16:42:13) C418: either that or it's a bug
(16:42:19) OEP: nah it's my 3d
(16:42:37) Xander: Anyone who realised Uberleben was filed under 'Social Impact' would win a prize if I had one
(16:42:52) OEP: I get other glx problems when I run glx-enabled stuff
(16:43:36) jw: thanks xander
(16:43:53) jstickeur: fucking valve
(16:43:58) jstickeur: items by random
(16:44:02) jstickeur: worst idea
(16:44:07) Xander: Don't get me started
(16:44:12) Epitaph64 [Epitaph64@ip24-255-27-201.tc.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(16:44:14) C418: what can you do in the gutter?
(16:44:17) C418: except drinking
(16:44:22) C418: ah. I see
(16:44:23) C418: nothing
(16:44:24) Xander: Especially including that you can get the same equipment you already have
(16:44:25) jstickeur: 15 achievements I got, no new weapon
(16:44:29) jstickeur: Yeah!
(16:44:32) C418: except I pay 5 dollars
(16:44:34) jstickeur: I got 3 weapons I already had
(16:44:36) C418: then you can die too
(16:44:53) jstickeur: This is so dumb
(16:45:03) jstickeur: I can't even understand why they did it this way
(16:45:08) Xander: I left a spy playing on his own idle earlier in a room that constantly killed him
(16:45:14) jstickeur: So far I could at least see why they'd make things the way they did
(16:45:14) C418: oh, you mean the weapon popup
(16:45:18) Xander: He earnt no equipment in 374 deaths
(16:45:23) jstickeur: :/
(16:45:31) jw: I dont get why they worry about the achievement servers
(16:45:59) Xander: What're you talking about? They're really important
(16:46:07) Xander: Achievements are like..wait...hold on
(16:46:16) Xander: No, they're stupid fucking things no one gives a rats ass about
(16:46:33) jw: achievements add a goal other then just winning the game
(16:46:38) jw: its something for yourself to worry about
(16:46:40) jw: so I like it
(16:46:41) jstickeur: They should just give you all weapons
(16:46:42) Xander: I mean that's partly untrue, but not to the extent that people would think 'OMG! YOU HAVE AN ACHIEVEMENT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE'
(16:47:12) Xander: They're a nice bonus, and they can be rather clever, but they have no automatic worth
(16:47:35) jw: they made me play tf2 for longer then I normally play games
(16:47:41) Xander: Your achievements mean something to you. Someone elses means something to them. In the middle, I shouldn't give a shit what achievements another person has, legitimately or not
(16:47:56) jstickeur: I don't know anybody that does, Xander
(16:48:03) jstickeur: What are acievement maps?
(16:48:10) jstickeur: They automatically unlock them?
(16:48:20) Xander: They were for the other classes where you could just really easily get the old achievements
(16:48:23) OEP: Maps built to make it easier to get achievements
(16:48:30) Xander: Like constantly spawning enemies you could mow down as the heavy
(16:48:32) Epitaph64: Mostly I think the reason for achievements is that they push the player to explore the game, rather than just focus on winning it right away
(16:48:42) Xander: Or burn people to death. They were actually quite fun in their own right
(16:48:53) jstickeur: The achievements in TF2 are stupid though, Epitaph64
(16:48:59) jstickeur: Because they make you act asocially
(16:49:10) jw: thats not true
(16:49:13) Epitaph64: True, well, any online achievements I generally dislike
(16:49:13) jstickeur: Most of them require you to act like a tard
(16:49:18) jw: they all make you do stuff that benefits your team
(16:49:19) jw: and in tf2
(16:49:23) jw: death to kill ratio is low
(16:49:25) jstickeur: No, jw
(16:49:25) jw: like
(16:49:27) jstickeur: They do not
(16:49:28) jw: 2:3 is good
(16:49:31) Xander: Some of them forced you to do insane things..
(16:49:32) jw: so when it says
(16:49:36) OEP: I don't think ubering a scout is one of those things
(16:49:38) jstickeur: You can't tell me that killing someone with a taunt benefits my team
(16:49:39) jw: burn 10 people
(16:49:41) jw: it helps te team
(16:49:46) jw: hmm thats true
(16:49:48) jstickeur: Yeah, there's those achievements
(16:49:51) jstickeur: But they're the minority
(16:49:57) jstickeur: Most achievements are bullshit
(16:49:58) Xander: Or doing a taunt after you've killed someone with an ubercharge?
(16:50:02) jstickeur: Yeah, exactly
(16:50:04) Xander: You've wasted ubercharge
(16:50:07) Xander: That's goddamn retarded
(16:50:18) plachenko: well, robin says this system has bugs so far
(16:50:29) plachenko: and it's just a foresight of what's to come
(16:50:30) OEP: I guess you could say that it gets you weps that make you kill better later :P
(16:50:33) Xander: The other taunting ones aren't helpful but still quite funny, but that one just pisses off a medic and leaves people alive
(16:50:50) Xander: but that's the thing, they used to which was great
(16:50:58) plachenko: also, I think the bennifit to this system is the fact that you can gift people excess items
(16:51:01) Xander: and then we could cheat if we wanted to to get weapons faster
(16:51:09) plachenko: which really does bring in the social aspect of the game
(16:51:25) Xander: I like that, however.. and I mean this with all the care in the world
(16:51:28) Xander: Fuck random people
(16:51:39) jw: some unlockable weapons were so good
(16:51:39) jstickeur: But yeah, I think they fucked TF2 up in a bad way
(16:51:40) gsoto left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(16:51:41) jw: like flare gun
(16:51:43) jw: flare gun rocks
(16:51:46) jstickeur: The original game with no unlocks was fine
(16:52:01) jw: hey at least they try to improve it
(16:52:05) Xander: I'm already social with people I'm social with. And I'm not just going to socialise with randomers, because I don't like random people. They blow themselves up in L4D and fall off buildings
(16:52:08) jw: better then making the graphics better
(16:52:13) plachenko: I keep thinking: if they released the original with a jar of piss, would people play it as much?
(16:52:14) jstickeur: No, jw, that's not how you value things
(16:52:21) jstickeur: You value things based on how good they are
(16:52:25) Xander: I do like the extra weapons. I don't think they're bad
(16:52:29) jstickeur: Not on what the intention was when they were done
(16:52:32) jw: you can still play the old one then
(16:52:34) jstickeur: You can use that context, of course
(16:52:41) jstickeur: But it doesn't change that TF2 is currently fucked up
(16:53:00) jstickeur: I hope they fix this item system
(16:53:08) jstickeur: Or just give every player every gun
(16:53:11) plachenko: nope, never going to be fixed
(16:53:13) jstickeur: There's no reason not to do it
(16:53:21) jstickeur: Yeah, I also think so, plachenko
(16:53:27) Xander: I really thought that's how it was going to be. Forsake your achievements to just unlock the weapons
(16:53:29) plachenko: people will complain, jstickeur
(16:53:30) Xander: It was what people wants
(16:53:35) plachenko: they always complain
(16:53:39) plachenko: but they'll complain even more
(16:53:48) Xander: and then we got this madness instead. Who wanted the weapons harder to get?
(16:53:55) plachenko: "I spent x ammount of hours doing stupid achievments and now EVERYONE has the weapon!?"
(16:53:58) jstickeur: It's not just harder to get
(16:54:02) jstickeur: It's completely random
(16:54:02) plachenko: "uninstalled! (not really)"
(16:54:06) jstickeur: Hehe, plachenko
(16:54:22) Xander: It'd be alright if there was a certain way to trigger it. Say each time you win a round you get something? Or a full game? Or a certain amount of kills?
(16:54:36) jstickeur: "now I don't have an advantage over other players anymore, and that in a team based shooter :("
(16:54:37) Cow [mccow28@d75-159-212-38.abhsia.telus.net] entered the room.
(16:54:42) plachenko: I say MVPs get rare items
(16:54:43) jstickeur: Yeah, Xander
(16:54:49) jstickeur: Every 100th kill or something
(16:54:54) jstickeur: Or every time you're an MVP
(16:54:58) plachenko: yeah
(16:55:02) Xander: but just completely and utterly random? I have no way of knowing how long I have to play to unlock things now. And lacking infinite amounts of time
(16:55:06) jw: I liked the old way ):
(16:55:21) jstickeur: It can take 5 minutes or 50 hours, Xander :(
(16:55:27) Xander: I unlocked the Cloak and Dagger earlier, and then nothing else for the next 3 hours
(16:55:39) jstickeur: :O
(16:55:44) jstickeur: I didn't get anything new
(16:55:48) jstickeur: In like 3 hours time today
(16:55:54) Xander: Which granted was a pretty damn cool thing to get, but to know that was just luck is shit
(16:55:59) jstickeur: I did get 15 achievements with the spy though
(16:56:03) plachenko: I got kritzkrieg nat, kgb and an ubersaw
(16:56:06) jstickeur: Which translates to at least 1 new weapon
(16:56:16) Xander: Although.. ironic given Devil Summoner 2 is all about people's LUCK
(16:56:19) plachenko: I deleted everything but KGB foolishly not realizing I can gift them eventually
(16:56:21) jw: I suck at spy man
(16:56:24) jw: today made me realise
(16:56:38) plachenko: what class do you usually play?
(16:56:39) jw: I like the direct classes that are just easy to learn hard to master
(16:56:40) plachenko: pyro?
(16:56:48) jw: pyro soldier medic or heavy
(16:56:54) Cow: moo
(16:56:56) plachenko: hah, knew it ;)
(16:56:58) jw: supcow
(16:57:01) jstickeur: It just seems they look at WoW being popular and put all the worst elements into TF2
(16:57:02) Xander: Well it's not really your fault entirely. I think a lot more people are playing as either spy or sniper, so people are a lot more suspicious of spys
(16:57:05) plachenko: good snipers are pretty good spies.
(16:57:06) Xander: Though they were pretty vigilant before
(16:57:09) jw: pyro was fun
(16:57:09) plachenko: it's all about patience
(16:57:11) jw: but it is easy
(16:57:12) Cow: just playing your game JW
(16:57:14) Cow: pretty funny
(16:57:16) jw: so i try to play it only when were losing
(16:57:18) jw: thanks
(16:57:22) jw: :3
(16:57:37) jstickeur: You can gift the unlocks, plachenko?
(16:57:40) jw: WHY DOES BOX.NET go back to 1% D:
(16:57:43) Xander: I love the Pyro.. the Back Burner and the flare gun really mean anything except a Turret is perfectly withing your capabilities to kill

(16:57:59) Cow: you need to make something serious in 3d
(16:58:00) jw: you can kill a sentry

(17:00:33) Cow: the camera thing is great
