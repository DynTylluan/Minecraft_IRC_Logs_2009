(21:41:03) Cosmic_Fool: Thom Yorke fucked everyones grandmas

(21:42:29) reetva: WOOOAH.
(21:42:49) Cosmic_Fool: just for effect
(21:42:49) reetva: The biggest bullets ever.
(21:43:43) PFawkes: no, the sniper rifle
(21:43:43) PFawkes: should shoot hammers
(21:43:43) reetva: Sledgehammers?
(21:43:43) Cosmic_Fool: No, thats another gun
(21:43:43) Cosmic_Fool: Its called the Throster, and it shoots hammers
