(12:21:42) Stargoat: half the industry can't make music, Ville
(12:21:59) Stargoat: I'm sure whatever crap you come up with it better than 80% of everything
(12:22:08) Stargoat: is better*
(12:22:19) fartron: if you can walk you can dance if you can talk you can sing
(12:22:41) RinkuHero: a lot of indie bands are out of tune though
(12:22:46) Evil-Ville: No stargoat I am somewhere in that 80%
(12:22:53) RinkuHero: although that just gives them some charm
(12:22:56) Stargoat: it's a matter of intent

(12:23:18) Stargoat: if you set out to make something that sounds pleasant, rather than to make money, you're taking one step in the right direction.

(12:24:19) Evil-Ville: I am in for the big bucks
(12:24:22) Stargoat: (not to say making money out of things created is bad)
(12:25:17) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, tell me more
(12:25:51) fartron: money is bad
(12:26:03) Siiseli: money is good it gets me something to drink
(12:26:13) RinkuHero: water is free
(12:26:14) fartron: no that's your hands
(12:26:16) RinkuHero: you can drink the rain
(12:26:17) fartron: hands are the ones getting
(12:26:23) fartron: money is just in the way of your hands
(12:26:35) fartron: makes them do other things besides getting a drink
(12:26:41) Stargoat: I'd like to see money go way, but that isn't going to happen any time soon.
(12:26:41) Siiseli: I carry stuff with my feet
(12:26:43) Evil-Ville: Siiseli I know you drink euroshopper energy drink what's your excuse
(12:26:47) Siiseli: RinkuHero, yes but something that tastes good
(12:26:49) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, no I don't
(12:26:58) Evil-Ville: I've seen a picture don't lie to me
(12:26:58) Stargoat: water tastes good...
(12:27:04) Evil-Ville: I drink mostly water
(12:27:25) Stargoat: I think water tastes sweet. People don't agree with me. They are crazy.
(12:28:07) postlogic: Water is awesome.
(12:28:16) RinkuHero: water tastes very good
(12:28:17) fartron: water does taste good
(12:28:18) nihilocrat: how do you drink mostly water in Europe? They put carbonation in all of it
(12:28:25) RinkuHero: they do?
(12:28:27) nihilocrat: I don't understand why everyone isn't constantly dehydrated
(12:28:29) RinkuHero: even tap water?
(12:28:32) nihilocrat: no
(12:28:34) nihilocrat: but, like
(12:28:37) fartron: nihil that's cause the water isn't as cheap
(12:28:39) fartron: or as clean
(12:28:44) nihilocrat: if you ask for water they give you carbonated water
(12:28:50) RinkuHero: then don't ask for water
(12:28:53) RinkuHero: just drink it from the tap
(12:29:07) nihilocrat: unless you specifically ask for tapwater, and then they give you mean looks
(12:29:12) nihilocrat: I figure that's what people do
(12:29:12) RinkuHero: hahah
(12:29:22) RinkuHero: tap water varies in quality
(12:29:26) RinkuHero: but here around nyc it's very good
(12:29:32) RinkuHero: we've the best tap water in the US by various tests
(12:29:35) fartron: the US has some of the best water infrastructure in the world
(12:29:43) nihilocrat: that's pretty amazing
(12:29:43) fartron: because we wisely invested heavily in it a long time ago
(12:30:04) nihilocrat: I would bet we do just because NC just suffered the worst drought, perhaps in its recorded history,
(12:30:04) fartron: europe on the other hand pays a lot more for their water and doesn't have as good quality control
(12:30:18) fartron: and bubbles are a good way to prove the water you are serving isn't from the tap
(12:30:18) nihilocrat: and the worst that happened is no one got to water their lawns, power wash, etc.
(12:30:23) nihilocrat: and had to get leaky faucets fixed
(12:30:27) Evil-Ville: Finland has tons of water
(12:30:36) fartron: actually the worst that happens is disease
(12:30:36) RinkuHero: that's cause finland has all those fjords
(12:30:40) RinkuHero: or is that norway
(12:30:45) Evil-Ville: That's norway
(12:30:45) fartron: and lots of death
(12:30:46) RinkuHero: ah
(12:32:27) postlogic: Yay fjords <3
(12:32:29) Evil-Ville: Heh http://www.insidethebottle.org/finland-study-finds-tap-water-purer-bottled-water
(12:32:30) nihilocrat: Was the 2007-2008 drought just a southern thing?
(12:32:38) nihilocrat: I don't remember if it happened to other parts of the country
(12:34:09) fartron: i think it was in the southwest too
(12:34:13) fartron: i didn't happen to notice it
(12:34:18) fartron: but i don't have any farmer friends to talk to about it
(12:34:21) nihilocrat: ah, ok
(12:34:23) nihilocrat: well
(12:34:29) nihilocrat: farmers feel droughts way before city folk do
(12:34:34) fartron: so do desert folk
(12:34:45) RinkuHero: tap water is purer than bottled water in the US as well
(12:34:48) RinkuHero: bottled water is kind of a sham
(12:35:00) RinkuHero: except distilled water
(12:35:05) RinkuHero: that's purer than tap, although
(12:35:10) fartron: it is generally, but like i said it has a history in europe of being preferred because of the unreliability of tap
(12:35:11) RinkuHero: it's so pure that it leeches minerals from you
(12:35:14) RinkuHero: since it has none
(12:35:18) RinkuHero: ah
(12:36:07) nihilocrat: that makes sense
(12:36:08) Evil-Ville: You should say something like southern europe instead of europe
(12:36:28) fartron: you should shut your face
(12:36:35) nihilocrat: Southern Italy, by the accounts I have heard, is kind of a sewer
(12:36:36) fartron: america is america
(12:36:40) fartron: and europe is europe
(12:37:00) Stargoat: fartron speaks the truth
(12:37:09) Evil-Ville: No stop saying america you're talking about united states of america
(12:37:10) Evil-Ville: 8)
(12:37:20) fartron: you europeans always say that

(12:42:46) fartron: australia is doomed
(12:43:00) Stargoat: probably

(12:47:56) fartron: decades
(12:48:13) fartron: desertification happens really quick

(12:54:41) RinkuHero: when i was researching for an old game of mine
(12:54:47) RinkuHero: was pretty scary
(12:55:18) fartron: yeah, the whole mess in the congo is about the desert moving into the jungle
(12:57:05) fartron: well that combined with religious and cultural clash
(12:57:15) fartron: but the lack of water really set it off

(13:32:35) pyl: dude
(13:32:37) pyl: no homo
(13:32:57) The_Doctor: It's not a physical installation. It's more of a spiritual thing.

(13:37:39) pyl: shit

(13:40:32) fartron: i see, you mean like a useful popup
(13:40:36) pyl: i click something, the webpage goes nowhere, and the popup is blocked
(13:40:44) fartron: i got ya
(13:40:52) fartron: that is frustrating
(13:40:53) pyl: i mean like the popup is part of the navigation locally on the page
(13:40:59) pyl: i just give up on the page alltogether
(13:41:14) pyl: just like when i encounter a page that's put together with 15 individual flash buttons

(14:23:05) shinygerbil: opera pops up with a little unobtrusive "a pop-up has been blocked" message >_>
(14:23:14) shinygerbil: which you can then click to open the popup
(14:23:36) RinkuHero: chrome does the same

(14:47:14) HannesP: i could use some C++ help... i don't get why this happens
(14:47:47) HannesP: the compiler complains about a class still being abstract when i try to allocate it, but i have overridden all abstract functions
(14:49:27) Kobel: Did you declare them all virtual?
(14:50:33) HannesP: yes... in fact it's only one function
(14:50:38) HannesP: you mean in the hpp file?
(14:50:58) Kobel: I don't think matters where you declare it virtual but yeah

(14:52:06) Z80: (And everyone else.)
(14:52:36) Kobel: Oh so it's something included with SFML that you're overriding?
(14:52:38) Jrsquee is now known as Jr
(14:53:40) Kobel: If it's declared virtual in the base class you actually don't need to declare it virtual again IIRC, all overloadings of that function are automatically virtual
(14:54:10) Androu1: http://www.joystiq.com/photos/pax-2008-cosplay/1010625/ <--- I wanna commit suicide now
(14:54:24) postlogic: I thought it was standard filetype naming to call it just .h and then .cpp ?

(14:58:39) Z80_: Now, while it joins a server...
(14:58:52) Kobel: function has to match exactly
(14:59:02) C418: where is our much beloved jsticker
(14:59:24) Z80_: He is in war, fighting for bananas.
(14:59:26) Z80_: Or something.
(14:59:29) Z80_: I DON'T KNOW.
(14:59:31) HannesP: Kobel: that was it! thank you very much
(14:59:36) Kobel: NP
(14:59:40) C418: a perfect translation for "in berlin, finding a place for eurotig"
(14:59:41) jw left the room (quit: Quit: bai bai).
(14:59:42) HannesP: i'm not used to C++'s oddities... :)
(14:59:56) Kobel: I'd look up all the uses of keyword const
(14:59:58) Kobel: if I were you
(15:00:10) Kobel: It does a lot of different things and it's good to understand all of them
(15:00:20) HannesP: yeah, obviously it has got a lot of new uses since C99 :P
(15:00:27) Kobel: AFK for a bit
(15:00:29) Kobel is now known as AFKobel
(15:02:42) Z80_: I should make a game called Team Fortress 3 and make all of it loading time.
(15:03:03) HannesP: heeh
(15:03:46) KonamiCode [chatzilla@cpe-76-174-91-167.socal.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(15:04:15) Z80_: "Sending loading data to your grave."
(15:04:20) Z80_: "Please wait."
(15:05:05) Z80_: FUCK.

(15:06:37) qubodup [qubodup@brln-4db95307.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(15:06:46) Jr: idea
(15:06:48) Z80: It crashed before I could even join a game.
(15:06:48) Z80: :I
(15:06:49) Jr: I game
(15:06:49) Jr: er
(15:07:00) Z80: iGame ?
(15:07:00) Jr: Idea:  A game focused on the loading screens
(15:07:15) Jr: you know how some have little minigames on the loading screen?
(15:07:17) Jr: or whatever
(15:07:23) Jr: But this would be a crazy easy game
(15:07:40) Jr: but it would have really really artificially long loading screens
(15:07:49) Jr: with little toys
(15:07:58) Super-Dot [Super-Dot@66-240-27-50.isp.comcastbusiness.net] entered the room.

(15:08:11) genericuser [chatzilla@ti541210a080-7048.bb.online.no] entered the room.
(15:08:14) genericuser: Hello!
(15:08:17) Jr: like some physics-based balls or a minigame or something
(15:08:34) qubodup: Jr: patented by fucking nintendo
(15:08:39) Jr: and that would say for a bit until you reached some kind of goal for the loading screen
(15:08:42) Jr: wait really?
(15:08:50) qubodup: Jr: I'll dig up my source for you
(15:08:51) ***Super-Dot closes all the tabs he used for his computer science exam
(15:08:52) Jr: you can't do that
(15:08:55) Super-Dot: ahhhhhhhhh
(15:08:56) qubodup: I think so too
(15:09:09) Super-Dot: it feels good to close tabs you don't use any more
(15:09:10) Jr: Can you patent game mechanics?
(15:09:16) Jr: I don't thinks so
(15:09:21) genericuser: I hope not
(15:09:36) Super-Dot: What did Nintendo supposedly patent?
(15:09:38) qubodup: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading_screen#Minigames
(15:09:40) qubodup: I was wrong
(15:09:41) qubodup: Namco
(15:09:51) qubodup: Namco owns the US Patent for the use of minigames during the initial loading screen
(15:09:56) Jr: yeah, namco has things like that
(15:09:59) Jr: but not patented
(15:10:08) Jr: and I'm talking a game /focused/ on that
(15:10:22) Jr: wait
(15:10:24) Jr: what
(15:10:25) Jr: they do
