(22:07:58) pyl: Sr
(22:08:00) PFawkes: Trico!
(22:08:01) PFawkes: TRICO!
(22:08:02) Jr: i think pfocks is a cool dood.  eh things and doesnt afraid of anything
(22:08:03) SMRobot_ [littleripp@121.212.138.245] entered the room.
(22:08:12) Jr: bobo, I'm working on it right now
(22:08:19) ***PFawkes shoots Jr for using a meme
(22:08:20) Thi3f: SMRobot_, what is "Collisions"? A list?
(22:08:22) Jr: and my teacher is a dumb-butt
(22:08:24) SMRobot_: ya
(22:08:35) SMRobot_: http://pastebin.com/m13fe24d3
(22:08:42) PFawkes: But seriously :( Trico!
(22:08:45) PFawkes: and I'll never get to play irt
(22:08:48) Viridian [chatzilla@cpe-70-113-35-162.austin.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(22:08:56) Thi3f: Mm, it doesn't get filled up like an array
(22:09:06) Thi3f: First time you have to add stuff with Collisions.Add()
(22:09:10) BlademasterBobo: do you know how to use the debugger smrobot
(22:09:17) SMRobot_: sort of
(22:09:22) SMRobot_: kk
(22:09:23) BlademasterBobo: if you just step through the loop
(22:09:28) BlademasterBobo: you could see where it goes out of bounds
(22:09:30) Thi3f: So you're trying to access indexes that hasn't been initialized yet
(22:09:37) tantan: that kittygriffin scares the shit out of me
(22:09:40) SMRobot_: how do I initialise?
(22:09:47) Thi3f: If collisions is a fixed size collection, I'd suggest you use an array instead
(22:09:50) SMRobot_: I was using it like an array to be honest :S
(22:09:53) Viridian: Greetings!
(22:09:55) pyl: run, coward
(22:09:55) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(22:09:55) tantan: i am disturbed
(22:09:56) BlademasterBobo: :P
(22:09:57) pyl: i hunger!
(22:10:04) Viridian: pyl: Sinistar
(22:10:05) tantan: i dunno what it is about it
(22:10:20) Z80: <pyl> best video ever
(22:10:24) Thi3f: Well, everytime you add something to a list, it expands the size available, so you can't access more spaces in it than you have stuff in it
(22:10:25) Z80: Oops, yeah, what I emant.
(22:10:25) _SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(22:10:27) Z80: *meant.
(22:10:28) Z80: :P
(22:10:35) Thi3f: So you can't access [6] for example until you have 7 items in your list
(22:10:41) SMRobot_: kk
(22:10:45) tantan: so, glee is the best thing i've seen come out of fox since AD
(22:10:48) Thi3f: You could fill it up with placeholder data if you still want to use a list
(22:10:50) pyl: Viridian: oh, so was that what i was quoting! thanks for sharing :)
(22:11:06) Viridian: Something wrong?
(22:11:10) Thi3f: Just do a for loop that runs 15 times or something and do Collisions.Add(new Rectangle(blabla));
(22:11:12) PFawkes: have you seen the trico trailer?
(22:11:20) paul|not left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(22:11:23) SMRobot_: no, it's a single screen platformer so I'll always have the same number of tiles
(22:11:25) tantan: yes i have
(22:11:33) BlademasterBobo: Thi3f: If that's a list
(22:11:35) Thi3f: Then go with an array, it's faster
(22:11:37) BlademasterBobo: wouldn't it be stupid to do that
(22:11:39) BlademasterBobo: since like
(22:11:45) SMRobot_: also how do I change res in XNA?
(22:11:47) BlademasterBobo: [] still goes through it like a list
(22:11:53) BlademasterBobo: if it's a real list
(22:12:00) BlademasterBobo: ?
(22:12:01) Thi3f: BlademasterBobo, I don't get what you mean
(22:12:06) tantan: is someone doing the dobbs challenge
(22:12:10) BlademasterBobo: If it's a list, filling it first would be dump
(22:12:12) Thi3f: SMRobot_, let me check the correct parameter name
(22:12:12) BlademasterBobo: *dumb
(22:12:13) BlademasterBobo: no?
(22:12:18) Thi3f: BlademasterBobo, depends on how you're gonna use it
(22:12:34) Thi3f: If you wanna use it as an array, for whatever reason that'd be, you have to do it like that
(22:12:48) Thi3f: Since otherwise it's empty, because you don't supply a list with a size
(22:12:49) BlademasterBobo: yeah but then you should use an array
(22:12:50) BlademasterBobo: :L
(22:12:55) Thi3f: Which is what I said :P
(22:12:58) BlademasterBobo: haha
(22:13:04) BlademasterBobo: Sorry missed it
(22:13:05) Fraeon: You know what I want to do?
(22:13:11) Fraeon: I want to take the internet to the past

(22:14:54) pyl: gryphonratthing is the new hot chick

(22:16:43) Fraeon: pyl, I actually kind of like AVGN when he talks about games he has a history with
(22:16:45) Thi3f: Rectangle[,] Collisions = new Rectangle[15,20];
(22:16:52) Fraeon: They suck of course but it's more interesting that way
(22:16:54) PFawkes: but I might take some of these screens and make me a wallpapetr
(22:16:58) Fraeon: Same with the Nostalgia Critic
(22:17:34) pyl: Fraeon: he's just not funny!
(22:18:34) KonamiCode [chatzilla@cpe-76-174-91-167.socal.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(22:19:06) PFawkes: I kind of like the NC sometimes
(22:19:20) PFawkes: he tends to actually make jokes rather than just swear a lot
(22:19:23) PFawkes: and fake explosions
(22:19:29) PFawkes: >.>
(22:19:51) lansing: SMRobot, you know it might be a good idea to get a book on C#
(22:20:40) PFawkes: http://i36.tinypic.com/2czc29t.jpg :D
(22:20:41) SMRobot_: I should eh?
(22:20:45) Thi3f: I shouldn't stay up all night playing ukulele and watching the O.C:
(22:20:45) SMRobot_: any good ones you know of?
(22:20:49) BlademasterBobo: loooooooooool
(22:20:50) Thi3f: Yes
(22:20:51) Thi3f: Uh
(22:20:51) Fraeon: Like I said, when he has a history with the game, the end result is usually more than just the AVGN swearing
(22:20:54) Thi3f: Let me check the name
(22:20:55) Jr: COOOOOOOOONKY
(22:21:01) PFawkes: yes yes

(22:21:48) Thi3f: Guh, I still have my books in boxes
(22:21:49) SMRobot: it's inconsistent
(22:21:54) BlademasterBobo: that's how I learned C++
(22:21:56) Thi3f: And I can't remember the author
(22:21:58) BlademasterBobo: On the internets
(22:22:12) SMRobot: kk
(22:22:15) Thi3f: BlademasterBobo, the internet is good, but a good book is never bad
(22:22:23) BlademasterBobo: ....
(22:22:25) PFawkes: Jr, thanks for reccomending the conky
(22:22:28) PFawkes: it is useful

(22:23:01) BlademasterBobo: Dragonmaw is a fag
(22:23:01) Jr: Peifocks, no problem
(22:23:02) Thi3f: There's alot of crap code on the internet, with a book at least you get consistency
(22:23:09) Jr: ITS AWSUM
(22:23:12) lansing: SMRobot, if you asked in the C# channel on freenode you'd get good answers as to which book is best

(22:49:10) BlademasterBobo: the irony is that stargoat will probably hate it
(22:49:12) Fraeon: Haha
(22:49:14) BlademasterBobo: because he's a diehard fan
(22:49:16) Fraeon: DSP has gone mad

(22:49:44) Drakkar: didn't realise beta didn't start yet
(22:49:45) BlademasterBobo: you have brood war right
(22:49:45) Drakkar: whoops
(22:50:09) Drakkar: well beta signups require blizzard games
(22:50:17) Drakkar: so its either diehard fans or blizzard fanboys
(22:50:32) BlademasterBobo: those sentences
(22:50:34) BlademasterBobo: they make no sense
(22:50:40) BlademasterBobo: rephrase yourself mang
(22:51:04) Stargoat: bobo: To "opt-in" to the beta, you need a blizzard game reg'd with the new battle.net
(22:51:08) Drakkar: you cannot set yourself as a beta participant unless you have a -
(22:51:09) Drakkar: yeah
(22:51:17) BlademasterBobo: oh
(22:51:23) BlademasterBobo: I just used my old copy of D2

(22:51:41) Drakkar: so unfortunately I can't
(22:51:42) Stargoat: yeah...
(22:51:45) fartron: i have boudoir
(22:51:49) Stargoat: I can't find my D2 or WCIII keys
(22:51:52) BlademasterBobo: we could play d2 someday
(22:52:04) BlademasterBobo: stargoat just find someone giving away their keys
(22:52:10) BlademasterBobo: and then steal it
(22:52:12) BlademasterBobo: and use it
(22:52:14) BlademasterBobo: :D
(22:52:15) Stargoat: heh
(22:52:19) Drakkar: I'm probably just gonna rebuy it
(22:52:25) Drakkar: its not that expensive to purchase the keys online
(22:52:29) Drakkar: like 5 bucks or something for each
(22:52:29) BlademasterBobo: Wakkawakkawakka
(22:52:40) Stargoat: I have Diablo II installed on here
(22:52:43) BlademasterBobo: it's too bad that this pretty much means you can't buy blizzard games used anymore
(22:52:47) BlademasterBobo: even if they're old copies
(22:52:48) Stargoat: I wonder if it tells me the key somewhere
(22:52:49) BlademasterBobo: :L
(22:53:15) Drakkar: yeah but that being said
(22:53:27) Drakkar: it's pretty much expected nowadays
(22:53:32) Drakkar: stuff liek GOG and steam
(22:53:34) Drakkar: like*
(22:53:41) Drakkar: are eliminating hard media
(22:53:44) Stargoat: hmm
(22:53:48) Stargoat: this is true
(22:53:50) BlademasterBobo: it's actually good
(22:53:55) BlademasterBobo: imo
(22:53:58) Dragonene: jaaaaaayarrrrrr
(22:54:00) BlademasterBobo: there is no reason not to
(22:54:05) Dragonene: Jr: Did you see the dawn thingy?
(22:54:06) Stargoat: I dunno, there's a something about owning a hard copy of a game
(22:54:07) Drakkar: I agree and disagree
(22:54:14) BlademasterBobo: Stargoat: Yeah, but if you really need it
(22:54:18) BlademasterBobo: maybe a collectors edition
(22:54:20) Drakkar: but my disagreement is purely my own fetish for cds
(22:54:22) Stargoat: but then again, digital distribution is very convenient/
(22:54:22) BlademasterBobo: but normal boxed copies
(22:54:27) BlademasterBobo: are a waste
(22:54:30) BlademasterBobo: .
(22:54:35) Drakkar: :D
(22:54:49) Drakkar: I mean that in a completely nonsexual sort of way btw
(22:55:02) BlademasterBobo: does an old copy of wc3 net you the frozen throne?
(22:55:03) BlademasterBobo: :O
(22:55:07) Drakkar: .
(22:55:07) Drakkar: ooh
(22:55:10) Stargoat: I don't think so
(22:55:13) Stargoat: because tft has its own cdkey
(22:55:14) Drakkar: that'd be awesome if it did
(22:55:14) BlademasterBobo: :(
(22:55:17) lansing: if it's all digital distribution, what will the poor game shopkeeps do?
(22:55:21) BlademasterBobo: so did brood war, though
(22:55:30) Stargoat: no it didn't
(22:55:30) Drakkar: sell console games
(22:55:38) lansing: Drakkar, and when they go digital too?
(22:55:49) Drakkar: there will be no more going outside
(22:55:50) Drakkar: clearly
(22:56:13) Stargoat: outside sucks anyway
(22:56:19) Stargoat: it hurts my eyes and my skin gets burnt
(22:56:38) Dragonene: But outside is the path to Blackmail!
(22:56:39) SMRobot: wow
(22:56:39) fartron: also there are bears
(22:56:44) SMRobot: my code is incredibly broken
(22:56:48) Dragonene: It's a challenge
(22:56:50) Dragonene: you have to endure it
(22:56:59) Stargoat: fartron spekas the truth
(22:57:03) Stargoat: there certainly arn't bears inside
(22:57:05) SMRobot: time to start from scratch
(22:57:08) Stargoat: unless you're quite unfortunate.
(22:57:27) Stargoat: SMRobot, have you ever made tic-tac-toe?
(22:57:48) Jr: Dragonene: I'm not in bed yet

(22:58:01) Jr: I did see it
(22:58:06) Jr: it's nice
(22:58:12) Jr: but I think I need to fix my palette
(22:58:13) _SMRobot: my collision system was pretty shite
(22:58:14) tantan: shawn johnson has gotten chunky
(22:58:22) tantan: still cute though
(22:58:26) _SMRobot: but now I understand what I'm doing a lot better
(22:58:30) tantan: and not out of my league age wise
(22:58:32) tantan: woooooooo
(22:58:48) Dragonene: Jr: No, your palette is great
(22:58:53) Dragonene: my pixelation is meh

(22:59:31) Jr: there needs to be some highlight
(22:59:40) Jr: in the warm colours
(22:59:46) Jr: one of them should be lighter
(23:00:00) Dragonene: I don't know
(23:00:03) Dragonene: I'm not sure I agree
(23:00:10) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(23:00:19) Dragonene: although maybe the brighter of the two blue tones should be a bit more distinct from the darker one
(23:01:59) jasongrlicky [jasongrlic@173.8.200.186] entered the room.
(23:02:07) Jr: yeah, I was thinking that too
(23:02:15) Jr: but it looks real nice on the darkest

(23:40:26) Dragonene: everyone likes both of those PFawkes
(23:40:29) Jrds: i like sleep
(23:40:38) Dragonene: you just don't like waking up from it?
(23:40:40) Dragonene: I know the feeling.
(23:40:52) Jrds: i like waking up
(23:41:04) Jrds: new day, etc
(23:41:10) Jrds: just not school
(23:41:30) Jrds: or inturrupting what i am doing
(23:41:38) PFawkes: dragonene, what do you think http://i37.tinypic.com/2a842yt.jpg
(23:41:55) Jrds: so i take about a half hour to leave school too
(23:42:05) Z80: PFawkes, is that your new desktop background?
(23:42:07) Jrds left the room (quit: Quit: sleep).
(23:42:08) PFawkes: yes
(23:42:13) Z80: :o
(23:42:45) Dragonene: PFawkes: awesome, except for that huge "project trico" logo
(23:42:48) Dragonene: it bothers me
(23:42:49) PFawkes: Hey now
(23:42:56) PFawkes: I picked this one because it has that
(23:43:02) Dragonene: also
(23:43:04) PFawkes: alse it's not got any motion blur
(23:43:05) Dragonene: why does it have two logos
(23:43:09) Dragonene: it's silly
(23:43:10) PFawkes: weeelll
(23:43:12) PFawkes: see
(23:43:13) PFawkes: it's from the trailer
(23:43:20) PFawkes: so this is the big title bit
(23:43:35) PFawkes: but the trailer also has the PSL logo and the Trico logo
(23:43:42) PFawkes: one of which I have tastefully removes
(23:44:28) PFawkes: I might use this one and crop it though http://playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/psls-trico-61995.jpg
(23:44:33) Dragonene: agh
(23:44:38) Dragonene: I can't tell what OS you're using
(23:44:58) PFawkes: haha!
(23:45:01) PFawkes: why not?
(23:45:08) PFawkes: is it not obvious
(23:45:32) Dragonene: Well see
(23:45:36) Dragonene: I'm guessing it's linux
(23:45:37) Lakmir [Lakmir@c-24-34-140-155.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(23:45:39) Dragonene: some dist
(23:45:46) Dragonene: but it's just close enough to the windows look that it could be a windows skin
(23:46:07) PFawkes: nah, tis a linux
(23:46:13) Dragonene: I'm mostly basing my guess on the fact that you have a folder called "Windows"
(23:46:35) PFawkes: I have a folder called windows because it's a symbolic link to my windows partition >.>
(23:46:43) Z80: Learn to Fly was fun.

(23:47:44) Z80: YOU BASTARD.
(23:47:50) Z80: Those poor Hydralisks...
(23:47:51) Z80: :(

(23:48:23) fartron: but later yes
(23:48:24) Z80: Ah, I see.
(23:48:49) BlademasterBobo: stargoat it is damn hard to attack and build 
(23:48:54) ***Dragonene listens to Karma Police
(23:48:56) Stargoat: D:

(23:49:10) BlademasterBobo: :S
(23:49:17) ***Z80 watches as Stargoat slits his wrist.
(23:49:18) Stargoat: Z80 never played Starcraft?
(23:49:25) Z80: Nope.
(23:49:29) Stargoat: oh my
(23:49:29) BlademasterBobo: :O
(23:49:32) Campster: He is too young.
(23:49:37) BlademasterBobo: 10 is a young age
(23:49:38) ***Stargoat feels old
(23:49:40) Z80: :I
(23:49:40) BlademasterBobo: but not that young
(23:49:40) PFawkes: but you know
(23:49:45) PFawkes: the thing about trico is
(23:49:46) Dragonene: No such thing as too young for Starcraft.
(23:49:51) Dragonene: It's a must-play.
(23:49:53) PFawkes: they seem not to have modern games down
(23:49:56) Campster: I force babies to play Starcraft.
(23:49:57) PFawkes: see, it's BROWN, sure
(23:50:04) Campster: They're not very good. :(
(23:50:06) PFawkes: but no eternal bloom effect
(23:50:12) PFawkes: on everything
(23:50:16) Campster: Korean Starcraft it is not.
(23:50:16) Dragonene: heh
(23:50:28) MegabitMonday [WickedbitW@c-67-188-18-170.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
(23:50:41) Stargoat: Starcraft is a cool game. Flawed, but fun. Nostalgia certainly plays a part.
(23:50:42) Dragonene: I've given all I can, it's... not enough
(23:50:54) BlademasterBobo: flawed how?
(23:50:57) Stargoat: I love the video clip to Karma Police.
(23:51:05) MegabitMonday: flawed because it is an RTS
(23:51:06) Stargoat: bobo: The UI is terrible :p
(23:51:12) Dragonene: I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll
(23:51:15) Campster: I like how everyone is saying how hideous the trailer for Trico is, and all I can think is "That is some fancy pants animation."
(23:51:26) Dragonene: Campster: It's hardly hideous
(23:51:28) Stargoat: hideous?
(23:51:34) MegabitMonday: Trico?
(23:51:34) Campster: This has been GAF's response, not my own.
(23:51:34) PFawkes: I love Starcraft :(
(23:51:34) Stargoat: it makes me want to play Ico.
(23:51:36) Dragonene: It's adorably fantastic
(23:51:42) Campster: I think it's incredibly impressive.
(23:51:43) PFawkes: Campster, i like the trailer
(23:51:46) PFawkes: I want to play it so badly
(23:51:49) Stargoat: PFawkes, join the tigs sc compo
(23:51:50) Dragonene: Me too
(23:51:50) ***PFawkes lacks a ps3
(23:51:52) MegabitMonday: what is Trico?
(23:51:54) Campster: SC compo?
(23:51:57) PFawkes: You know Ico
(23:52:00) PFawkes: and SoTC?
(23:52:01) MegabitMonday: yes
(23:52:03) PFawkes: it's the new one
(23:52:05) Campster: Don't tell me there's a new compo
(23:52:05) Dragonene: It's not that
(23:52:06) MegabitMonday: :O
(23:52:08) PFawkes: that's got a trailer out

(23:52:24) MegabitMonday: that was fast
(23:52:31) Dragonene: I had it open in my browser.
(23:52:32) PFawkes: sort of like replacing yorda with something AWESOME
(23:52:33) Campster: (It is better to watch the Trico trailer in HD)
(23:52:34) PFawkes: see
(23:53:00) PFawkes: but I am sad, as I lack a ps3 to play it on
(23:53:09) Dragonene: I haven't even played Ico or SotC
(23:53:11) Dragonene: I don't have a PS2
(23:53:14) Dragonene: :'(
(23:53:21) Campster: They're different.
(23:53:28) PFawkes: I love SoTC
(23:53:29) Campster: I like them, but they're definitely not to everyone's taste.
(23:53:32) PFawkes: Ico... it's pretty
(23:53:38) PFawkes: but I didn't enjoy it so much
(23:53:39) ***Dragonene listens to In Rainbows

(23:53:59) Dragonene: I don't even have Kid A on my archos
(23:54:02) PFawkes: :D
(23:54:04) Stargoat: :|
(23:54:04) Campster: They're both slow-ish, and very based around generating a certain sense of empathy not just with the characters but sort of the world they inhabit.
(23:54:17) PFawkes: I just remember the flying snake collosus
(23:54:22) PFawkes: and how amazing it is
(23:54:24) Campster: Their games have a bit of a That Game Company vibe to 'em.
(23:54:27) Dragonene: I convinced my friend to buy SotC
(23:54:32) Dragonene: I don't think he regretted it :D
(23:54:45) Stargoat: I will listen to Squarepusher.
(23:55:03) Campster: I have that horrible Rap Chop song stuck in my head.
(23:55:15) PFawkes: I think I'll listen to something...
(23:55:15) Campster: I hate YouTube.
(23:55:17) PFawkes: Hm
(23:55:41) Campster: The Freakazoid theme song.
(23:55:41) PFawkes: yes! I will watch the URU Music Video
(23:55:45) Campster: Or that.
(23:55:48) PFawkes: it makes me so sad :(
(23:56:16) Stargoat: I will play JA2. It makes me angry. But it's awesome.
(23:56:38) MegabitMonday: do ico/sotc/trico all take place in the same universe?
(23:57:06) MegabitMonday: because the world seems really...consistent
(23:57:08) Z80: Jeeves is an Asshole 2
(23:57:10) MegabitMonday: in style
(23:57:13) Z80: Sounds like fun, Stargoat/

(23:58:17) PFawkes: yes
(23:58:19) Campster: Sort of.
(23:58:19) PFawkes: they do
(23:58:26) Campster: I don't think we know about this one yet.
(23:58:28) Dragonene: I like In Rainbows, because it sounds more like hail to the thief.
(23:58:28) PFawkes: but not in an actual sequel-style way
(23:58:30) Campster: But it certainly looks possible.
(23:58:32) PFawkes: you know what I mean?
(23:58:57) PFawkes: i.e. it's not clear if one comes before the other, or even if they happen in the same place

(00:12:30) lansing: no

(00:12:50) Drakkar: yep
(00:12:52) PFawkes: it's all a trick

(00:40:44) Dragonene: Adulthood sounds like it sucks as much as studenthood
(00:40:51) Dragonene: Which is naturally the stage before adulthood.
(00:40:53) Cthulhu32: student hood = homework
(00:41:04) Dragonene: Yes
(00:41:07) Dragonene: I'm doing homework right now
(00:41:07) Siiseli: it's like studenthood.. without homework or alcohol..

(00:41:59) Dragonene: Fantastic, innit?
(00:42:07) Siiseli: yay
(00:42:17) Dragonene: That's the plan, anyway

(00:42:31) Dragonene: Yes, millionaired is a word.
(00:42:42) Cthulhu32: masters in comp sci = 100k salary
(00:43:13) Dragonene: Cthulhu32: Scary random fact: In a few weeks, when I've taken the exams for my current subjects, I'll have enough uni points to begin my thesis work
(00:43:15) Siiseli: I'm gonna go shower
(00:43:27) Dragonene: After which I'll have a master's degree in computer science.
(00:43:27) Cthulhu32: oh snaps

(00:43:46) Cthulhu32: ahh went from undergrad straight to grad?
(00:43:53) Dragonene: well we don't have that system
(00:44:05) Dragonene: you pick either bachelor or master from the start.
(00:44:29) Cthulhu32: ahh gotcha
(00:44:38) Dragonene: so I don't have any degree at all, but I've studied for almost 4 years. This education used to be four and a half year and gets translated into a master's

(00:45:25) Dragonene: The reason is I'm on exchange studies in australia
(00:45:34) Dragonene: and finding somewhere to do my thesis work from here seems too complicated
(00:45:43) Cthulhu32: yeah, sounds fun though
(00:45:43) Dragonene: So I'm just going to go back and study for a while more first.

(02:43:26) Ciahnensy: I don't like questions when they look like his.
(02:43:30) BlademasterBobo: Was he abused by a question growing up? Did the question beat you, Ciahnensy?
(02:43:31) BlademasterBobo: oh
(02:43:39) Ciahnensy: Weird statement sentence thingies with questions marks on the end.
(02:43:59) Lord_Ash: no don't say that !
(02:44:02) BlademasterBobo: ?
(02:44:07) BlademasterBobo: *No don't say that?!

(02:57:15) Ciahnensy: Hot and steamy.
(02:57:26) lansing: Cold and refreshing.
(02:57:27) The_Doctor: We... haven't had a working shower in my house for a few days.
(02:57:39) Ciahnensy: George is squeaky clean.
(02:57:49) The_Doctor: Yes
(02:58:18) lansing: squeaky wheel gets the grease
(02:58:27) Ciahnensy: And no tiny spiders were in the bathroom.

(03:00:01) MegabitMonday: AUGH
(03:00:02) Arne: how is opera?
(03:00:07) MegabitMonday: An entire two days!
(03:00:11) MegabitMonday is now known as WickedbitWed
(03:00:12) Arne: compared to ff?
(03:00:24) Arne: I haven't used it in a while
(03:00:26) lansing: Arne, I find it zippier and more consitent
(03:00:38) Arne: FF has gotten kinda bloated
(03:00:49) Ciahnensy: Been using Opera for a long time now and I don't have complaints.
(03:01:04) Arne: although Opera probably is too, a lot of stuff is built in which ff has as extensions
(03:01:09) lansing: I don't have FF on this computer, but on my other one, which is quad core and has 8GB of ram, it takes like 20 seconds to start and churns when I start typing things in the address bar.  really... wtf.
(03:01:15) Arne: but I'm mainly thinking about image scaling issues
(03:01:28) lansing: Opera on the same computer works great.
(03:01:36) Arne: ah, I'll try it out then
(03:02:15) Arne: 7.9mb
(03:02:19) Arne: that's pretty small
(03:02:38) Arne: for the dmg that is
(03:02:57) Arne: I'm on mac os btw
(03:03:08) lansing: dmg, I figured

(03:03:46) Siiseli: how the fuck do you get out of the water place

(03:04:06) Siiseli: I still want to
(03:04:10) ramdance-: I need to make a iphone shizzle
(03:04:12) Siiseli: so
(03:04:13) Siiseli: how
(03:04:17) Lord_Ash: hey Rand
(03:04:18) Arne: collect fish and they will zip around
(03:04:31) Arne: giving you a clue, perhaps
(03:04:32) Evil-Ville: Well basically you bounce around the cave randomly until you find things and then the game ends
(03:04:45) Siiseli: ergh
(03:04:57) Siiseli: Arne, well I've got a lot of fish strolling about
(03:05:17) Siiseli: oh
(03:05:20) Siiseli: I found something
(03:05:45) The_Doctor: Were you talking to me?
(03:05:49) Lord_Ash: yes
(03:06:00) Arne: well, just sit still and watch them for clues
(03:06:13) The_Doctor: Sup
(03:06:20) Lord_Ash: havent seen yu in awhile bud, how are you ?
(03:06:59) The_Doctor: I'm alright, really. Currently plotting the enjoyment of iced tea.
(03:07:10) Siiseli: Arne, yeah already figured it out
(03:07:12) Lord_Ash: right on, got a bit of that myself
(03:07:16) Siiseli: The_Doctor, ever so much fun
(03:08:08) KingAl left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:08:14) The_Doctor: Well, to be honest, I did just finish coding a program that has a character walk around the screen using the arrow keys, as well as using 6 frames of animation for each direction of walking
(03:08:22) KingAl [AlKing_@203-214-153-235.perm.iinet.net.au] entered the room.
(03:08:31) Lord_Ash: thats pretty good
(03:08:45) Siiseli: aww, disappointing ending
(03:08:48) Lord_Ash: I did something similar for m final in 2d game dev
(03:09:12) Lord_Ash: in C ?   what api ?
(03:09:22) The_Doctor: I use FreeBASIC
(03:09:38) The_Doctor: The program also plays .ptcop files
(03:09:46) The_Doctor: and has dialogue boxes
(03:10:02) Lord_Ash: awesome
(03:10:08) Lord_Ash: mine does not do that
(03:10:19) Lord_Ash: it plays midi though
(03:10:52) Lord_Ash: it has solid tiles, but the enemy collision stuff isnt built yet
(03:11:09) Lord_Ash: well, with tiles its there, but not attacking
(03:11:33) The_Doctor: I'm currently using a tile sheet for Laharl from Disgaea as a placeholder
(03:11:44) Lord_Ash: also I turned some heads in class, apparently using a 4d array is unusual
(03:12:21) Lord_Ash: I rendered out a guy and color reduced him, looks very 8bit

(03:15:15) Lord_Ash: cool, that was one of my worst problems, I had no real direction in how I wanted to go
(03:15:18) iZ80: :(
(03:15:29) Lord_Ash: it was all just adding stuffto satisfy assignments
(03:15:37) The_Doctor: http://buzinkai.net/screen.png
(03:16:04) Lord_Ash: I missed a bit on using mappy with c and allegro, 
(03:16:16) Lord_Ash: nice
(03:16:22) The_Doctor: Just reached my 300th line of code.
(03:16:28) Lord_Ash: going for final fantasy or legend of mana ?
(03:16:29) iZ80: I should sleep.  I have to meet all my new teachers tomorrow.
(03:16:32) The_Doctor: Haha
(03:16:56) Lord_Ash: I get to stay up, I just finished class today, 
(03:16:58) The_Doctor: I did it in 5 minutes in paint. I'll probably fix it up.
(03:17:04) iZ80: In other words: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
(03:17:09) Lord_Ash: schooooool's out for summer
(03:17:22) The_Doctor: I'm just happy because it draws with like: draw_box(x,y,l,w,string$)

(03:18:27) Lord_Ash: is ok
(03:18:48) Lord_Ash: I may push it though and try to get 2 degrees
(03:19:04) Lord_Ash: just associates, but it will give me a bacxkup plan

(03:19:41) Lord_Ash: get my lib arts, and the get an AAS inweb design on the side, I can try to get work as a code monkey for some shop
(03:19:55) iZ80: History is really great.  I have a teacher who plays Bob Dylan during class in relation to the Civil Rights Movement.
(03:20:14) Lord_Ash: I only have like an extra semester to get the second degree
(03:20:20) Lord_Ash: right on
(03:20:46) Lord_Ash: Ill be going online, so It probably going to just be a lot of reading and some papers
(03:21:00) iZ80: Also we watched a movie about Women's Suffrage.
(03:21:20) Lord_Ash: rigt on
(03:21:21) Ciahnensy: Look at that capitalization.

(03:22:06) Lord_Ash: Rand: what is next for you ?
(03:22:24) iZ80: Ciah loves CPD a bit too much.
(03:22:35) Ciahnensy: I've hardly played the game.
(03:22:42) iZ80: If you know what I mean.
(03:22:48) Ciahnensy: I do not.
(03:23:05) iZ80: (Wink wink nudge nudge)
(03:23:12) Ciahnensy: Look at that parentheses usage.
(03:23:13) The_Doctor: Right now, I'm working on integrating the simple collision
(03:23:22) Lord_Ash: GTA: crayon capers
(03:23:33) dom: that would be awesome

(03:24:45) The_Doctor: S'alright. They have pills for that.

(03:24:54) Lord_Ash: "ok billy, here's the deal, you gotta wait till nap time then sneak over to the cubbies and get Sarah Wlmenker's Gempop Ring, dig ?"

(03:25:28) dom: there was a level in vice City where you got drunk and had to drive, that was spooky
(03:25:30) The_Doctor: If you don't know
(03:25:38) The_Doctor: then you weren't there when it became a meme

(03:26:48) Siiseli: uhm.. movie
(03:27:00) haowan: that is a movie, don't question me
(03:27:03) iZ80: GTA: The fuck?
(03:27:05) The_Doctor: I highly suggest...
(03:27:12) The_Doctor: Night of the Living Dead
(03:27:22) The_Doctor: ...2
(03:27:26) iZ80: It would be dadaist, see.
(03:27:31) The_Doctor: Return of the Living Dead, actually.
(03:27:47) haowan: is that not Dawn of the Dead?
(03:28:19) Siiseli:  I've seen it :-D
(03:28:25) The_Doctor: Well, there was a movie made called Return of the Living Dead, that was not REALLY a sequal to the original, but it's hilarious
(03:28:27) iZ80: GTA: We Should Stop Making These
(03:28:27) Siiseli: best movie ever.. *cough*
(03:28:36) Siiseli: iZ80, :D
(03:28:42) lansing: which one had the boomstick?

(03:29:38) iZ80: GTA: I'm Tired and Want to go home to my wife.
(03:29:47) The_Doctor: Though not a zombie movie at all
(03:29:53) Lord_Ash: GTA: "Hall Street" White Collar Crime Edition
(03:29:58) Siiseli: though haowan that looks rather nice
(03:30:21) iZ80: GTA: You will code or you will never see your wife again, ya hear?
(03:30:25) lansing: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/quotes  Alright you Primitive Screwheads, listen up! You see this? This... is my boomstick! The twelve-gauge double-barreled Remington. S-Mart's top of the line. You can find this in the sporting goods department. 
(03:30:40) The_Doctor: Or if you're not into that kind of thing, try... The Cat Returns, by Studio Ghibli

(03:31:04) Siiseli: The_Doctor, I think I've seen all ghibli movies
(03:31:18) The_Doctor: Haha, nuts then.
(03:32:09) haowan: GTA: we've lost the plot and forgotten what made GTA games fun
(03:32:47) The_Doctor: Wasn't the game originally british?
(03:32:59) haowan: still is
(03:33:06) haowan: rockstar north is in scotland
(03:33:27) Siiseli: GTA: Fuck it, it's got guns women booze and you can do whatever the fuck you want stop complaining this is what you want from lif
(03:33:29) The_Doctor: Huh. And yet the games... blow nowadays.
(03:33:46) haowan: yeah
(03:33:52) The_Doctor: Granted, I haven't played a GTA since 3
(03:33:57) haowan: well san andreas was a masterpiece imo
(03:34:23) haowan: and so was vice city, but IV is just... total balls
(03:34:29) Dragonmaw: GTA2
(03:34:30) lansing: I've only ever played vice and sa, both get boring after awhile.
(03:34:32) Dragonmaw: Best game in the series

(03:35:14) Dragonene: I did well.
(03:35:17) The_Doctor: Good job
(03:35:28) Dragonene: Such a shame that I had to practice this waking up thing as well
(03:35:35) Dragonene: ta, doctor
(03:35:44) Dragonene: It wasn't easy.
(03:36:30) dom: I prefer to actually sleep instead of practising.
(03:37:07) Lord_Ash: Rand: if you need any help, just ask
(03:37:23) lansing: Lord_Ash, you know it's really weird to use peoples names instead of their irc nick when talking to them on irc
(03:37:37) ***dom really is called Dom
(03:38:17) Lord_Ash: hes been AtrusRand, Rand, to me so long now, hard to call him anything else
(03:38:19) Lord_Ash: sry
(03:38:22) dom: or at least my name is Dominic, as you can tell from my /whois information (which I clearly could have forged, but didn't) - ask Ciahnensy 
(03:38:23) Lord_Ash: Doc then
(03:39:14) ***lansing gives up
(03:39:26) Lord_Ash: and how are you lans ?
(03:39:32) lansing: are you talking to me?
(03:39:33) dom: I gave up years ago.
(03:39:38) Lord_Ash: yes
(03:40:20) lansing: Lord_Ash, fine, right now I'm piecing together a 2d engine, redoing my last attempt from scratch
(03:40:37) Lord_Ash: cool, what language ?
(03:41:04) lansing: Haskell
(03:41:12) Lord_Ash: scary
(03:41:16) lansing: why?
(03:41:25) lansing: it's really high level
(03:41:42) lansing: safe too
(03:41:44) Lord_Ash: haskell, functional lang 9in general, scare me a bit
(03:42:03) Lord_Ash: try in ten yearsmaybe I will be more profficient then
(03:42:35) Lord_Ash: also, I hate python
(03:42:42) lansing: how much you know already has nothing to do with how easy Hasekll is
(03:43:03) lansing: and if you're suggesting it, python is not a functional language, it's imperative
(03:43:26) Pepe left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:43:31) Lord_Ash: eh, maybe, all the examples Ive seen look very  complex
(03:43:49) Lord_Ash: no not at all, I just hate python
(03:43:58) lansing: well, one you learn a few basic concepts, it's all easy to understand
(03:44:10) lansing: yeah, I don't know any python, I can't see any reason to learn it
(03:44:20) Lord_Ash: hard enough for me to try to think in curly race language, intermezzo style just gets in my way
(03:44:35) Lord_Ash: it runs on top of everything
(03:44:47) Lord_Ash: only reason I learned it
(03:44:50) lansing: hm, what do you mean it runs on top of everything?
(03:45:10) ramdance-: well
(03:45:14) ramdance-: I will tell you
(03:45:15) Lord_Ash: python is implemented as a scrtipting language in many many softwares
(03:45:24) lansing: Lord_Ash, so? you can do this with other languages too
(03:45:41) ramdance-: my lazah is not racist, it destroys everyone.
(03:45:43) ramdance-: :3
(03:45:48) Lord_Ash: is already implemented as a scripting language in many many softwares
(03:46:09) lansing: Lord_Ash, lua, ruby, postscript, java, c#... all are embeddable
(03:46:17) Lord_Ash: lua looks cool
(03:46:34) lansing: Lord_Ash, hell, even C is embeddable if you use libtcc
(03:46:56) Lord_Ash: can be and is already are very different weights though
(03:47:18) Notch [Notch@static-213-115-28-4.sme.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(03:47:22) lansing: right, so going back to the reason you learned python, it's not really much of a reason given that so many other languages are embeddable too
(03:47:24) lansing: :)
(03:47:26) The_Doctor: I'm going to go to sleep, methinks.
(03:47:31) Lord_Ash: python is part of blender, python is part of poser, and a cpl other things laying around
(03:47:45) Notch: good morning all
(03:48:01) Lord_Ash: I learned python so I could interact, script, softwares that use it
(03:48:14) lansing: fair call
(03:48:18) lansing: morning Notch
(03:48:27) Lord_Ash: honestly, I wish Id taken another semester of java or C#, 
(03:48:40) Arne: speed dial is real handy
(03:48:45) Arne: in Opera
(03:48:55) lansing: sure is
(03:49:32) Lord_Ash: I did learn a little bit more about OOP, and I did a cpl things with regular expressions
(03:49:40) Lord_Ash: regex is hard
(03:49:41) krabbo left the room (quit: Quit: great psychedilic gothic romp - http://www.krabbitonline.com).
(03:50:23) Notch: yes, it is
(03:50:34) Lord_Ash: dont get me wrong, python is useful, I just dont care for it
(03:51:37) Lord_Ash: well, it has a few things I like
(03:52:05) Lord_Ash: 12 lines of code to make a notepad clone is cool
(03:52:13) Notch: whoa, really? =D
(03:52:36) lansing: you can probably do that in other languages too if they have the appropriate libraries
(03:52:43) Siiseli: :D
(03:52:51) Lord_Ash: yeah, like most stuff that uses tcl/tk I think
(03:53:20) Siiseli: hey I'm now free from school until monday
(03:53:25) Siiseli: and that'll be my last week
(03:53:56) Lord_Ash: so I have like 2 months of summer to do something productive
(03:54:06) ramdance-: hey
(03:54:14) Lord_Ash: Im thinking of trying to knock out some little flash games
(03:54:18) ramdance-: I might do a let's play
(03:54:22) ramdance-: it sounds like fun
(03:54:49) Siiseli: yay
(03:54:49) ramdance-: what game should I play?
(03:54:52) Siiseli: do that
(03:54:54) ramdance-: ^-^
(03:54:57) Siiseli: rayman for the psx
(03:54:58) Stargoat: always the last fucking guy
(03:55:03) Stargoat: complacency is the biggest killer in JA2
(03:55:08) Siiseli: or lyle in cube sector
(03:55:42) Notch: ramdance-: Dungeon Master 2!
(03:56:04) ramdance-: no
(03:56:14) Siiseli: well.. uuh
(03:56:14) ramdance-: be serious
(03:56:16) Siiseli: I am
(03:56:18) Siiseli: I really am
(03:56:34) ramdance-: was talking to notch
(03:56:39) Siiseli: ah
(03:56:54) Notch: Gah, I liked it
(03:57:07) Notch: and it feels like nobody else played it
(03:58:43) ramdance-: oh
(03:58:54) ramdance-: I should play a short game
(03:59:28) JamesGecko [james@adsl-219-4-88.asm.bellsouth.net] entered the room.
(03:59:53) Notch: what genre?
(04:00:20) ramdance-: dunno
(04:00:35) ramdance-: was thinking of doing a game only out in japan
(04:00:53) ramdance-: because that would be a good start
(04:01:02) Notch: Mad TV!
(04:01:09) ramdance-: it would have to be on a portable system
(04:01:12) ramdance-: or on the wii
(04:01:24) Notch: space invaders extreme?
(04:01:25) ramdance-: because I wont pirate it
(04:01:28) ramdance-: oh
(04:01:36) ramdance-: that's a good idea
(04:01:43) Notch: yay =D
(04:01:55) Notch: I was starting to feel uncool for a moment there
(04:03:09) Siiseli: ramdance-, just play lyle in cube sector
(04:03:13) Siiseli: the only let's play done of it sucks
(04:03:16) Siiseli: it's godawful
(04:03:48) ramdance-: I will look into it
(04:04:20) Siiseli: I will start learning php
(04:04:22) ramdance-: but should I try and see if I don't fail miserably at let's playing first?
(04:05:07) Siiseli: it's a short game
(04:05:24) Siiseli: but sure make a test epissode or two

(04:21:33) Parthon: did you jump in
(04:21:44) SMRobot: it was all pinkish, like you get when your blending doesn't work right
(04:22:08) SMRobot: Parthon, yes, and I surviced
(04:22:15) WickedbitWed: night
(04:22:19) SMRobot: night
(04:22:21) Notch: did all lava do that, or just surface lava?
(04:22:22) WickedbitWed: ohey notch
(04:22:40) WickedbitWed: minecraft = awesome
(04:22:46) SMRobot: well, there were two layers of lava, like it was being drawn double sided
(04:22:57) Pasteletsap left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).

(04:24:20) Pasteletsap: Why's it keep freezing when I try going into the gg2 channel :(
(04:24:30) Notch: ah. ok.. It's probably more or less intentional, smrobot. I draw all sides of liquids on purpose, but I could add a pass to burn the zbuffer so only the nearest surfaces get rendered
(04:24:40) michael left the room (quit: Quit: michael).
(04:25:00) SMRobot: that would be good
(04:25:11) SMRobot: also implement the scroll wheel already!

(04:25:31) Notch: you won't be able to see other bodies of liquid of you're inside one, though
(04:25:37) SMRobot: ya
(04:25:45) Notch: but that shouldn't be a very common scenario
(04:25:47) SMRobot: and is lava supposed to be non letha;
(04:26:02) Notch: not later on, no. But I have nothing to kill yet

(04:26:15) Stargoat: minecraft update?
(04:26:21) Notch: you won't explode on impact, though, so you could survive a second of touching lava
(04:27:04) SMRobot: kk
(04:27:11) SMRobot: my code is broked right now
(04:27:18) ramdance-: dag, yo
(04:27:19) Notch: Stargoat: Last night, yes. Lava and water, plus a few bugs
(04:27:20) ramdance- left the room.
(04:27:25) Stargoat: oh wow
(04:27:48) Stargoat: my firefox is not responding. Your stupid game broke my internets, Notch
(04:27:59) Stargoat: I demand a refund
(04:28:09) ***Notch gives refund
(04:28:17) Notch: sorry about that!
(04:28:34) Notch: it could be the map generation, see if it clears up after a short while
(04:28:42) Notch: I really should make that thing not take up 100% cpu. ;)
(04:28:50) Stargoat: heh
(04:29:02) Notch: at least I added a progress screen. It used to be just black
(04:29:46) Notch: Oil!
(04:29:48) Notch: A third liquid
(04:30:16) SMRobot: yay
(04:31:09) Parthon: which explodes when it hits fire?
(04:31:24) Movius: http://67.199.7.46/_media/imgs/articles2/a96674_ThisIsAComputer.jpg
(04:31:42) Notch: or burns, Parthon
(04:31:58) Notch: dear god, that IS a computer indeed
(04:33:14) Stargoat: can the water only flow in chunks?
(04:33:44) Notch: I poll the tiles fairly seldom as there's four million of them
(04:33:53) Notch: water flows really really slow if it doesn't do what it does now

(04:39:23) SMRobot: nope
(04:39:27) Pasteletsap: Oh it's not
(04:39:37) SMRobot: closed source, but all the game logic is scripted
(04:39:44) Pasteletsap: Well in that case I'd send him a PM
(04:39:48) SMRobot: ya
(04:39:57) SMRobot: I think he's moving right now tho
(04:40:24) SMRobot: oh well I send it anyways

(04:40:58) SMRobot: *shudder*
(04:41:05) SMRobot: OK

(04:42:18) Pasteletsap: Free to use
(04:42:18) Pasteletsap: etc
(04:42:30) Parthon: Notch: have you thought about doing a nonsynchronous poll?
(04:42:35) Stargoat: Notch, the way you calculate water level doesn't follow newtonian physics laws
(04:42:49) Notch: Parthon: How do you mean?
(04:43:21) Parthon: only poll 1/8th of them every frame
(04:43:41) Parthon: well .. not every frame, but every poll
(04:43:47) Parthon: and poll them 8 times as often
(04:43:48) Notch: Stargoat: I know. It's a design descision. =) I was thinking about the best way of handling water pressure, but then I realized that I'd have to simulate AIR pressure as well since a small enclosed area under water wouldn't fill up from a hole on the bottom
(04:43:52) Siiseli: anyone know what's wrong, I just installed apache and php5 and now when I try to test it it says I can't access index.php becouse it is forbidden
(04:43:59) Parthon: if you split them into 2-cell block groups, there are 8 in a 2x2x2 group
(04:44:02) Stargoat: damn
(04:44:13) Stargoat: :(
(04:44:14) Notch: Parthon: I already only poll 1/200 per tick
(04:44:22) Parthon: oh .. dang :P
(04:44:30) Parthon: what determines how which ones you poll?
(04:44:36) Notch: pure chance!
(04:44:50) Siiseli: someone? please?
(04:45:03) Notch: Siiseli: I've never used php. :-\
(04:45:50) Parthon: Notch: lol .. and here's me thinking you had a system
(04:45:56) Parthon: how often do you poll?
(04:46:05) SMRobot: Notch, I know this is bad simulation wise, but why not poll only those tiles the user can see
(04:46:21) Notch: every game tick. There's a game tick 15 times per second
(04:46:23) Parthon: Siiseli: that could be a number of things
(04:46:29) SMRobot: brb
(04:46:30) Siiseli: Parthon, for example?
(04:46:31) jw [chatzilla@gd-c-7611.adsl.wanadoo.nl] entered the room.
(04:46:33) Parthon: it could be that .php pages are forbidden, or just index.php
(04:46:43) Siiseli: ugh, why would they be forbidden
(04:46:47) Parthon: it could be that you haven't properly opened access to the directory the php is stored in
(04:46:58) Parthon: something in your apache confi
(04:47:00) Parthon: config
(04:47:01) Notch: SMRobot: That would get very complex in multiplayer. I'm trying to keep the game player location agnostic so I can predict as much as possible on the clients
(04:47:07) Notch: and then just verify it on the server
(04:47:09) Siiseli: I've tried to look in the config
(04:47:10) Parthon: are they in your html home directory?
(04:47:19) Bezzzy [aubrey.hes@93-97-195-169.zone5.bethere.co.uk] entered the room.
(04:47:20) Siiseli: but you know it's the same folder as the index.html

(04:49:03) Stargoat: that would be awesome
(04:49:06) Stargoat: AWESOME!
(04:49:53) Notch: but air pressure!
(04:50:00) Notch: I don't want to fill pockets of air under water
(04:50:01) Stargoat: just have a constant air pressure
(04:50:15) Stargoat: hmm
(04:50:35) Notch: I'm actually happy with the current system, sorry. =)
(04:50:39) Stargoat: D:
(04:50:41) Stargoat: haha, okay
(04:50:44) Stargoat: you win this round.
(04:50:50) Notch: it's very fast, and it feels very predictable, if a bit "off"
(04:51:22) Notch: (it's strange what feels off.. Floating islands of rock: perfectly fine. Water not rushing up in wells: that's strange!)
(04:51:39) Notch: (this is why game design will never be an exact science!)

(04:53:24) Parthon: drop a lump of rock into water and that water has to go somewhere
(04:53:38) Notch: 3d?
(04:53:53) Parthon: yeah
(04:53:58) hao-1: a fluid dynamics system that can do air pockets would be nontrivial for a world as big as minecraft's
(04:54:00) Notch: sweet
(04:54:01) Parthon: dwarf fortress style
(04:54:12) Snakey: Hey guys
(04:54:15) Parthon: nowhere near the size of mincraft
(04:54:28) Parthon: or more like: the squares are much larger, and the world is a little smaller
(04:54:39) Notch: hao-1: It's a looot of 3d flood fills unless I start caching the data.
(04:54:50) Stargoat: notch, I dug a hole, through water, into a cave, and it isn't filling up :|
(04:54:54) Stargoat: wait
(04:54:55) Stargoat: nevermind
(04:54:57) Stargoat: there is goes
(04:55:02) Notch: or, well, I don't have to flood fill, I just have to find a path to a level border
(04:55:41) Notch: there seems to be some bug with water sometimes not updating. I've got "still water" that never spreads as an optimisation. It should get tagged as mobile when any surrounding tile changes
(04:55:49) hao-1: not sure how dwarf fortress does water pressure
(04:56:03) hao-1: but you could use the same system to model the air too
(04:56:09) Movius: theres an article on the wiki about it
(04:56:14) Notch: there's a great article on it.
(04:56:29) Notch: i don't know if it fills enclosed pockets of air under water or not
(04:56:39) hao-1: never tried it
(04:57:12) Notch: i suck so bad at DF, btw. :-(

(05:02:00) Stargoat: Notch, I have an 4x4x4 pool of water, with a 1x2 pipe connecting it to a 2x2x4 pool at the bottom, but the water won't flow into the 2x2x4 pool
(05:02:09) SMRobot: making a brand new prototype with more generalised, seperated classes
(05:02:18) Parthon: all DF needs is a greatUI
(05:02:24) Parthon: then it would be the best game ever
(05:02:30) Stargoat: not even a great UI, just a useable one.
(05:02:31) SMRobot: it's coded in OpenGL
(05:02:52) SMRobot: DF that is
(05:02:54) Stargoat: I believe old versions of DF used curses.
(05:03:06) Parthon: Stargoat: I mainly said that because of all the purists who would yell at me for it :P
(05:03:22) Notch: Stargoat: If you add another pipe that's not right next to the last one, does the new pipe work?
(05:03:27) Notch: build it in the same way if you can
(05:03:33) Notch: I've got a feeling my new RNG might be broken, hehe
(05:03:36) Succendo [dragonmaw@c-98-247-110-202.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] entered the room.
(05:03:40) Stargoat: I made the pipe 2 blocks high instead of 1
(05:03:57) Stargoat: and it filled the 2x2x4 pool to the height of the pipe
(05:04:24) Notch: oh, so it did pour down the pipe, but it didn't go back up over the depth of the pipe?
(05:04:39) Stargoat: exactly
(05:04:53) Notch: ok, that's intentional behavior, heh
(05:05:00) Stargoat: hmm
(05:05:02) Stargoat: okay
(05:05:04) Notch: it'd work that way in real life as well in an enclosed room. The air has no where to go
(05:05:15) Stargoat: it's not an enclosed room
(05:05:26) Notch: ooh. Then it's not like in real life
(05:05:27) Stargoat: also, air can be compressed
(05:05:48) Notch: yes, but you need massive water pressure for it to compress much.. heh
(05:06:03) Notch: water cant' compress, right?
(05:06:04) kevglass: are you modelling the air as well now notch?
(05:06:14) Stargoat: hmm
(05:06:15) Dragonmaw left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(05:06:48) Notch: no, the air is just empty tiles
(05:07:03) Notch: I want to keep the game as simple as possible so I can add many tools that interact
(05:07:14) eci [eci@dslb-088-064-189-177.pools.arcor-ip.net] entered the room.
(05:07:18) Notch: it's more important that the game is fast and fun than to have perfectly realistic water
(05:07:28) kevglass: fair enough
(05:07:51) Notch: I'm flexible, though. But not until the game has gotten further along. =)
(05:08:35) kevglass: yeah, know how that goes
(05:09:28) kevglass: still miles away from having a playable demo here :(
(05:09:54) Notch: aww
(05:10:11) Notch: you were going for android, right?
(05:10:17) kevglass: applet + android
(05:10:22) Notch: sweet. =)
(05:10:31) Notch: how is the 3d performance on android?
(05:10:45) kevglass: aye, I figure I might sell more if people can play the first quest online before bothering with the phone :)
(05:10:49) Stargoat: hmm
(05:10:56) Notch: Is a scaled down version of minecraft be at all possible, you think?
(05:10:57) kevglass: 3D performance is great if you can stick to fixed point math
(05:11:00) Notch: *would
(05:11:05) Notch: oh cool
(05:11:08) Stargoat: at the moment, I have the 2x2 pool at a higher water level than the 4x4...
(05:11:41) Notch: oh, it's a HORIZONTAL pipe
(05:11:51) Notch: I thought you had it beneath the other one
(05:12:01) Stargoat: heh
(05:12:45) jw: notch
(05:12:47) jw: water?
(05:12:48) jw: D:
(05:13:31) Notch: water! and lava.

(05:15:33) jw: ooh
(05:15:35) jw: nice : )
(05:16:40) Stargoat: it seems that I can create water from no-where
(05:17:10) LtJax [Jax@78.43.255.21] entered the room.
(05:17:16) Stargoat: extending the pipe to a height of 4 fills up the water in the larger tank, but the water level from the smaller tank does not fall
(05:17:26) Notch: yeah.. heh =D
(05:17:43) Notch: it's raining? no?
(05:17:52) Stargoat: this is in a cave.
(05:18:08) Notch: cave bear sweat?
(05:18:16) Notch: vdgmprgrmr posted a really interesting idea on water
(05:18:25) Stargoat: your game is flawed, sir. F-. Restart/Quit/Exit Program
(05:18:28) Stargoat: haha
(05:19:09) Evil-Ville: Notch I've got a minor complaint about your lava
(05:19:13) Evil-Ville: It shouldn't be transparent
(05:19:22) Notch: at all, Evil-Ville?
(05:19:27) Evil-Ville: Yes
(05:19:36) Notch: i can do that
(05:19:42) Notch: (and I agree)
(05:19:43) Snakey: Lava shouldn't be transparent.
(05:20:43) Evil-Ville: Also I hope you're still going to do drainable water
(05:20:57) BYTE-Smasher [bytesmashe@S0106002129b2ff60.tb.shawcable.net] entered the room.
(05:21:30) Notch: Evil-Ville: I haven't figured out how yet.
(05:22:44) Stargoat: Notch: It seems that in your game, when water "flows", it actually just fills a square with water, while not removing a square of water from somewhere else.
(05:23:14) Notch: yes, that's what it does at the moment. If it removed the last tile, a single block of water in a large empty bed would wobble around randomly
(05:23:34) Evil-Ville: I don't think it would matter too much
(05:23:47) Evil-Ville: Sure it would look a bit stupid but it wouldn't really make the game worse
(05:24:02) Notch: I hate wobbling water particles.. it's one of my pet peeves
(05:24:03) Adam left the room (quit: Quit: Adam).
(05:24:25) Stargoat: hmm.
(05:24:34) Evil-Ville: Maybe you could just delete it then?
(05:24:50) eci left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(05:24:53) Notch: when?
(05:25:08) Evil-Ville: Maybe after it has wobbled for a few seconds
(05:25:14) Notch: what about a block of 2x2 water tiles in a large bed?
(05:25:39) Notch: hmm
(05:25:44) Stargoat: what if it will only move to a new square if it is touching another water square, and if the square it is touching is saturated?
(05:27:05) Lakmir left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(05:27:21) Stargoat: replace square with block/cube.
(05:28:23) Stargoat: although, that could potentially lead to a tower of water... 
(05:28:38) Stargoat: hmm
(05:28:45) Evil-Ville: I got an idea I'll try to draw a picture to illustrate it because I am bad at explaining

(05:36:08) Evil-Ville: I don't know if it's plausible at all
(05:37:20) Movius: Trico
(05:37:26) Movius: wow
(05:37:31) hao-1: hot
(05:39:56) Evil-Ville: Notch would it be a stupid request to make a version with a bigger level size for those who can run it
(05:43:07) Movius: I'm hoping for some sort of banjo-kazooie control
(05:43:20) Movius: alternating between the kid and the giant bird cat
(05:43:45) hao-1: nice
(05:44:14) hao-1: so the levels are designed to be platformable with both characters
(05:44:18) hao-1: two scales in one design
(05:44:39) Stargoat: that would be interesting
(05:46:36) hao-1: even if you don't control the catratbat they'll need good AI to make it work
(05:46:41) hao-1: yeah seems to be bleeding
(05:46:48) hao-1: wrong window there

(06:27:28) jsticker: Yup, KareemK
(06:27:42) KareemK: did ya choose a place yet?
(06:27:58) Notch: i don't think it'll work.. I'll have to experiment a bit

(07:15:26) Arne: I've seen these things in action
(07:15:32) konjak: My necessary is pink, and I have drill bits and porn in it.
(07:15:35) Arne: with my hidden cameras
(07:16:18) Dock: my hidden camera is disguised as a vibrator

(07:27:07) konjak: Arne, I intend to use it still
(07:27:28) Arne: You can pickle it!
(07:27:35) Notch: make a penis based game!
(07:27:46) Arne: Pickles gives you colon cancer. It's special like that.
(07:27:49) konjak: mmm, saltgurka
(07:28:02) konjak: Everything gives you cancer
(07:28:10) konjak: Like DIET DRINKS OH NO
(07:28:18) Notch: and smoking
(07:28:24) hao-1: but being fat gives you heart disease
(07:28:26) konjak: Problem is the substance giving cancer isn't concentrated enough to do anything bad
(07:28:43) konjak: I hate the tabloid news
(07:28:46) Arne: enough to show up in studies
(07:28:54) konjak: indeed
(07:28:56) hao-1: ass cancer is nasty
(07:29:05) hao-1: don't wanna go like that
(07:29:12) hao-1: i'll kill myself if I get it
(07:29:23) konjak: How about just losing the muscle power in your sphincter?

(07:30:26) Arne: I will crush you all with my... sphincter!
(07:30:33) Arne: Raaaaaarr
(07:30:41) konjak: Quick, find an 8-bit game that has a mace and draw a picture of it!

(07:35:13) Dock: athena is more famous as a KOF character than the older game
(07:35:21) Arne: the character changes visually
(07:35:33) Arne: over here perhaps
(07:35:40) Dock: I'm sure in Japan too.
(07:36:06) Dock: Otherwise she would have had more than just one mobile game in the last 20 years
(07:36:07) konjak: Looking at pictures of the KoF design, it could just as well not have been based on the old character
(07:36:28) konjak: But then manga characters don't often look apart
(07:36:38) Dock: She's been in KOF for 16 years, it's just a legacy thing
(07:37:06) Arne: she needs her lowrise bikini bottom

(07:42:08) Arne: but Athena could use a remake treatment, it has some nice components

(07:49:43) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:51:06) hao-1: you could either do the whole meter as an animated sprite, or you could do it in four quarters and render only part of the quarter that shows where the meter is at the time
(07:51:26) mewse [mewse@c122-107-189-4.eburwd5.vic.optusnet.com.au] entered the room.

(07:52:41) konjak: hao-1, I can't imagine what you mean by that second suggestion
(07:53:05) mewse: hao..  I have a conundrum with my terrain rendering.
(07:53:17) _SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:54:32) slv left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(07:54:44) hao-1: well, imagine you have an empty meter graphic, and a full meter graphic. you draw the empty one underneath. Then you draw the full one on top, except you split it up into eight triangles (imagine a square split into four and then also split along the diagonals). Then you remove the sections where the meter is empty, and only partly draw the section that is partly full.
(07:54:51) hao-1: mewse: what's up?
(07:55:06) mewse: http://www.vectorstorm.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/4kmofterrain.png
(07:55:19) hao-1: culling?
(07:56:48) mewse: I'm giving my rendering stuff 4 square kilometers of terrain, with one vertex every 4 meters.  That's about 262,000 vertices.  See that bar in the bottom left corner?  The green part is how much time is being spent rendering (the red pads out to a full frame).  It's tiny.
(07:57:10) mewse: It's making me wonder whether it's even worth trying to do adaptive terrain using a quadtree.
(07:57:26) nyarlu [nyarla@203-219-80-25.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(07:58:02) hao-1: yeah looks fine
(07:58:17) nyarla left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:58:19) hao-1: up to you i guess.
(07:58:21) mewse: Silly modern GPUs, being faster than they have any right to be.
(07:58:47) hao-1: a quicker and easier one might be to go back to lodding down to 2x2 and 4x4 in the distance, and stitching the edges
(07:58:55) mewse: Still thinking about it.  Probably still worth having the quad tree there.  For faster ray collisions and occlusion and stuff, if nothing else.
(07:59:01) hao-1: if you really want to feel safe about drawing too much int he distance
(07:59:26) Notch: ooh, smooth, mewse
(07:59:34) hao-1: because the quadtree stuff for drawing is really gross
(07:59:49) Notch: is there grain in the sky, or that is compression?
(08:00:04) mewse: There's full-screen grain.
(08:00:27) mewse: Not sure if I'm going to keep it.  It's an experiment.  :)
(08:00:37) Notch: I'm a sucker for grain. =D

(08:02:30) nyarla [nyarla@203.219.92.70] entered the room.
(08:02:47) mewse: Enough that there'd be no point putting a texture onto the ground.  Like in the older "Love" screenshots.
(08:03:05) hao-1: that'd make the terrain render even easier:)
(08:03:57) mewse: Mm.  I'm still thinking about rendering out terrain textures with lighting baked into them, so that the terrain isn't being realtime-lit..
(08:04:18) Fraeon: So apparently Britain is the center of Tony Hawk fanaticism
(08:04:51) lansing: how old is Tony Hawk now? 50?
(08:05:16) lansing: 41.
(08:05:16) Fraeon: I don't know but that's kind of irrelevant here
(08:05:42) nyarla left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:05:48) mewse: But I'm still kind of stunned that I'm getting this performance.  And all I had to do was stop using VBOs for the terrain, and use a standard display list instead.
(08:05:51) Fraeon: The funniest news today: MS got an exclusive for Tony Hawk: Ride
(08:05:57) Fraeon: But that exclusivity is only in the UK

(09:12:58) C418: well, the neverending story was two different stories in one book
(09:13:05) C418: that would make two... games actually
(09:13:23) C418: the second part seems kind of impossible to make

(10:03:29) Movius: it's not just warcraft in space
(10:03:33) fartronomicon: isn't it?
(10:03:38) Stargoat: it's more sophisticated
(10:03:46) RinkuHero: it has 3 races rather than 2
(10:03:52) RinkuHero: that's the main difference from wc2
(10:03:57) KareemK: warcraft has 4
(10:04:01) fartronomicon: i only played warcraft 1
(10:04:01) RinkuHero: yes
(10:04:02) KareemK: wc3 that is
(10:04:13) RinkuHero: but wc3 has heroes
(10:04:16) RinkuHero: which ruined everything
(10:04:19) KareemK: DotA
(10:04:23) RinkuHero: since in order to win you gain experience for your heroes
(10:04:32) KareemK: not really
(10:04:33) RinkuHero: which makes it more of an rpg than an rts
(10:04:41) KareemK: its an rpg/rts
(10:04:43) KareemK: but yea
(10:04:47) KareemK: low unit count
(10:04:57) KareemK: some stuff makes it not very rts-y
(10:04:58) RinkuHero: they units also move very slow
(10:05:06) RinkuHero: to move a unit across the map in wc3 takes several minutes
(10:05:14) RinkuHero: whereas even a slow unit in sc can cross the map in around 30 seconds
(10:05:31) Stargoat: subject to the map
(10:05:33) RinkuHero: yes
(10:05:40) RinkuHero: but that dymanic affects play a lot
(10:05:44) Stargoat: also, I doubt a reaver can do much without a dropship...
(10:05:52) Fraeon left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:05:53) RinkuHero: because it means you can quickly get to your opponents' base, and do quick raids
(10:05:59) RinkuHero: whereas in wc3 that's less possible
(10:06:17) shinygerbil: i had a lan match of wc3 with friends once. Only one person could *actually* play the game. He had a level 9 hero before we'd even got heroes :|
(10:06:18) RinkuHero: wc3 also has auto-casting units though
(10:06:23) RinkuHero: which sc coul dhave used
(10:06:27) RinkuHero: that was one improvement
(10:06:38) RinkuHero: auto-cast stim would be nice
(10:06:45) shinygerbil: i think he might have been secretly Korean :|

(10:07:17) KareemK: or maybe i got rusty at rts
(10:07:22) shinygerbil: well alright but you get the point
(10:07:25) Stargoat: yeah, SC has heaps of micro
(10:07:29) RinkuHero: my micro is pretty terrible yet i do well
(10:07:36) shinygerbil: Stargoat the anecdote-killer :'(
(10:07:37) RinkuHero: due to knowledge of build orders and macro
(10:07:48) Stargoat: :|
(10:07:49) Stargoat: wut
(10:07:57) Stargoat: micro is annoying
(10:08:06) RinkuHero: i like it
(10:08:09) RinkuHero: i'm just not good at it
(10:08:43) RinkuHero: there are only a few things you need to do in micro, but it requires high apm
(10:08:49) RinkuHero: moving weakened units back
(10:08:53) RinkuHero: focusing on units one at a time
(10:08:55) RinkuHero: etc.
(10:09:07) Stargoat: hmm
(10:09:10) Siiseli: anyone here know php and sql to go along with it?
(10:09:11) paul|not: http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/1662/ufo.png
(10:09:11) RinkuHero: also knowledge of how many hits things take to kill helps
(10:09:18) RinkuHero: for instance, dragoons take 8 shots to kill a tank
(10:09:23) Dragonene: Siiseli: the basics
(10:09:26) RinkuHero: so sending 4 to attack 1 tank and 4 to attack another
(10:09:27) Dragonene: haven't used it in a while tho
(10:09:28) RinkuHero: would be good
(10:09:29) Stargoat: eh, that's way too technical for me
(10:09:31) thewreck: Siiseli! me! =)
(10:09:34) thewreck: coding that right now
(10:09:43) Stargoat: thewreck is dodging your challenge, Rinku.
(10:09:44) Stargoat: :(
(10:09:47) thewreck: been doing straight php and sql for 1 week
(10:09:50) RinkuHero: he seems to be coding
(10:09:56) Stargoat: poor excuse!
(10:09:57) Stargoat: haha
(10:10:12) Stargoat: unless it;s JEN?
(10:10:22) thewreck: JEn is sql and php =)
(10:10:24) thewreck: isnt
(10:10:30) Stargoat: bahhh
(10:10:35) Fraeon [kzer-za@e212-246-65-153.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(10:10:44) Siiseli: http://paste.servut.us/plain/izkn well I'm trying to do a simple login from this sql shitwizzler and it only checks if the username matches. aka. it does a query on the username provided by the form and tries to find one from the database and if it does(if the query is not null) it echoes "Onnea vittu" but otherwise it does :(
(10:10:52) Siiseli: but it for some reason always returns a true
(10:10:57) Siiseli: even if the username was faultyu
(10:11:00) RinkuHero: also another part of micro is sending the right units to the right units
(10:11:15) Stargoat: what do you mean?
(10:11:24) Siiseli: me?
(10:11:27) RinkuHero: for instance, let's say zerg is attacking with hydras and lurkers
(10:11:29) Stargoat: nah, rinku
(10:11:30) RinkuHero: and you are protoss
(10:11:31) paul|not: tank killers to kill tanks
(10:11:32) Siiseli: kk
(10:11:40) thewreck: $result = mysql_query('select username from users where username="'.$_POST['fname'].'"');
(10:11:41) RinkuHero: you'd use dragoons against lurkers, and zealots against hydras
(10:11:42) thewreck: ops
(10:11:44) thewreck: sorry
(10:11:44) RinkuHero: rather than vice versa
(10:11:46) Stargoat: right
(10:11:51) Stargoat: that makes sense
(10:11:55) RinkuHero: since zealots against lurkers group up and are all killed at once, and have to get close
(10:12:06) RinkuHero: and dragoons do half damage to small units
(10:12:07) RinkuHero: such as hydras
(10:12:08) Stargoat: since my micro is so bad, I usually go for more geurilla-esq tactics
(10:12:08) Siiseli: thewreck, what about that
(10:12:13) RinkuHero: so would only do 10 damage to them instead of 20
(10:12:19) RinkuHero: whereas zealots do the full 20
(10:12:19) thewreck: accidentally pasted your stuff
(10:12:26) Siiseli: oh
(10:12:30) Siiseli: so, any ideas?

(10:12:57) Siiseli: if(mysql_fetch_row($result, 0)) this how one does it?
(10:13:00) RinkuHero: is probably a part of micro
(10:13:10) RinkuHero: knowing when to use the various spells, and on which groups
(10:13:16) fartronomicon: <RinkuHero> also spellcasting
(10:13:16) fartronomicon: <Siiseli> if(mysql_fetch_row($result, 0)) this how one does it?
(10:13:16) fartronomicon: <RinkuHero> is probably a part of micro
(10:13:16) fartronomicon: <RinkuHero> knowing when to use the various spells, and on which groups
(10:13:17) KareemK: yea
(10:13:18) fartronomicon: oops
(10:13:19) RinkuHero: like stasising large groups of tanks in the back rather than the front
(10:13:22) KareemK: fuckin science vessel
(10:13:26) fartronomicon: http://www.adventuregamers.com/newsitem.php?id=1893
(10:13:28) KareemK: is lotsa micro
(10:13:35) fartronomicon: irc messes with my clipboard in annoying ways
(10:13:37) thewreck: RinkuHero
(10:13:40) RinkuHero: hi
(10:13:48) thewreck: do another echo mysql_error(); after the query
(10:13:49) Movius: awesome
(10:13:56) RinkuHero: ?
(10:13:57) RinkuHero: what is that
(10:13:58) thewreck: might give you clues
(10:14:11) Movius: thats siiseli
(10:14:25) RinkuHero: no, what is an echo mysql error
(10:14:29) Siiseli: thewreck, surely, thanks
(10:14:30) Siiseli: Movius, what?
(10:14:36) shinygerbil: hahaha
(10:14:37) Movius: disregard
(10:14:38) shinygerbil: this is funny
(10:14:50) shinygerbil: i understand what is going on with this conversation
(10:14:50) thewreck: ah
(10:14:53) shinygerbil: but nobody else does
(10:14:55) thewreck: Siiseli of course =)
(10:15:04) Stargoat: shinygerbil is ahead of the back
(10:15:07) Stargoat: pack!
(10:15:15) Siiseli: thewreck, this half works now I mean
(10:15:16) shinygerbil: I'm ahead of the backpack
(10:15:20) Siiseli: it always returns 0
(10:15:31) Stargoat: you should go back to get it
(10:15:34) Stargoat: it has your school books
(10:15:42) shinygerbil: I know, my lunch too :'(
(10:16:05) hao-1: i've put my shoes back on, got two jumpers on, fingerless gloves and my hoodie hood up
(10:16:13) hao-1: and only now am I actually warm enough to work
(10:16:31) tantan [tantan@c-98-213-201-216.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:16:34) Stargoat: isn't it spring or something over there?
(10:16:37) hao-1: yeah
(10:16:41) RinkuHero: over where
(10:16:44) Stargoat: how come it's so cold?
(10:16:45) Notch: here
(10:16:48) fartronomicon: in high school my friend used to wear fingerless gloves and one time he got called to the office where the vice principle asked him not to wear them anymore because a teacher had complained that they were intimidating or something
(10:16:52) RinkuHero: it's spring here yes
(10:16:53) RinkuHero: may
(10:16:55) hao-1: uk. but it's still pretty cold. but also, the office is air conditioned
(10:16:57) tantan: hi all
(10:17:01) tantan: i have to leave soon
(10:17:06) RinkuHero: i think the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere?
(10:17:10) tantan: but i chose to spend my free time with you
(10:17:11) hao-1: to top it off, the air coming out of the air conditioning machines is really stinky
(10:17:11) shinygerbil: hi tantan, pre-emptive bye tantan
(10:17:16) fartronomicon: no rinku they are just upside down
(10:17:20) RinkuHero: so the seasons should be the same for any latitude
(10:17:34) Stargoat: your face is upside down and inside out, that's what's wrong with it
(10:17:41) tantan: god rinku, didn't you ever pay attention in school
(10:17:43) RinkuHero: er, logitude
(10:17:46) RinkuHero: no
(10:18:00) RinkuHero: my school never mentioned those
(10:18:05) RinkuHero: i went to school in an inner city slums
(10:18:12) fartronomicon: you would think that Stargoat, what with all the blood rushing to your head all the time
(10:18:12) RinkuHero: where we did crossword puzzles and had substitute teachers all day
(10:18:27) tantan: that sounds like cool beans
(10:18:33) fartronomicon: what slum do they do crosswords in
(10:18:40) tantan: compton
(10:18:48) RinkuHero: they do them because they're too cheap for textbooks
(10:18:54) RinkuHero: so they just xerox crossword puzzles
(10:19:00) RinkuHero: and call that 'spelling class'

(10:19:54) RinkuHero: just substitute teachers the whole year
(10:20:11) fartronomicon: i had that
(10:20:30) fartronomicon: in 8th grade my science teacher was new that year, and he got fired 1 month in, reportedly for looking in the girls locker room
(10:20:32) fartronomicon: and we had a sub all year
(10:20:36) fartronomicon: and we just watched Bill Nye
(10:21:57) fartronomicon: the science guy
(10:22:08) RinkuHero: he didn't exist when i was in school i think
(10:22:15) RinkuHero: when we watched tv in class it was like
(10:22:16) RinkuHero: voltron
(10:22:25) fartronomicon: voltron isn't educational
(10:22:31) fartronomicon: what year did you graduate
(10:22:35) RinkuHero: you can learn about robots
(10:22:38) RinkuHero: from where

(10:38:29) hao-1: why can't i download my purchased tracks from itunes at any time
(10:38:42) hao-1: if i'm allowed to copy them over a shared network, as suggested by itunes
(10:38:56) hao-1: very annoying
(10:38:56) fartronomicon: why would you purchase tracks from itunes
(10:39:05) fartronomicon: is the real question
(10:39:41) hao-1: nice way to buy music aside from that
(10:39:49) fartronomicon: did they get rid of the drm yet?
(10:39:53) hao-1: yeah
(10:39:57) fartronomicon: on all tracks?
(10:39:57) hao-1: pretty much?
(10:40:09) Dragonene: nice google stuff :)
(10:40:24) hao-1: i think i got one or two that were protected, but I can't remember in what way
(10:40:28) Dragonene: hao-1: Not that it has all music
(10:40:31) Dragonene: but do you use spotify?
(10:40:38) hao-1: no, not yet
(10:40:40) fartronomicon: i hear good things about emusic too
(10:40:51) fartronomicon: but seriously who pays for music anymore
(10:41:00) hao-1: i've only just started :)
(10:41:12) hao-1: figure i should start giving back a bit now hehe
(10:41:24) fartronomicon: if your favorite artist comes to town, go see them
(10:41:44) hao-1: no time
(10:42:00) fartronomicon: i find that hard to believe
(10:42:14) hao-1: sorry to hear that
(10:42:25) fartronomicon: no i mean i am sorry to hear that you have no time
(10:42:26) fartronomicon: that sucks
(10:43:11) Stargoat: pen spinning is hard, but I am determined to obtain this skill.
(10:43:22) RinkuHero: is it harder than coin spinning
(10:43:25) RinkuHero: i can do coin spinning
(10:43:42) Stargoat: coin spinning?
(10:43:45) RinkuHero: yes
(10:43:47) fartronomicon: over the fingers?
(10:43:50) RinkuHero: you put a coin on a flat surface
(10:43:53) fartronomicon: oh
(10:43:53) RinkuHero: then stand it up
(10:43:55) RinkuHero: and flick one of the sides
(10:43:57) fartronomicon: no that's lame
(10:43:58) RinkuHero: then it spins like a top
(10:43:59) RinkuHero: haha
(10:44:02) Stargoat: oh
(10:44:05) Stargoat: yeah, that's easy
(10:44:11) fartronomicon: the cool thing is to make the coin go over your fingers
(10:44:20) fartronomicon: like badguys in movies
(10:44:33) Stargoat: ah, like at the casino
(10:44:34) Stargoat: playing poker
(10:44:37) fartronomicon: yes
(10:44:42) fartronomicon: also casino scenes in movies
(10:44:47) Stargoat: I saw some guy doing it when I was playing the other day
(10:44:49) Stargoat: guy scared me

(10:45:54) Rotab [Rotab@h33n2c1o291.bredband.skanova.com] entered the room.
(10:45:57) fartronomicon: is pen spinning like the coin spinning rinku described
(10:45:58) Stargoat: especially considering how shit Nintendo has been recently.
(10:46:00) hao-1: that's what they all say
(10:46:08) Stargoat: :p
(10:46:09) hao-1: hehe oh
(10:46:17) hao-1: yeah we got turned down by nintendo for dev status
(10:46:22) fartronomicon: assholes
(10:46:26) hao-1: they are reaaaally picky
(10:46:27) Movius: no office?
(10:46:34) Siiseli: hao-1, fuckers
(10:46:34) Stargoat: dyson>?
(10:46:53) hao-1: well, rudolf's got two companies, one is registered at his home - so no good - the other is a shop
(10:46:56) Siiseli: let's kill the fuckers if that means we don't get no dyson wii
(10:47:01) jsticker: fartronomicon, emusic is fine
(10:47:03) Stargoat: maybe dyson just isn't as good as we all think it to be
(10:47:04) jsticker: In theory!
(10:47:05) hao-1: still no good apprently
(10:47:13) jsticker: The problem is that their music catalogue becomes smaller
(10:47:19) jsticker: I don't know why, though
(10:47:30) jsticker: Lots of music I bought in the past months just disappeared
(10:47:32) fartronomicon: the problem is that it costs money and the rest of the internet will always have more music free
(10:47:37) hao-1: just loads of really shitty nitpicky emails going back and forth, who works at each company, how are the companies related, what goes on at each company
(10:47:41) jsticker: No no, fartronomicon
(10:47:45) hao-1: for fuck's sake all we want to do is make a game
(10:47:48) hao-1: so fuck them
(10:47:49) jsticker: emusic had lots of music I couldn't find ANYWHERE
(10:47:50) hao-1: their loss
(10:47:57) Stargoat: heh, yeah
(10:48:01) fartronomicon: like what?
(10:48:02) jsticker: And 50 cent per song is alright with me
(10:48:03) fartronomicon: i've never not found something
(10:48:08) Stargoat: you should trash your room or something, haowan
(10:48:10) jsticker: Maybe your taste is shit
(10:48:12) fartronomicon: unless it was insanely obscure
(10:48:16) fartronomicon: like local bands
(10:48:24) hao-1: i actually was dreading going to console
(10:48:26) hao-1: so this is good
(10:48:39) hao-1: none of the services except community games seem to offer an actual route
(10:48:41) Stargoat: did rudolf wanna develop console-side?
(10:48:59) hao-1: we would have considered it if we could keep the ip and still get funding
(10:49:01) fartronomicon: hao you should make a version of dyson for hacked wiis
(10:49:03) fartronomicon: just to get back at them
(10:49:06) Stargoat: ah
(10:49:16) Movius: I'm an artist and I shouldn't have to work for a living
(10:49:18) jsticker: Stuff that emusic had but no piracy site includes Digiki, Chimidoro, lotsa Momus albums, Lullatone etc
(10:49:22) jsticker: So, mostly japanese stuff
(10:49:31) jsticker: But as I said, their catalogue is shrinking for whatever reason
(10:49:37) jsticker: Which is why i cancelled my subscription
(10:49:40) Dragonene: Nooooooo alarms and nooo surprises
(10:49:40) fartronomicon: there must be a weeaboo tracker for you to go on
(10:49:47) jsticker: Nope
(10:49:56) Dragonene: Heh, spotify's catalogue is also shrinking
(10:49:57) jsticker: It's not weeaboo music anyway
(10:49:57) Dragonene: a lot
(10:50:07) Dragonene: they removed pretty much everything I listened to from there
(10:50:08) Dragonene: :'(
(10:50:16) Dragonene: but it's still relatively huge
(10:50:43) jsticker: I don't listen to the music because it's japanese, the japanese just happen to make music I find exciting. They're usually unknown in Japan too :(
(10:51:01) fartronomicon: i like boris
(10:51:04) fartronomicon: and melt banana
(10:51:05) Dragonene: speaking of japanese music
(10:51:11) Dragonene: I saw Electric Eel Shock live at a festival
(10:51:17) RinkuHero: momus isn't japanese
(10:51:23) Dragonene: they're the strangest thing to ever come out of japan
(10:51:23) RinkuHero: i have him on my lj friends list
(10:51:25) Dragonene: well no probably not
(10:51:29) Dragonene: but they're strange.
(10:51:30) Movius: Sigh are the best Japanese band
(10:51:36) Stargoat: boris is decent
(10:51:42) Stargoat: but it doesn't sound terribly japanese
(10:51:45) fartronomicon: boris is awesome
(10:51:54) fartronomicon: seen them twice
(10:51:56) Movius: followed by Boris, Guitar Wolf and Melt Banana
(10:51:58) fartronomicon: they are sick
(10:52:12) Movius: the Sunn O)))/Boris Aus tour didn't come to Adelaide >:(
(10:52:18) Movius: also boredoms
(10:52:26) fartronomicon: yes boredoms too
(10:52:26) jsticker: I know, RinkuHero. I said "Mostly japanese"
(10:52:32) RinkuHero: ah
(10:52:36) jsticker: Also, he's been quite involved with Shibuya-Kei
(10:52:59) jsticker: So it's not even that far off
(10:53:05) jsticker: But yeah, I read his blog a lot
(10:53:10) jsticker: Didn't know you did too!
(10:53:15) Notch: -> home
(10:53:24) RinkuHero: auriea recommended it to me
(10:53:35) jsticker: Yeah, I noticed her commenting there
(10:53:47) jsticker: I've not missed an entry since sometime in 2006
(10:53:50) Stargoat: I guess the most compelling reason to be interested in japanese culture is because 80% of all the interesting games ever never leave the country.
(10:54:03) RinkuHero: but that's also true of here
(10:54:05) jsticker: NICE MUSSAAL
(10:54:12) Movius: hyperbole much?
(10:54:21) RinkuHero: i doubt fallout for instance was translated to japanese

(10:55:27) Dragonene: Notch is double home.
(10:55:34) Dragonene: Both in #lwjgl and #tigirc.

(10:56:31) Dragonene: RinkuHero: what
(10:56:37) Dragonene: you don't think fallout was translated to japanese?
(10:56:41) RinkuHero: their lifespan will probably go down after their food gets more westernized
(10:56:41) Dragonene: I'm sure it must have been

(10:57:23) Dragonene: huh
(10:57:25) RinkuHero: but not fallout 2 or 1
(10:57:33) Dragonene: that depends of what you're comparing to Movius
(10:57:42) Movius: everywhere except Japan
(10:57:45) RinkuHero: well
(10:57:46) Dragonene: Western nations have like the longest life expectancy in the world
(10:57:49) RinkuHero: there are various teirs
(10:57:54) RinkuHero: third world has lowest life expectancy
(10:58:03) RinkuHero: then of the developed nations, the asian developed ones have the highest
(10:58:09) RinkuHero: followed by europe
(10:58:19) RinkuHero: particularly the mediterranian
(10:58:26) Dragonene: I have no idea about life expectency in Sweden
(10:58:30) Stargoat: I have the longest life expectancy of any nation
(10:58:33) Dragonene: but we have the least violence!

(10:58:44) fartronomicon: a friend and i got stoned and watched a history channel special on samurai culture and we wrote a future scenario in which aliens manage to kill all the humans except the japanese because they are so crazy violent
(10:58:45) RinkuHero: japan is third highest
(10:58:48) Dragonene: jsticker: I can wiki too! :D
(10:58:50) RinkuHero: andorra and macau are higher
(10:58:55) jsticker: I don't wiki, Dragonene
(10:59:01) jsticker: I Wolfram Alpha
(10:59:04) jsticker: See? The name ruins it
(10:59:07) Movius: macau and andorra are small enough to be blips
(10:59:08) jsticker: You can't use it as a verb
(10:59:11) jsticker: They fucked it zp
(10:59:12) jsticker: up
(10:59:14) Dragonene: jsticker: 
(10:59:16) RinkuHero: sweden is pretty high
(10:59:19) Dragonene: Hah, Sweden is high on that list
(10:59:26) jsticker: 81 years is quite high
(10:59:27) Dragonene: awesome \o/
(10:59:39) Stargoat: Australia is surprisingly high
(10:59:51) RinkuHero: wowow
(10:59:52) Dragonene: I'd say that list is dominated by western countries
(10:59:53) Movius: aside from Japan the only ones higher than "western nations" are tiny metropolitan islands or principalities
(10:59:53) Stargoat: despite the fact that we're competing with America for "fattest nation ever"
(10:59:54) RinkuHero: puerto rico
(10:59:59) RinkuHero: has a higher life expentancy than the us
(11:00:14) fartronomicon: puerto rico is in the us
(11:00:17) fartronomicon: so that makes no sense
(11:00:23) RinkuHero: yes
(11:00:27) RinkuHero: but they can't vote for presidents
(11:00:27) fartronomicon: new jersey probably has a higher life expectancy than the us too
(11:00:31) fartronomicon: but it doesn't mean anything
(11:00:34) Dragonene: wow
(11:00:41) krabbo [terithom@d75-155-120-107.bchsia.telus.net] entered the room.
(11:00:43) Dragonene: life expectancy in denmark 4 years worse than sweden

(11:01:06) fartronomicon: only if you want your friends to outlive you
(11:01:09) fartronomicon: i certainly don't
(11:01:10) Movius: it's one step below TOUGH ON CRIME
(11:01:11) Dragonene: "least population density" :D
(11:01:13) fartronomicon: i think i will make friends with africans
(11:01:15) RinkuHero: swaziland is the lowest
(11:01:19) RinkuHero: 32.23
(11:01:29) Stargoat: Movius: You obviously arn't listening to enough scarey media
(11:01:30) jsticker: That's sad, innit
(11:01:36) Stargoat: you need to watch ACA, man
(11:01:39) Movius: Swaziland is the heart of AIDS land
(11:01:41) Stargoat: shit is real
(11:01:48) Movius: hehe
(11:02:06) Dragonene: Stargoat: australia has like a tenth of swedish population density
(11:02:12) Dragonene: and sweden has like a tenth of everywhere else
(11:02:12) Stargoat: sweet as
(11:02:24) Movius: Australia is far more urbanized than sweden
(11:02:25) Stargoat: I wonder what game dev density is like
(11:02:33) Dragonene: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density
(11:02:33) fartronomicon: what?
(11:02:35) fartronomicon: no it isn't
(11:02:40) fartronomicon: australia is mostly desert
(11:02:45) Dragonene: yes
(11:02:45) Movius: exactly
(11:02:45) fartronomicon: sweden is tiny in comparison
(11:02:47) Dragonene: that means it's urbanized
(11:02:50) Movius: where do you think people live
(11:02:52) Stargoat: urban desert
(11:02:52) Movius: in the cities
(11:02:55) Dragonene: mostly desert -> people live in the desert
(11:02:56) Dragonene: uh
(11:02:57) Dragonene: no
(11:03:00) fartronomicon: oh i see you mean by population
(11:03:00) Movius: thats what urbanized means
(11:03:02) Dragonene: mostly desert -> people live in the cities*
(11:03:12) fartronomicon: not by development

(11:04:19) Stargoat: vatican city wins in pope density
(11:04:24) Stargoat: there are two popes per square mile
(11:04:35) Dragonene: :D
(11:04:47) fartronomicon: vatican city isn't a country
(11:04:53) fartronomicon: it's a spot the italian government elects not to govern
(11:05:32) Ina [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(11:05:33) Dragonene: wow
(11:05:38) Dragonene: namibia is lower than australia
(11:05:44) Dragonene: wasn't expecting that
(11:06:16) Lakmir left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:06:22) Stargoat: I dunno, I thought Vatican City was considered as a country
(11:06:32) Movius: it is
(11:07:56) fartronomicon: do they have a seat at the un?
(11:08:00) Movius: no
(11:08:03) fartronomicon: then fuck 'em
(11:08:08) Stargoat: haha
(11:08:09) Movius: they haven't applied to join
(11:08:15) fartronomicon: because they aren't a country
(11:08:22) RinkuHero: doesn't north korea not have a seat in the un
(11:08:25) Movius: all other nations recognise it
(11:08:27) Pepe left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:08:28) RinkuHero: and still a country
(11:08:31) ramdance-: dude
(11:08:36) Movius: everyone has a seat at the UN bar Vatican City
(11:08:38) ramdance-: omegle is so lols
(11:08:47) Movius: Switzerland were the last to join
(11:08:49) Stargoat: I love the popes
(11:08:49) ramdance-: like 800+ lols
(11:08:50) RinkuHero: what about that country that used to be an oil rig
(11:08:50) fartronomicon: everyone? what about the other city-states?
(11:08:52) Pepe [pepe@99-202-127-241.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(11:09:00) RinkuHero: off uk shores
(11:09:06) fartronomicon: they got washed away
(11:09:09) RinkuHero: haha
(11:09:09) fartronomicon: by a storm
(11:09:13) Movius: Sealand
(11:09:18) Dragonene: hey
(11:09:20) Movius: they're all dead 
(11:09:22) Dragonene: UN Survey:
(11:09:24) Dragonene: "After Iceland, the next nine best places to live are: Norway, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, the Netherlands, and France."
(11:09:36) nihilocrat: Norway?
(11:09:39) nihilocrat: it's 'spensive
(11:09:40) Dragonene: Yes, why not?
(11:09:44) fartronomicon: what about the other european city-states?
(11:09:48) Dragonene: Well yes, but the wages are also higher
(11:09:48) fartronomicon: do they have UN seats?
(11:09:49) nihilocrat: maybe it's just Oslo
(11:09:58) Dragonene: nihilocrat: No, norway *is* expensive
(11:10:01) Dragonene: but you make more money there, too.
(11:10:08) nihilocrat: oh
(11:10:10) RinkuHero: nyc is expensive
(11:10:12) nihilocrat: the food is inedible
(11:10:13) Movius: Norway taxes you through the nose
(11:10:17) nihilocrat: according to others
(11:10:20) RinkuHero: but it's still a good place to live if you can afford it
(11:10:21) Movius: to fund their church
(11:10:22) Dragonene: I think Sweden has higher taxes.
(11:10:26) nihilocrat: according to everyone in my office who has visited Norway
(11:10:32) Dragonene: Sweden has the highest taxes in the world afaik.
(11:10:51) RinkuHero: let's find the wikipedia list for highest taxes
(11:10:53) RinkuHero: if it exists
(11:11:04) Movius: commie countries would be #1
(11:11:05) nihilocrat: well cool
(11:11:10) nihilocrat: I'm possibly moving to Canada
(11:11:10) RinkuHero: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_around_the_world
(11:11:14) nihilocrat: so I get #4
(11:11:16) nihilocrat: eh
(11:11:21) RinkuHero: taxes are complex so
(11:11:22) Dragonene: actually
(11:11:23) Dragonene: http://www.thelocal.se/10402/20080311/
(11:11:27) Movius: thats inaccurate
(11:11:27) RinkuHero: you can't just say 'highest taxes' that simply
(11:11:27) Dragonene: Denmark apparently have higher taxes.
(11:11:32) Dragonene: Norway has lower taxes though.
(11:11:34) RinkuHero: there's corporate tax, indiviual, vat, sales
(11:11:36) Movius: Payroll Tax is levies by all states in australia
(11:11:39) fartronomicon: montenegro has a UN seat..
(11:11:41) Movius: *levied
(11:11:42) fartronomicon: andorra doesn't seem to have one
(11:11:46) nihilocrat: I think they mean income tax, Rinku
(11:11:50) nihilocrat: when they say "tax"
(11:11:52) RinkuHero: ah
(11:11:56) nihilocrat: individual payroll
(11:11:57) RinkuHero: that'd be individual
(11:12:15) RinkuHero: but even those
(11:12:16) RinkuHero: vary by income
(11:12:17) Movius: payroll tax isn't income tax
(11:12:21) Movius: it taxes the company
(11:12:27) Movius: for paying you
(11:12:30) RinkuHero: yes, income is individual
(11:12:32) Lakmir [Lakmir@c-24-34-140-155.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(11:12:35) fartronomicon: i can't figure out monaco
(11:12:50) Movius: it's a tax haven
(11:13:00) fartronomicon: whether it has a un seat i mean
(11:13:03) Movius: oh
(11:13:08) Dragonene: on the other hand, http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1492845.ece?service=print
(11:13:08) hao-1: soo crazy tv shows wow wow
(11:13:14) RinkuHero: US is 0-35%
(11:13:41) Dragonene: RinkuHero: No, they just estimate how much of GDP goes into taxes
(11:13:48) RinkuHero: that's a different list
(11:13:52) Dragonene: GNP even
(11:13:57) RinkuHero: that's this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP
(11:14:01) Movius: government spending as GDP or taxes?
(11:14:18) RinkuHero: wow
(11:14:18) Movius: Australia has risen to 26% this budget. but thats with a huge deficit
(11:14:24) RinkuHero: timor-leste's is 109.7%
(11:14:39) Dragonene: what
(11:14:40) RinkuHero: kiribati's is 91.6%
(11:14:43) Dragonene: WHAT
(11:14:47) Dragonene: 109% of money goes into taxes
(11:14:48) RinkuHero: denmark is third
(11:14:49) RinkuHero: 50%
(11:14:50) Dragonene: this doesn't make sense
(11:14:56) nihilocrat: yeah, the screwed up economies are going to be at the top of the list
(11:14:58) RinkuHero: then sweden
(11:15:02) RinkuHero: 49.7%
(11:15:02) nihilocrat: runaway inflation makes no sense either, Dragonene
(11:15:21) Movius: I was in the same room as the Secretary of treasury today
(11:15:25) Movius: I should have called him names
(11:15:26) Dragonene: RinkuHero: look at lists two or three
(11:15:30) RinkuHero: who is the secretary of treasury
(11:15:33) Dragonene: and denmark and sweden are #1 and #2
(11:15:39) RinkuHero: list 2 makes more sense, yes
(11:15:49) nihilocrat: Timothy Geithner
(11:15:53) RinkuHero: denmark, sweden, belgium, france, norway, itlay, finland
(11:16:04) RinkuHero: italy*
(11:16:30) fartronomicon: inflation is a way for large economic actors to squeeze out small economic actors
(11:16:43) fartronomicon: through differential accumulation
(11:16:44) Movius: Ken Henry. Not the actual treasurer. Just the guy thats in charge of the running of the Aus dept. of treasury
(11:16:52) Dragonene: quite a lot of people live in norway but buy their groceries in sweden
(11:16:53) curby left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(11:17:07) Dragonene: that way they earn super high wages but can make use of swedish currency which is valued lower
(11:18:08) Dragonene: but I don't know, living on the border pretty much living out in nowhere
(11:18:09) RinkuHero: i remember the inflation rate of some country recently
(11:18:14) RinkuHero: was something like 7 septillion percent
(11:18:15) Dragonene: zimbabve.
(11:18:17) Dragonene: zimbabwe*
(11:18:21) Dragonene: Yeah
(11:18:33) Dragonene: A local newspaper in sweden had this huge number
(11:18:42) Movius: it's *only* in  the sextillions atm
(11:18:45) Ina: Dragonene, lots of people live in Belgium and Germany with cheaper houses and lower tax, and buy in the Netherlands with much lower prices.
(11:18:48) fartronomicon: yeah i like the photos of people with wheelbarrows full of bills to go buy milk
(11:18:49) Dragonene: Like 655439% or something
(11:18:52) Dragonene: and then in tiny text below:
(11:19:00) Dragonene: Zimbabwe's inflation. Yesterday.
(11:19:18) fartronomicon: and so what the gov't there did was delete a bunch of zeroes off the back of the bills to solve the problem
(11:19:19) RinkuHero: they reach a point eventually where
(11:19:19) Movius: zimbabwe dollars aren't actually used 
(11:19:25) RinkuHero: the paper is worth more than the money
(11:19:30) Dragonene: Ina: huh, netherlands has lower prices?
(11:19:31) Movius: they use $US, barter or the South African Rand
(11:19:39) Dragonene: that makes no sense
(11:19:41) fartronomicon: yeah but the gov't declares that illegal movius
(11:19:47) fartronomicon: so they have to do that on the black market
(11:19:47) Dragonene: germany has low prices, netherlands has high
(11:19:52) Dragonene: is what I've always believed
(11:19:55) nihilocrat: Montreal has surprisingly low real estate prices / rent
(11:19:59) Movius: no, they legalised it ~1 year ago
(11:20:02) fartronomicon: oh
(11:20:08) Ina: Dragonene, yeah, that changed after the supermarket wars.
(11:20:09) nihilocrat: it costs less to rent a place there than here, in the middle of nowhere
(11:20:14) nihilocrat: it's very surprising
(11:20:26) nihilocrat: I can get a place with free electricity and heat for less than I pay now
(11:20:32) Dragonene: Ina: I found that everything in Amsterdam was price pretty much exactly like in Stockholm
(11:20:39) nihilocrat: in a city that isn't just a bunch of suburban sprawl
(11:20:41) fartronomicon: bankers have fucked our real estate system
(11:20:41) Dragonene: it's the one place I've been to where prices are almost exactly the same
(11:20:43) Dragonene: for everything
(11:20:44) fartronomicon: it's not that surprising
(11:20:52) Dragonene: australia comes pretty close
(11:21:08) Dragonene: oh
(11:21:09) Dragonene: damn
(11:21:09) Ina: Dragonene, Amsterdam is expensive, hella expensive.
(11:21:11) Dragonene: it's 1:21
(11:21:15) Movius: Australian house prices are hugely inflated
(11:21:25) Dragonene: Ina: Well yes, and Stockholm is probably more expensive than most of sweden
(11:21:28) Movius: far in excess of the American Property Bubble
(11:21:50) Dragonene: I need to sleepify me.
(11:21:52) fartronomicon: i wish the marxists would come back
(11:21:54) Dragonene: Good night folks
(11:22:01) fartronomicon: and try to hang the bankers
(11:22:02) nihilocrat: haha
(11:22:05) RinkuHero: http://myfirstdictionary.blogspot.com/
(11:22:07) nihilocrat: what do you mean "come back"?
(11:22:15) RinkuHero: real marxists
(11:22:16) nihilocrat: I thought there were never really any marxists who got attention in america
(11:22:18) Ina: Dragonene, the point is, supermarkets all across the country drove down prices to try and kill eachother by running on losses for as long as they could manage.
(11:22:22) Movius: the marxists are the ones giving them trillions of tax payers money
(11:22:24) RinkuHero: there were afew
(11:22:27) fartronomicon: haha
(11:22:29) fartronomicon: hardly
(11:22:31) fartronomicon: those are oligarchs
(11:22:48) fartronomicon: also the US almost had a socialist revolution in the 30s and the new deal stopped it
(11:22:57) fartronomicon: also in the turn of the century
(11:23:01) RinkuHero: marx also apparently helped the us during the civil war
(11:23:02) fartronomicon: anarchists and syndicalists were getting huge
(11:23:03) nihilocrat: we also almost had a redneck hitler
(11:23:06) nihilocrat: but he got assasinated
(11:23:07) RinkuHero: by instigating riots in the UK
(11:23:16) Movius: anarchist and socialist are polar opposites
(11:23:25) RinkuHero: there are anarcho-syndicalists
(11:23:28) RinkuHero: like chomsky
(11:23:31) fartronomicon: movius has funny ideas
(11:23:32) Movius: made up word
(11:23:35) RinkuHero: haha
(11:23:39) fartronomicon: like that the bankers running the gov't are marxists
(11:23:43) RinkuHero: yes
(11:23:48) Dragonene: I love that dictionary RinkuHero
(11:23:51) Dragonene: :P
(11:23:59) hao-1: this myfirstdictionary guy is getting better
(11:24:02) RinkuHero: yes
(11:24:04) hao-1: used to be quite crass
(11:24:12) Dragonene: night.
(11:24:28) Dragonene left the room.
(11:25:09) hao-1: still some are too obvious though
(11:25:19) hao-1: today's word is a good example of that
(11:25:22) RinkuHero: yeah
(11:25:34) RinkuHero: but if you do one a day
(11:25:38) RinkuHero: i gets hard to be consistent
(11:25:40) hao-1: "then he lay down again" would have been fine
(11:26:08) Movius: 'Hi, I'm Troy McClure! You may remember me from such threads as ''You're Reading This In My Voice'' and ''You Just Lost The Game'''
(11:26:21) nihilocrat: haha
(11:26:25) nihilocrat: "triumph" is a good one
(11:26:40) hao-1: nah, still not subtle enough
(11:26:47) hao-1: imo
(11:27:12) hao-1: it should be that a child could read it and not get particularly upset
(11:27:12) fartronomicon: pretend is pretty good
(11:27:23) nihilocrat: might be a US / UK humor difference
(11:27:27) hao-1: new is good for instance
(11:27:36) hao-1: enthrall is great
(11:27:38) craphat left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:27:56) nihilocrat: haha "new" is indeed great
(11:28:07) hao-1: alone, pretend
(11:28:10) hao-1: both good
(11:29:48) Arne: if I run I only burn 4x the kcal as I do if I sit still it seems
(11:30:33) nihilocrat: if you walk 20 minutes daily, you are several times better off than sitting still all day
(11:30:38) ***Arne almost got scroller working
(11:30:42) nihilocrat: I think exercise works on a logarithmic scale
(11:30:54) Arne: no it's just energy in and out
(11:30:55) craphat [capsizer@u200.ip4.netikka.fi] entered the room.
(11:31:12) nihilocrat: hmm
(11:31:26) Arne: I burn 2700 kcal a day if I sit in front of the computer
(11:31:27) nihilocrat: then maybe it's just the case where the margin / difference tends to be so low
(11:31:36) nihilocrat: that only a little bit more 'energy out' will mean you break even
(11:31:45) Arne: if I run for 15 mins I burn 100 kcal
(11:31:58) nihilocrat: but just a little too much energy in adds up over time
(11:32:10) RinkuHero: exercise is not just for burning calories though
(11:32:20) RinkuHero: it also keeps the heart and muscles from deteriorating etc.
(11:32:37) Arne: eating less seems to be far more efficient, but you risk losing muscle massrather than fat if you don't also excercise
(11:32:44) Arne: the body likes to burn muscles first
(11:32:45) RinkuHero: i'm 6'4 and 135 lbs and i still exercise
(11:32:50) RinkuHero: even though i don't need to lose weight
(11:33:05) lemmer: no more mustard on egg salad
(11:33:06) Arne: that's rather skinny
(11:33:25) hao-1: it is also good to prepare you for the inevitability of naked, unarmed combat
(11:33:34) Arne: I'm below 6' and I'm 145lb or something
(11:33:51) Drakkar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:33:58) craphat left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:34:02) Arne: which is close to underweight
(11:34:51) fartronomicon: arne nihil is right, although it is energy in vs energy out, regular exercise will raise the general level of energy out
(11:35:03) fartronomicon: rather than just sitting around and then trying exercise once in a while
(11:35:11) Arne: overall energy consumption / burn in idle, yeah
(11:35:28) Arne: I'm thinking these kcal values are wrong
(11:35:28) fartronomicon: i mean it will up your energy consumption while sitting still too
(11:35:36) Arne: yes, I think so too
(11:35:47) Arne: these kcal values are probably just for hte moment
(11:36:03) Arne: not for the whole day of recouping 
(11:36:05) craphat [capsizer@u211.ip4.netikka.fi] entered the room.
(11:36:17) RinkuHero: exercise isn't a great way to lose weight, there was a study that showed
(11:36:24) Arne: it takes up to 48hrs to recoup after a training pass
(11:36:34) RinkuHero: that exercising tends to increase appetite to account for the increased calorie use
(11:36:56) Drakkar [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(11:37:28) RinkuHero: also weight isn't as simple as calories in
(11:37:31) RinkuHero: their form matters too
(11:37:34) hao-1: fight bears
(11:37:36) Arne: some bodybuilders develop huge digestive systems
(11:37:39) Arne: aka bellies
(11:37:58) BotageL [legatob@75.102.128.163] entered the room.
(11:38:12) RinkuHero: you'd gain more weight eating an equal number of calories in carbohydrates vs an equal number of calories in protein and fat
(11:38:31) RinkuHero: dueto the effects of sugar on insulin etc.
(11:38:52) Arne: yeah you have to time it right with insulin levels, and you want fast or slow carbs depending on when you work out
(11:38:59) Arne: I think fast after training
(11:39:03) Arne: slow before, I dunno
(11:39:28) hao-1: i wonder how much energy you've consumed while pondering this shit :D
(11:39:34) jsticker: Eat well, do sports = works
(11:39:37) Arne: Apparently insulin levels are low in hte morning so it's a good time to exercise 
(11:39:38) RinkuHero: the brain uses a lot of energy actually
(11:39:42) jsticker: All this detail shit doesn't work
(11:39:44) hao-1: jsticker has it
(11:39:47) RinkuHero: i think it was like 80% of the sugar in the blood is used by the brain
(11:40:03) jsticker: You don't get thinner if you work out for a week
(11:40:06) Arne: yeah, like I said, I use 2.7k kcal just sitting here and going to bed
(11:40:20) fartronomicon: eat food. not too much. mostly plants.
(11:40:28) hao-1: stretch
(11:40:29) hao-1: floss
(11:40:33) hao-1: call your mom
(11:40:35) fartronomicon: michael pollan
(11:40:36) fartronomicon: said mine
(11:40:41) Arne: Sports are a good way to hurt yourself, especially indoor crap on high friction carpets
(11:41:05) hao-1: do yoga
(11:41:19) hao-1: i do tai chi and i could kill you with a single blow
(11:41:40) RinkuHero: haha
(11:41:49) jsticker: Bicycling works well for me
(11:41:57) Arne: I shoot poisonous jizz and I could...
(11:41:57) hao-1: i gave up on that
(11:42:09) hao-1: too much of it now i have thighs like jodhpurs
(11:42:09) jsticker: I lost 3kg yesterday
(11:42:15) jsticker: Rode about 40km in Berlin
(11:42:19) Arne: huge dump?
(11:42:27) jsticker: Nah, haven't eaten much
(11:42:31) hao-1: hehe
(11:42:38) Arne: ,ostly fluids then?
(11:42:44) jsticker: 2 of those kilo will come back I bet
(11:43:07) fartronomicon: tai chi blows must be very slow
(11:43:15) hao-1: on the contrary
(11:43:30) Arne: They're very fast if you're senile like the rest of the group
(11:43:34) RinkuHero: you just have to speed up your mind and imagine them in fast-motion
(11:43:37) hao-1: you're buying into the stereotype there. should try some
(11:43:48) hao-1: it's the hardest martial art there is
(11:44:05) Arne: Diamond is the hardest metal there is
(11:45:19) Arne: I used to be 64 kg and now I'm steadily 67, and I'm already moving and eating some
(11:45:33) Arne: so i need to move a bit more and eat a bit less/healthier
(11:45:39) hao-1: the reason it's associated with slowness is that's how the forms are performed. they're done like that because doing so trains a different set of muscles and gives you a different type of strength. we still do fast punches and some pretty mean stuff, it's just that's not what you see on tv
(11:46:32) jsticker: hao-1 kills you with his eyelid
(11:46:42) hao-1: each of those slow movements has a martial application if you speed it up
(11:47:29) Arne: does this apply to masturbation techniques too?
(11:47:52) jsticker: Yeah, how many calories does masturbation burn
(11:48:13) hao-1: probably quite a lot if you're any good at it
(11:48:28) fartronomicon: sperm production eats up a whole lot
(11:48:32) jsticker: I don't know if quality is important
(11:48:39) jsticker: I'd guess it depends on the way you do it
(11:48:46) fartronomicon: so if you're making more sperm frequently that's a whole bunch of kcal
(11:48:47) jsticker: I heard there are very elaborate ways
(11:49:02) hao-1: duration a factor too though
(11:49:18) RinkuHero: taoists recommend not organisming requently, since it drains your spiritual essence
(11:49:21) jsticker: If you can only masturbate while running a marathon, I think that's good for losing weight
(11:49:43) hao-1: yeah hehe
(11:49:43) fartronomicon: most religious doctrines recommend not orgasming because it is a method of control
(11:49:45) Arne: isn't sperm production constant? It's just the filler fluid you can stimulate.
(11:50:06) jsticker: You can lose between 100-150 calories for each act of masturbation, according to the Young People?s Reproductive and Sexual Health & Rights Organization. You can raise that amount to around 300 calories, though, through a 5 minute vigorous masturbation session, according to Japanese scientist Dr. Shukan Tokuho.
(11:50:11) jsticker: I can do 5 minutes
(11:50:20) fartronomicon: is that short or long
(11:50:22) Arne: if you don't jizz you'll just piss them out
(11:50:25) fartronomicon: i'm not sure what he's saying
(11:50:38) jsticker: Apparently it's long? No idea
(11:50:41) ***jsticker coughs
(11:50:42) fartronomicon: cause i can do 2 minutes and i can do 20 too
(11:51:04) jsticker: If he attributes those 5 minutes as "vigorous", I guess it's long
(11:51:12) jsticker: Tennis Arm Masturbation
(11:51:22) shinygerbil: shotgun pump
(11:52:23) Arne: If those numbers were true I would use up thousands of calories each day
(11:53:43) Arne: 300, that's 45 minutes of running
(11:54:08) jsticker: running builds muscles though
(11:54:17) fartronomicon: arne you are meant to use up thousands of calories a day
(11:54:20) Arne: I find that hard to believe, the legs are very large muscle groups, the arm is not
(11:54:36) Arne: yes, but I meant on top of idle
(11:54:49) fartronomicon: you are not meant to be idle
(11:55:17) Arne: I looked it up, I use 2700 a day in front of hte machine

(11:55:32) Arne: 2100 is my base value
(11:55:44) RinkuHero: that's not something it's easy to look up though
(11:55:47) RinkuHero: there's personal variation
(11:55:50) Arne: 4200 is if I work out a lot
(11:55:52) RinkuHero: due to fidgeting and other such things
(11:56:15) Arne: sure, but it's probably approximately correct
(11:56:21) Arne: I'm kind of average built
(11:56:37) Arne: I'm sure it doesn't apply to extreme cases
(11:56:57) corpus: jsticker, jsticker, where are you

(13:03:33) C418: I bought spore galaxy edition you see
(13:03:40) C418: and ea said my version was illegal
(13:03:47) C418: and now I take revenge by not buying sims 3
(13:04:04) jsticker: I dunno if it works like that, karma
(13:04:17) C418: it kinda does in a complicated way
(13:04:40) C418: if ea wouldn't have said my version was illegal, I may have ended up buying sims 3
(13:04:43) C418: it' not a bad game
(13:04:45) C418: plus s
(13:05:18) jsticker: With a typing like that you shouldn't be the head of an entire virtual family
(13:05:41) C418: I usually only go like career-wise
(13:06:01) C418: and then the game crashed. and I'm pretty sure it's the retail version anyway
(13:06:21) yeoz left the room.
(13:06:45) jsticker: They should add sex to the SIms formula
(13:07:19) jsticker: There actually was a game like that called Singles. The second game in that series was the first game I ever reviewed professionally. It was actually a good game
(13:07:36) C418: eh
(13:07:40) C418: sex was there since sims 2
(13:07:42) Stargoat: I think i remember the Something Awful review of that
(13:07:42) jsticker: You could try to hook up with dudes or girls (playing as a dude or a girl)
(13:07:43) hao-1 left the room.
(13:07:50) C418: you can fuck the whole town if you want
(13:07:55) C418: you can even fuck in public
(13:08:01) jsticker: Can you really?
(13:08:03) C418: yes
(13:08:03) Stargoat: that's illegal
(13:08:03) Ina left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(13:08:11) C418: it's actually a goal of sims 2 as I recall it
(13:08:24) C418: if you have a lot of sex, your sim wishes to... go crazy in public
(13:08:25) jsticker: Or is it just them hopping into bed, a music playing and then it's done?
(13:08:35) C418: well, you can't see anything of course
(13:08:40) jsticker: :(
(13:08:43) C418: and it isn't called sex
(13:08:46) jsticker: Can you have weird sex formations
(13:08:50) C418: it's still a pg rated game
(13:08:50) jsticker: Like two dudes and a girl
(13:08:56) C418: possible
(13:08:58) C418: never tried
(13:09:39) fartronomicon: and a hamster
(13:09:44) C418: but yeah, thats why esrb said the game has sexual content, but it being still pg
(13:09:46) jsticker: I've youtubed and sims sex lasts exactly 8 seconds
(13:09:56) fartronomicon: poor sims
(13:09:59) C418: thats 8 minutes
(13:10:02) C418: sounds realistic
(13:10:14) C418: :D
(13:10:23) fartronomicon: poor C418 
(13:10:41) jsticker: No hot videos of Singles 2 on youtube because that's actually pornographic, I guess
(13:10:41) jsticker: :D
(13:10:43) C418: yeah, you're probably one of those people having sex for over two hours
(13:11:03) shinygerbil: Aren't we all
(13:11:33) C418: gerbil comes to berlin, he sure does
(13:12:23) jsticker: Then he can show us his two hour sex

(13:13:06) fartronomicon: C418,  have you ever used this http://www.soundsonline.com/Quantum-Leap-Gypsy-pr-EW-172.html
(13:13:12) fartronomicon: or do you know anything about it
(13:13:13) shinygerbil: -ecnadmar
(13:13:35) shinygerbil: right i'm going to street fighter
(13:13:38) shinygerbil: later, pussies
(13:13:49) ramdance-: later pussy
(13:13:55) shinygerbil: pussy will be later
(13:13:55) fartronomicon: my friend has been talking to me about it and it kind of sounds like he doesn't even know what it is, despite being really excited about it
(13:14:20) worstplay [miranda@92.52.13.242] entered the room.
(13:14:31) C418: quantum leap is a good sampling company, they really are
(13:14:36) C418: but I hate samples actually
(13:15:05) C418: and I think my daw has enough sampled stuff for that matter anyway
(13:15:09) ramdance- left the room.
(13:15:35) C418: well, things labeled as "for games" aren't really that much for games
(13:15:53) C418: theres a presetpack for absynth 4, called a soundpack for games
(13:16:03) C418: utter crap actually, you can use everything for games
(13:16:26) Ina [InaVegt@5ED73BFE.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(13:17:06) fartronomicon: they mean for derivative and uninventive games
(13:17:37) C418: hm
(13:17:39) C418: makes sense
(13:18:13) C418: well, if you consider buying or warezing this, I can tell you, quantum leap is good
(13:18:21) C418: so you can't go that wrong
(13:18:35) jsticker: quick, ban C418, he is a pirate
(13:19:12) plachenko: http://www.inbflat.net/
(13:19:19) C418: think about this before you say such a thing
(13:19:20) Arne: Twitter
(13:19:28) Arne: people are asking be about twitter
(13:19:34) C418: you buy a maybe 600 dollar samplebase just because you think it could be good?
(13:19:34) Arne: fuck off twitter
(13:19:36) C418: seriously?
(13:19:39) Arne: fuck off facebook too
(13:19:47) C418: quantum leap has no demo versions
(13:19:58) C418: and I'd say nobody except studios would buy stuff that fast
(13:20:14) C418: this is interesting plachenko
(13:20:23) plachenko: hah, yeah
(13:20:30) plachenko: ambient shit through youtube uploads
(13:22:15) adamrobo left the room (quit: Quit: adamrobo).
(13:22:56) C418: only one video has a kind of rhytmic
(13:23:03) C418: so this makes it sound good everytime
(13:23:29) jsticker: It's a lot better running ?torrent
(13:23:34) jsticker: Lots of buffer stops
(13:23:49) fartronomicon: c4 do you know if these samples can be played without using their "sample engine"
(13:23:50) worstplay: that would be pretty cool for a game soundtrack
(13:24:05) fartronomicon: like what format they would come in
(13:24:05) C418: no. they're often password protected
(13:24:10) fartronomicon: that's fucking lame
(13:24:13) C418: and they use a native instruments software
(13:24:15) C418: ...
(13:24:18) jsticker: worstplay: Yes, if it was dynamically sampled from youtube videos like this site
(13:24:18) C418: kontakt or something like that
(13:25:18) worstplay: they don't look dynamically sampled to me
(13:25:43) worstplay: everytime i reload i get same clips
(13:25:44) jsticker: The way you play these videos simultaneously is quite dynamic, isn't it
(13:25:51) worstplay: ah
(13:25:55) worstplay: that's what i meant
(13:26:00) jsticker: Ah, alright
(13:26:12) jsticker: Then we even agree
(13:26:16) C418:  you can't get it exactly the same
(13:26:24) C418: it's always different
(13:26:34) jsticker: Especially with torrent running
(13:26:35) jsticker: 8)
(13:26:37) qubodup [qubodup@brln-4db94aa4.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(13:27:02) fartronomicon: you could get it the same if they let you timestamp the vids
(13:27:13) fartronomicon: #t=1m30s
(13:27:15) fartronomicon: for example
(13:27:25) fartronomicon: works on any yt url
(13:27:39) plachenko: they should be able to let you loop certain parts of a video
(13:27:44) worstplay: i tried again, same clips
(13:27:53) C418: that wouldn't work either because youtube buffering is slow
(13:28:20) fartronomicon: you would have to prebuffer too
(13:28:25) fartronomicon: with them on pause
(13:28:41) C418: yeah, that could work. but after all, this isn't what the author wanted
(13:28:49) fartronomicon: i understand
(13:28:53) fartronomicon: i'm just thinking of other ways to do it
(13:36:26) C418: this ambient thing gives me a nice feeling
(13:36:41) C418: I kind of enjoy the silence after every video stopped
(13:39:17) SimonTheDigger: so
(13:39:28) SimonTheDigger: how many of you hepcats know about the final boss of Punch-Out!! for Wii?
(13:41:44) C418: nobody it seems
(13:42:34) C418: hilarious
(13:42:59) fartronomicon: i hope it's mike tyson
(13:42:59) C418: I looked up one of my older songs, about 3 years old I think, and the mastering consisted of one compressor
(13:43:02) C418: to master everything
(13:43:26) SimonTheDigger: fart: do you really wanna know?
(13:43:29) SimonTheDigger: because I can totally tell you
(13:43:44) fartronomicon: i only wanna know if it's mike tyson
(13:43:51) SimonTheDigger: it's not
(13:43:56) SimonTheDigger: it's better than mike tyson
(13:44:03) fartronomicon: it couldn't be
(13:44:14) SimonTheDigger: what if I told you
(13:44:17) fartronomicon: unless it were..
(13:44:21) fartronomicon: but go on

(13:44:46) fartronomicon: cassius clay would be better
(13:45:09) SimonTheDigger: Punch-Out!! is about being fun, not realistic
(13:45:21) fartronomicon: punch out is about mike tyson

(14:57:58) C418: no bottomless pits anymore? that kinda takes the noby boy feeling away
(14:59:19) Siiseli: http://siiseli.dy.fi/ I suck at thiiiis
(14:59:40) Siiseli: how do I fix it
(15:00:24) Rotab: fix wat
(15:00:34) Notch_: pyl: Oh.. Hum.. let's see..
(15:00:48) Siiseli: Rotab, the godawful colors
(15:00:52) Rotab: oh
(15:00:55) Notch_: well, if you lead infinite water into a small lake, cut it off, then expand that lake, it'd be infinite
(15:01:05) pyl: yes, that's what needs
(15:01:09) pyl: changing
(15:01:14) pyl: some way to un-infinite the water
(15:01:20) Notch_: hmm
(15:01:21) pyl: which is the problem i guess
(15:01:42) pyl: but given that the computation was expensive
(15:01:46) Notch_: I have to say, I'm getting very very confused with this whole 3d cellular automata thingie I've got going on, hehe
(15:01:57) pyl: could you walk through the water in the same way you walk through empty spaces
(15:02:05) pyl: to calculate wether it should be finite or not
(15:02:12) pyl: to avoid it taking lots of time?
(15:02:30) Gravious left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving.).
(15:02:37) Notch_: non-infinite water has the problem that small amounts of them in a large container would wobble about randomly
(15:02:47) C418: digging up lava is kind of interesting if it happens accidently
(15:03:01) pyl: i think in those cases you should just interpolate
(15:03:02) C418: you instinctively want to go far away from it. as fast as you can
(15:03:05) pyl: and have it "dry up"
(15:03:08) pyl: or
(15:03:12) pyl: fill up
(15:03:25) pyl: to a number of squares to give a flat surface
(15:03:36) Notch_: if the water if pouring out of something, it's less of a problem. Just remove the tiles furthest away from the pour point first
(15:04:52) Notch_: that'd make lakes very boolean. Either they dry up very fast, or fill very fast and become something that for all intents and purposes is infinite water since you'd have to make the container huge in a very short time to make it dry out again, heh
(15:05:09) Notch_: humm.. perhaps random evaporation is the answer
(15:05:32) Notch_: every now and then, I check a surface tile of water. If its surface isn't connected to the ocean around the level, I remove the entire top level of water
(15:05:34) Hachi-Roku left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:05:44) pyl: and say it "seeps into the ground" or something :]
(15:05:50) Notch_: yeah, good idea
(15:06:14) Notch_: it only requires a 2d flood fill since it's only along the surface
(15:06:23) Notch_: wait, that won't work too well..  argh
(15:06:25) Notch_: it's too complex!!
(15:06:39) pyl: it's funny, cause the fact it's an abstracted, simpler model
(15:06:43) pyl: actually makes it harder to figure out
(15:06:44) pyl: :)
(15:06:46) Notch_: a lake connected to the ocean but one tile down would constantly evaporate, refill, evaporate, refill
(15:10:03) Notch_: ack, I'll focus on saving levels now instead. =)

(16:49:42) genericuser: I'm still unsure about how many of those are real
(16:49:43) fartron: that same girl got number 21 too
(16:49:56) fartron: some might be trolls i guess
(16:49:59) fartron: but i think mostly real
(16:50:00) genericuser: but seeing as the Internet in general is full of idiots
(16:50:17) genericuser: I'll assume all of them are real
(16:50:18) Siiseli: lol fartron 
(16:50:23) genericuser: At least, the elitism behind them is
(16:50:27) jsticker: It's not a surprise 100% of those people are amaricans though
(16:50:42) jsticker: The whole site seems like europeans making fun of amarica
(16:50:55) fartron: how do you know they're all american
(16:51:00) fartron: besides your european superiority
(16:51:06) jsticker: I just know it

(16:51:21) jsticker: When you're from this side of the pond, you have a certain sensibility
(16:51:27) fartron: you can "just tell"
(16:51:54) Turgid: Oh look, it's a bunch of people being elitist idiots, must be americans.

(16:56:20) nihilocrat: hahah
(16:56:21) C418: I have so much halfway interesting abandoned projects
(16:56:34) nihilocrat: twitter lets me peek into the lives of people who I will never know
(16:56:39) nihilocrat: and who I will never understand
(16:56:39) fartron: so did blogs
(16:56:46) C418: the thing I'm listening to now. why the hell did I never touch it again. I have no fucking idea
(16:57:00) C418: it's not bad. just half done
(16:57:07) nihilocrat: "                  Watching a LOT of fashion mistakes go past whilst waiting for the bus. This is why I don't use public transport.     "
(16:57:09) nihilocrat: this is a great site
(16:57:17) fartron: some years ago i randomly came across some blog for this kid in highschool from the midwest and he had links to his friend's blogs and i just started following their lives for a while
(16:57:22) genericuser: Except Twitter shows their lives in bite-sized chunks

(16:57:30) Jr: that sounds neat

(16:57:40) genericuser: while blogs are long essays about certain, most likely boring, parts of them
(16:57:40) Jr: please try to interpret that in a non-creepy way
(16:57:50) fartron: it had a creep element, but that's the internet for you
(16:57:54) Jr: Yes
(16:58:03) Jr: the general rule, I've found
(16:58:22) Jr: is that you may only mention your creeping publicly via whatever method you are creeping
(16:58:27) jsticker: :D
(16:58:29) fartron: it was kind of surreal because i would hear about these events that i had no way of knowing about, from several perspectives
(16:58:30) genericuser: :D
(16:58:33) Jr: Never mention facebook stuff offline
(16:58:39) Jr: twitter, maybe
(16:58:39) jsticker: haha
(16:58:50) Jr: but only if it's noteworthy
(16:58:57) jsticker: I don't see this the same way
(16:59:02) Orestes left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(16:59:05) jsticker: If people publish it online, it's all a-okay
(16:59:10) Jr: yeah
(16:59:11) genericuser: I think the reason it's so creepy
(16:59:16) genericuser: is because of the BOFH potential
(16:59:20) jsticker: BOFH?
(16:59:26) fartron: what does he have to do with it
(16:59:28) Jr: I find that facebook has a wonderful unwritten code of conduct
(16:59:32) genericuser: blackmail and such
(16:59:38) fartron: but it's published online already
(16:59:46) nihilocrat: it has an unwritten code of conduct?
(16:59:54) genericuser: Still, you can creep people out
(17:00:09) fartron: you're making an ass of yourself for all eternity!
(17:00:16) fartron: where are your brains!?
(17:00:17) jsticker: I'm more freaked out by forgetting about song scrobbling for example
(17:00:25) jsticker: And someone chatting me up because of the last song I heard
(17:00:36) genericuser: fartron: Who?
(17:00:37) nihilocrat: haha
(17:00:37) jsticker: "what the fuck where are you"
(17:00:40) nihilocrat: that sounds scary
(17:00:54) fartron: it's a video generic

(17:01:11) fartron: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqAypbgaUKM&fmt=18

(17:04:16) jsticker: How brilliant is this keyboard cat idea
(17:04:21) genericuser: Cry to the internet?
(17:04:22) fartron: i wasn't so into it until i saw that video
(17:04:24) jsticker: From 1 to amazing, it is a 9
(17:04:31) genericuser: That is one of the worst ideas ever
(17:04:43) fartron: no, he means the idea of putting keyboard cat at the end of other videos
(17:04:44) genericuser: It's not rubbing salt into the wound
(17:05:00) C418: but in the vagina
(17:05:07) jsticker: C418, high five
(17:05:16) C418: .o/
(17:05:20) jsticker: :D

(17:07:02) nihilocrat: hahaha
(17:07:14) C418: keyboard cat jokes are very sadistic
(17:07:18) nihilocrat: I think firey death is pretty damn funny
(17:07:26) nihilocrat: oh my get out of the way please
(17:07:29) fartron: yeah, i think the most popular one is when the wheelchair kid falls down the escalator
(17:07:36) genericuser: OMG, the Hindenburg?
(17:07:41) nihilocrat: people from the 1920s (?) are funny
(17:07:54) nihilocrat: "oh god get out of the way oh my god worst catastrophe ever"
(17:08:02) Jr: Hindenburg is one of my favorite things
(17:08:08) fartron: apparently the tape of that is always played back slightly faster than it was recorded
(17:08:08) nihilocrat: 20 die in zepplin crash
(17:08:09) Jr: the idea
(17:08:10) nihilocrat: film at 11
(17:08:10) Succendo: lemme take a dump on your chest
(17:08:14) fartron: so the guy's voice isn't meant to be so high
(17:08:24) Jr: MAW
(17:08:40) Jr: Also, cuban missile crisis
(17:08:50) Jr: and moonpeople
(17:08:59) fartron: eh?
(17:09:06) genericuser: ?
(17:09:33) Arne left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(17:09:41) jsticker: Jr, I agree, the wheelchair one is horribly funny too
(17:09:54) jsticker: It's the cats apathetic face plus the melody right after the video is done
(17:10:00) Jr: and I have not seen the wheelchair one
(17:10:11) jsticker: Oh, then who was it
(17:10:19) fartron: i mentioned it as one of the most popular
(17:10:20) jsticker: Oh, fartron
(17:10:33) nihilocrat: I think hindenburg and keyboard cat is a pretty good fit
(17:10:40) fartron: yeah, it's definitely the cat's face and the melody
(17:10:43) fartron: which makes it so hilarious
(17:11:07) Parthon: it's only a matter of time before someone does it to the wtc collapse
(17:11:13) Jr: hahah
(17:11:32) Jr: :|
(17:11:37) genericuser: Even though it was 8-9 years ago
(17:11:46) genericuser: I think that would be a "Too Soon" moment
(17:11:51) jsticker: Nah
(17:11:56) Jr: Yeah
(17:11:56) fartron: someone has to be the first
(17:12:06) fartron: there will always be someone saying too soon
(17:12:08) jsticker: Definitely not too soon
(17:12:08) Jr: GOTTA LET IT GO, MANG
(17:12:08) genericuser: The Postal movie was first
(17:12:17) fartron: JSTICKER YOU ARE NOT A MURICAN
(17:12:21) fartron: YOU DONT GET TO SAY
(17:12:23) jsticker: :(
(17:12:30) genericuser: And I don't think Uwe Boll counts as "first"
(17:12:34) jsticker: Just saying, there's been so many jokes
(17:12:51) fartron: yeah, i recall going online at like 10:30 9/11/01 and seeing "someone set us up the bomb" parodies already
(17:13:03) jsticker: One or two weeks after WTC there's been the news channel screencap with the "NEWS BREAK: NYC LEGALIZES MARIJUANA" caption
(17:13:10) jsticker: That was quite soon, but definitely funny
(17:13:17) Jr: Hah

(17:14:27) genericuser: ah

(17:19:30) Andy_W: fartron the vaporware compo is backwards
(17:19:37) Jr: OH MAN
(17:19:39) Andy_W: you make the games that were vaporware

(17:22:48) fartron: you make a game for a specific person
(17:23:01) fartron: and they don't know you're doing it
(17:23:18) Andy_W: you start making a game, then after a while everyone passes their games to someone else for them to finish it
(17:23:19) genericuser: Except in the worst case, you'd get people who would make crappy games just to get a good one from someone else
(17:23:39) fartron: well in the end we'd get to see them all
(17:23:41) genericuser: Andy_W: Good idea
(17:23:46) genericuser: Until someone comes along
(17:23:48) fartron: exquisite game
(17:23:54) genericuser: And makes a game in Brainfuck
(17:24:03) genericuser: or Malbolge

(18:48:43) jsticker: That's actually not bad, I guess
(18:48:46) lansing: using php?
(18:48:48) Siiseli: yup
(18:48:50) jsticker: There must be hundreds of thousands of players
(18:48:55) lansing: that's what you're doing wrong
(18:49:02) Siiseli: lansing, employer wants me to learn it
(18:49:03) Siiseli: I learn it
(18:49:06) Siiseli: end of story
(18:49:10) lansing: it was a joke :P
(18:49:18) Siiseli: k
(18:49:32) Siiseli: so, what doth I be doingst wrongfully
(18:49:50) lansing: look at line 27

(18:52:54) lansing: drop the quotes around $row['username']?
(18:53:57) lansing: if you seperated the stuff to the right of the equals statement on a new line, php -l on the script would have pointed you to that line
(18:54:00) Siiseli: sure it doesn't throw an error then but it doesn't work either
(18:54:15) lansing: what doesn't work?
(18:54:21) Siiseli: but yeah that means we get more problems
(18:54:28) Siiseli: lansing, I get a blank file
(18:54:49) BlademasterBobo: RinkuHero
(18:54:53) lansing: this is why you use some framework instead of doing from scratch
(18:55:01) Siiseli: lansing, this is how I learn
(18:55:10) BlademasterBobo: Is there some secret method to building / managing drones and attacking at the same time?
(18:55:12) BlademasterBobo: o_O
(18:55:13) lansing: Siiseli, ok, well add more debugging
(18:55:13) Siiseli: I don't try to get stuff done I try to learn how to do stuff myself
(18:56:16) lansing: Siiseli, if you want to trace the value of stuff, you can open a file and use fprintf throughout your script to show the value of variables
(18:56:23) BlademasterBobo: or
(18:56:27) BlademasterBobo: you can learn how to use a debugger
(18:56:28) BlademasterBobo: :U
(18:56:28) Siiseli: or.. echo
(18:56:34) Siiseli: dude. php. 
(18:56:45) lansing: echo doesn't really work if it's a web script Siiseli
(18:56:49) Andy_W: or you can try to speak to your computer and ask it what its doing
(18:56:54) Siiseli: yyeah
(18:56:56) Andy_W: beep boop
(18:56:57) lansing: echoing in the middle of processing an upload, echoing before you send http headers, that's just wrong
(18:56:59) Andy_W: beboooop boop
(18:57:00) BlademasterBobo: Androu1
(18:57:04) lansing: that's why you'd output to a file

(18:58:32) RinkuHero: i don't know, i don't play zerg
(18:58:33) RinkuHero: however
(18:58:40) RinkuHero: i hear a lot of zergs hotkey their hatcheries
(18:58:48) RinkuHero: so they don't need to go and click on them in order to make stuff
(18:58:57) RinkuHero: they can just press 4 then l then h or something
(18:58:59) RinkuHero: to make 3 hydra
(18:59:02) BlademasterBobo: Rinku: Yeha, that's what I do
(18:59:06) BlademasterBobo: but, like
(18:59:14) BlademasterBobo: how can you get those drones building while you're attacking?
(18:59:18) BlademasterBobo: it's easy to build the drones
(18:59:22) BlademasterBobo: but not easy to make them do stuff
(18:59:27) Z80: I am rapping about THE SECRET OF SHERMAN AND BUCHANAN.  It is about Buchanan forming the Confederacy and only Sherman knowing it.  Sherman's all like, "The fuck?"  And Buchanan's like, "It was a necessary step!  Also, I am gay."

(18:59:47) RinkuHero: possible
(18:59:49) fartron: what do you mean only sherman knowing it

(19:01:43) jsticker: That sounds interesting, fartron
(19:01:49) fartron: here is the tricky part
(19:01:52) fartron: both keys must be pressed at the same time
(19:02:01) fartron: but the tab key cannot
(19:02:04) fartron: i repeat: cannot
(19:02:04) jsticker: Quite a challenge for the young user

(19:26:36) Hachi-Roku: alternate argument - wasd is a common configuration for FPS PC games, along with a lot of MMOs lately, including world of warcraft.  by simply eliminating 
(19:26:52) Hachi-Roku: 'w' and 'a', you keep the familiar hand positioning
(19:26:56) fartron: wasd is common because everyone wanted to be fatal1ty

(19:38:06) BlademasterBobo: maybe so
(19:38:09) Zaratustra: is it intentional that it is boring
(19:38:11) RinkuHero: it works perfectly if the intent is to make the player get lost
(19:38:29) BlademasterBobo: yeah, but it shouldn't be so confusing that 90% of players don't even know why they won
(19:38:30) Zaratustra: I managed to clear the maze -before- knowing I had a flashlight

(20:09:56) PhoenixJ: as prominent as in the rest of the song
(20:10:04) C418: that was kinda the part where I thought "FUCK THIS PIECE OF SHIT SONG CRAP ASS." or kinda in that way
(20:10:12) jsticker: :D
(20:10:14) PhoenixJ: so like
(20:10:19) PhoenixJ: that loop's volume increased
(20:10:24) jsticker: Writing music is just like writing text then, C418
(20:10:30) PFawkes: hmm

(20:11:52) PFawkes: So, like, the only reason I use iTunes is for the exclusive stuff
(20:11:55) jsticker: But they did stop using DRM; right?
(20:11:56) SMRobot [littleripp@58.168.106.203] entered the room.
(20:11:56) PFawkes: which is now higher :(
(20:11:59) jsticker: It's now all mp3?
(20:12:00) PFawkes: yes, they did
(20:12:01) Z80_: I trust this fine evening is treating you well?
(20:12:02) PFawkes: no
(20:12:04) PFawkes: it's aac
(20:12:05) C418: my creativity is drained now, so I could just complete your request
(20:12:06) PFawkes: but drm-free
(20:12:10) C418: now... which hdd has this song...
(20:12:11) PFawkes: so that's ok
(20:12:13) jsticker: ...
(20:12:28) jsticker: Fuck AAC
(20:12:33) PFawkes: well
(20:12:35) PFawkes: >.>
(20:12:37) PFawkes: it's ok
(20:12:40) PFawkes: aac isn't bad
(20:12:43) PFawkes: it
(20:12:44) jsticker: No it's not
(20:12:55) jsticker: Err, it is
(20:12:59) PFawkes: ?
(20:13:00) jsticker: No it's not not bad, basically
(20:13:05) PhoenixJ: (17:12:46) jsticker: Fuck AAC
(20:13:06) PhoenixJ: ?
(20:13:10) PFawkes: they also improved the bitrate
(20:13:11) PFawkes: I note
(20:13:11) PhoenixJ: you mean romantically then?
(20:13:14) PFawkes: it's twice as high
(20:13:16) PFawkes: :)
(20:13:18) PFawkes: 256
(20:13:27) PFawkes: which is about right for an iPod anyway
(20:13:28) _SMRobot [littleripp@58.168.106.203] entered the room.
(20:13:34) jsticker: Properly ripped MP3s, FLAC or GTFO
(20:13:38) fartron: doesn't an ipod downmix them?
(20:13:40) jsticker: They charge quite a lot for songs already
(20:13:51) PFawkes: well yes
(20:13:54) JamesGecko: jsticker, MP3 is an awful format for preserving quality...
(20:13:57) PFawkes: I only use it for the stuff I can't get cheap
(20:14:00) fartron: i thought ipods only do 128
(20:14:00) PFawkes: you know
(20:14:07) PFawkes: but it's good that it's higher
(20:14:11) PFawkes: I can listen on comp as well
(20:14:14) PFawkes: you know?
(20:14:20) jsticker: JamesGecko, it depends a lot on the type of music and ripping method
(20:14:30) PFawkes: aac is better than mp3, sure
(20:14:33) jsticker: Lots of MP3 are transparent at 192+ or V0/V2
(20:14:34) PFawkes: but ogg is better than both
(20:14:36) PFawkes: >.>
(20:14:40) PFawkes: or not
(20:14:42) fartron: but how do they get it to 128 for the ipod? if you recompress it, you will lose tons of data
(20:14:44) PFawkes: see, it all depends
(20:14:58) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:15:00) PFawkes: no, fartron, I think it can handle 256
(20:15:05) jsticker: They just use AAC as standard because that helps them sell their fucking ipods
(20:15:09) fartron: the old ones couldn't
(20:15:10) PFawkes: probably it's optimised for aac
(20:15:15) PFawkes: you know
(20:15:30) PFawkes: I remember they used to say it couldn't physically handle OGG due to memory usahe
(20:15:40) PFawkes: which means they're lazy or ripping you off
(20:15:46) PFawkes: likely both
(20:15:59) JamesGecko: I was under the impression they used AAC so they could control the DRM
(20:16:07) plachenko: http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/1778/spyj.jpg
(20:16:10) plachenko: jarate is going to be
(20:16:10) PFawkes: well, but they still use aac
(20:16:13) plachenko: level 4 lunchbox
(20:16:15) PFawkes: even now that none has a drm
(20:16:17) jsticker: That too, JamesGecko, yeah
(20:16:22) C418: I'm lucky today
(20:16:28) PFawkes: and you can use it in any mp3 player
(20:16:28) C418: found that song on the fifth try
(20:16:33) jsticker: Watermarked files et al
(20:16:39) C418: I had like 50 projects to search through
(20:16:40) PFawkes: well, perhaps
(20:16:49) PFawkes: you can watermark mp3s though
(20:16:53) PFawkes: emusic watermarks their stuff
(20:16:58) Ciahnensy: That's terrible.
(20:17:00) PFawkes: I <3 emusic though
(20:17:09) PFawkes: 25 cent songs are amazing
(20:17:14) fartron: do they use an id3 tag?
(20:17:32) PFawkes: well, I think they actually have a watermark in the music
(20:17:35) PFawkes: but an invisible one
(20:17:39) PFawkes: you know what I mean?
(20:17:44) PFawkes: nonintrusive
(20:17:52) JamesGecko: How does that work? Will it carry over if you burn it to a CD and then rip it?
(20:17:53) fartron: sounds impossible
(20:18:00) PFawkes: not really
(20:18:12) fartron: how can you change the music data without changing how it sounds
(20:18:21) PFawkes: if you use a proper algorythm you can put the bits in where it's not audible
(20:18:21) lansing: I think it's just specific to the mp3 format
(20:18:45) PFawkes: steganography sort of thing
(20:18:57) jsticker: emusic doesn't watermark their mp3s, as far as I know
(20:18:58) Z80_: Stegosaurography.
(20:19:07) PFawkes: anyway, I prefer that sort of copyright protection to DRM
(20:19:23) JamesGecko: lansing, It seems like there are likely any number of formats you could do it to. You'd use different algorithms for each one.
(20:19:31) PFawkes: yes, true
(20:19:36) C418: ookay
(20:19:38) C418: so
(20:19:44) C418: PhoenixJ
(20:19:46) PFawkes: so?
(20:19:48) jsticker: People compared watermarks of tracks they got etc
(20:19:55) jsticker: Also, emusic stated that officially
(20:19:58) Pepe left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:19:58) jsticker: just saying
(20:20:00) PFawkes: did they?
(20:20:08) jsticker: There's companies that don't suck
(20:20:11) PFawkes: I think they DO watermark the audiobooks though
(20:20:17) jsticker: Yeah, that they do :/
(20:20:21) lansing: I tried to buy digital music once, but amazon wouldn't let me, apparently digital music is only for americans.
(20:20:21) jsticker: But not music
(20:20:21) PFawkes: yeah
(20:20:23) jsticker: Weird, innit
(20:20:27) PFawkes: I love emusic
(20:20:34) jsticker: I just cancelled my account
(20:20:37) jsticker: Two days ago
(20:20:39) PFawkes: nono
(20:20:42) PFawkes: I don't subscribe
(20:20:43) jsticker: yesyes
(20:20:43) C418: you want the dee doo da doo more prominent in the entire song... okay...
(20:20:45) jsticker: Oh
(20:20:47) PFawkes: you can buy cards here
(20:20:49) jsticker: Yeah
(20:20:52) C418: it's just that it's overriding two synths at that part...
(20:20:55) jsticker: I had a monthly subscription
(20:20:57) PFawkes: like, say, 20 bucks for 60 songs
(20:20:58) jsticker: For about half a year
(20:20:59) PFawkes: or whatever
(20:21:06) PFawkes: hundred bucks for 400 songs
(20:21:09) PFawkes: O.o
(20:21:11) jsticker: But their songs catalogue got tinier and tinier
(20:21:21) PFawkes: well, see, that's why
(20:21:24) jsticker: and tinier and tinier and tinier and tinier
(20:21:30) PFawkes: ?
(20:21:33) PFawkes: they have a lot of music I like
(20:21:37) jsticker: Songs I got months ago aren't available anymore

(20:22:01) PFawkes: it makes me say
(20:22:03) PFawkes: sad*

(20:22:52) Siiseli: jesus
(20:22:54) C418: I like audiobooks

(20:32:24) PiratePoo: The update is releasing tomorrow, isn't it?
(20:33:45) C418: so the sniper has now a jar of pee to disgust enemies and distinguish fires
(20:33:47) C418: ew
(20:34:05) fartron: pfawkes i've seen that
(20:34:13) fartron: disney still has a page up
(20:34:31) PFawkes: It's so... wrong!
(20:35:04) PFawkes: especially since apparently one of their covers is of Freedom of Choice
(20:35:46) Z80_: Best Sniper achievement name: "Not a Crazed Gunman, Dad"
(20:35:55) fartron: they leave off the last line of "a beautiful world"
(20:36:00) fartron: the one that makes it all sarcastic
(20:36:01) PFawkes: ?
(20:36:03) PFawkes: :(
(20:36:09) PFawkes: but not for me!
(20:36:13) Z80_: Then there is also "William Tell Overkill".
(20:36:13) fartron: yeah
(20:36:20) PFawkes: But I mean, the entire song of Freedom of Choice
(20:36:29) SMRobot [littleripp@58.168.106.203] entered the room.
(20:36:30) PFawkes: is the OPPOSITE of this
(20:36:34) PFawkes: how do they reconcile?
(20:36:42) fartron: devo sold a beautiful world to target too for an ad
(20:36:45) fartron: and they removed that line too
(20:36:50) PFawkes: it reminds me of when the school censored my cousin
(20:36:56) PiratePoo: I like the Friendship is Golden one
(20:36:57) PFawkes: he wanted to sing A Day In The Life
(20:37:00) PFawkes: you know?
(20:37:02) PiratePoo: with the Jarate jar icon
(20:37:16) Z80_: Well, yeah.
(20:37:19) PFawkes: "he blew his brains out in a car"
(20:37:22) fartron: yeah i know it
(20:37:25) fartron: they stopped him?
(20:37:25) PFawkes: can't have that :D
(20:37:26) Z80_: But you're named PiratePoo, PiratePoo.
(20:37:31) PFawkes: they changed the line
(20:37:43) PiratePoo: So?
(20:37:47) PFawkes: I think it was "he pulled his car up just too far"
(20:37:49) PFawkes: or something stupdi

(20:39:00) Z80__: <fartron> why hypocritical?
(20:39:09) fartron: i said that
(20:39:10) PFawkes: ?
(20:39:15) PFawkes: what do you mean
(20:39:27) fartron: well what had they said that made it seem like they wouldn't censor it
(20:39:29) fartron: or something
(20:39:34) PFawkes: because you can only have the song if you take away its meaning
(20:39:56) fartron: yeah, and that's shitty, but i don't see hypocrisy
(20:40:23) PFawkes: like when advertisers use the very beginning of Fortunate Son
(20:40:24) PFawkes: and so on
(20:40:34) Pepe [pepe@173-96-127-163.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(20:40:42) PFawkes: because people want to appear to use popular music, but they don't want to be connected to the message?

(20:40:50) PFawkes: isn't that hypocrisy?

(20:44:55) PFawkes: Z80
(20:45:01) PFawkes: the thing is, if you use the FIRST TWO lines
(20:45:05) PFawkes: it sounds vaguely patriotic
(20:45:12) Z80: True.
(20:45:29) fartron: people use Born in the USA the same way
(20:45:30) PFawkes: so... Van Heusen (?) did that
(20:45:34) PFawkes: it really annoyed me
(20:45:50) PFawkes: yeah
(20:45:52) PFawkes: that's true
(20:46:00) PFawkes: :(
(20:46:07) fartron: you can tell someone's politics by whether they prefer lynyrd skynyrd or creedence

(20:46:37) PFawkes: :D
(20:46:40) PFawkes: how so?
(20:46:53) fartron: look at the words to sweet home alabama
(20:46:57) PFawkes: If, say, I prefer Creedence what does it say?
(20:47:03) fartron: left
(20:47:06) fartron: antiwar
(20:47:06) PFawkes: :DC

(20:47:10) PFawkes: yes
(20:47:15) PFawkes: that's good then
(20:47:28) PFawkes: oh, have you heard the inexplicable remix of Sweet Home Alabama?
(20:47:34) fartron: sweet home alabama is all about backlash to lefty music
(20:47:38) PFawkes: where they use the music from Werewolves of London
(20:47:42) fartron: Now Watergate does not bother me
(20:47:42) fartron: Does your conscience bother you? 
(20:47:45) PFawkes: but sing Sweet home alabama

(20:54:50) fartron: oh it's that beach boys song
(20:55:00) PFawkes: It was really weird at the time, because for some reason they also kept playing Werewolves of London

(21:07:38) Z80: Who wants to play Tee Eff Two PC?
(21:07:48) IrishFawkes: not me for certainty
(21:07:49) Super-Dot: Actually more like a bzzt
(21:08:05) Super-Dot: I don't have Tee Eff Two
(21:08:05) Zaratustra: Super-Dot: because adding controls for that would get in the way of increpare's 8-games-a-week schedule

(21:08:24) PhoenixJisNowAway: so mspaint adventures has an IRC channel
(21:08:28) PhoenixJisNowAway: that is also on esper
(21:08:30) IrishFawkes: increpare is clearly a railroading DM
(21:08:32) Super-Dot: I do like how it tells you what order to beat it in
(21:08:38) Z80: I would not want to visit that, PhoenixJisNowAway.

(21:11:26) Super-Dot: The only thing worse than being a jerk is being an uninformed jerk
(21:11:28) IrishFawkes: because lugaru is a game with giant fighting rabbits?
(21:11:31) Z80: We were discussing furries.

(21:45:46) plachenko: not this update

(21:45:57) IrishFawkes|Rez: ?

(21:45:59) IrishFawkes|Rez: z..z.

(21:46:10) IrishFawkes|Rez: whatever
(21:46:14) IrishFawkes|Rez: that's not the point
(21:46:16) plachenko: instead of being achieved through a number of achievments
(21:46:19) SMRobot: we need an engie update:(
(21:46:24) IrishFawkes|Rez: beating 400 people up with a bottle is not good gameplay

(21:46:26) El_Shamro: indeed
(21:46:28) IrishFawkes|Rez: even if you get a hat

(21:47:30) plachenko: soldier WILL be dead last, though
(21:47:36) SMRobot: and demo with engie probs
(21:48:14) plachenko: (then after the patches... 10th class)
(21:48:17) JamesGecko: they've done freeplay weekends with some previous updates. think it'll happen again with this one?
(21:48:22) plachenko: (saxton hale)
(21:48:23) SMRobot: alyhough updating 2 classes at once should somewhat avoid the everyone playing the same class problem
(21:48:31) plachenko: yes
(21:48:35) IrishFawkes|Rez: hmm
(21:48:36) plachenko: it's going to happen this one too
(21:48:40) IrishFawkes|Rez: anyone good with vista>
(21:48:40) fartron: not having to achieve the weapons should get rid of a lot of it too
(21:48:42) IrishFawkes|Rez: ?
(21:48:53) JamesGecko: yay. ^_^
(21:48:56) SMRobot: yes but everyone will play 2 classes now =D

(22:07:59) PossumGryphon: yes
(22:08:00) JamesGecko: KK_laptop, that might work, but this was an actual modprone-able driver. I think it might have been xpad.

(22:11:26) kinten: dentistry ey?
(22:11:28) JamesGecko: BlademasterBobo, You're absolutely right. Ico and SotC were horrible. Why should I expect some alpha video footage to indicate the next game will be any better?
(22:11:29) Jr: Junior Argumentative Research Paper
(22:11:31) KK_laptop: yup
(22:11:32) Jr: bobo

(22:11:48) BlademasterBobo: So did everyone see the new video of that game by the SotC guys? Looks pretty tight
(22:11:54) kinten: ironic, oral exam on oral pathology
(22:11:54) PossumFawkes: I understand they aren't for everyone
(22:11:59) BlademasterBobo: The cat thing looks sweet, but the kid is oogly
(22:11:59) KK_laptop: kinten: you know your dental shite indeed :)
(22:12:03) PossumFawkes: but I really love the style of game, see
(22:12:09) PossumFawkes: Bobo, it's not a cat >.>

(22:12:54) Jr: the animal
(22:12:54) BlademasterBobo: BUT
