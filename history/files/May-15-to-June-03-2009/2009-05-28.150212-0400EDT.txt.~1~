(15:53:52) fartron: what dimensions are the frames?
(15:53:59) Jr: 70mm
(15:54:10) fartron: that's wide
(15:54:11) fartron: i mean the ratio
(15:54:13) fartron: so i can find the height
(15:54:16) shinygerbil: 2.35
(15:54:18) shinygerbil: :1
(15:54:20) shinygerbil: probably
(15:54:23) shinygerbil: i dunno
(15:54:27) fartron: for imax?
(15:54:39) shinygerbil: i could well be wrong
(15:54:47) Jr: aspect ratio of 2.20:1.
(15:54:51) shinygerbil: :O
(15:54:55) shinygerbil: is that all?
(15:55:01) Jr: I think so
(15:55:04) Jr: so says wikipedia
(15:55:12) shinygerbil: most films these days are 2.35:1
(15:55:25) shinygerbil: i.e. cinemascope

(15:55:44) Jr: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Imaxcomparison.png
(15:55:51) Jr: IMAX is not 2.20:1
(15:56:05) C418: imax is almost like 4:3
(15:56:11) Jr: While traditional 65 mm film has an image area that is 48.5 mm wide and 22.1 mm tall (for Todd-AO), in IMAX the image is 69.6 mm wide and 48.5 mm tall. In order to expose at standard film speed of 24 frames per second, three times as much film needs to move through the camera each second.
(15:56:27) Arf: They installed an IMAX here in argentina
(15:56:32) shinygerbil: i would assume the picture is not projected 1:1 onto the screen
(15:56:32) Arf: although I don't know what city
(15:56:32) fartron: three times as much length or three times as much area
(15:56:33) fartron: that is unclear
(15:56:36) Arf: so I can't go and check myself

(15:57:43) fartron: mainly by picking what film to use

(15:59:48) nihilocrat: "turbaconducken" sounds like some improbable form of jet engine

(16:01:25) Jr: corpus, yeah?
(16:01:27) corpus: is the white thing translucent

(16:03:03) shinygerbil: i kno rite
(16:03:17) Jr: fartron: Despite those advantages, one big disadvantage is the resolution of the picture is much lower than normal IMAX. The screens used by digital IMAX installations are also much smaller (28x58 feet) than those found in traditional IMAX cinemas. The digital installations have drawn some confusion based on poor consumer differentiation to the traditional 15

(16:09:58) Jr: the IMAX proprietary "DMR" (Digital Remastering) process that allowed conventional films to be upconverted into IMAX format.
(16:10:11) Jr: Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which have superior visual and auditory impact to the same films projected in 35 mm. Many large format film industry professionals point out, however, that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70 mm 15 perf IMAX format.
(16:10:26) Jr: of course they aren't the same

(16:49:37) siiseli: Jr, for what?
(16:49:38) nihilocrat: it just sounds like, coming from the TMNT...
(16:49:45) nihilocrat: "Turtles all the way down" is more of a threat
(16:49:50) Jr: siiseli you people are making this op business too big a deal. Jr has ops becouse some ops are not here often
(16:49:55) nihilocrat: than some sort of cosmological myth
(16:50:01) siiseli: I mean I think if you're talking about.. what happened last night, you should do it in private
(16:50:10) Jr: +5 points on the friend chart
(16:50:13) siiseli: I loved it too but it's a private matter between us
(16:50:13) Jr: for you

(16:50:41) Jr: :3
(16:50:55) Turtle: Set up abot
(16:51:01) Turtle: let that see to ops

(16:51:57) siiseli: Turtle, we don't need auto-ops since we have nickserv
(16:52:12) siiseli: and my uptime... I think it's over 80 days
(16:52:16) Turtle: not for auto-ops
(16:52:25) reetva: Also, we wouldn't want Gravious getting ops, now would we?
(16:52:25) Turtle: to control who gets ops full stop
(16:52:40) Turtle: Don't set him to trusted then
(16:52:43) Turtle: simples

(16:53:44) reetva: You could say that about me, minus the "too.."
(16:54:02) siiseli: yeah I'm special here in the same way
(16:54:02) Jr: turtle
(16:54:05) Jr: that's not a great system
(16:54:20) Jr: because ops has a lot to do with who are good ops
(16:54:25) Jr: not just uptime
