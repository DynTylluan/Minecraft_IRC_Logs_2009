(21:10:02) lansing: in which case, it's lame
(21:10:03) Frankie: heh guys
(21:10:06) Kobel: Andy_, how Freudian
(21:10:10) BlademasterBobo: lansing like haskell right
(21:10:13) Frankie: I got PIXEL ART WORTH problems again
(21:10:21) Andy_W: tell us about it
(21:10:24) Frankie: I got a hard time giving out a price tag...
(21:10:30) lansing: BlademasterBobo, pretty sure C compilers do it, Java is getting support for it
(21:10:36) BlademasterBobo: Ah
(21:10:42) BlademasterBobo: O:
(21:10:46) Andy_W: frankie your shit is definitely worth a price
(21:10:51) BlademasterBobo: still slower
(21:10:56) Frankie: yes but which price...
(21:10:57) BlademasterBobo: Frankie: I would buy you for a night
(21:11:00) lansing: but yeah, it's necessary for functional languages because you use recursion a lot, and no there is no slowdown
(21:11:00) Andy_W: get over your self-worth problems
(21:11:02) BlademasterBobo: if I could afford you
(21:11:12) Frankie: someone is asking me how much I would have asked for this sprite's animation:
(21:11:15) Frankie: http://www.frankiesmileshow.leafo.net/Stuff/Recession/Apefish_walk.gif
(21:11:24) Frankie: as an example of my price
(21:11:25) BlademasterBobo: lansing: Really? I would've thought it would have some with how it's done in ASM
(21:11:27) BlademasterBobo: ;l
(21:11:31) Frankie: and heh I have honestly no idea
(21:11:53) Frankie: I thought uh, 150$? Is that ridiculously low? or high?
(21:11:56) lansing: BlademasterBobo, nope.. smart compilers turn recursion into tight loops 
(21:11:59) Andy_W: you're probably just inexperienced at pricetagging your own stuff. you'll get used to it eventually yeah
(21:12:08) BlademasterBobo: lansing: So it's really a loop anyways.
(21:12:12) Frankie: yeah thats my current proglem
(21:12:14) Frankie: blem
(21:12:19) Siiseli: Frankie, no idea how much pixelart costs
(21:12:21) Andy_W: how long did it take you to make it
(21:12:28) Frankie: I dont really remember
(21:12:37) Frankie: I think it had taken like 6 hours...
(21:12:41) Frankie: or something around that...
(21:12:41) Andy_W: its always good to go by hours when you don't have any idea what to price
(21:12:42) lansing: BlademasterBobo, except some things can be expressed more clearly with recursion, but yeah, in effect you are looping
(21:12:49) Kobel: $150 seems about right? Maybe a tad low
(21:12:51) BlademasterBobo: okey doke
(21:12:56) BlademasterBobo: $150 seems low
(21:13:09) BlademasterBobo: that's only $25 an hour
(21:13:14) Frankie: you think? so more like 200$
(21:13:15) BlademasterBobo: which is low for freelancing, isn't it?
(21:13:15) Cow: man that animation goes perfectly with this music
(21:13:32) Kobel: It's a really nice looking sprite
(21:14:06) Andy_W: its your call really
(21:14:11) Kobel: I honestly couldn't say for sure but $200 isn't too bad for a day's work
(21:14:16) Jrsquee: pricing art sucks
(21:14:21) Frankie: yeah...
(21:14:24) Frankie: I hate that part
(21:14:25) RinkuHero: for indie games the typical prices i see are
(21:14:31) RinkuHero: between 2000-10000 for all the art in a game
(21:14:32) Frankie: Not because im like
(21:14:37) Frankie: ART HAS NO PRIIICE
(21:14:42) Jrsquee: it's just hard!
(21:14:43) Frankie: but really because im so clueless
(21:14:46) Jrsquee: yeah
(21:14:52) Kobel: Jesus that's cheap :O
(21:14:52) BlademasterBobo: Hi Mr. Squee
(21:14:55) Jrsquee: I had an art show recently
(21:15:01) RinkuHero: depends on the artist though
(21:15:03) Kobel: Though I guess it depends on the size of the game
(21:15:05) RinkuHero: braid spent around 90k on its art
(21:15:11) RinkuHero: i mean jon blow spent 90k on the art of braid
(21:15:11) Jrsquee: and I had to price everything
(21:15:13) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(21:15:13) Jrsquee: it sucked
(21:15:15) Kobel: But wasn't most of that false starts?
(21:15:19) RinkuHero: but that had a lot of art
(21:15:23) Jrsquee: that was the hardest part of the whole show
(21:15:24) RinkuHero: tons of background images etc.
(21:15:31) Kobel: I thought he lost tons of money trying out artists
(21:15:38) Kobel: Before he found David Hellman
(21:15:43) RinkuHero: that's possible
(21:15:48) Cow: how did it go Jrsquee?
(21:15:50) RinkuHero: i remember edmund was one of the first ones
(21:15:52) Cow: woah
(21:15:54) RinkuHero: he did the sprite for the main character
(21:15:56) Cow: I was scrolled up
(21:15:59) Kobel: Yeah I saw that
(21:16:20) Jrsquee: Cow, pretty dank
(21:16:24) Kobel: And David Hellman probably wasn't even working on it for a whole year, he probably only got 30-40k
(21:16:26) Jrsquee: I didn't sell much
(21:16:35) Kobel: I'm betting the rest went to those false starts
(21:16:36) Jrsquee: but we had an AWESOME reception
(21:16:39) Androu1 left the room (quit: Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by FuckPingOut))).
(21:16:39) Jrsquee: like, really classy

(21:18:02) Siiseli: allrightie

(21:18:10) Jrsquee: Siiseli: GO TO BED
(21:18:16) Jrsquee: Cow, probably
(21:18:18) Siiseli: Jrsquee, I most certainly will
(21:18:26) Siiseli: I don't particularily feel tired
(21:18:28) Jrsquee: I think I will too
(21:18:29) BlademasterBobo: jrsquee I'm starting work now
(21:18:33) Siiseli: but I must still go to bed
(21:18:33) BlademasterBobo: if you'd like to join me
(21:18:35) Jrsquee: I am particularly tired
(21:18:40) Jrsquee: oh, actually
(21:18:42) Siiseli: BlademasterBobo, wanna join me in bed?
(21:18:43) Jrsquee: I would like to bobo
(21:18:49) Kobel: What I should do is write a to-do list for my graphics framework and then just leave it alone for now while I port some Flash stuff to use it, then I can address that stuff later
(21:18:49) Jrsquee: I will work for a bit
(21:18:50) Cow: what are you doing?
(21:18:56) Siiseli: having gay sex

(21:20:12) Siiseli: oh well, a fabulous night to all

(22:25:08) BMcC: After I get everything in place I'll make a test scene
(22:25:10) Snakey: Ahh yeah, and it didn't fit to well?
(22:25:36) BMcC: It's not terrible, just that I removed some garbage and renamed some things in the new engine
(22:25:46) Snakey: Mmmhmm, cool :)
(22:25:56) BMcC: Also haven't decided on some bits yet... but a bit of the old brute force trial and error should get this working... tonight?
(22:26:06) Snakey: Awesome stuff!
(22:26:22) Snakey: I tidied up all of the rendering experimental line here too,
(22:26:38) Snakey: and now have a nice new render engine which can render using shaders

(22:29:51) BMcC: Snakey's editor is great!  Also, map-making will get easier once there are a load of global objects to play with
(22:29:54) BMcC: Brb!
(22:30:17) Snakey: Thanks BMcC
(22:30:20) Zaratustra: what's the latest version of minecraft
(22:30:32) Snakey: I'm going to wait for a while till you finalize more of the map format details
(22:31:06) Cludney [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(22:31:07) Drakkar left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(22:31:29) lansing: ahh! I have no self control.
(22:31:37) Cludney: agh
(22:31:38) Cludney: anyway
(22:31:44) Cludney is now known as Drakkar
(22:32:01) Drakkar: 19:29:44 of 18/05/2009) <Drakkar> my pixel art is very much something I would like to work on
(22:32:02) Drakkar: (19:29:45 of 18/05/2009) <Drakkar> like alot
(22:32:02) Drakkar: (19:30:04 of 18/05/2009) <Drakkar> and I don't like the concept of publicizing stuff I feel is complete trash
(22:32:02) Drakkar: (19:30:06 of 18/05/2009) <Drakkar> (which it usually is)

(22:33:04) Drakkar: wassup
(22:33:27) BlademasterBobo: hi kintent
(22:33:56) kinten: hey bobo
(22:34:07) kinten: looking at you, Drakkar
(22:34:17) Drakkar: shit
(22:34:23) Drakkar: should I pose or something
(22:34:30) kinten: give it your best
(22:34:40) Drakkar: k hows that
(22:34:55) Zaratustra: I don't see water in minecraft :S
(22:34:59) kinten: the magnum
(22:35:04) Drakkar: its not in yet
(22:35:13) Drakkar: he keeps his own build seperate from the public one
(22:35:17) Drakkar: probably to avoid horrific disasters
(22:35:40) Evil-Ville: Zaratustra http://notch.tumblr.com/
(22:37:42) BMcC left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(22:38:10) lansing: hm, yes, mines are dangerous, you dig and you dig and then you hit water... it floods and you're trapped.
(22:39:00) lansing: seeing mine subsidence from the surface would be cool too

(22:41:31) Zaratustra: that water seems rather lagged
(22:42:50) plachenko: http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=2518
(22:42:53) plachenko: man they just keep coming
(22:42:54) BlademasterBobo: hopefully he fixes
(22:42:59) BlademasterBobo: it
(22:43:05) plachenko: and yeah that water isn't much like the lava in infiniminer
(22:43:08) plachenko: it's close though
(22:43:47) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(22:45:02) BlademasterBobo: there's more of it
(22:45:11) BlademasterBobo: maybe he should do it the opposite way
(22:45:19) BlademasterBobo: have squares the player digs out check for adjacent water
(22:45:57) BMcC: Less errors, almost under 100...
(22:46:01) BlademasterBobo: O:
(22:46:02) Evil-Ville: I think the lava in infiniminer is pretty shit in comparison
(22:46:15) BlademasterBobo: lava in infiniminer actually moves
(22:46:25) Evil-Ville: No, it replicates
(22:46:31) Snakey: What?
(22:46:33) Snakey: I don'
(22:46:40) Snakey: get this official TF blog
(22:46:56) plachenko: yeah
(22:47:02) plachenko: robin has been foolin' around
(22:47:06) plachenko: tim schaffer style
(22:47:09) plachenko: all day
(22:47:14) plachenko: four blog posts in a day
(22:47:24) plachenko: based on the fact that meet the spy was leaked
(22:47:45) Snakey: Oh I got it
(22:48:38) Drakkar: he's actually working on the water
(22:48:45) Drakkar: still

(22:49:29) Andy_W: >_<
(22:49:31) Andy_W left the room.
(22:49:32) BlademasterBobo: Evil-Ville: The water in this does the exact same thing
(22:49:35) BlademasterBobo: only more of it at a time
(22:49:37) BlademasterBobo: :U
(22:50:25) shinygerbil: fufuu~~
(22:50:30) ***shinygerbil to bed
(22:51:02) Evil-Ville: I am pretty sure that if you make a pit that is let's say five blocks deep and then get lava in that pit it's not going to fill it
(22:51:24) Evil-Ville: Just the bottom layer
(22:51:45) Drakkar: yeah
(22:51:47) Drakkar: it won't
(22:51:55) Drakkar: and not really fill
(22:52:00) Drakkar: it just creates a layer of lava
(22:52:05) Evil-Ville: This water does that though
(22:52:12) Drakkar: there's no way to really get rid of lava in infiniminer
(22:52:15) BlademasterBobo: shinygerbil
(22:52:19) Evil-Ville: You can with dynamite
(22:52:25) Drakkar: it doesn't help that much
(22:52:29) Evil-Ville: Yes
(22:52:46) Drakkar: unfortunately
(22:52:49) Drakkar: on the other hand
(22:52:53) Drakkar: making a castle out of TNT is fun
(22:52:53) Drakkar: :D
(22:53:00) BlademasterBobo: albeit dangerous
(22:53:02) Drakkar: and then building blocks around it
(22:53:06) Drakkar: and inviting your friends in
(22:53:07) Drakkar: for some tea
(22:53:09) BlademasterBobo: lol
(22:53:13) Drakkar: running out the door and setting it off
(22:53:13) Drakkar: :D
(22:53:23) Drakkar: "brb cakes"
(22:53:26) Drakkar: *boom*
(22:53:36) Drakkar: that shit amuses me so much
(22:53:43) Drakkar: or at one point a friend of mine goes afk
(22:53:54) Drakkar: so I build a cell made out of jump blocks and shock blocks
(22:54:14) Drakkar: blocked it off with forcefields and chuckled
(22:55:20) BMcC:  warning C4800: 'int' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)
(22:55:35) BlademasterBobo: do this
(22:55:41) BlademasterBobo: (x != 0)
(22:55:42) BMcC: ^Why is that being thrown?  It isn't in BQ, and it's from a Lua return, which should be a bool?
(22:55:47) BlademasterBobo: oh
(22:55:57) BMcC: Different warning settings for the project, perhaps?
(22:55:59) Evil-Ville: I just watched the water video again and it's so much better than the lava in infiniminer. I don't get how anyone could think otherwise
(22:56:01) BlademasterBobo: pastebin?
(22:56:05) BlademasterBobo: no idea
(22:56:20) BlademasterBobo: your face thinks otherwise
(22:56:20) BMcC: bool clear = true;
(22:56:21) BMcC: if(args >= 2) clear = lua_toboolean(L, 2);
(22:56:30) BMcC: I get that warning there
(22:56:34) BMcC: Don't make no sense
(22:56:38) BlademasterBobo: one sec
(22:56:41) BMcC: Maybe I'm not including the header or something :P
(22:56:53) BlademasterBobo: isn't lua_toboolean type int?
(22:56:54) PFawkes [chatzilla@24-155-231-191.dyn.grandenetworks.net] entered the room.
(22:56:55) Drakkar: there will be water pressure as well Evil-Ville
(22:57:01) BlademasterBobo: just do this
(22:57:09) BlademasterBobo: (lua_toboolean(L, 2) != 0);
(22:57:17) PFawkes: Hello.
(22:57:18) Drakkar: at least he wants to put it in
(22:57:19) BlademasterBobo: if that works then there's your problem
(22:57:19) Zaratustra: http://i42.tinypic.com/53mnox.jpg check the second row from the bottom, second column from the left
(22:57:39) Z80_ [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(22:57:39) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(22:57:42) Evil-Ville: cool Drakkar
(22:57:45) Drakkar: the reason its so much is related to him just putting it together with his current block code
(22:58:05) PFawkes: Has anyone the link to the mining thing?
(22:58:10) PFawkes: minecraft sort of thing
(22:58:20) BMcC: Maybe it is, but why wouldn't I get that warning in BQ?
(22:58:24) Drakkar: he's working on optimizing it so it'll be more block by block
(22:58:25) Drakkar: uh
(22:58:28) Drakkar: www.minecraft.net
(22:58:34) PFawkes: I wonder if it works
(22:58:55) PFawkes: it might
(22:59:01) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: no ide
(22:59:01) BlademasterBobo: a
(22:59:10) PFawkes: oh hey...
(22:59:12) BlademasterBobo: maybe you did
(22:59:13) PFawkes: I just read Neuromancer
(22:59:15) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(22:59:22) BlademasterBobo: or maybe different warning level?
(22:59:49) MisterX left the room (quit: Quit: Miranda IM! Smaller, Faster, Easier. http://miranda-im.org).
(22:59:53) BlademasterBobo: but I don't think it's anything else or it wouldn't be a warning
(23:00:26) PFawkes: hm... this is amazingly laggy, Drakkar
(23:00:30) PFawkes: I get 4 fps :(
(23:00:46) Drakkar: intel onboard?
(23:00:51) PFawkes: :D yes
(23:00:54) Drakkar: yep
(23:00:57) PFawkes: on LINUX
(23:00:57) Drakkar: he's working on that bug iirc
(23:00:59) PFawkes: woo
(23:01:12) PFawkes: so at least you know it runs in linux I guess
(23:01:20) PFawkes: which of course why wouldn't it >.>
(23:02:24) BMcC: Yeah, probably different warning level
(23:02:28) BMcC: I think I'm on the max right now?
(23:02:33) BlademasterBobo: then
(23:02:35) BlademasterBobo: that's why.
(23:02:36) BlademasterBobo: :P
(23:02:45) BlademasterBobo: just do the != 0 thing
(23:02:47) BlademasterBobo: it'll disappear
(23:02:49) BlademasterBobo: like magic
(23:03:02) BMcC: Cool, thank you sir
(23:03:49) BlademasterBobo: np
(23:04:47) PFawkes: so why is Minecraft wonky on intel?
(23:04:47) gandhi__ left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(23:04:56) PFawkes: it seems like it'd work ok being all lowpoly etc etc
(23:05:06) Z80_: INTTTTTEEEL SUUUUUUUUUCKS.
(23:05:08) PFawkes: hah
(23:05:13) Z80_: I'm sorry, what was the question?
(23:05:15) Drakkar: not sure
(23:05:16) PFawkes: not as much as the last gfx card
(23:05:22) PFawkes: geforce 4 MX!
(23:05:24) PFawkes: woo
(23:05:38) Drakkar: it also has massive issues running on windows eee pcs
(23:05:39) PFawkes: which was like... they took a Geforce 2, stripped it of functionality, then lied about it
(23:05:45) PFawkes: that was fun
(23:05:49) Z80_: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4t6zNZ-b0A
(23:05:55) PFawkes: they also lied about its directx support
(23:06:16) PFawkes: it was only directx 7 I think, but it had a few 9 functions so they could claim it as directx 9
(23:06:18) PFawkes: >:(
(23:06:23) BMcC: Yeah!  52 errors, 92 warnings
(23:06:26) BMcC: PROGRESS :)
(23:06:32) Z80_: By the way, I have a collection of Vonnegut short stories now.
(23:06:37) Z80_: Huzzah.
(23:06:45) Campster: I am finding it hard to avoid spaghetti code in Unity. :(
(23:06:59) BlademasterBobo: haha

(23:09:57) Zaratustra: a demake of braid
(23:09:59) Zaratustra: called Beard
(23:10:19) BlademasterBobo: where you can go forwards in time?
(23:10:28) fartron: that would be great
(23:10:31) fartron: i wouldn't have to play it
(23:10:36) fartron: just fastforward to the end
(23:10:41) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(23:11:15) MrBusiness [ButanPress@67-41-78-203.clsp.qwest.net] entered the room.

(23:16:03) Cow: I was hovering over it
(23:16:03) Drakkar: yes
(23:16:08) Cow: and then I decided against it
(23:16:09) BlademasterBobo: Who among us is brave enough
(23:16:15) BlademasterBobo: Is man enough
(23:16:17) Thi3f: It's just another one of those fake "link this everywhere and you'll get amateur porn!"
(23:16:21) BlademasterBobo: ah
(23:16:23) Thi3f: Yes, I click all links
(23:16:27) Cow: are you a bad enough dude to click that link
(23:16:32) Thi3f: So don't be posting gross
(23:17:26) shinygerbil: it's meh
(23:17:49) fartron: you should probably ban that ip bobo
(23:17:56) Drakkar: it changes
(23:18:05) Drakkar: never the same guy
(23:19:50) PFawkes [chatzilla@24-155-231-191.dyn.grandenetworks.net] entered the room.
(23:20:15) PFawkes: Aha
(23:20:19) PFawkes: fixed my sounds :)
(23:20:32) PFawkes: how are things
(23:21:08) Drakkar: time for concept art is how things are
(23:21:46) PFawkes: ok.
(23:21:48) PFawkes: cool.
(23:22:02) PFawkes: I am reading things, but that is also a good thing.
(23:22:13) Drakkar: I've sort of semi-decided a 3d landstalker style aesthetic
(23:22:36) PFawkes: :D
(23:22:40) PFawkes: landstalker was awesome.
(23:22:47) Drakkar: indeed
(23:22:51) Drakkar: though a little tedious
(23:22:54) PFawkes: yes.
(23:22:57) PFawkes: true
(23:23:00) PFawkes: I miss good games.
(23:23:09) El_Shamro left the room (quit: Quit: Off to play video games or something.).
(23:23:38) PFawkes: remember good games?
(23:24:07) PFawkes: like... er... Secret of Evermore! Now there's a game you won't remember.
(23:24:18) Drakkar: secret of evermore is great
(23:24:19) Drakkar: :P
(23:24:32) PFawkes: yes.
(23:24:34) PFawkes: yes it is.
(23:24:43) PFawkes: did you ever see the multiplayer mod of it?
(23:25:05) PFawkes: they found some defunct multi-play capabilities and fixed them up so you can play it proper
(23:28:07) BMcC: 50 e, 67 w
(23:29:34) BlademasterBobo: fartron I Missed the IP

(23:38:50) BMcC: I have :P
(23:38:55) BlademasterBobo: didn't like it
(23:39:10) PFawkes: I know
(23:39:13) PFawkes: it's badly designed
(23:39:18) BMcC: Hahaha
(23:39:19) BlademasterBobo: first part is ok
(23:39:22) BlademasterBobo: second part is bad
(23:39:33) BlademasterBobo: too hard to figure out what you're doing, and then when you do it.. you don't know what you did
(23:39:49) Z80_: FATHOM was okay.
(23:40:07) Z80_: The water part was bad.
(23:40:08) PFawkes: well, I figured it out yeah
(23:40:14) PFawkes: but I hate when people do things like that
(23:40:15) BlademasterBobo: Thing I don't get is it's not like Adam didn't know about these things
(23:40:21) BlademasterBobo: I guess that's the point of it?
(23:40:27) PFawkes: that you have this light that you can't see with
(23:40:34) PFawkes: because it points the wrong way
(23:40:42) BlademasterBobo: BMcC liked it
(23:40:59) BlademasterBobo: What did you like about it BMcC
(23:41:03) BlademasterBobo: give us some contrast here
(23:41:04) Movius [simba@ppp59-167-51-163.lns1.cbr1.internode.on.net] entered the room.
(23:41:05) BMcC: Hehe, Adam -definitely- knew what he was doing
(23:41:14) PFawkes: did he now
(23:41:19) Z80_: PFawkes, you can at least fall while pointing the light in the correct direction.
(23:41:19) BlademasterBobo: yeah
(23:41:24) Z80_: *sing
(23:41:27) Z80_: *sink
(23:41:41) PFawkes: well yes
(23:41:44) BlademasterBobo: I just don't get why he chose to leave the part so confusing... a little direction would've helped
(23:41:51) Z80_: "Ooooooooooooooooh, my liiiiights pointin' the riiiiight way.
(23:41:53) PFawkes: bobo
(23:41:53) Z80_: "

(23:42:20) PFawkes: I still disliked it though
(23:42:20) Movius: hooray
(23:42:22) BlademasterBobo: that wasn't in when I played it
(23:42:25) Movius: or is at least confirmed as real
(23:42:27) PFawkes: hm
(23:42:36) Z80_: Project 'S'?
(23:42:37) PFawkes: the title screen changes, I guess that's a nice touch
(23:42:39) PFawkes: but >.>
(23:42:45) Movius: http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro/next/
(23:42:47) BlademasterBobo: I like the start, and the idea
(23:42:51) BlademasterBobo: but execution is lacking imo
(23:42:55) Movius: Kojima + Suda 51
(23:42:55) Z80_: Ah, Kojima.
(23:42:59) Z80_: WHAT.
(23:43:04) BlademasterBobo: and the transition is neat
(23:43:11) BlademasterBobo: the underwater part is just not very good
(23:43:26) PFawkes: ydx.
(23:43:28) PFawkes: yes.
(23:43:32) Z80_: Bobo, want to play Tee Fuck 2?
(23:43:36) PFawkes: it's just boring and dark
(23:43:41) Z80_: (TF2)
(23:43:41) BlademasterBobo: I don't know z80
(23:43:43) BMcC: No, but... anyway, I'm coding :P
(23:43:44) PFawkes: why couldn't the light point the right direction?
(23:43:52) BMcC: Kojima + Suda 51 == !!!
(23:43:52) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: Well
(23:43:56) PFawkes: hooray?
(23:44:06) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: What's your opinion
(23:44:08) BlademasterBobo: :l
(23:44:09) PFawkes: so Kojima can taint Suda 51's games with his pointless blathering
(23:44:11) PFawkes: yes?
(23:44:12) plachenko: more like you guys should play bumpound (gunbound)
(23:44:14) Z80_: Suda 51 is awesome, Koji--
(23:44:18) Z80_: Yeah, PFawkes.
(23:44:19) PFawkes: Let me tell you what it means to be a soldier!
(23:44:31) Movius: it's a sequel to Snatcher
(23:44:33) Z80_: First, you must have your laser sword.
(23:44:34) PFawkes: ooh
(23:44:45) Z80_: Also seven personalities.
(23:44:49) Movius: well related to it anyway
(23:44:51) Z80_: THEN YOU'RE SET.
(23:45:01) PFawkes: Let me tell you what it means to be a split personality assassin
(23:45:03) PFawkes: in a wheelchair
(23:45:05) Z80_: Exactly.
(23:45:11) PFawkes: in 5 hours of exposition
(23:45:12) PFawkes: etc etc
(23:45:24) Z80_: More like two.
(23:45:28) BlademasterBobo: Z80_ I could only play for ~15 mins
(23:45:29) BlademasterBobo: :U
(23:45:33) Z80_: That is a great difference.
(23:45:38) Z80_: Bobo.
(23:45:44) Z80_: I never even played Killer 7.
(23:45:46) Z80_: Or MGS4.
(23:45:52) PFawkes: plachenko, how can you say that thinking a game has poor design
(23:45:52) BlademasterBobo: me neither...?
(23:45:57) Z80_: Oh.
(23:45:58) PFawkes: means that we are all philistines
(23:45:58) Z80_: Hahahahahaha.
(23:46:03) Z80_: TF2.
(23:46:08) PFawkes: I mean, sure, everyone else here maybe :D
(23:46:11) BlademasterBobo: if you want to play for 15 mins
(23:46:12) BlademasterBobo: sure
(23:46:27) Z80_: Not really, I think you'd be better off not playing.
(23:46:32) Z80_: Or, at least, I would be.
(23:46:33) Z80_: ;D
(23:46:36) BlademasterBobo: oooouch
(23:46:46) PFawkes: I want to play Killer 7
(23:46:56) PFawkes: it's been in the discount tray at Best Buy for two years
(23:47:00) PFawkes: and I still haven't bought it
(23:47:02) PFawkes: :(
(23:47:03) Z80_: Buy it.
(23:47:04) Z80_: :(
(23:47:04) PFawkes: noone else has either though
(23:47:14) Z80_: Noon-e.
(23:47:16) PFawkes: I just... I don't know
(23:47:20) Z80_: eNoon
(23:47:20) PFawkes: I don't buy games new >.>
(23:47:24) PFawkes: because I am the poor
(23:47:25) Z80_: Digital Noon.
(23:47:36) ***PFawkes buys games at pawn shops and thrift stores
(23:47:45) PFawkes: woo! Bionic Commando GB
(23:48:00) Z80_: PFawkes, is kickin' it oooooold school.
(23:48:03) Z80_: And that's all right.
(23:48:06) PFawkes: :D
(23:48:19) PFawkes: I am happy I finally have my NWN Linux workin' fine
(23:48:23) Z80_: :D
(23:48:28) Z80_: We should play someday.
(23:48:31) PFawkes: hah
(23:48:35) BlademasterBobo: z80
(23:48:37) PFawkes: I have no expanding paks

(23:48:39) BlademasterBobo: I'm going to play without you
(23:48:40) BlademasterBobo: so there.
(23:48:42) Z80_: I have never tried MP.
(23:48:59) PFawkes: I'm happy, though, I even have the pointless little cloth map
(23:49:03) Z80_: BlademasterBobo, you rotten, dirty, good for nothing...
(23:49:04) PFawkes: that came with the original game
(23:49:18) PFawkes: some guy resold the whole thing, it's amazing
(23:49:20) Z80_: GTA IV also came with a pointless map.
(23:49:40) PFawkes: well, but this one is better than that one
(23:49:44) PFawkes: because it's fantasy
(23:49:49) PFawkes: fantasy = pointless maps
(23:50:19) plachenko: <PFawkes> plachenko, how can you say that thinking a game has poor design
(23:50:21) plachenko: wut I say?

(23:59:43) PFawkes: why so, lansing?
(23:59:54) lansing: PFawkes, isn't it typical that people do a linux version and then neglect it?
(00:00:04) PFawkes: well, no, they actually kept up the patches

(00:26:40) Dragonene: That's quite a lot!
(00:26:49) Drakkar: hmm

(00:29:37) Dragonene: lansing: I wonder if a fathom is the same as swedish "famn"
(00:29:40) Dragonene: I believe it is
(00:30:03) Dragonene: famn translates into "embrace" and basically is the length from fingertip to fingertip with your arms spread wide
(00:30:33) Dragonene: Like fathom it's commonly associated with marine stuff
(00:30:52) PFawkes: I cannot fathom the fathoms

(00:31:39) Dragonene: lansing: the title doesn't have fathoms in it though?
(00:31:41) Dragonene: Just leagues.
(00:31:53) lansing: Dragonene, oh yeah, but I think of fathoms when I hear leagues
(00:31:58) ramdance: I am already sitting

(00:33:11) lansing: ramdance, I have a book on the pleasures of probability or beyond good and evil by nietzsche
(00:33:14) Dragonene: I was just about to talk about books
(00:33:36) ramdance: I was just about to talk about horse cock

(00:34:22) ramdance: that I took upsideown
(00:34:43) BMcC: Isn't "leagues" a misnomer?  Like, I think it's meant to be used as a distance, not depth

(00:38:24) Dragonene: a league is like...
(00:38:28) Dragonene: I don't know, several miles?
(00:38:32) lansing: that would place them in space wouldn't it?
(00:38:33) paul|not: yes
(00:38:36) PFawkes: quiet
(00:38:38) paul|not: the eart is REALLY BIG lol I dunno
(00:38:40) Dragonene: 1 league = 3.45233834 miles
(00:38:41) PFawkes: they ARE that distance
(00:38:47) PFawkes: because of magic
(00:39:01) lansing: 20k leagues is 111120km
(00:39:02) Dragonene: No, 20000 leagues is how far they travel
(00:39:02) PFawkes: or plagianrism
(00:39:04) PFawkes: maybe
(00:39:08) Dragonene: and they do it under the sea
(00:39:10) Dragonene: hence the title.
(00:39:12) Adam: hiya tigers!
(00:39:16) PFawkes: "20,000 leagues UNDER the sea"
(00:39:27) PFawkes: I think that Verne just didn't know what a League was
(00:39:29) Dragonene: "20,000 leauges. Under the sea."
(00:39:34) Dragonene: You think wrong
(00:39:36) PFawkes: oh, hey, it's a distance! Like feet
(00:39:37) Dragonene: Verne is god
(00:39:42) PFawkes: or toothpick lengths
(00:39:42) Dragonene: wtf
(00:39:48) Dragonene: even 20000 feet below sea level makes no sense
(00:39:52) PFawkes: :D
(00:39:55) PFawkes: yes it does
(00:40:00) Dragonene: No it doesn't
(00:40:00) PFawkes: that's 4 miles
(00:40:06) Dragonene: that'd be like the deepest point in the ocean
(00:40:08) lansing: the circumfrence of the earth at the equator is 40,000km or so, you're not going to get very far attempting to travel 111,1120km under water
(00:40:08) PFawkes: you could be in the marianas trench

(00:40:51) Adam: haha no
(00:40:57) BMcC: Ah, Dragonene, that makes more sense
(00:40:59) Adam: well its entertaining at least
(00:41:06) lansing: Dragonene, yeah, I meant down :)
(00:41:07) Dragonene: BMcC: It does indeed!
(00:41:10) Dragonene: lansing: Ah, yes
(00:41:20) PFawkes: hm
(00:41:25) Dragonene: Well, they probably don't really travel 20000 leagues at all
(00:41:28) Dragonene: in any direction
(00:41:29) PFawkes: Verne has a lot of issues I think
(00:41:31) PFawkes: I mean
(00:41:37) Dragonene: it's just a nice arbitrary number for a book title
(00:41:44) lansing: we have found its flaw
(00:41:49) Dragonene: perhaps it should've been called 3000 leagues under the sea or something
(00:41:50) Adam: "Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is the deepest point in Earth's oceans. The bottom there is 10,924 meters (35,840 feet) below sea level."
(00:41:54) Dragonene: Yes
(00:41:56) Dragonene: It has flaws.

(00:44:14) Adam: epi-whatsits?
(00:44:17) Dragonene: Who the fudge cares? :D
(00:44:24) Dragonene: He isn't really politically correct either
(00:44:28) Dragonene: by today's standards
(00:44:33) ramdance: is silver a gay hedgehog or a gay echidna?
(00:44:34) Dragonene: He's still a good writer though.

(00:45:23) PFawkes: :D
(00:45:27) ramdance: nah man
(00:45:33) Dragonene: keep in mind that ramdance was the one inviting everyone on the channel to some random other channel
(00:45:39) ramdance: I need to know about gay animals
(00:45:40) Dragonene: because he thought it'd be entertaining
(00:45:45) PFawkes: because the newer Sonic is like... my childhood being shot repeatedly with a shotgun?
(00:45:54) ramdance: and you guys seem to be experts on gay things
(00:45:54) PFawkes: maybe
(00:45:59) PFawkes: oh, I see
(00:46:00) lansing: we should join all of ramdance's channels
(00:46:04) PFawkes: of course

(00:48:36) Dragonene: there was this presentation in class on wiki technologies
(00:48:38) Dragonene: hey Ina
(00:48:40) PFawkes: you know, that was odd
(00:48:41) The_Doctor: Hallo tigs
(00:48:53) PFawkes: I mean, normally people call people pretentious or spout memes
(00:48:56) Dragonene: and uh, they showed some wikis
(00:49:01) PFawkes: :D
(00:49:04) basro_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(00:49:09) PFawkes: did they show yours? :D
(00:49:11) Dragonene: and suddenly they showed a wiki called "wiki furry"
(00:49:14) PFawkes: what
(00:49:16) Dragonene: yes
(00:49:19) lansing: hm, he left
(00:49:19) PFawkes: what
(00:49:20) Androu1: That's so wrong D:
(00:49:21) Dragonene: they were fully serious
(00:49:25) PFawkes: well
(00:49:26) PFawkes: ok
(00:49:29) Dragonene: and they kept it up for like 5 minutes
(00:49:30) Dragonene: or more
(00:49:34) Dragonene: on the projector
(00:49:36) PFawkes: why care?
(00:49:37) Dragonene: it was rather hilarious
(00:49:42) Dragonene: Well you see
(00:49:52) Dragonene: I *think* they thought it meant, you know, pets
(00:49:59) PFawkes: did it
(00:50:01) PFawkes: ?
(00:50:04) Dragonene: No, I don't think so.
(00:50:07) Dragonene: Didn't look that way.
(00:50:13) Dragonene: I think it was a furry week in truth.
(00:50:23) PFawkes: because I can see some ignorant people actually making a furry wiki on their cats or whatnot
(00:50:30) Dragonene: Yep
(00:50:31) PFawkes: and thinking that was what it mean
(00:50:34) Dragonene: well, I don't think that was it
(00:50:40) PFawkes: ok...
(00:50:45) Dragonene: and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with furry wikis
(00:50:48) PFawkes: why did this come up?
(00:50:50) Dragonene: that's up to everyone to decide
(00:51:01) Dragonene: I just thought it was funny that it was the major example of their internet technologies example
(00:51:03) Dragonene: uh
(00:51:06) PFawkes: Megaman versus the Lion Men!
(00:51:12) Dragonene: internet engineering project*
(00:51:24) Dragonene: it came up because you said #furry a while back.
(00:51:36) PFawkes: no... someone els4e did
(00:51:42) PFawkes: pandy maybe
(00:51:48) PFawkes: but ok
(00:51:55) Dragonene: Oh okay
(00:52:02) Adam: seems like a remarkably high percentage of time in tigirc is spent on the topic of furries
(00:52:02) Dragonene: ah
(00:52:04) Dragonene: it was Pepe apparently
(00:52:13) Adam: historically i mean
(00:52:13) Dragonene: Adam: Yes, it is quite remarkable.
(00:52:39) Adam: tis why I remarked upon it!

(00:53:10) Pepe: who set off my highlight
(00:53:22) Pepe: rage rage rage
(00:53:37) PFawkes: perhaps it is the same reason gay people don't like a similar term?
(00:53:48) PFawkes: or similar
(00:53:49) Androu1: I mean. It comes from that evil 4chan, and that site is full of insulting terms for everything. Only furries care >:U

(00:54:42) PFawkes: as a clean, honest youth
(00:54:50) Adam: maybe "wonder"
(00:54:52) PFawkes: who wants only to use his dictionary

(01:22:22) BlademasterBobo: :'(
(01:22:22) EnergyTurtle: IV is Roman Numerals
(01:22:24) Dragonene: so I can find out if they do a #5
(01:22:35) Cow: it'll be a long while

(01:24:12) BlademasterBobo: Hello Farbs
(01:24:18) EnergyTurtle: 3 has like, better tiles, and worse tiles
(01:24:18) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Hellobobo!
(01:24:25) EnergyTurtle: it's more varied quality wise
(01:24:36) Dragonene: Cow: I'm in the progress of trying to learn some pixelling. I just got started a short time ago
(01:24:42) Dragonene: doing some practice now and then.
(01:24:46) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Hey does Farmergnome still drop by here often?
(01:24:49) Cow: oh yeah
(01:24:51) Cow: it's fun
(01:25:02) Cow: it's a good hobby
(01:25:07) EnergyTurtle: someone answer the poor man!
(01:25:08) Cow: it was my gateway drug
(01:25:12) Cow: into other artz
(01:25:12) Snakey: Hey Farbs, been developing much of your shooter?
(01:25:18) Evil-Ville: iso collab II is pretty bad
(01:25:20) iFire: need a FTP Client which can view all the
(01:25:21) iFire: directories and files on a specific server
(01:25:21) iFire: WITHOUT logging in with the FTP details.
(01:25:21) iFire: It must be able to show me the server IP
(01:25:21) iFire: and all other details given below. It
(01:25:22) iFire: must be able to get all the MySQL
(01:25:23) iFire: Databases connected to the pages. It must
(01:25:25) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Not since last night :)
(01:25:25) iFire: collect the...
(01:25:26) Evil-Ville: I wonder what the first one is like
(01:25:27) iFire: crap
(01:25:29) ***iFire dies
(01:25:35) Dragonene: Cow: I love doing art, I'm just really bad at it :P
(01:25:39) Snakey: Ahh right. I was trying to come up with something like that myself
(01:25:44) Dragonene: But I'd like to practice some more.
(01:25:44) iFire: that's from rentacoder
(01:25:44) Snakey: Haven't come up with much yet.
(01:25:45) iFire: and not me
(01:25:48) lansing: iFire, requests on rac are so stupid they are not even worth reading
(01:25:55) Cow: that's a good starting point
(01:26:09) Dragonene: in fact, I just set up a blog category to post my pixel stuffs yesterday
(01:26:18) Snakey: iFire: Half the requests are just wannabe hackers
(01:26:19) Dragonene: there's a bunch of ludumdare people who do "daily sketches" to practice art
(01:26:23) Dragonene: so I intend to join them.
(01:26:25) lansing: iFire, rac is a circlejerk involving morons who don't know what they want and people in india telling them they can deliver it
(01:26:34) Dragonene: in fact, I'm about to do some pixelation right now! :)
(01:26:52) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Farmergnome was on TV! See episode 8, "Gaming in the recession" segment, 5:13.
(01:27:02) Cow: cool
(01:27:04) Snakey: Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Are the enemies randomly generated in your game?
(01:27:13) Cow: daily sketches are a good idea
(01:27:18) Cow: followed by daily masturbation
(01:27:18) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Yep. It was easier than making them myself :)
(01:27:21) Dragonene: http://www.x2d.org/categories/daily-sketches is what I've got so far.
(01:27:29) Dragonene: It's rather crappy, but I'll learn
(01:27:30) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Sequel should include different algorithms for enemy ship generation.
(01:27:31) Dragonene: with time! :)
(01:27:32) Dragonene: I hope.
(01:27:34) Movius: TV you say?
(01:27:49) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Shit, forgot the link.
(01:27:58) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/video/
(01:28:09) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Episode 8, "gaming in the recession", 5:13
(01:28:16) Movius: fkn goodgame
(01:28:18) The_Doctor: I hate being sick.
(01:28:41) Dragonene: funny name that, Farbs|FarmingGnomes
(01:28:47) Dragonene: "goodgame" is an organization in sweden
(01:28:55) Dragonene: who basically say "don't play games."
(01:28:57) Movius: pwned (defeated)
(01:29:09) Movius: I believe that is the aim of good game here too

(01:29:39) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: ADAMADAMADAM
(01:29:52) Dragonene: there's no "5:13" farbs
(01:29:57) Dragonene: each episode is like a minute and a half
(01:29:58) Movius: I watched the first 2 episodes. They were terrible, therefore it's eternally tainted :P
(01:30:16) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: Ah. I haven't seen those.
(01:30:25) Adam left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(01:30:36) adam_: hmm
(01:30:37) lansing: I managed to ignore the show up to a few episodes ago

(01:30:47) adam_: HEY ITS FARBS!!
(01:30:52) adam_: FARBS how are you man :D

(01:31:05) jstickeur: Yay farbs \o/
(01:31:17) lansing: Movius, I think it's a little more refined now
(01:31:22) adam_: hey its movius!!
(01:31:24) Movius: hopefully
(01:31:26) adam_: this is starting to feel like home
(01:31:44) The_Doctor: Yeah, I've seen it.
(01:31:48) Farbs|FarmingGnomes: This is what I'm hoping for -> They seemed basically like an ad for whoever was being interviewed
(01:31:50) Movius: greetings and salutations
(01:31:52) The_Doctor: I prefer the game
(01:32:14) Drakkar: I do too
(01:32:21) Drakkar: but as a movie it wasn't that bad I thought
(01:32:24) Farbs|FarmingGnomes is now known as Farbs|EmergencyEvacuation
(01:32:32) Cow: I wish I was at Adam's home.
(01:32:35) ***Farbs|EmergencyEvacuation shall return.
(01:32:36) The_Doctor: It was alright, except for the scenes with the husband
(01:32:46) The_Doctor: Because he's totally irrelevant
(01:32:47) Movius: if this article ends in a pitch for government subsidies i will be very angry
(01:32:49) PFawkes: have you seen my child?
(01:32:52) PFawkes: have you?
(01:33:02) The_Doctor: Have you seen a little girl? Short, black hair?
(01:33:04) PFawkes: I am in need of assistance sir
(01:33:11) PFawkes: please have you seen a little girl
(01:33:27) PFawkes: oh shoot the city's gone insane

(01:34:13) Dragonene: Very new
(01:34:13) Movius: oh, the EVILS OF USED GAMES angle
(01:34:15) Dragonene: You started it.
(01:34:17) Movius: a bold twist
(01:34:23) Pasteletsap: Woah
(01:34:27) PFawkes: hah
(01:34:36) PFawkes: I believein the evils of used games
(01:34:37) The_Doctor: "Last clip." "That's all the bullets you got?" "What do you expect? I'm a mall cop!"
(01:34:38) Pasteletsap: That's crazy. 
(01:34:42) PFawkes: since they're usually the bad ones
(01:34:49) PFawkes: we need some QUALITY used games
(01:34:53) PFawkes: in pawn shops and the like
(01:34:53) Dragonene: The_Doctor: what's that?
(01:34:58) Dragonene: sounds like quality dialogue
(01:34:59) Pasteletsap: No way, I got Megaman Legends 1 and 2 used
(01:35:03) Movius: I can't find dead rising anywhere
(01:35:47) lemre: D:

(01:36:12) BlademasterBobo: later
(01:36:13) BlademasterBobo left the room (quit: Quit: BlademasterBobo).
(01:36:13) lemre: buy my copy of Misadventures of Tron Bonne
(01:36:16) The_Doctor: But the last line was me
(01:36:37) PFawkes: Resident Evil!
(01:36:45) PFawkes: I wonder where these webs came from
(01:36:53) Cow: guys if I made a L4D level, would you play it with me?
(01:37:06) Drakkar: if you bought me l4d
(01:37:07) Drakkar: :D
(01:37:10) Pasteletsap: Man if I had any spare change I'd buy Misadventures of Tron Bonne
(01:37:12) adam_: jstickeur: life is good!
(01:37:13) lansing: do we have to install it manually Cow?
(01:37:15) PFawkes: if you bought me a gaming rig
(01:37:17) Cow: I don't know
(01:37:21) lemre: i've been meaning to put it up on ebay for a while
(01:37:29) lemre: i think it's the only ps1 game i own that i could make anything off of
(01:37:30) PFawkes: hm
(01:37:32) Pasteletsap: It'll get snatched up pretty quick
(01:37:34) lemre: except Tomba, perhaps, but i'm never parting with that one. ever
(01:37:34) PFawkes: maybe
(01:37:46) Cow: Toooooooomba
(01:37:47) PFawkes: I could probably get something for Vagrant Story
(01:37:53) PFawkes: or Chrono Cross
(01:37:56) Cow: I remember seeing ads of that
(01:38:02) Farbs|EmergencyEvacuation is now known as Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow
(01:38:02) Cow: in old EGMs
(01:38:06) PFawkes: maybe FF7 just because of the crazy people who lust for it
(01:38:08) PFawkes: :(
(01:38:08) lemre: it's a great game
(01:38:11) ***Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow is back.
(01:38:16) The_Doctor: I have a few copies of FF9
(01:38:21) Cow: how Farbs? HOW?
(01:38:25) Drakkar: vagrant story is pretty awesome
(01:38:29) pyl: slap fight!
(01:38:30) PFawkes: yes
(01:38:33) Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow: Eat a lot, then poop.
(01:38:38) Drakkar: but I already have 3 copies
(01:38:41) Drakkar: a 4th would be excessive
(01:38:42) Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow: You have to gain 3kg first.
(01:38:45) PFawkes: I'm Ashlet Riot!
(01:38:49) Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow: 4kg would be dangerous!
(01:38:55) Cow: I do that every day
(01:38:57) PFawkes: I'm the one Square character with characterization!
(01:38:59) Cow: 3kg every day
(01:39:01) PFawkes: it's amazing!
(01:39:12) EnergyTurtle: Whut? Doesn't Ashley Riot never talk or anything?
(01:39:25) PFawkes: ?
(01:39:35) Drakkar: especially for a game whose main mechanical gimmick I am very very terrible at
(01:39:39) PFawkes: but there's still characterization
(01:40:00) Drakkar: he's pretty expressive
(01:40:04) PFawkes: yeah
(01:40:05) Drakkar: visually and in other ways
(01:40:06) EnergyTurtle: I never got very far
(01:40:10) PFawkes: they did a lot for that
(01:40:19) PFawkes: and the whole angle with the kid and such
(01:40:21) Drakkar: vagrant story is the reason I enjoy uh
(01:40:24) Drakkar: FFXII
(01:40:29) PFawkes: they managed to express a lot without speech
(01:40:32) EnergyTurtle: ... what does that mean, drakkar?
(01:40:32) Drakkar: same art team
(01:40:34) EnergyTurtle: ah
(01:40:40) Cow: so, Vagrant Story, story about hobos?
(01:40:43) EnergyTurtle: No
(01:40:45) Drakkar: and partially the same writer

(01:40:53) PFawkes: yes
(01:40:58) EnergyTurtle: But it is brown and dark long before current gen games, Cow
(01:41:01) PFawkes: but FFXII has the worst battle system
(01:41:03) PFawkes: of all time
(01:41:13) EnergyTurtle: And Vagrant Story has a good one!
(01:41:22) Cow: we're runnin' low on beans... better go inna town
(01:41:23) Drakkar: I think the battle system is ok but the character development system
(01:41:24) The_Doctor: We should just adopt the old Final Fantasy battle system
(01:41:25) Drakkar: is the big issue
(01:41:31) Drakkar: because with enough grinding
(01:41:34) PFawkes: noi
(01:41:35) Drakkar: you can have every ability
(01:41:37) The_Doctor: instead of trying to improve on something and make it more rediculous
(01:41:37) Drakkar: without issue
(01:41:41) PFawkes: we need Vagrant Story system to come back
(01:41:43) Cow: spare change, sir? odd jobs, man?

(01:42:25) The_Doctor: Hahaha
(01:42:28) PFawkes: so you might either be broken or unlucky
(01:42:29) Drakkar: phantasy star 4's autobattle
(01:42:32) Drakkar: it'd be alot better

(01:43:24) PFawkes: they took all the edges off it though
(01:43:33) PFawkes: everything is rounded and even more cutesy than before
(01:43:39) PFawkes: you know
(01:43:44) Cow: I need to exercise
(01:43:46) Cow: lose 3kg
(01:43:52) Cow: I might go do that
(01:44:00) The_Doctor: It seems these days that Final Fantasy sells nowadays because it's Final Fantasy.

(01:44:45) Cow: red mages are the best characters ever

(01:45:41) EnergyTurtle: I only played the GBA one, PFawkes, were da others good?
(01:45:57) The_Doctor: And in all honesty, more Final Fantasy characters should dress that way
(01:45:59) Farbs|Lose3kgAskMeHow: Snakey - for..? Captain Forever? Yes.

(01:50:53) lemre: it's not gratuitous, but edward does end up nearly breaking her hips with his super strength
(01:51:06) Cow: does he have adamantium claws?
(01:51:12) PFawkes: don't be silly
(01:51:18) PFawkes: adamantium is expensive

(03:29:27) bagu: there's*
(03:30:16) bagu: also, my legs now work again after a half-marathon the other day, so maybe war would be fine
(03:31:40) lansing: oh man, I am so lazy, last month I was running several km a day and this month I have run none
(03:32:17) Notch: running? Outdoors? :-O
(03:32:31) iFire: what is this exercise you refer to?
(03:32:31) lansing: on the treadmill mostly
(03:32:39) Notch: oh, ok.
(03:32:53) Notch: kidding aside: nice. =)
(03:33:05) lansing: I run at my local park sometimes, but if it's been raining, it's a bit of a bog.
(03:33:26) Evil-Ville: Notch the water looks awesome
(03:33:30) Evil-Ville: Just wanted to say that to you
(03:34:17) Notch: Thanks, I appreciate it. =)
(03:34:35) Notch: I stayed up far too late last night, adding alpha blending to it and making it flow slightly better
(03:34:35) lansing: Notch, I linked your blog on the Ubuntu forums where someone was asking about infiniminer too :)
(03:34:55) pyl: Notch: would giving you a feature request be presumptuous? :]
(03:35:15) Notch: absolutely not, pyl, I'd appreciate it a lot. I've gotten many great ideas from here.
(03:35:15) iFire: lansing can you link it again?
(03:35:23) Notch: sweet lansing. =)
(03:35:27) iFire: Evil-Ville I mean
(03:35:31) pyl: i'd love to have something like earthworm-mode
(03:35:35) lansing: http://notch.tumblr.com/
(03:35:36) Notch: I got the domain up and running last night as well, but there's nothing there
(03:35:40) pyl: were any block you run into disappears

(03:35:56) Notch: *on
(03:36:03) pyl: yeah :)
(03:36:06) lansing: Notch, is there going to be mine subsidence?
(03:36:18) Notch: what does subsidence mean?
(03:36:22) pyl: or you'd be a very vertical earthworm
(03:36:23) lansing: to cave in, deform
(03:36:46) pyl: and maybe an inverse earthworm, which forms blocks behind you when you run
(03:36:47) Notch: I don't know. I'd like floating islands of stuff to fall down at the very minimum
(03:36:49) lansing: in mines that are no geotechnically sound, they cause mine subsidence, eg the land above collapses into the mine
(03:36:53) pyl: like a tail/trace, tron-style
(03:37:07) Notch: would it be fun to play with that, lansing?
(03:37:40) Notch: hehe pyl =D With free flying mode, that would be pretty.. fast. What would you use it for?
(03:37:43) lansing: maybe it would add a technical aspect where if you don't reinforce your mines they might deform
(03:37:47) lansing: I don't know :)
(03:37:54) haowan: one player is playing the sandworm
(03:38:12) Notch: I want dirt to slide down at least if you don't reinforce
(03:38:47) pyl: i don't know what i'd use it for, i just think it would be fun as hell burrowing through at high speed without all the clicking :]

(03:43:22) iFire: :P
(03:43:34) Notch: =D
(03:44:02) Evil-Ville: Also for the survival mode you should make it so that to keep your house/fort/whatever warm you need to burn wood and if you don't build a chimney you choke on smoke
(03:44:19) Evil-Ville: That is if you add winter
(03:44:24) Evil-Ville: Maybe that's too much
(03:44:34) Notch: i want snow. =D
(03:44:44) Notch: but that implies keeping track of temperatures, hehe
(03:44:58) Evil-Ville: It would be awesome though
(03:45:10) Notch: wait, only the server needs to know the temperatures
(03:45:27) Evil-Ville: Also direction of light should change depending on time of day
(03:45:53) Notch: i'm probably not going to change that. The shadow code would get too slow since the entire world is dynamic
(03:46:02) Evil-Ville: oh
(03:46:20) Notch: but day and night cycles would be cool =D
(03:46:26) pyl: naw, i love the lighting like it is right now
(03:46:42) pyl: it's lo-res and fits the style
(03:46:44) pyl: of it all
(03:46:50) pyl: it's coherent, kinda
(03:46:57) pyl: i actually kinda liked the slow updating water :D
(03:47:00) pyl: for the same reason
(03:47:54) pyl: water/lava that's so slow that you can just barely run from it is pretty awesome
(03:48:31) Evil-Ville: I think lava should be slower than water
(03:49:01) Notch: lava will be slower, yes. =)
(03:49:20) Notch: I changed water so whenever it spreads, it always also spreads as far down as it can
(03:49:34) pyl: so it fills up from the bottom?
(03:49:43) Notch: yes, mostly
(03:49:47) pyl: niice
(03:49:56) Notch: there can be small air pockets sometimes, but they kinda look like bubbles now that I made it transparent
(03:50:48) pyl: have you looked at the water handling from the dwarf fortress wiki?
(03:50:50) pyl: for water pressure etc
(03:50:52) pyl: it's solid work
(03:50:55) Notch: i have. =)
(03:51:03) Notch: very clever stuff
(03:51:21) Notch: i have no idea how he can do that many 3d flood fills, though, heh
(03:51:26) Notch: well, C.
(03:51:36) Notch: array accesses are fairly slow in java compared to c
(03:51:50) pyl: he wrote something about the whole realism vs. speed thing, and the way he cheats to get water pressure done
(03:51:55) pyl: eh i guess you know :]
(03:52:13) Notch: but if you've got water underground a small enclosed pocket of air, the air pressure will keep the water out
(03:52:24) pyl: mhm, but then if you drill a whole in the ceiling
(03:52:27) pyl: the air rushes out
(03:52:30) pyl: and the water rises :D
(03:52:37) Notch: then I'd have to simulate air pressure as well. ;)
(03:52:45) KareemK: i was surprised at minecraft's java nature
(03:53:00) Notch: I'm kinda thinking of keeping the system I've got now. It actually plays very nicely

(03:53:38) Notch: oh, and mining underground and hitting is not fun, haha
(03:53:45) pyl: is the water.. finite?

(03:53:49) kevglass [avatar@rhubarb.custard.org] entered the room.
(03:53:52) pyl: if you have a lake of 10x10 blocks of water
(03:53:57) pyl: and you drill a hole in the bottom
(03:53:58) pyl: will it drain
(03:54:14) Notch: I want it to. The one I've got now is infinite
(03:54:18) pyl: mm
(03:54:26) Notch: and I also want waterfalls, and that won't work if it drains
(03:54:46) pyl: well, you can have infinite water tiles
(03:54:48) kevglass: you need to be able to place water sources
(03:54:51) pyl: but it's complicated i guess
(03:54:56) pyl: faucet tiles
(03:54:58) pyl: :]
(03:55:00) kevglass: aye
(03:55:24) Notch: how does it work in real life? Rain water and pressurised springs?

(03:56:18) Evil-Ville: Rain would be cool
(03:56:29) Notch: when it's next to water, it follows it upwards and removes one of the surface tiles of water
(03:56:43) Notch: combined with all water being infinite, that could work as a drain, heh
(03:56:54) pyl: rock holds a lot of water
(03:58:05) kevglass: feels like the inverse of what you want to do as a player though

(03:59:12) bozoMan left the room.
(03:59:55) Evil-Ville: The whole map should just be an island so you could drain water from the sea surrounding it
(04:00:01) Notch: Evil-Ville: It is. =)
(04:00:10) Evil-Ville: Yes but it should stay that way
(04:00:19) Notch: it probably will. =D
(04:00:27) Notch: but I want lakes over water level
(04:01:28) SMRobot [littleripp@121.212.138.245] entered the room.
(04:02:38) Notch: and they should NOT fill the entire level when you open them, up, heh
(04:02:46) Evil-Ville: Yes
(04:03:08) kevglass: in that case, can you just place water tiles?
(04:03:11) _SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:03:13) kevglass: and have them non-infinite
(04:03:29) Evil-Ville: I don't really know how a small island could have a waterfall though, other than maybe underground
(04:03:45) Notch: not in real life, no. =)
(04:04:18) SMRobot: that's what we play games fore
(04:04:18) Notch: still, the waterfall bit is mainly a side effect of me wanting islands about ground, and them not filling the entire level when you upen them
(04:04:22) SMRobot: for*
(04:04:38) dom: there could be a pressurised underground well
(04:04:47) kevglass: have standing water and flowing water?
(04:04:50) dom: something relating to volcanic activity
(04:05:13) pyl: i want a floating island with a water source so you can have a waterfall in the middle of nowhere. :]
(04:05:19) kevglass: :)
(04:05:23) kevglass: faucet tile!
(04:05:23) Notch: me too, pyl =D
(04:05:30) SMRobot: infiniminer's getting fluid sim lite?
(04:05:52) Notch: faucet, flowing and standing water.
(04:05:54) ***dom thinks of the infinite flowing taps 
(04:05:55) Evil-Ville: infiniminer isn't getting anything
(04:06:06) SMRobot: argh I mean minecraft
(04:06:07) SMRobot: ;p;
(04:06:09) Notch: water that hasn't changed in a tick can be converted to still water that doesn't need ticking.
(04:06:17) pyl: have water be infinite below the "sea level"
(04:06:19) pyl: finite above it
(04:06:27) pyl: except from water tiles
(04:06:37) Notch: combining that with faucets could just work
(04:06:59) SMRobot: I have basic collision in my prototype
(04:07:09) kevglass: faucet tiles need to produce water upwards
(04:07:26) kevglass: or at least to the side
(04:07:34) kevglass: morning btw Notch :)
(04:07:40) Evil-Ville: pyl that would just make it so that when the finite water flows below sea level it would suddenly start replicating all over the place

(04:08:04) Notch: Evil-Ville: Oh yeah, crap. you're right. :-\
(04:08:07) SMRobot: not much
(04:08:15) pyl: have it become part of the infinite sea?
(04:08:19) SMRobot: how would I detect what side is being touched?
(04:08:28) Notch: pyl: If you dig a huge bowl
(04:08:34) Notch: (under sea level)
(04:08:38) Notch: then that area won't be connected to the sea
(04:08:45) SMRobot: on an AABB btw
(04:08:48) pyl: mm
(04:08:50) kevglass: eventually it would flow above the bowl
(04:08:55) kevglass: and over sea level
(04:09:11) Notch: SMRobot: I cheat, and move X first, then Z, and lastly Y
(04:09:39) SMRobot: hmm?
(04:09:40) Notch: so there's some bias to what sides you hit, but it also means it's easier to hit landings
(04:09:52) Notch: I only move them one axis at a time
(04:09:58) SMRobot: I mean how do I tell if player's touching the top so I can enable jumping?
(04:10:10) Notch: If the player can't move down along y. =)
(04:10:28) SMRobot: oh yeah!
(04:10:35) SMRobot: I kinda have that
(04:11:01) Notch: one very bad thing about water is that it won't work too well with non-square blocks
(04:11:45) kevglass: let it flow over non-square bugs, and render water before :)
(04:12:04) kevglass: -bugs +blocks
(04:12:04) Notch: it'd replace them, it's a new tile type, heh. I'm probably going to have to separate it
(04:12:13) Notch: that'd work
(04:17:04) SMRobot: hmm
(04:17:30) SMRobot: the way I have collision right now is that if the player hits a block collide is true

(04:17:58) kevglass: which direction were they moving in when you detected the collide
(04:18:07) Notch: if there's a collide when moving along x, check if the player was going left or right
(04:18:08) SMRobot: ahh
(04:18:10) SMRobot: good idea
(04:18:17) Notch: if he was going left, you hit the right side
(04:18:47) kevglass: ?
(04:18:57) kevglass: oh the right side of the thing you hit
(04:19:06) SMRobot: ya
(04:19:11) Parthon: :S
(04:19:20) Parthon: this is a very interesting conversation .. who is making the game?
(04:19:34) SMRobot: notch is making the cool one
(04:19:40) SMRobot: I'm mking a platformer
(04:19:49) ***kevglass is just bored. :)
(04:20:24) SMRobot: problem is, the tiles are stored in the players parent class
(04:20:42) SMRobot: how do I access them from a function within the player class?
(04:20:59) kevglass: language?
(04:21:03) SMRobot: C#
(04:21:05) SMRobot: XNA
(04:22:35) Drakkar: hey Notch, will there also be water currents?
(04:22:44) Movius: is a reference to the player's parent stored?
(04:22:53) Movius: or do you mean like a superclass & subclass
(04:24:15) Notch: i'm not sure, Drakkar. I can store the direction water spread in and keep that, I guess. =)
(04:24:29) Parthon: Notch: is this a 2d or 3d game?
(04:24:29) Drakkar: was just curious
(04:24:33) Drakkar: would be neat to create a sort of dam
(04:24:38) Drakkar: near an enemy's fortress
(04:24:40) Drakkar: then pop it
(04:24:44) Drakkar: and watch the water wash them away
(04:25:59) Notch: 3d, Parthon. http://www.minecraft.net/
(04:26:12) Notch: haha yeah
(04:26:30) Notch: I have to add currents. At the very least for spreading water
(04:26:40) Drakkar: excellent
(04:26:41) Parthon: I want to start working on fluid dynamics for a dwarf fortress in space game
(04:26:42) Evil-Ville: Is the level size really big enough to secretly build a dam, or anything
(04:27:12) Notch: no, not secretly, hehe
(04:27:19) Drakkar: not above ground no
(04:27:23) Notch: but if there is a natural one..
(04:30:02) pyl: you could build one secretely inside a mountain? :]
(04:30:21) Parthon: Notch: what's that written in?
(04:30:26) Notch: java. =)
(04:30:59) kevglass: ** silence **
(04:31:13) Drakkar: interesting thought
(04:31:16) Drakkar: pipe systems
(04:32:10) Notch: ooh

(05:00:59) Bigger: hey _SMRobot
(05:01:41) _SMRobot is now known as SMRobot
(05:01:45) SMRobot: fixed =D
(05:02:02) Parthon: SMRobot: what kind of platformer?
(05:02:36) SMRobot: Movius, how do I store a reference to a class' parent?
(05:02:41) Dragonene: Notch!
(05:02:45) SMRobot: Parthon, single screen
(05:02:46) Dragonene: Since when do you have a domain for minecraft
(05:02:52) Notch: since last night =)
(05:02:52) SMRobot: I have a blog about it
(05:03:01) Movius: is parent some C# terminology for superclass?
(05:03:13) SMRobot: hmm
(05:03:33) SMRobot: I mean the class that contains an instance of my player class
(05:03:41) SMRobot: specifically the world class
(05:03:42) Movius: thats what i thought
(05:03:45) Movius: easily
(05:03:56) SMRobot: Parthon, my blog -> http://sm-robot.tumblr.com/
(05:04:07) Movius: pass the reference to the parent class in the constructor
(05:04:21) Parthon: cool
(05:04:31) SMRobot: how do I do constructors in C#, the same as C++?
(05:04:41) lemre: aren't sierra adventures supposed to work in scummvm
(05:04:53) Stargoat: some of them
(05:04:59) Dragonene: ooh
(05:05:01) Dragonene: you have water also?
(05:05:05) Stargoat: I think the Space Quest games before IV do
(05:05:05) Dragonene: Notch has been productive
(05:05:11) Parthon: I was thinking about a single screen platformer where as you play, you don't switch levels, the level morphs around you
(05:05:22) Parthon: so it's quite literally a single screen game
(05:05:24) Eclipse: yes SMRobot
(05:05:25) Stargoat: do work in SCUMMVM
(05:05:32) Movius: I'd assume just like Java. which is where everything else is copied from in C3
(05:05:34) Movius: C#
(05:05:52) Dragonene: hm
(05:05:52) SMRobot: so just a <classname>() function within a class
(05:05:57) Dragonene: time to do some more pixelling perhaps?
(05:06:03) Dragonene: hm... I suppose I should make dinner first.
(05:06:05) Movius: yes
(05:06:08) SMRobot: kk
(05:06:43) Eclipse: SMRobot: that broadcast concept seems cool
(05:07:06) Eclipse: yep just like c++
(05:08:05) SMRobot: thanks

(05:10:19) Notch: =D
(05:10:29) Notch: i replied to your question, trying to coax out some more info
(05:10:59) SMRobot: wha?
(05:12:06) xe0n: notch, what will be the goal of that minecraft game?
(05:12:24) lansing: it will be the game to end all games
(05:12:41) Notch: there will be several game modes. In survival, it's to survive.
(05:12:49) Notch: in creative, there is none
(05:12:55) xe0n: haha... not that it needs a goal.. i was having a blast just  dropping dudes down into eternity
(05:13:32) Notch: whoever made the youtube video I linked to from minecraft.net pretty much sums the game up so far, I think. ;)
(05:13:48) xe0n: lol

(05:17:41) SMRobot: If there's one thing I'd like on tumblr it's an about page on my blog
(05:18:46) Dragonene: Notch: that is an awesome movie
(05:19:52) SMRobot: Notch liked my post =D
(05:20:31) Notch: anything that mentions prototypes, I like!
(05:20:40) _SMRobot [littleripp@121.212.138.245] entered the room.
(05:22:32) _SMRobot: Notch, watching your video I think it would be nicer if the water blocks spread slowly like infiniminer's lava
(05:22:53) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(05:22:59) Notch: isn't it enough if lava spreads slow?
(05:23:40) _SMRobot: hm?
(05:24:09) Notch: hehe
(05:24:18) Notch: why do you think that water should spread more slowly?
(05:24:26) _SMRobot: Oh wait, I've watched it more, the water doesn't just flood fill
(05:24:28) _SMRobot: sorry nvm
(05:24:46) Notch: ah. It does this kind of chunked spreading. It's a bit strange
(05:25:16) _SMRobot: yeah

(05:31:18) Dragonene: http://x2d.org/categories/daily-sketches/ look, another one! :)
(05:36:02) _SMRobot: nice
(05:37:32) Farbs|GnomeFarming: Are you using a tool to generate your palettes, or is it all by eye?

(05:51:13) Farbs|GnomeFarming: Oh cool. That's a nice idea.
(05:51:26) Dragonene: I also ask people to tell me what to make
(05:51:33) Dragonene: not for this last one (the dawn thingy)
(05:51:35) Dragonene: but for the others
(05:51:44) Dragonene: well not the face one either... :P

(06:31:50) Bigger: I eat a lot of pasta
(06:32:05) Parthon: poing
(06:33:00) Dragonene: I haven't cooked in like a week or more
(06:33:07) Dragonene: Probably like 2 weeks
(06:33:18) Bigger: I am programming again and it feels great to exercise my brain again
(06:33:34) Dragonene: Hhe
(06:33:35) Dragonene: Heh
(06:33:41) Dragonene: I was programming instead of making pasta for two weeks
(06:33:46) Bigger: hehe
(06:33:49) Dragonene: Maybe we switched personalities without noticing

(06:34:41) Dragonene: Mm
(06:34:41) Stargoat: I have nearly AU$100 in shrapnel. Aweomse
(06:34:45) Stargoat: awesome*
(06:34:45) Dragonene: this is quite delicious
(06:34:49) Dragonene: shrapnel?
(06:34:59) mewse: Small change.
(06:35:00) Stargoat: loose, shiity coins that you can't do much with
(06:35:02) Dragonene: ah
(06:35:03) Dragonene: right
(06:35:05) Dragonene: cool
(06:35:07) Dragonene: It's just... what's the one called with meat, onion and tomato?
(06:35:08) Bigger: Awesome Stargoat
(06:35:15) Dragonene: it that bolognese?
(06:35:17) Stargoat: I should play poker with it
(06:35:23) Dragonene: Anyway, it's just that
(06:35:27) mewse: Used to only refer to the 1 cent and 2 cent coins.  But those don't exist any more, so the term seems to have been promoted.
(06:35:27) Stargoat: sounds like it could be bolognese
(06:35:27) Dragonene: But it turned out just right
(06:35:29) Bigger: you should buy something worth $100 with it
(06:35:39) Stargoat: haha
(06:35:43) Stargoat: piss off the clerk right?
(06:35:54) Stargoat: also, nothing is "worth" $100 that costs $100
(06:36:05) Dragonene: I probably just leveled up in pasta crafting
(06:36:10) Stargoat: :|
(06:36:30) Dragonene: btw, my friend's sister bought a pair of pants for... I think it was 1000SEK in coins
(06:36:36) mewse: That means you can choose a new pasta perk?
(06:36:38) Dragonene: that'd be about 200AUD
(06:36:42) Stargoat: hah
(06:36:51) Stargoat: real life trolling
(06:37:02) Stargoat: I'm eating some delicious chickeny thing
(06:37:30) Bigger: 3d space 3d space 3d geometry aaaaaagh
(06:37:55) Stargoat: I love chicken.
(06:38:00) Dragonene: Weird truth: Even though I'm very picky about with what I eat, I rather like cooking. I even think I'm quite adept at cooking the few things I do cook.
(06:38:29) Stargoat: mewse: how's mmorpg 2 coming along?

(06:40:39) Stargoat: food tastes better the second time around.
(06:40:44) Stargoat: This is objective fact.
(06:40:47) Dragonene: Nah
(06:40:52) Dragonene: But it's usually still good.
(06:41:02) Stargoat: there's no room for disagreement

(06:41:56) ***Bigger rolls two dice. Lands critical hit on kevglass.
(06:42:04) Dragonene: Yet hardly worthy of playing it.
(06:42:05) Stargoat: Bigger is no good at this game.
(06:42:07) kevglass: ack
(06:42:08) Dragonene: Bigger: You can't do that
(06:42:11) Dragonene: You just had your salary halved.
(06:42:12) ***kevglass is dead?
(06:42:25) Dragonene: Nah
(06:42:30) Dragonene: You can't kill in this game
(06:42:33) Dragonene: Only lose money.
(06:42:35) Dragonene: And wait.
(06:42:36) ***kevglass likes this game

(06:44:05) Dragonene: Or the Internet?
(06:44:09) Stargoat: it's@
(06:44:11) Stargoat: ack
(06:44:16) Stargoat: typing one handed is difficult.
(06:44:19) kevglass: tigirc
(06:44:22) kevglass: the forum scares me off
(06:44:26) kevglass: but here is pretty funny :)
(06:44:28) Stargoat: let's not go to tigirc
(06:44:30) Stargoat: it is a silly place
(06:44:38) Dragonene: Heh
(06:44:44) Stargoat: the forum is good for Super Joe and nothing else.
(06:44:47) Dragonene: I enjoy the forum occasionally
(06:44:52) Dragonene: But only on a semi-regular basis
(06:44:55) Dragonene: Sort of like JGO
(06:45:02) Dragonene: I like ircing better than fora.
(06:45:10) ***kevglass likes to code mostly.
(06:45:16) Dragonene: Heh

(06:45:19) Dragonene: I pretend I like to code
(06:45:21) Bigger: Answer by Yako: No. If it is a shoulder keyboard. it wii be a different story.
(06:45:22) Dragonene: and sit on irc instead
(06:45:30) kevglass: got the defeated dialog in last night before bed
(06:45:38) Stargoat: hmm
(06:45:38) Dragonene: yay
(06:45:47) Stargoat: I have a mountain of screwed up paper behind my laptop
(06:45:49) Dragonene: How's the battle system shaping up
(06:45:50) Dragonene: is it fun?
(06:45:53) Stargoat: this -has- to be a fire hazard
(06:45:55) Stargoat: awesome!
(06:45:57) kevglass: not sure really
(06:45:58) Bigger: The forums have less and less places for me to post. The IRC saps more and more of my time
(06:46:04) kevglass: it's just a turn based select skill select target type thing
(06:46:13) kevglass: probably be more interesting once the skills are coded 
(06:46:23) Dragonene: Bigger: Imagine what it is like for me. I pretty much started on irc straight away
(06:46:24) kevglass: gotta wire the combat into the dungeon first tho
(06:46:28) Stargoat: an RPG, kevglass?
(06:46:30) Dragonene: kevglass: ah right
(06:46:36) ***kevglass nods at stargoat.
(06:46:47) Stargoat: what type?
(06:46:47) nyarla: i think i have posted 2 posts on the tig forummy thing
(06:46:49) Dragonene: rpg / roguelike
(06:46:54) Stargoat: ooh
(06:46:59) Stargoat: roguelikes are awesome +
(06:46:59) kevglass: it's not roguelike any more I'm afraid
(06:47:05) Dragonene: oh really?
(06:47:06) Dragonene: good
(06:47:07) Dragonene: :D
(06:47:08) Stargoat: damn.
(06:47:13) Dragonene: I prefer other RPGs to roguelikes
(06:47:17) kevglass: not gonna work well for a little touch screen
(06:47:17) Stargoat: Dragonene is full of hate and pasta
(06:47:21) Dragonene: oh
(06:47:26) Dragonene: so you *are* putting it on a phone?
(06:47:28) Stargoat: PWDER works
(06:47:28) Dragonene: \o/

(06:47:46) Stargoat: phht
(06:47:47) Stargoat: whatever
(06:47:48) kevglass: is how the dungeon looks when you're exploring
(06:47:50) Stargoat: you hate everything
(06:47:53) Stargoat: even the things you like
(06:47:57) Stargoat: ...or that me?
(06:48:03) Stargoat: I can't remember.
(06:48:12) Dragonene: kevglass: what platform is this dammit
(06:48:13) kevglass: and yeah, phone target and web, same code.
(06:48:14) Dragonene: you must tell me
(06:48:16) Bigger: I feel pretty hardcore when I try to visualise my code on paper
(06:48:17) Dragonene: ah
(06:48:18) Stargoat: I like the archer
(06:48:18) Dragonene: okay.
(06:48:31) Bigger: it is just a bunch of formulas and diagrams and things
(06:48:34) Dragonene: I like the warrior the best
(06:48:46) Bigger: and only a tiny bit of it is actually mathmatical
(06:48:47) nyarla: i love the "coke and code" font on the mainpage of your site kevglass
(06:48:55) kevglass: :)
(06:49:00) nyarla: now i want coke
(06:49:09) kevglass: http://www.cokeandcode.com/yoren/yoren7.png - reaper is the best sprite :)
(06:49:31) Stargoat: coke is expensive and damages your nose.
(06:49:36) kevglass: tsk
(06:49:46) Stargoat: where do you hail from, kev?
(06:49:54) kevglass: uk
(06:50:09) Stargoat: cool
(06:50:11) nyarla: you have to be upside down to easily pour coke into your nose
(06:50:28) Rosetta [Rosetta@78.149.12.170] entered the room.
(06:50:42) Bigger: I find that putting it into a saucer makes it easier to sniff
(06:50:49) Dragonene: kevglass is the greatest thing to ever come out of the UK
(06:50:51) Dragonene: together with music
(06:50:53) lansing: kevglass, is cokeandcode your website?
(06:51:28) Bigger: I was going to argue that UK music is boring but two of my favourite artists live in the UK so I guess that theory is zero
(06:51:40) ***kevglass nods at lansing
(06:51:43) lansing: kevglass, are you really born in 1905?
(06:51:46) Stargoat: everything from the uk is boring and ugly
(06:51:49) Stargoat: no exceptions
(06:51:52) ***kevglass grins at lansing 
(06:52:34) Bigger: kevglass, you have aged well
(06:53:23) Bigger: for someone 104 years old that is
(06:53:23) kevglass: you should see my pension pay out
(06:53:35) Bigger: hehe
(06:55:22) SMRobot [littleripp@121.212.138.245] entered the room.

(06:55:42) Bigger: hello again SMRobot
(06:55:47) Dragonene: pretty much all the bands I listen to are from the UK
(06:55:50) Dragonene: :P
(06:55:57) Bigger: there are only two for me
(06:56:01) Dragonene: There's a few exceptions, but you know... :)
(06:56:04) kevglass: who?
(06:56:17) SMRobot: Most of my bands are UK
(06:56:25) Bigger: goreshit and dj ninja love mistake
(06:56:36) Bigger: and even then they reside more in the "internet" side of things
(06:56:54) ***kevglass nods
(06:57:04) kevglass: not what you'd call mainstream
(06:57:15) Bigger: I guess everything else would be mainly japanese.
(06:57:41) Dragonene: Some favorite UK bands for me: Radiohead, New Model Army, The Veils (they're mixed NZ and UK), Hell Is For Heroes...
(06:58:01) Dragonene: Naturally The Beatles as well.
(06:59:15) SMRobot: I'm so mainstream =D, listening to blur right now
(06:59:23) kevglass: aww, blur are just great tho
(06:59:33) Dragonene: I only know Song 2 from them.
(06:59:38) Dragonene: It's a pretty good song though.
(06:59:43) kevglass: oh, you missed the parklife album
(06:59:50) kevglass: their hayday
(06:59:53) Dragonene: Speaking of mainstream... I forgot about Travis.
(06:59:55) Bigger: Blur are that band that the guy from Gorillaz plays in, isn't it?
(06:59:58) SMRobot: parklife is awesome
(06:59:58) Dragonene: I rather like them.
(06:59:59) SMRobot: ya
(07:00:03) kevglass: Damon Al...
(07:00:04) Dragonene: They're from Scotland, I think
(07:00:12) SMRobot: really?
(07:00:13) kevglass: Travis, yep, scots.
(07:00:17) kevglass: Blur arn't no.
(07:00:24) SMRobot: didn't think so
(07:00:30) SMRobot: muse is good
(07:00:31) kevglass: they're middle class city dwellers.
(07:00:39) kevglass: muse are fantastic.
(07:00:51) Dragonene: Muse... plays music I feel I *should* like, but it never gets to me
(07:01:03) Dragonene: Strangely enough
(07:01:10) kevglass: have you heard snow patrol
(07:01:11) SMRobot: I used to be a pretty big Kasabian fan
(07:01:12) Notch: oh, I think I figured out how to do waterfalls =D

(07:01:20) SMRobot: arg effin Snow Patrol
(07:01:23) kevglass: waterfalls!
(07:01:25) Notch: maybe. probablty not. crap
(07:01:28) Notch: -t
(07:02:06) Dragonene: kevglass: have you heard the veils?
(07:02:08) Dragonene: Just curious.
(07:02:33) Dragonene: ...The Verve are also from the UK, aren't they?
(07:02:35) Dragonene: They're pretty good.
(07:02:51) Dragonene: kevglass: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVTfNVF_SPY go!

(07:03:16) kevglass: verve also yeah

(07:03:33) Dragonene: At work?
(07:03:40) Siiseli: Dragonene, no thanks
(07:03:40) ***kevglass nods
(07:03:44) kevglass: nasty business.
(07:03:49) Siiseli: not my kind of music
(07:03:50) Dragonene: Siiseli: ...you don't like the song?
(07:03:51) kevglass: lunch soon tho, so codey
(07:03:52) Dragonene: :)
(07:03:59) Siiseli: not particularily
(07:04:05) Dragonene: Siiseli: They're rather varied. It's certainly not the only type of music they play
(07:04:12) Bigger: Siiseli likes metal since he is finnish
(07:04:12) Dragonene: what sort of music do you listen to
(07:04:24) Siiseli: Bigger, I hate maetal
(07:04:27) Siiseli: metal*
(07:04:30) Bigger: But you are finnish
(07:04:30) kevglass: europop?
(07:04:41) Dragonene: Siiseli: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5yUoVXuLjU that's a rather different song from them.
(07:04:57) Dragonene: One of the most beautiful songs in the world, if you ask me.
(07:04:58) Dragonene: :)
(07:04:59) Siiseli: Dragonene, blues, dnb, some subforms of dnb like jungle and neurofunk, psybient, dub, ambient(of all flavours), classical
(07:05:24) Dragonene: if you like classical you might enjoy that last song.
(07:05:29) Dragonene: Try it.
(07:05:31) Dragonene: :)
(07:05:36) Bigger: psybient like ambient psytrance? or psychadelic ambient?
(07:05:38) Siiseli: well the one you pasted is kind of nice
(07:05:42) Siiseli: Bigger, no
(07:05:49) Siiseli: I'll give you an example
(07:05:56) SMRobot: I was listening to I Am Robot And Proud the other day when I hear everyday shooter guy was teaming up with him
(07:05:56) Siiseli: trance is hatred
(07:06:18) Bigger: psytrance for me is like trance but actually interesting
(07:06:26) Bigger: not just the same boring synths
(07:06:49) Siiseli: http://speakmusic.net/media/mind_split/SpeaK-End_of_Day_Dub.mp3
(07:07:05) Siiseli: that's kind of psybient
(07:07:19) Notch: why.. can't I .. open.. links or.. copy.. text
(07:07:21) Notch: agh
(07:07:22) Notch: brb
(07:07:24) Notch left the room (quit: Quit: L?mnar).
(07:07:24) Dragonene: I'd save it to my HDD and listen later Siiseli
(07:07:32) Dragonene: but quicktime insists on opening it
(07:07:41) Dragonene: and I can't right click -> save or my irc will crash
(07:07:42) Siiseli: http://speakmusic.net/music/nmal some psybient in this album as well
(07:07:45) Dragonene: ... :P
(07:07:47) Notch [Notch@static-213-115-28-4.sme.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.

(07:08:57) Dragonene left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(07:09:03) Notch: genres rock
(07:09:14) Bigger: this is sort of like ambient chillout psychadelic goa dub
(07:09:17) Bigger: maybe
(07:09:17) Dragonene [none@202.171.170.5] entered the room.
(07:09:25) Dragonene: right, so that didn't work. The truth is, quicktime and opera don't work well together
(07:09:27) Notch: Bigger: You linked me to some awesome japanese hardcore a few days ago.. you don't happen to remember what it was?
(07:09:27) Dragonene: at least not in this version
(07:09:35) Dragonene: file -> save as crashed by browser

(07:10:07) Siiseli: Bigger, oh it's known as ambient psytrance? 
(07:10:16) Siiseli: I never thought this sounded anything like trance
(07:10:19) Notch: aaah, arm! thanks!
(07:10:33) C418 [C418@p5B3D55EC.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(07:10:39) Ina: Heya
(07:10:40) Bigger: psytrance is not much like trance
(07:11:01) Siiseli: Bigger, I find the genre definitions of dnb/other stuff like that amusing
(07:11:01) Siiseli: :D
(07:11:10) Bigger: i mean, same 4 to the floor beat and tempo, but it is much more interesting
(07:11:35) Siiseli: http://kunaki.com/Sales.asp?PID=PX00ZEZ5HT buy this cd from that guy who made the songs I just pasted
(07:11:46) Siiseli: is a jungle album
(07:12:30) Bigger: I haven't listened to psytrance in so long. it was my introduction to electronic music iirc
(07:12:58) Notch: mine was Aphex Twin - Donkey Rhubarb, heh
(07:13:04) Bigger: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSrc4MgKL3o
(07:13:07) dom: aww, jungle

(07:16:09) Notch: hard? slow? experimental?
(07:16:21) Siiseli: also a pleasant chainsaw surprise
(07:16:24) Siiseli: you're a naming god
(07:16:31) Bigger: hard stuff is always great :>
(07:16:36) Notch: xenomotion is pretty good, it a bit slow
(07:16:57) Notch: "trust me"'s hard, but silly. =D
(07:17:28) Bigger: oh wow
(07:18:10) Bigger: trust me is pretty brilliant so far
(07:18:19) Notch: Oh, and Spine. I think you'll like Spine
(07:18:59) Dragonene: oh fudge
(07:19:08) Notch: (just give it time to start)
(07:19:09) Dragonene: I just realized I haven't done my pushups yet

(07:19:15) C418: holy shit how many albums do you have?
(07:19:25) Notch: five, and many unsorted
(07:19:40) C418: :o
(07:20:09) Dragonene: I'm..
(07:20:11) C418: recommend me a song
(07:20:18) Dragonene: somewhat disturbed by your naming conventions
(07:20:19) Notch: what style? Slow? hard? fast?
(07:20:26) C418: your most beloved
(07:20:27) Dragonene: "NullPointerException.getMessage()" <-- what?
(07:20:35) Notch: xenomotion means the most to me
(07:21:32) Dragonene: I'm trying to listen to it
(07:21:35) Notch: Dragonene: It's.. well. =D
(07:21:35) Dragonene: it takes a long time to load.
(07:21:41) Notch: yeah, the site is slow
(07:21:44) Dragonene: nah
(07:21:46) Notch: i need a better host, but I'm cheap
(07:21:47) C418: I don't have any problems
(07:21:47) Dragonene: it's my australian internet
(07:21:54) Bigger: The site is being fine for me ;o
(07:22:00) Dragonene: Notch: what host do you use?
(07:22:02) Notch: it is? it's slow here.
(07:22:18) C418: should I test the speed?
(07:22:19) C418: ookay
(07:22:23) Dragonene: Notch: I'm talking "I've been loading since you first said xenomotion and it's barely loaded 20 seconds" slow
(07:22:39) Notch: don't remember the name.. the cheapest one i found with decent transfer cap
(07:22:46) Dragonene: !
(07:22:49) Dragonene: Don't remember the name
(07:22:50) Dragonene: wtf :P
(07:22:53) Dragonene: I use one.com
(07:22:56) Notch: ah, there. lunarpages
(07:22:59) C418: 350 kbyteps per user I think
(07:23:01) Dragonene: they're pretty good. Although sort of slow as well
(07:23:04) C418: thats decent enough
(07:23:09) Notch: i need shell access so I can run servers and stuff. =)
(07:23:22) Notch: that's not bad. thanks, C418. =)
(07:23:31) Dragonene: I... don't like electronic music.
(07:23:37) C418: word
(07:23:39) Dragonene: Which is a bit of a problem when trying to listen to your stuff.
(07:23:40) C418: electro sucks
(07:23:41) Dragonene: :)
(07:23:48) Dragonene: Shush C418
(07:23:59) Notch: hehe. I know the feeling, Dragonene. =)
(07:23:59) Dragonene: I like C418's electronic music. Because it's not like electronic music.
(07:24:10) Notch: yes it was. =D brilliant stuff
(07:24:24) Dragonene: Notch: Why haven't you been including your music in your games?
(07:24:36) Dragonene: This is something I've been idly wondering for a while
(07:24:41) C418: because it doesn't fit to minecraft, I'd say
(07:24:44) Notch: Oh yeah, if anyone is still checking out my music, Eirl Rofl Amke is flipping awesome
(07:24:49) Dragonene: I haven't actually heard your music before, but I knew that you made music (because it says on your page)
(07:25:02) Notch: because i don't like to mix the two, strangely.
(07:25:13) Bigger: By electric music you mean dnace music do you dragonene?
(07:25:26) C418: if I'd have the ability to make games decently, I'd try to make music games
(07:25:27) Notch: games for me is about doing something the player will enjoy. making music is me trying to invoke a mood. Usually.
(07:25:28) Bigger: dance, even
(07:25:40) Dragonene: No, I actually meant electronic music in general. Although of course it's a generalization and not entirely true.
(07:25:55) Dragonene: There's electronic music I enjoy, particularly the kind that doesn't at all sound like it was electronic.
(07:25:56) C418: electronic music is too big to dislike it completely
(07:25:56) Dragonene: :)
(07:26:03) Notch: i wonder what kind of music WOULD fit minecraft..
(07:26:17) C418: don't make another amen song
(07:26:22) Succendo: Oh hey
(07:26:24) Bigger: Notch; harsh noise
(07:26:26) Succendo: You did L4KD

(07:26:32) Succendo: I love that game LD
(07:26:33) Notch: lol amen
(07:26:35) Succendo is now known as Dragonmaw
(07:26:36) C418: it doesn't fit
(07:26:38) Notch: Bigger: Spine? Yes
(07:26:40) #tigirc: mode (+o Dragonmaw) by ChanServ
(07:26:47) Dragonene: Heh, electronic music usually invokes the mood "ouch, my head" for me
(07:27:02) C418: fucking math heads
(07:27:03) Dragonene: Notch: did you see the bigdownload news on the 4k contest?
(07:27:08) Dragonene: that was Dragonmaw there writing
(07:27:11) Bigger: I was thinking more Hijokaidan quality
(07:27:11) Notch: no? =D
(07:27:15) C418: well, 4k is not a big download

(07:28:16) Bigger: hehe
(07:28:43) Notch: I'd love to experience that live. Just seeing it on youtube is a bit.. spock-inducing.
(07:28:46) Notch: Fascinating.
(07:28:52) ***Notch raises eyebrow
(07:29:07) Bigger: noise acts would be intense live
(07:29:12) Cait|Asleep is now known as Cait
(07:29:17) Dragonene: "Spock-inducing"?
(07:29:20) Dragonene: That's a new phrase.

(07:30:05) Bigger: Hello SimonTheDigger
(07:30:08) Dragonene: but "Nya Perspectives" is mixed swedish and english
(07:30:10) Dragonene: strange name
(07:30:21) Bigger: strange name for strange music
(07:30:22) SimonTheDigger: are you sure it doesn't involve catgirls
(07:30:32) Dragonene: Nya = New
(07:30:34) Dragonene: in swedish.
(07:30:39) Bigger: SimonTheDigger; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCKW5wkNVvM I doubt it
(07:30:45) Dragonene: new in plural, specifically
(07:30:53) Dragonene: Ny is new in singular.
(07:31:34) Bigger: new in plural form?
(07:31:38) Dragonene: yes
(07:31:42) Dragonene: as in "new cars"
(07:31:44) Dragonene: "nya bilar"
(07:31:46) Bigger: ah
(07:31:49) Sos [Sos@err64.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl] entered the room.
(07:32:04) Bigger: I was thinking more "news car" and wondering what the hell it meant
(07:32:13) Dragonene: heh no :P
(07:32:31) Dragonene: adjectives are adapted to singular or plural in swedish.
(07:32:51) Dragonene: usually just by adding an a
(07:32:52) SimonTheDigger: man
(07:32:54) Dragonene: although not always.
(07:33:01) SimonTheDigger: buying Symphony of the Night on XBOX Live Arcade was a good decision.
(07:33:39) Dragonene: Notch: Gott & Blandat or Vienetta?
(07:33:49) Notch: gott & blandat!
(07:33:53) Dragonene: hmm
(07:33:57) Dragonene: hmmm
(07:33:59) Dragonene: It is indeed good
(07:34:05) Dragonene: But I only have one bag.
(07:34:13) Dragonene: I can get new vienetta while I'm here.
(07:34:34) Dragonene: ...I guess I should wait with getting either until after I do my pushups
(07:34:39) pyl: gott & blandat would be better if it had more gott and less blandat
(07:34:44) Dragonene: agreed
(07:34:45) pyl: less licorice
(07:34:48) Dragonene: licorice is meh
(07:34:59) Dragonene: notch once made a game called licorice.
(07:35:01) Dragonene: Well, almost...
(07:35:07) Dragonmaw: Lick Yo Rice
(07:35:10) Notch: haha, l4krits
(07:35:25) Dragonene: Somewhat buggy but still great.

(07:35:58) Dragonene: Oh damn
(07:36:00) Bigger: hey Dragonmaw
(07:36:02) Dragonene: I want to make 4k games <3
(07:36:07) Dragonene: Why isn't it December yet?
(07:36:15) kevglass: 4k demo contest coming
(07:36:22) Dragonene: True enough
(07:36:27) Dragonene: But I doubt I can make anything interesting
(07:36:32) kevglass: tsk
(07:36:36) kevglass: you always do
(07:36:47) Dragonene: Well see, I don't know how those fancy formulas work! :P
(07:36:47) Movius: I just got Postal 2 from gog.com
(07:36:50) Movius: manual is hilarious
(07:36:54) Movius: recommended keys
(07:37:09) Movius: forward -z
(07:37:11) Movius: backward v
(07:37:30) Dragonene: huh
(07:38:08) Fraeon: Moin
(07:38:15) Fraeon: Meine geilen Aschenbr?deln
(07:38:35) Dragonene: I just realized something
(07:38:44) Dragonene: In the future, Mass Effect will be "retro"
(07:38:50) Notch: haha
(07:38:50) Dragonene: Rather horrifying, innit?
(07:39:06) kevglass: not sure about that you know :)
(07:39:14) kevglass: is magic carpet retro?
(07:39:21) Dragonene: Isn't it?
(07:39:22) Notch: Movius: I LIKED postal 2. It was so over the top, it started being so silly that it was over the top again
(07:39:27) kevglass: not when you look at it
(07:39:36) Notch: people look at me like I'm strange when I say that
(07:39:39) Movius: hehe
(07:39:42) Dragonene: I haven't actually played magic carpet.
(07:39:44) Notch: "You liked peeing on burning people?"
(07:39:46) Notch: ".. yes"
(07:40:04) Dragonene: I have postal 1 in a box somewhere
(07:40:13) Dragonene: It's another game entirely
(07:40:19) FinDude [chatzilla@a81-197-97-250.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(07:40:26) Dragonene: I seem to recall postal 1 having some actual gameplay merits, but being very hard
(07:40:27) Notch: i never played it. It's isometric, right?
(07:40:31) Fraeon: 50 years ago someone speculated that computers might weigh less than 1 ton
(07:40:32) Dragonene: But that might just be my memory failing me
(07:40:35) Dragonene: Yeah, I think it is?
(07:40:35) PiratePoo: Aaah yea, I have it too
(07:40:38) Dragonene: It's top-down anyway
(07:40:45) Dragonene: Hi there PiratePoo
(07:40:53) PiratePoo: Hiya Dragonene
(07:40:58) FinDude: hai
(07:41:00) kevglass: isometric
(07:41:01) FinDude: lolwater
(07:41:10) PiratePoo: And the guy you played as was quiet insane
(07:41:26) PiratePoo: *quite
(07:41:37) Dragonene: ...well, yes
(07:41:39) Dragonene: It's postal.
(07:41:57) Dragonene: He's supposed to have "gone postal"
(07:42:25) PiratePoo: Well yea, but Postal guy didn't really feel like he went "Postal" in the next game
(07:42:25) Dragonene: There's a postal movie, by the way. By Uwe Boll, no less
(07:42:31) Dragonene: I'm sure it's utterly crap.
(07:42:41) PiratePoo: I've seen it
(07:42:46) Dragonene: Was it bad?
(07:42:54) PiratePoo: I've seen worse
(07:43:00) Dragonene: Fair enough
(07:43:05) Dragonene: There's some pretty bad movies out there.
(07:43:06) PiratePoo: And some things managed to make me chuckle
(07:43:22) Dragonene: I've only seen the trailer
(07:43:28) Dragonene: Which was... uh, odd.
(07:43:39) Dragonene: and didn't seem even remotely related to postal
(07:44:14) Terry [chatzilla@86-45-213-203-dynamic.b-ras2.mvw.galway.eircom.net] entered the room.
(07:44:24) Dragonene: Why hello Terry
(07:44:36) Terry: heya :)
(07:45:51) Dragonene: kevglass: That photo of yours
(07:45:54) mewse: Heyas
(07:46:01) Dragonene: I have a feeling it might be worth playing around some more with levels in it.
(07:47:53) Dragonene: Also, I don't know what the original was like, but if you have some space available, I'd crop it differently.
(07:49:48) Farbs|GnomeFarming left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(07:50:25) mewse: Headache.  :(
(07:50:58) jeb: hey Terry
(07:51:10) Terry: hey
(07:51:16) jeb: thank you for Don't Look Back
(07:51:28) jeb: that game made my day great
(07:51:31) SimonTheDigger: Hello Terry.
(07:51:34) jeb: the day i played it
(07:52:32) kevglass: actually Dragonene
(07:52:39) kevglass: funny you should mention that photo
(07:52:46) kevglass: I too the original last, cropped it differently
(07:53:01) kevglass: to give a bit more sky and less at the bottom, then order a canvas print for wall
(07:53:07) kevglass: 35"x15"
(07:54:31) C418: <Dragonene>Was it bad? < not everything about the movie was bad I thought
(07:54:36) C418: at least I had a few laughs
(07:54:36) Terry: heh, cheers jeb
(07:54:37) C418: maybe three
(07:55:51) kevglass: if you were presented with the options "open", "search for traps", "leave" when being questions about a chest
(07:55:56) Dragonene: kevglass: Oh, col.
(07:55:58) kevglass: what would be the difference between the first two?
(07:56:00) Dragonene: cool*
(07:56:40) slv left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(08:01:37) Dragonene: kevglass: I PM'd you in #lwjgl
(08:01:46) Dragonene: well, on freenode, that is

(08:05:09) Stargoat: fffffffff
(08:05:26) Stargoat: taking a town, the last couple of guys are hiding in one of the houses
(08:05:35) Stargoat: I approach, one sees me, gets the interrupt
(08:05:40) Stargoat: boom, down goes my medic
(08:05:42) Stargoat: stupid game
(08:06:24) lemre [lemmer@ip68-228-223-17.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(08:07:06) Dragonene: Sounds like X-Com to me!
(08:07:07) Dragonene: :D
(08:09:04) Stargoat: JA2
(08:09:20) Stargoat: but you already knew that
(08:09:26) Dragonene: yeah.
(08:09:38) Dragonene: I did indeed!
(08:10:19) Ina left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:13:15) Farbs|GnomeFarming [chatzilla@123.200.216.48] entered the room.
(08:13:18) Siiseli: bleh I feel like traveling
(08:13:22) Siiseli: I feel like traveling alot
(08:13:38) Siiseli: but when you're 16 there's not much you can do even if you did have the money
(08:13:42) Siiseli: I could travel in finland
(08:13:45) Siiseli: but no point in that
(08:13:46) Bigger: I am playing viola
(08:13:47) Siiseli: a boring country as fuck
(08:13:54) Bigger: and I have realised that I hate it
(08:14:09) Dragonene: Siiseli: What
(08:14:28) Dragonene: Are you not allowed to go abroad at 16?
(08:14:41) Bigger: and my teacher asked me to do more than just play the notes on the page, actually play with feeling. but i don't feel anything when playing classical music
(08:14:45) Dragonene: What sort of a weird system is that
(08:16:30) Siiseli: Dragonene, I think I might but I think I'm going to need to get some kind of ugh.. permission papers from my parents
(08:16:39) Dragonene: okay
(08:16:52) Siiseli: and when you're 16 traveling alone can be a bit dangerous, or something
(08:16:56) Dragonene: I really want to do the opposite of travelling right now
(08:17:00) Dragonene: I want to go home
(08:17:02) Dragonene: :)
(08:17:13) Siiseli: I sure could travel with my parents but that sucks
(08:17:25) Dragonene: That's a shame then :S
(08:17:30) Dragonene: I rather like travelling with my parents.
(08:17:37) Dragonene: They're great people to be around. :)
(08:18:11) kevglass: damn you and your happy family :)
(08:18:28) Siiseli: my parents are awful to travel with
(08:18:29) ***kevglass rather put a nail in his foot than travel with his parents.
(08:18:44) C418: I don't really like travelling with parents
(08:18:48) Siiseli: they stress out about everything want to go to the worse tourist spots and want to go exactly where everyone else does
(08:19:28) Siiseli: also they tend to always be in a hurry
(08:19:29) Siiseli: and I must do exactly what they want to do, I can't just chill out and relax
(08:19:29) Siiseli: I must see and experience everything and do this and that becouse relaxing isn't fun at all
(08:19:35) Stargoat: wow, hitlers must die looks very cool.
(08:20:19) Evil-Ville: Yes it does
(08:21:07) Evil-Ville: Siiseli sounds like your parents are stereotypical tourists
(08:21:15) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, that they are
(08:21:25) Siiseli: which is exactly why traveling with them sucks
(08:21:45) Evil-Ville: Also what makes you think you can't travel outside Finland when you're 16
(08:22:13) lansing: hm, trying to find a game I played once, dos, first person, late 80s / early 90s, d&d style, polygon filled graphics, similar to Bob's Dragon Hunt, any ideas?
(08:22:32) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, I'm not really sure I'm just saying I've got this mental image of needing some papers that indicate my parents let me travel as I'm under 16
(08:23:16) Evil-Ville: Sounds like nonsense to me
(08:23:23) Siiseli: it very well could be
(08:23:51) Dragonene: No idea lansing, sorry
(08:24:14) Dragonene: when you say dnd, dos and first person I instantly think might & magic :)
(08:25:28) mewse: lansing:  Not Ultima Underworld?
(08:26:14) mewse: (Ultima Underworld footage, for reference:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuTbxkaZ94 )
(08:26:30) mewse: That would be around 1992.
(08:27:05) Notch: and how good it was
(08:27:13) Evil-Ville: Siiseli what's wrong with traveling in Finland
(08:27:15) Notch: the sequel was great too. =D
(08:27:21) Evil-Ville: It's probably a lot more varied than you think
(08:27:50) Siiseli: I'm looking for this game.. I think it was on the nes.. It was this platformer with this dude dressed in red and he had like this moustache and uh.. There were lots of pipes and mushrooms and turtles..
(08:28:03) Notch: Siiseli: Great Giana Sisters?
(08:28:07) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, could be but I just can't think of anywhere I'd like to travel in finland
(08:28:11) Siiseli: Notch, yeah that's it!
(08:28:26) lansing: mewse, no, graphics were a lot simpler, just composed of solid, simple polygon shapes to make up how mobs looked
(08:29:00) mewse: Hm..  solid, simple polygon shapes would be earlier, then..
(08:29:10) Wr4ThR4v3n: http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2009/05/15/Super-rats-evolve-in-Britain/UPI-95181242406599/
(08:29:29) Notch: (Great Giana Sisters footage, for reference:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwYLX_2fJK0 )
(08:29:50) C418: I actually like giana sisters ds
(08:29:59) Siiseli: yeah I know giana sisters :D
(08:30:01) C418: it's a nice casual version of it
(08:30:07) Notch: i was just being silly. :D
(08:30:07) Siiseli: all I know about it is it was a mario ripoff
(08:30:11) Wr4ThR4v3n: I haven't really heard any good cover of videogame music
(08:30:27) Wr4ThR4v3n: everyone just adds a bunch of fluffy new instrument or techon 
(08:30:29) Siiseli: Wr4ThR4v3n, me neither I think
(08:30:31) Wr4ThR4v3n: techno
(08:30:44) C418: people love chris hülsbeck, I can't really understand it
(08:30:51) C418: maybe because he does trance-like music
(08:30:54) Sos` [Sos@esh31.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl] entered the room.
(08:30:54) C418: not my section
(08:30:56) Wr4ThR4v3n: I love the giana sisters intro tune
(08:30:58) Siiseli: but why in the love of god do you replace some of your letters with numbers
(08:30:58) Wr4ThR4v3n: it's epic
(08:31:02) Bigger: video game music remixes
(08:31:03) Siiseli: please don't :C
(08:31:04) Bigger: hmmmmmm
(08:31:06) Siiseli: Wr4ThR4v3n, so do 
(08:31:07) Siiseli: I
(08:31:12) Wr4ThR4v3n is now known as Arne
(08:31:17) Siiseli: oh
(08:31:18) Siiseli: I seee
(08:31:21) Notch: I've heard good covers
(08:31:34) Bigger: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovU4q2OwMn4
(08:32:02) KareemK: machinae supremacy cover
(08:32:24) Terry left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(08:32:24) Arne: videogame music covers reminds me of crappy 16 bit graphical revamps to 8bit games
(08:32:25) Dragonene: Arne: You clearly haven't been to Play!, then
(08:32:27) Sos left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:32:44) Arne: you know hte kind where they change the deisgn to shit and throw in dirty gradients
(08:32:55) Arne: just to use more colors... beause they have them
(08:32:56) Notch: I can't find the one I'm thinking of. :-(
(08:32:57) Dragonene: Also, what's the name of that guy who writes the elder scrolls music
(08:32:58) Bigger: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YoSJNryA7E&feature=related remix of a video game song remixed into a song about mahjong
(08:33:04) Dragonene: and pretty much every other game's music
(08:33:05) Notch: it's a great glitch cover of the mario theme
(08:33:06) kevglass: is there a place on tigsource forums for hiring people?
(08:34:01) Dragonene: jeremy soule.
(08:34:30) C418: ew ew we
(08:34:35) Siiseli: kevglass, the collaboration-thread I think
(08:34:41) nyarla: lansing: Moraff's Revenge or something like that by any chance? there were lots of Moraffs games, at least one of them was first person w/ polygon graphics
(08:34:48) nyarla: i think
(08:34:55) Dragonene: here Arne
(08:34:56) Dragonene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnwwkr-k2LA
(08:35:08) Dragonene: It's Jeremy Soule covering Uematsu's Final Fantasy VI music
(08:35:33) Arne: I was referring to chiptunes
(08:35:42) Arne: not 16bit game stuff
(08:35:47) Dragonene: meh
(08:36:00) Arne: I like terra's theme from ff6 though
(08:36:11) Dragonene: "<Wr4ThR4v3n> I haven't really heard any good cover of videogame music"
(08:36:19) Dragonene: Yeah, terra's theme is great
(08:36:25) Dragonene: and I like soule's version of it
(08:36:27) Dragonene: it works well.
(08:36:58) Stargoat: kareemk: Stop talking, and start beating up the dominion
(08:37:07) Arne: the original is much better
(08:37:15) Arne: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joRZL671Esk
(08:37:26) Dragonene: Arne: Yeah, I prefer the original too
(08:37:31) Dragonene: But I like both versions
(08:37:54) Arne: I think it's more to the point
(08:38:01) Arne: the cover is just instrument masturbation
(08:38:09) Arne: like most covers are
(08:38:39) Arne: there's something appealing about lofi music
(08:38:46) Arne: and graphics
(08:38:47) Bigger: I have heard a cover of this song
(08:38:51) Bigger: not a cover a remix
(08:38:54) Bigger: let me remember where from
(08:39:01) Arne: making the most out of a small set of something
(08:39:17) C418: http://senduit.com/578032
(08:39:19) C418: here
(08:39:28) C418: a decent remix for giana sisters
(08:39:52) C418: you can play this with winamp
(08:39:57) C418: I think foobar can do this too
(08:40:12) Notch: hey, an xm file! =D
(08:40:32) C418: not from me, mind you
(08:41:10) Rosetta left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:41:21) Arne: anyways, naturally I'm not talking about covers of contemporary videogame music, I was talking about... bridging a generational gap while not losing the feel of the original
(08:41:39) Arne: I haven't hear music which have done that, or seen graphics
(08:41:47) Arne: Heard.
(08:41:53) Notch: haha http://s10.directupload.net/images/user/090519/ob3laugm.jpg
(08:42:04) Arne: hehe
(08:42:15) Bigger: I don't see how you could bridge the generational gap without losing the feel of the original, as a lot of the feel is because of the limited sounds
(08:42:16) C418: ah. dwarf fortress fanart
(08:42:59) SimonTheDigger: Dorf Fort
(08:43:04) Fraeon left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(08:43:12) Bigger: agh i can't find the song, it's driving me mad
(08:43:18) Arne: techno shit 30s in aside, I kinda like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ptVf0dQ18M
(08:43:52) Stargoat: Dorf Dorf
(08:44:32) Stargoat: GX is a fine game.
(08:44:54) Dragonene: no way
(08:44:54) Evil-Ville: Notch I don't understand what you mean with waterfall block (in the blog)
(08:45:08) Dragonene: this pushup program says I'm supposed to do 22+30+20+20+28 pushups today
(08:45:12) Dragonene: That's like... a lot
(08:45:28) Stargoat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWeYuOqE_I&feature=related <-- Dr.Stewart is a dirty raver
(08:45:49) Notch: Evil-Ville: When water spreads, it spreads as far down as it can immediately. If this is more than, say, two tiles, I could turn it into "Waterfall" instead of "Water"
(08:45:54) Dragonene: okay, be back in 10 minutes or so (after pushups)
(08:45:57) Notch: Waterfall tiles would never spread sideways, only down
(08:46:14) Notch: and if the area above them becomes empty, they go away
(08:46:37) Rosetta [Rosetta@78.145.62.158] entered the room.
(08:47:04) Bigger: ah, found the song
(08:47:08) Bigger: I can rest in peace finally
(08:47:23) Dragonene: It was nice knowing you
(08:47:27) Dragonene: See you in the afterlife.
(08:47:30) Dragonene: Not that I believe in one.
(08:47:35) Dragonene: *poof, gone*
(08:47:45) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(08:47:52) Evil-Ville: How would that help with the infinite water? Maybe I am just too stupid
(08:49:18) Evil-Ville: Or is that to fix the 1x1x1 water blocks from wobbling around?
(08:49:48) Notch: if you've got water five tiles up and dig to the edge so it reaches it
(08:49:52) Notch: it won't keep spreading once it notices that the drop is five tiles, but rather it'd turn into columns of "waterfall" that block the water from spreading past it
(08:49:56) C418: aah, I love lafraise
(08:50:04) C418: my new shirts are of awesome quality
(08:50:08) Notch: and the waterfall only goes down to the water, but doesn't spread unless it hits ground
(08:50:47) Evil-Ville: Oh I get why you'd do that now
(08:50:50) C418: water in minecraft? incredible
(08:51:29) C418: it's like a new toy
(08:51:30) C418: :D
(08:51:49) Drakkar: it will be great
(08:51:51) Notch: it's a bit slow, but it at least WORKS.
(08:52:00) Drakkar: yay waterparks
(08:52:08) C418: oh yeah, I can't play minecraft in chrome that well by the way
(08:52:08) Notch: and with some tweaks, I got it to run at 50 fps on my Eee, but the draw distance really suffered
(08:52:18) C418: but I think it has to do with the fact that chrome hates minecraft
(08:52:22) C418: firefox is all fine
(08:52:27) C418: er
(08:52:28) C418: also
(08:52:31) C418: chrome hates java
(08:52:32) C418: :D
(08:52:35) Arne: are you gonna put animals in at some point? Like cows (grazing), birds, bats (in cave roofs, preferring to be under tiles), spiders (making webs)
(08:52:39) Arne: questionmark
(08:52:58) C418: 8 bit noby boy?
(08:52:58) Notch: et tu, chrome? :-(
(08:53:23) Arne: Or maybe Shalraths walking around shooting vore mines or whatever
(08:53:27) Notch: Arne: Yes, there will be (blocky) animals. I want sheep that you can shear
(08:53:29) Arne: yes! Quake 1
(08:53:35) Notch: they'd get a much thinner model after shearing
(08:53:40) Arne: I must masturbate to quake 1 pics now
(08:53:42) C418: well, it works in google chrome, but it ocasionally just hangs
(08:53:47) Evil-Ville: I think you're worrying about it running on slow computers too much but maybe I am biased
(08:53:51) Arne: I'm kinda glad they haven't made a sequel
(08:53:57) Arne: they'd shit things up
(08:54:14) C418: arne comedy
(08:54:36) Notch: Evil-Ville: Perhaps. But I'd rather have too many fps now than too few. The more fps I have now, the more cpu I can use later on for cool features
(08:54:43) Stargoat: man. I really want a new F-Zero.
(08:55:07) C418: I'm actually really amazed how much mobs I can spawn without the game going real slow
(08:55:10) C418: except on chrome
(08:55:15) C418: it made my windows crash
(08:55:16) Farbs|GnomeFarming: I've lost count. Are they at Quake 5 now?
(08:55:29) Evil-Ville: I spawned a few thousand and got it down to 30 fps
(08:55:55) C418: a few thousands sounds about right
(08:55:59) Notch: C418: The physics are veeeery fast. =D AABB's for the win
(08:56:09) C418: it's like the dead rising of 8 bit games
(08:56:26) Evil-Ville: Farbs|GnomeFarming latest one is Quake 4 I think
(08:56:28) Stargoat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSiot2xxoYo&feature=related <-- I love the music of this stage (Armada, Starfox)
(08:56:39) Stargoat: best level in the game, too.
(08:56:45) Stargoat: had a really "epic" feel to it.
(08:57:28) Evil-Ville: But Quake 1 will always be the best Quake. It doesn't have ugly super orange graphics like Quake 2
(08:57:37) Dragonene: Big Blue in F-Zero has the best video game music.
(08:58:15) Stargoat: I think you'll find the bramble stages of Donkey kong Country 2 have the best music.
(08:58:16) Arne: http://androidarts.com/misc/shambler_encasement_sex.jpg
(08:58:29) C418: disturbing
(08:58:29) Farbs|GnomeFarming: I edited the renderer in Q2 to do additive instead of multiplicative lighting. I thought it looked pretty :)
(08:58:32) Arne: needs to be in Notch's game, so sexy, maybe too sexy
(08:58:46) C418: disturbing.

(08:59:07) Farbs|GnomeFarming: Was an early inspiration for Captain Forever
(08:59:15) Notch: is that an S&M shambler? :-O
(09:00:04) Arne: it was a joke for a thread
(09:00:17) Notch: THERE!! http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00683/

(09:02:15) pyl: nnnot really
(09:02:30) pyl: the original kicks ass, though
(09:02:31) Farbs|GnomeFarming: no really
(09:02:55) C418:  theres this .mid-file of a mario sunshine song that sounds exactly like original. it amazes me everytime
(09:03:01) Stargoat: very cool, Farbs
(09:03:02) C418: http://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/nintendo/gamecube/sms-sandbird.mid
(09:03:27) C418: and the original really sounds like that. I have no idea how that guy got custom sounds into the mid file
(09:04:00) pyl: http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00881/ is better, for instance
(09:05:02) kevglass left the room (quit: Quit: My damn controlling terminal disappeared!).
(09:05:12) Dragonene: C418: you're right
(09:05:14) Farbs|GnomeFarming: C418 - which bits are the custom sounds?
(09:05:18) Dragonene: that really does sound like that SMS track
(09:05:21) Dragonene: I think
(09:05:24) C418: everything except the bd
(09:05:28) Dragonene: it's been a while since I played it
(09:05:39) C418: I listened to this mid file while I was playing it years ago
(09:05:41) C418: it was the same
(09:05:44) Nightro left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(09:05:45) pyl: aren't any custom sounds, the original tune just uses sounds which are close to midi instruments
(09:06:04) C418: I never heard any other midi file using such instruments
(09:06:13) pyl: .. you haven't?
(09:06:14) Dragonene: agh Notch
(09:06:20) Dragonene: minecraft just froze chrome
(09:06:28) Notch: that's not good. Sorry!
(09:06:38) Cascade [EventCasca@173-29-190-202.client.mchsi.com] entered the room.
(09:06:38) Dragonene: you really don't want me to play this game, do you
(09:06:43) Dragonene: no way I dare try it in opera right now :P
(09:06:55) Stargoat: urgh
(09:06:59) Stargoat: all I want from Nintendo
(09:07:01) Stargoat: is a new Starfox
(09:07:03) lansing: mewse, I finally found it
(09:07:05) Stargoat: and a new F-Zero
(09:07:08) Stargoat: then I'll love them again
(09:07:09) lansing: darn, he left
(09:07:12) Dragonene: Notch: It actually froze chrome
(09:07:14) Cascade: Stargoat, it'd just be like Star Fox Command: sucky
(09:07:15) Dragonene: the entire browser
(09:07:20) Dragonene: despite it running tabs in separate processes
(09:07:22) nyarla: lansing: what was it?
(09:07:23) Stargoat: Cascade: Not necessarily!
(09:07:25) Stargoat: but probably :|
(09:07:26) jeb: pyl: i like that blob remix
(09:07:31) Cascade: I know you want a new Starfox 64, we all do, but Nintendo sucks now, they couldn't make it
(09:07:33) Stargoat: maybe I'll make my own Starfox fangame.
(09:07:33) lansing: nyarla, dungeons of the unforgiven
(09:07:40) Stargoat: it'll have hookers and blackjack
(09:07:49) Cascade: A winning combination
(09:07:59) lansing: http://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeons-of-the-unforgiven
(09:08:09) Dragonene: that the one?
(09:08:18) Stargoat: Starfox 64, man what a game.
(09:08:25) nyarla: ah hah. knew it. :)
(09:08:52) Cascade: Guys I made a crummy arcade style game
(09:08:54) pyl: http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR00165/ is pretty good as well
(09:08:55) Cascade: http://cascadeup.com/misc/wave.zip
(09:09:01) lansing: nyarla, I had been trying to figure out which game it was for 10 years on and off
(09:09:04) Cascade: It is worse than chessmine but I want you to play it anyway
(09:09:11) nyarla: ( nyarla) lansing: Moraff's Revenge or something like that by any chance? there were lots of Moraffs games, at least one of them was first person w/ polygon graphics
(09:09:17) nyarla: :P
(09:09:28) nyarla: those were pretty cool games
(09:09:44) lansing: nyarla, ah, I was in a different window chatting in #dosbox on freenode trying to figure it out, must have missed your suggestion
(09:10:11) Dragonene: Notch: why do the shrubs randomly disappear now and then?
(09:10:11) nyarla: :)
(09:10:14) pyl: Cascade: 404?
(09:10:15) lansing: nyarla, my 286 was too slow to play it though, some of the video modes didn't work, the rest rendered at a snails pace
(09:10:27) Notch: they want dirt or grass, and they want sunlight
(09:10:48) Cascade: I'm not getting a 404
(09:10:55) Stargoat: I guess I should add "good 2d metroid" to that list of games Nintendo should make
(09:10:59) nyarla: i think i found the Moraff's games on a shareware compilation CD a few years later, pretty sure i had a 486 at the time
(09:11:04) Stargoat: but I have my doubts about their ability to make anything 2d these days...

(09:22:21) Cascade: Pres z
(09:22:59) Cascade: Basically you keep trying and dying until you can stay alive for more than ten seconds, at which point nothing happens but I would be impressed with you for your resolve in playing and conquering crappy games
(09:23:02) Notch: Hey, that's pretty interesting. I want to be able to go diagonally, though
(09:23:15) Notch: i got 10 seconds once, but I died
(09:23:16) Siiseli: let's see
(09:23:19) Notch: do I need to reach 11?

(09:27:25) Cascade: I bought a cd with like 15000 old demos crammed on it
(09:27:29) Cascade: A long time ago
(09:27:38) Cascade: I love that they did that and called it a product
(09:27:59) pyl: i got one of those for free when i was a kid :o
(09:28:15) Cascade: Windows 98
(09:28:20) Notch: hao-1: How much are you supposed to charge? :-\
(09:28:54) nyarla: i used to buy those Night Owl shareware compilation cds from the US, for my BBS. i had the best file section in town. ^_^
(09:28:57) Cascade: Siiseli has the DNS resolved for you yet
(09:29:19) Siiseli: apparently yes
(09:29:30) C418: what. 450 developers for one fucking game?
(09:29:33) C418: insane
(09:29:39) Cascade: Hooray, don't you just love the blank space and one enemy
(09:29:44) Notch: C418?
(09:29:49) C418: assasins creed 2
(09:29:56) Siiseli: so what' the pointo f the game
(09:30:00) Notch: oh. Didn't GTA4 have something similar to that?
(09:30:06) Cascade: How long can you stay alive
(09:30:08) C418: I have no idea
(09:30:13) hao-1: for games that are over a decade old? probably not $25
(09:30:23) Cascade: Long enough for the enemy spawners to bug out effectively making you immortal?
(09:30:24) Notch: oh, they're that old? :-O
(09:30:27) Notch: holy moly, haha
(09:30:51) Siiseli: well

(09:31:03) Cascade: You've got moves
(09:31:03) Notch: my best is 15. niice
(09:31:11) Siiseli: haha ty :D
(09:31:15) Notch: i kept trying to go diagonally.
(09:31:16) Siiseli: well let's try again
(09:31:39) nyarla: wow, textfiles.com has all those nightowl cds archived. sexy! http://cd.textfiles.com/nightowl/
(09:32:32) Siiseli: 15 seconds on the second try
(09:34:36) Evil-Ville: I got 19 too
(09:35:19) Dragonene: remind me never to play minecraft again
(09:35:33) Dragonene: I'd been building for 20 minutes and it suddenly froze
(09:35:35) Dragonene: :S
(09:35:40) Dragonene: wait no, it runs again
(09:35:43) pyl: Dragonene: never play minecraft again.
(09:35:44) Dragonene: just froze for a while...
(09:35:45) Siiseli: 19 again :D
(09:35:57) Notch: Dragonene: Never play minecraft again.
(09:36:01) Evil-Ville: One of those floaty things just spawned on top of me
(09:36:40) Siiseli: 20!?
(09:36:43) Siiseli: I win Evil-Ville 
(09:37:31) Evil-Ville: The enemies just got stuck in a combo for ten seconds and couldn't do anything to me
(09:38:17) Siiseli: wait WHAT
(09:38:19) Siiseli: I can shoot?
(09:38:41) Siiseli: I just dodged and made them ram into each other to get 20 seconds :D
(09:38:55) Notch: .. there's shooting?
(09:38:58) Evil-Ville: I got 20 too
(09:39:05) Evil-Ville: Oh I didn't know you could shoot either
(09:39:16) Cascade: Doesn't help, apparently
(09:39:31) Evil-Ville: It just makes it harder
(09:39:41) Notch: i thought it was easier to just dodge, haha
(09:40:00) Notch: why no diagonal? :-(
(09:40:05) Cascade: It was originally going to be a multiplayer bomberman type game
(09:40:08) Evil-Ville: I can't even get 10 seconds if I shoot at things
(09:40:22) Siiseli: yeah I got 17 trying to shoot stuff
(09:40:30) Notch: shooting is not productive
(09:40:34) Notch: it just creates more things to avoid

(09:43:33) postlogic: But I installed Diablo 2 through wine last night :(
(09:43:42) postlogic: That was a dumb move.
(09:43:47) shinygerbil: postlogic: that is a very good idea, but i don't think I could handle it. :P
(09:43:56) C418: very dumb
(09:44:03) C418: diablo 2 got me too once
(09:44:23) postlogic: I'm just glad D3 isn't out yet.
(09:44:24) C418: even tho I don't really like it... it took away a whole fucking weekend
(09:44:35) postlogic: C418: But it's so fun
(09:44:37) shinygerbil: also, it would require me to actually install linux and tweak it for hours, which would probably be just as time-consuming as playing games in Windows :/
(09:44:46) postlogic: shinygerbil: I recommend Linux Mint 7 RC1.
(09:44:53) postlogic: Builds on Ubuntu 9.04. No tweaking.
(09:45:00) postlogic: Very polished.
(09:45:10) C418: robot chicken and spore?
(09:45:14) lansing: shinygerbil, if you have a recent pc, installing 8.04 + nvidia drivers, wine mostly works, no tweaking involved
(09:45:16) C418: and this is even official
(09:45:21) C418: http://www.spore.com/wtf
(09:45:23) postlogic: 8.04, lansing?
(09:45:29) shinygerbil: well, by tweaking I mean installing lots of extra pointless software and desktop themes etc
(09:45:36) lansing: postlogic, yes, don't you have pulseaudio problems with 9.04?
(09:45:41) postlogic: lansing: Nope.
(09:45:48) postlogic: I think Linux Mint has fixed it.
(09:45:57) lansing: postlogic, ah, nice of them, it's still broken in ubuntu
(09:46:06) postlogic: They do a lot of their own changes and stuff, but still keep compatibility with the ubuntu repos

(09:46:15) Siiseli: Win'
(09:46:23) Siiseli: oh well
(09:46:27) Siiseli: I grow tired of this game :D
(09:46:36) lansing: postlogic, on Ubuntu it sometimes randomly fails an assertion in a library call, killing Wine
(09:46:36) Siiseli: becouse it doesn't have diagonal movement
(09:46:41) Siiseli: and a smaller player character
(09:46:42) Cascade: I'm impressed that I held your attention as long as I did
(09:46:51) postlogic: lansing: Haven't had the issue at all, actually..
(09:46:51) Siiseli: to allow more elegant manouvering
(09:47:06) lansing: postlogic, ah good then, it causes a lot of people grief :)
(09:47:12) postlogic: Linux Mint! <3
