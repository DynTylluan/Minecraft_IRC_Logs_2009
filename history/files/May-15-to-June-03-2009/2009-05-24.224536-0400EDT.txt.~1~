(01:27:38) Dragonene: Hi tigs, btw
(01:27:42) Super-Dot: Hello
(01:27:52) Super-Dot: Also hi tigs from me
(01:28:09) Dragonene: my tabs list in opera is ridiculously small atm
(01:28:13) Dragonene: only about 40 tabs
(01:28:21) Super-Dot: That's small?
(01:28:25) WrkEcho [1@d75-159-19-240.abhsia.telus.net] entered the room.

(01:28:29) Dragonene: yep.
(01:28:35) Dragonene: No, no
(01:28:45) Dragonene: 70 tabs would be normal-sized
(01:28:49) Super-Dot: ah
(01:29:25) Super-Dot: It's a good thing we live in an age where tabs are available
(01:29:46) Super-Dot: Imagine if the Internet became as awesome as it is when we were still using windows
(01:29:51) Voxl: I've been up to 200 once
(01:30:05) Super-Dot: W-why
(01:30:49) Dragonene: You know, the sad thing is, I think Super Joe seems to be a fairly smart guy.

(01:31:14) Dragonene: Voxl: Wow
(01:31:19) Dragonene: My record is only 120 or 130 or so
(01:31:39) Voxl: Yeah, I just keep tabs open with stuff I want to check out later
(01:31:39) Dragonene: although that's happened on more than one occasion
(01:31:43) Dragonene: Voxl: me too
(01:31:44) Voxl: And then I never check them out
(01:31:48) Dragonene: me too
(01:31:51) mewse: I use bookmarks.
(01:32:02) Dragonene: but every month or so, I decide I have too many tabs open
(01:32:03) Super-Dot: I use Instapaper
(01:32:05) Dragonene: and do a cleanup
(01:32:12) Dragonene: by first doing "save session"
(01:32:21) Dragonene: and then closing lots of tabs
(01:32:25) Dragonene: that's how I just got down to 40 tabs
(01:32:48) Super-Dot: I can usually get down to 0 tabs when I want to
(01:33:12) Dragonene: 20 or so of my tabs are irc tabs
(01:33:16) Dragonene: keep that in mind
(01:33:25) Super-Dot: ah
(01:33:25) Dragonene: actually more like 15
(01:33:30) Dragonene: so I have about 25 browser tabs open
(01:33:31) Dragonene: atm
(01:33:32) Voxl: I would use bookmarks, but I feel they're for pages I'm going to look at repeatedly
(01:33:39) Super-Dot: I have 5 IRC tabs right now, and one of them is a silly one
(01:33:51) Dragonene: Voxl: I don't use bookmarks for that, I use speed dial
(01:33:59) Super-Dot: Instapaper is for pages you look at once
(01:34:03) Dragonene: 16 thumbnails in blank tabs
(01:34:04) Super-Dot: It's quite nice
(01:34:05) Dragonene: magic!
(01:34:34) Super-Dot: Top Sites is Safari's version of Speed Dial
(01:34:43) Super-Dot: It's filled up automatically, which is neat
(01:34:47) Dragonene: Super-Dot: I have two uni-related, one opera-related, tigirc, xkcd, ludumdare, gamedev, webdev, lwjgl, photography, two dota-related, android and flash.
(01:35:01) Dragonene: 14 in total.
(01:35:05) Super-Dot: Uni-related? 
(01:35:11) Dragonene: university
(01:35:15) Super-Dot: Yeah
(01:35:30) lansing: I never visit any bookmarks that aren't on my bookmark toolbar, so they might as well be tabs... die bookmarks, die.
(01:35:33) Super-Dot: Your Uni has a channel, or a club or a class, or what?
(01:35:40) Dragonene: the student union's computer science section
(01:35:43) Z80_ left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(01:35:44) Dragonene: has a couple of irc thingies
(01:35:48) Super-Dot: Ah, neat
(01:35:48) Dragonene: they're not, you know, official
(01:35:49) Snakey: DOTAAAAAH!
(01:35:53) Dragonene: just where we hang out.

(01:36:05) Dragonene: everybody in sweden has to be a member in the student union btw
(01:36:14) Dragonene: otherwise we can't take any exams
(01:36:28) Dragonene: it's the only fee that's compulsory at uni
(01:36:33) Dragonene: it's like 200SEK a year or something
(01:36:39) Dragonene: that's... $30 or smt
(01:36:48) mewse: Dude.  They make you pay to take exams?  What sort of bizarre business model is that?
(01:36:54) Dragonene: mewse: No
(01:37:04) Dragonene: The idea is that they *want* the student to have a say
(01:37:06) Dragonene: and a real one
(01:37:12) mewse: It's like if you had to pay a fee in order to have your income tax audited.
(01:37:13) Dragonene: so by forcing us into union
(01:37:27) Dragonene: students become an important factor in uni politics
(01:37:30) ljnc left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(01:37:40) Super-Dot: Sounds neat
(01:37:45) Dragonene: they don't make you pay to take exams specifically
(01:37:58) Dragonene: they just don't allow non-union members to take any classes
(01:38:09) mewse: (a) university politics don't exist.  And (b) if they did exist, students would already be an important factor in them.  :)
(01:38:10) Dragonene: but the only way they can check that is by checking your student card on exams
(01:38:29) Super-Dot: My IRC channels are #tigIRC, #minecraft, ludumdare, xkcd-signal, and <3thunder
(01:38:40) Dragonene: xkcd-signal?
(01:38:41) Snakey: Dragonene: What is your thoughts on League of Legends?
(01:38:41) Dragonene: what's that
(01:38:47) Dragonene: Snakey: I haven't heard of it
(01:38:52) mewse: xkcd without the noise?
(01:39:01) Super-Dot: It's http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/
(01:39:02) Snakey: It's a Dota remake co-developed by Guinsoo
(01:39:08) Dragonene: Snakey: Oh - that one
(01:39:11) Dragonene: I don't know
(01:39:13) mewse: Oh, unless the '-' is a minus sign, in which case it would only be the noise.
(01:39:19) Dragonene: I haven't really bothered to look at it
(01:39:34) Super-Dot: It's the signal without the noise
(01:39:36) Snakey: It looks a lot like War3 and thus Dota
(01:39:43) ***lansing is reminded to check xkcdsucks.blogspot.com
(01:39:45) Dragonene: Super-Dot: lots of browsers have auto-filling "most visited" sites thingies now, since chrome started that
(01:39:56) Dragonene: but it's basically all just ripoffs of opera's speed dial from opera mini
(01:40:03) Dragonene: I prefer being able to set them yourself tho
(01:40:04) paul|not: I love speed dial
(01:40:07) Dragonene: to having them auto set
(01:40:16) Super-Dot: You can set them yourself as well
(01:40:19) Dragonene: I mean
(01:40:21) Dragonene: Well in opera
(01:40:23) Super-Dot: But by default it autosets them
(01:40:31) Dragonene: you can right click them and set them to a recently visited one
(01:40:40) Dragonene: but I don't do that
(01:40:44) Dragonene: anyway
(01:40:46) Dragonene: it's an opera invention
(01:40:52) Dragonene: and all other browsers are copycats
(01:40:56) Dragonene: I'm not an opera fanboy at all

(01:44:16) Super-Dot: It's fun sometimes

(01:47:04) pyl: :D
(01:47:57) Super-Dot: I like that idea
(01:48:42) Cait|Asleep: Except you'd get people writing basic words, then stringing them together into
(01:48:46) Cait|Asleep: 'sentences'
(01:48:47) Cait|Asleep: like
(01:48:48) Cait|Asleep: this

(01:49:20) pyl: :)
(01:49:47) Super-Dot: that sounds like fun
(01:49:51) Cait|Asleep: So at that point, you might as well allow sentences constructed of previously spoken words.
(01:49:53) Super-Dot: an all-noise channel
(01:49:59) pyl: no
(01:50:02) pyl: i might not!
(01:50:08) pyl: because then there would be less kicking
(01:50:39) pyl: also i refuse to argue with a person who is sleeping
(01:50:49) Super-Dot: I like the idea of deliberately hostile channels, but the problem is that in practice nobody talks in them
(01:50:57) Dragonene: pyl: Your idea doesn't make any sense :)
(01:51:10) pyl: Dragonene: my idea makes sense

(02:19:03) Dragonene: Well yes, but don't you think that my question *why meta-discussion is bad* is a valid question?
(02:19:08) Dragonene: It's perfectly interesting to me
(02:19:10) Stargoat: what are you bitches talking about. What is xkcd-signal :|. I'm assuming a channel, but for what purpose?
(02:19:28) Dragonene: Just because it's not interesting to *everyone* else doesn't make it a bad topic
(02:19:29) Stargoat: talking about talking about the weather is fun
(02:19:30) Super-Dot: It's perfectly interesting to you because that's the first time you've been to -signal
(02:19:40) pekuja: I'm guessing it's an alternative channel to #xkcd, where the signal/noise ratio is supposed to be better?
(02:19:41) Super-Dot: But it comes up all the time
(02:19:42) Dragonene: http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/
(02:19:46) Dragonene: Stargoat.
(02:20:05) Super-Dot: And it's not very interesting the second to fifteenth time
(02:20:26) Dragonene: Super-Dot: So basically, you're saying that the channel restricts newcomers from having opinions?
(02:20:34) Dragonene: I think that's the same thing as having an exclusive club
(02:20:34) WrkEcho left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(02:20:40) Dragonene: in which case the whole purpose is off
(02:20:50) Dragonene: The idea was to have a channel that does *not* have to be an exclusive club
(02:20:54) Super-Dot: No, it restricts newcomers from having opinions about #xkcd-signal
(02:21:00) Dragonene: which is silly.
(02:21:11) Dragonene: also, I don't believe that all topics regarding to #xkcd-signal have been explored
(02:21:20) Super-Dot: Believe me, they have
(02:21:26) Dragonene: Not a chance.
(02:21:42) Dragonene: I'll use the same argument as was used to establish the channel
(02:21:49) Dragonene: there's lots of things that haven't been said.
(02:22:00) Dragonene: That goes for narrow subsets of the topic superset as well
(02:22:03) Dragonene: I'm sure there are improvements that could be made.
(02:22:12) Dragonene: If not, it would be the perfect channel
(02:22:18) Dragonene: and it's clearly not, because I don't like it.
(02:22:29) Dragonene: See, flawless logic.
(02:22:59) Super-Dot: Of course improvements can be made, but generally newcomers think of improvements which have already been shown to be bad ideas
(02:23:00) pyl: well, you honestly like xkcd
(02:23:05) Super-Dot: Through time and experimentatino
(02:23:07) pyl: so your opinion is invalid
(02:23:07) Dragonene: "shown"
(02:23:28) ***lansing eats a pear
(02:23:34) ***BlademasterBobo eats a lansing
(02:23:40) Super-Dot: They've tried it with punctuation not stripped, and it doesn't work
(02:23:45) BlademasterBobo: ?
(02:23:45) Dragonene: Super-Dot: okay, but consider this: removing punctuation serves the exact same purpose as a theoretical "aaaaaaaaaaaa" stemmer, yes?
(02:24:03) ***lansing imagines a lansing to be a bulbus alien vegetable
(02:24:04) Dragonene: and they say in the blog that they don't want to do the latter one, and leave that to ops
(02:24:08) pyl: lansing: is it with one of those hard ones, or is it soft and juicy
(02:24:09) Dragonene: they could do the same thing to punctuation
(02:24:11) Super-Dot: I think aaaaaaaaaaa is interpreted as "aaa" now
(02:24:12) pyl: uh
(02:24:17) lansing: soft and juicy
(02:24:22) pyl: oh man those are so good
(02:24:23) Dragonene: people who overuse it could just be kicked or muted manually.
(02:24:29) Dragonene: Also, > isn't punctuation
(02:24:31) BlademasterBobo: it tastes like tomatos and lime
(02:24:40) Dragonene: Imagine a code scenario
(02:24:51) lansing: BlademasterBobo, with traces of nicotine
(02:24:51) pyl: whenever i'm going to eat a pear and it turns out to be all hard and chewy like an apple i'm so disappointed :/
(02:24:55) Dragonene: x > y and x < y are opposites, it doesn't make sense to regard them as one phrase
(02:25:12) Voxl: Apples are hard and chewy?
(02:25:16) Dragonene: removing punctuation is one thing, but removing all alphanumerical characters doesn't make sense to me.
(02:25:19) Dragonene: which is what I said.
(02:25:20) Super-Dot: Yeah, but people usually speak in long sentences
(02:25:57) pyl: Voxl: compared to a good pear, yes!
(02:25:59) Super-Dot: "x > y" is surrounded by five words on each side, so it's not an issue
(02:26:00) Dragonene: Yeah, well, I don't like the idea that any opinions that I may have are dismissed out of hand just because I'm new to the channel
(02:26:05) BlademasterBobo: dragonene went into a channel and starting NoobImproving?
(02:26:18) BlademasterBobo: and then was angry his improvements were discarded
(02:26:19) Super-Dot: Bobo, yes
(02:26:22) Dragonene: I think it's an elitist way of running things that leads to overly conservative behaviour
(02:26:26) BlademasterBobo: among the millions of other noobprovements
(02:26:39) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: That's one way to put it
(02:26:42) Dragonene: But that's not the thing
(02:26:52) Cthulhu32 [Cthulhu32@c-71-229-171-213.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(02:26:53) Dragonene: I went into a channel, something happened, and I asked "Why?"
(02:27:04) Super-Dot: It's not that your opinions don't matter, it's that most members consider meta-discussion to be boring
(02:27:05) Dragonene: the channel responded by saying "go ask that somewhere else"
(02:27:13) Super-Dot: And most meta-discussions have already been had
(02:27:19) Dragonene: Not being allowed to ask "Why?" is the most fundamentalist thing that can happen
(02:27:21) Cthulhu32: damn racists
(02:27:24) BlademasterBobo: Dragonene, on a channel founded by rules like that
(02:27:27) Dragonene: It's like thought crime
(02:27:31) Dragonene: :P
(02:27:32) BlademasterBobo: they must get asked that question daily
(02:27:40) BlademasterBobo: and it gets tedious to answer it
(02:27:48) BlademasterBobo: you're overreacting.
(02:27:57) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: I don't care. It'd make more sense to write a FAQ about it or just not answer it
(02:28:07) The_Doctor: Mmbow
(02:28:07) Dragonene: than to throw out a generic "We don't like your questions" answer
(02:28:08) Super-Dot: There is an FAQ
(02:28:15) Dragonene: Super-Dot: the FAQ doesn't have anything on that
(02:28:19) Dragonene: I read it before I joined.
(02:28:26) The_Doctor: today's word of the day is malfeasance.
(02:29:08) pyl: no it's not, it's penis
(02:29:12) pyl: just like yesterdaqy
(02:29:33) Dragonene: Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of the channel, I just don't like the elitist "Your question sucks." approach of some of its inhabitants.
(02:29:43) Dragonene: (Not all of them.)
(02:29:48) paul|not: man shut up your question sucks
(02:29:49) BlademasterBobo: you're overreacting
(02:30:05) Cthulhu32: i have no reaction to this situation
(02:30:09) BlademasterBobo: good
(02:30:12) BlademasterBobo: you can go home then
(02:30:12) Super-Dot: It's not that your question sucks, it's that your question leads to a discussion
(02:30:12) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: You keep saying that. :)
(02:30:18) BlademasterBobo: and you keep doing it
(02:30:20) Cthulhu32: haha
(02:30:21) Super-Dot: And the discussion is boring
(02:30:21) Cthulhu32: sweet
(02:30:23) Dragonene: Super-Dot: again, FAQ
(02:30:32) BlademasterBobo: Who cares?!
(02:30:35) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: I obviously don't agree
(02:30:35) BlademasterBobo: go bitch at them
(02:30:38) pyl: Dragonene cares
(02:30:39) pyl: a lot
(02:30:41) pyl: apparently!
(02:30:42) Cthulhu32: I'm more interested in the bee swarms in NYC
(02:30:42) Dragonene: Now who's overreacting bobo :P
(02:30:53) BlademasterBobo: Bee swarms in NYC?
(02:31:01) Super-Dot: Dragonene: There's a whole channel precisely for the sort of question you're asking
(02:31:07) BlademasterBobo: Super-Dot
(02:31:07) Super-Dot: Not using the channel is impolite
(02:31:12) Cthulhu32: http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&id=6828888
(02:31:15) Cthulhu32: insanity
(02:31:24) BlademasterBobo: we are doing a subtle topic shift over to bee swarms
(02:31:29) Super-Dot: Okay
(02:31:32) Cthulhu32: cause I hate bees
(02:31:38) Cthulhu32: and apparently there was a HGUE swarm of them
(02:31:39) Super-Dot: Bees are cool
(02:31:40) lansing: bees, bees the magical fruit
(02:31:40) Dragonene: Super-Dot: ... :D It's that idea I'm opposed to.
(02:31:43) pyl: haha
(02:32:00) pyl: the reason for colony collapse disorder was a huge relief for me
(02:32:09) Dragonene: I need a #meta-meta-discussion
(02:32:12) Voxl: What was the reason?
(02:32:16) Dragonene: Where I can discuss why #meta-discussion is a bad idea.
(02:32:21) Cthulhu32: it was a virus right?
(02:32:24) Super-Dot: There is a #meta-meta-discussion
(02:32:28) Dragonene: Good!
(02:32:29) lansing: colon collapse disorder?
(02:32:34) Cthulhu32: no no thats cause of goatse
(02:32:35) pyl: fungus i thought?
(02:32:40) Cthulhu32: oh yeah funguss
(02:32:43) Dragonene: Super-Dot: Nobody there :(
(02:32:44) Cthulhu32: i knew it was some weird thing
(02:32:52) Cthulhu32: the super bee jock itch
(02:33:21) pyl: at least it's not cell phones or wifi or something
(02:33:22) Super-Dot: Yeah, because after the first few months, most people agreed that #meta-discussion is a good idea
(02:33:42) Cthulhu32: hah yeah that was really far fetched
(02:33:45) Cthulhu32: "cell phones, THE BEE KILLER"
(02:34:01) Dragonene: Super-Dot: Wouldn't you agree that it'd make sense to have this sort of thing in the FAQ though?
(02:34:14) Super-Dot: The emoticon thing?
(02:34:18) pyl: not necessarily so far fetched
(02:34:20) BlademasterBobo: this is obviously a sign of the end of times, cthulhu32
(02:34:22) Dragonene: No
(02:34:29) BlademasterBobo: This is where you make your move
(02:34:30) Dragonene: the removal of all alphanumerical channels
(02:34:31) Dragonene: uh
(02:34:33) BlademasterBobo: DRAGONENE
(02:34:36) Dragonene: all alphanumerical characters
(02:34:37) BlademasterBobo: jeez
(02:34:40) pyl: the em spectrum is quite a bit more exciting than it was 150 years ago
(02:34:44) BlademasterBobo: shut up about it, Super-Dot quit feeding him
(02:34:51) Super-Dot: okay
(02:34:53) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: Why are you so upset about this? I'm just discussing with Super-Dot
(02:35:01) Dragonene: I can switch to PMs if you prefer that.
(02:35:02) Dragonene: :P
(02:35:05) BlademasterBobo: sigh
(02:35:06) Dragonene: Calm down already
(02:35:09) Cthulhu32: I don't think animals are sensitive to those frequencies?
(02:35:17) BlademasterBobo: quit doing that
(02:35:19) Cthulhu32: although animals can tell like earthquakes and crap
(02:35:30) Cthulhu32: all I want is my microcontrolled beetle and I'm happy
(02:35:32) Stargoat: I like to talk about talking about talking about the weather.
(02:35:37) Voxl: Use orgone to take down the evil cell towers!
(02:35:44) Cthulhu32: I heard you like talking so I put some talking in your talking
(02:35:54) BlademasterBobo: groooan
(02:35:57) pyl: Cthulhu32: i don't HOPE they are, but i wouldn't assume it to be impossible :)
(02:36:07) Stargoat: bobo, what's up? You sound stressed.
(02:36:16) Cthulhu32: :D
(02:36:20) The_Doctor: Hallo
(02:36:20) Cthulhu32: bobo needs a massage
(02:36:25) Cthulhu32: hey doctor
(02:36:25) Stargoat: 'sup cthulhu
(02:36:27) BlademasterBobo: Dragonene is being stupid and he won't stop
(02:36:29) Cthulhu32: word star
(02:36:31) pyl: a very erotic massage
(02:36:36) BlademasterBobo: he's obviously wrong but nothing brings him to his senses
(02:36:49) Cthulhu32: doctor: I listened to the NES songs, I might PM you about that in a couple weeks about using one in my physics demo if you have the nsf :D
(02:36:57) BlademasterBobo: Dragonene the last argument used by any troll is always "You're destroying freedom of speech! THIS IS UNFAIR"
(02:36:58) Stargoat: pyl, everything you say is magma being poured into my ears. Just shut up, okay?
(02:37:05) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: Don't go there
(02:37:06) pyl: Stargoat: make me!
(02:37:09) BlademasterBobo: I just did
(02:37:11) Dragonene: You don't have half of this discussion to go by
(02:37:14) The_Doctor: I have tons of NSFs, and I'd like to make more, so I'll see what I did.
(02:37:17) BlademasterBobo: u_u
(02:37:18) The_Doctor: er
(02:37:19) Dragonene: You're the one trolling, not me.
(02:37:28) BlademasterBobo: Sure thing
(02:37:28) Cthulhu32: awesome, did you see my simple physics demo so far?
(02:37:34) Voxl: Stargoat: How are words from the screen going into your ears?
(02:37:37) The_Doctor: Not yet, I was a little busy.
(02:37:44) The_Doctor: Link meh?
(02:37:47) Cthulhu32: no problem, http://cthulhu32.kraln.com/nesdev/physics.0.1.nes I think
(02:37:49) pyl: text-to-speech
(02:37:50) Cthulhu32: lemme double check that works
(02:37:54) Stargoat: Voxl: Wouldn't you like to know.
(02:38:02) Voxl: Yes, I would
(02:38:08) Stargoat: oh.
(02:38:19) pyl: years ago when the microsoft agent stuff first came out i hooked it up to an irc channel
(02:38:21) Stargoat: well, maybe I have one of those text-to-speech programs.
(02:38:33) pyl: had the different agents act out actions and text-to-speech what each person said
(02:38:41) BlademasterBobo: oh
(02:38:42) Cthulhu32: oh noz did my kraln link go down
(02:38:42) BlademasterBobo: The_Doctor
(02:38:43) pyl: was annoying as all hell
(02:38:43) BlademasterBobo: [21:54] Jr: if you see George tell him I should get ops
(02:38:51) The_Doctor: Haha, I was here.
(02:38:52) Cthulhu32: crap kraln's isp must have broke
(02:39:00) BlademasterBobo: haha
(02:39:02) BlademasterBobo: k
(02:39:03) The_Doctor: I'm yaegashi, remember?
(02:39:13) BlademasterBobo: yes, but I wasn't really paying attention
(02:39:24) The_Doctor: I don't think that link worked, Cthulhu32
(02:39:29) Cthulhu32: nope, my server is down
(02:39:31) Cthulhu32: rapidshare?
(02:39:45) BlademasterBobo: dropbox
(02:39:45) The_Doctor: Sure.
(02:39:46) BlademasterBobo: :O
(02:39:55) The_Doctor: Or AIM transfer if you want
(02:41:25) Cthulhu32: yeah gotta find it, PM me your aim name
(02:41:31) The_Doctor: AtrusRand
(02:41:34) Cthulhu32: k
(02:43:01) Dragonene: In the future, Bobo will not hate me anymore.
(02:43:48) Cthulhu32: cool found it
(02:44:11) pyl: Dragonene: shutting up about it would probably facilitate that outcome, you know

(04:48:06) ***mewse considers writing a game.
(04:48:27) Dragonene: Shouldn't you be working on MMOMMO?
(04:48:40) ***mewse considers writing a tiny game which would be mentioned on the frontpage of all the indie blogs and suchlike.
(04:48:44) mewse: Yeah, should be and am.
(04:48:53) Dragonene: Ooh
(04:48:57) Dragonene: A tiny omnipresent game
(04:49:02) Dragonene: Those are nice.
(04:49:11) Dragonene: I find they're not as easy to make as one would hope though
(04:49:29) Dragonene: My record is being mentioned on the indiegames.com blog, and that's happened twice.
(04:49:40) mewse: This one is.  It's a reductio ad absurdum game.
(04:50:19) mewse: Could probably write it in an hour.  Might take a day if I wanted to implement an online leaderboard.
(04:50:29) mewse: Wouldn't make the blogs without the leaderboard, so I should do that, I guess.
(04:52:17) Dragonene: How do you know the blogs would pick it up?
(04:52:18) Dragonene: :)
(04:52:28) mewse: Because it's the Most Awesome Thing Ever.
(04:52:29) Dragonene: If there's a magical trick to it, I'd like to learn it :D
(04:52:41) Dragonene: Ah
(04:52:43) Dragonene: But be careful
(04:53:12) Dragonene: If it's the MATE (great abbrevation, btw), it'll make MMOMMO look worse in comparison
(04:53:16) mewse: Even more awesome than the MK "censor over-the-top violence" switch on the back of the arcade cabinets that wasn't actually wired up to anything and nobody noticed.  :)
(04:53:35) Dragonene: great acronym I should say
(04:53:37) Dragonene: not abbreviation
(04:53:47) Dragonene: in sweden we use the same word for both
(04:53:53) Dragonene: So I rarely make the correct distinction
(04:54:00) Pepe left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(04:54:25) mewse: I call it "The Space Bar Game".
(04:54:26) Dragonene: That was weird
(04:54:29) mewse: It haunts me.
(04:54:31) Dragonene: My vision just blurred for a while
(04:54:36) Dragonene: As in
(04:54:42) Dragonene: Not in any way I've ever experienced before
(04:54:49) Dragonene: It was like somebody had applied a gaussian filter
(04:54:53) mewse: Tired?  Overworked?
(04:54:58) mewse: Stressed?
(04:55:00) Dragonene: It didn't just go out of focus, it actually blurred
(04:55:01) lansing: low blood pressure?
(04:55:07) lansing: lie down for a minute
(04:55:26) Dragonene: Nah... it passed pretty fast
(04:55:31) mewse: Yeah, I vote for lie down for a minute.
(04:55:34) Dragonene: But maybe I should prepare some dinner.
(04:55:39) Dragonene: I could use some food.
(04:56:18) Dragonene: I have some leftover tacostuffs from yesterday.
(04:56:22) smn`offline is now known as smn

(05:10:29) haowan: but people were speculating as to whether it was me :D

(05:10:38) lansing: an imposter?
(05:10:47) haowan: nope, his name really is the same as mine
(05:10:48) mewse: I mean, except when I was out.
(05:10:54) haowan: he wasn't pretending to be me :D
(05:11:38) haowan: yeah this was 5 hours ago mewse

(05:16:57) lansing: hmm, modern warefare 2 looks like more of the same log ride that cod4 was
(05:17:26) mewse: I've always thought of them more as Pirates of the Caribbean.  (the ride, not the movies)
(05:17:54) mewse: So, like, boats on invisible rails under the water level, rather than obvious channels.
(05:20:56) lansing: yeah, I don't know, maybe it's improved, I just don't like the feeling of being pushed and pulled everywhere
(05:21:47) ***mewse pushes lansing, when he's not looking.

(05:22:46) Snakey: mewse: I'm not sure if you can bundle call lists into call lists mewse?

(05:23:05) mewse: Hm.. I think you can, but that's not what I had in mind.
(05:23:29) Snakey: Aren't you already using VBO's and stuff tho?
(05:23:31) mewse: There's a function call 'glCallLists()' which lets you pass an array of display lists you want OpenGL to render.
(05:24:18) mewse: My engine can do whichever.  My static terrain is rendered using display lists right now, because that seems to have much higher performance than VBOs.
(05:24:38) mewse: Although that could well be because I've done my tristrip VBOs non-optimally.
(05:25:01) Snakey: Neat, didn't know you could do that
(05:25:05) mewse: (which is certainly true;  right now I use one VBO per tristrip, which has got to be a lot of overhead)
(05:25:20) Snakey: Mmm yeah,

(05:26:07) The_Doctor: I'm trying to fill out this FASFA form
(05:26:37) mewse: Really I should have one VBO containing interleaved vertex data, and one VBO with all the tristrip indices.. but at the end of the day, I'm left calling "glDrawElements()" once per each tristrip, regardless.
(05:27:07) mewse: Much simpler to just compile the silly thing into a display list and be done with it.  :)
(05:27:26) mewse: I mean, assuming that it's actually static.
(05:27:46) Snakey: mewse: I've always wanted to make Magic Carpet
(05:27:53) Snakey: I think I might do it at some stage :D
(05:27:53) mewse: Why?
(05:27:58) Snakey: I loved that game
(05:28:02) mewse: I'm pretty certain that Bullfrog already made it?
(05:28:04) Snakey: but I could never get it to work multiplayer
(05:28:13) Snakey: sorry, remake
(05:28:14) mewse: So, like, now you don't have to make it;  it already exists!  Yay!
(05:28:27) Snakey: yeah but I could never play it with other people
(05:28:42) Dragonene: mm

(07:07:49) The_Doctor: So far, I have a graphics engine with animation, text boxes for dialogue and a fully functional music library.
(07:08:05) The_Doctor: Programmed by hand, without any DLLs except for the music.
(07:08:07) lansing: The_Doctor, power to you, BASIC programmers tend to have a habit of getting things done.
(07:09:19) The_Doctor: What I've got so far is also about 250 lines of code.
(07:09:44) DeM0nFiRe: Only 250 lines for all of what you listed?
(07:09:46) DeM0nFiRe: How?
(07:10:03) fartron: libraries
(07:10:18) DeM0nFiRe: He said it was done by hand

(07:13:50) fartron: watch for the rap machine to be revealed
(07:15:34) The_Doctor: I'm trying to write a very simplistic graphics engine in FreeBASIC.
(07:16:33) The_Doctor: To be honest, it seems fairly basic.
(07:16:57) The_Doctor: I can't do complex things like rotations or shit like that
(07:17:02) fartron: NO PUN INTENDED

(07:18:11) The_Doctor: 3 lines of code
(07:18:21) DeM0nFiRe: What are the 3 lines?
(07:18:39) The_Doctor: Well, 4 if you count screen initialization.
(07:19:06) DeM0nFiRe: Ok, see FreeBasic's core library must include more than I know
(07:19:25) The_Doctor: SCREEN 14

(07:19:43) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, ok
(07:19:52) HannesP: my condoleances
(07:20:09) pyl: haha, tthis takes me back
(07:20:12) DeM0nFiRe: I get it. I was under the impression that FreeBasic's Core Library didn't have anything to put images
(07:20:32) HannesP: I'M GONNA BLOAD YOU
(07:20:37) pyl: custom written qbasic-stuff where my sprite-format was just a dump of a part of the graphics memory
(07:21:15) The_Doctor: It has quite a bit for simple image placement.
(07:21:41) The_Doctor: Which is why I'm using it for animated 2d characters.
(07:21:42) DeM0nFiRe: That;s cool
(07:22:30) The_Doctor: I mean, in the other screenshot I posted, I still used a PRINT command.
(07:22:36) The_Doctor: It's sad, really.

(07:24:21) The_Doctor: I just cheated and made it draw pretty graphics around the located and coloured terminal text.
(07:25:08) smn: that IS simple indeed =D

(07:29:16) The_Doctor: It's just for fun, but I want to make a game in this.
(07:29:39) Snakey: PXTONE?
(07:29:51) The_Doctor: Music software by the guy who did cave story
(07:30:30) The_Doctor: I mean, you CAN use libraries in FreeBASIC, but it's a bitch and a half.
(07:30:44) The_Doctor: in this case, I had to actually make the program recognize each command.
(07:31:22) Snakey: Ahh right.
(07:31:41) Snakey: I'm working on a complex project at the moment
(07:31:56) Snakey: First time I've decided to create internal libraries to compose a larger program

(08:05:21) mewse: fartron:  I'm trying my hand at a Love-style heightmap which supports cliffs.
(08:05:53) fartron: can't you just do a normal heightmap with floats and then do steps
(08:06:17) mewse: Steps?
(08:06:40) fartron: steps 1 to 3
(08:06:46) fartron: that was a bad joke
(08:07:01) fartron: uh i mean like from 0.00001 to 0.0001 is one color
(08:07:19) mewse: Yeah, I'm doing that.
(08:07:35) mewse: But what I meant is supporting actual sheer vertical cliffs within the heightmap.
(08:07:52) mewse: Requires having two heights for the vertical faces.
(08:08:05) mewse: That's what I meant by "two-level heightmap".
(08:08:06) fartron: i seee

(08:10:28) mewse: Basically, lets you have heightmaps that have both smooth rolling hills, and sharp cliffs, as seen here:  http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/screens/me_gdc_screen_1.png

(08:12:42) fartron: he must have a 3d matrix
(08:12:47) fartron: because otherwise you could only hollow out once
(08:13:04) mewse: From his description, he only supports hollowing out once.

(08:14:34) mewse: For minecraft is definitely awesome.
(08:14:49) fartron: but why do you need a second point, why can't the cliff just be where the value goes from 0 to 1
(08:14:58) fartron: or any such steep change
(08:15:12) mewse: What value?

(08:15:45) gandhi_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:15:49) mewse: Following you so far.
(08:16:21) fartron: but why doesn't having a 1 and a 0 next to each other in the map cause a cliff
(08:16:28) fartron: why do you need to do tricky things with extra points
(08:16:45) mewse: Because you also need to be able to support smooth terrain.
(08:16:56) fartron: ah
(08:17:18) fartron: so then something like if stepsize > 0.02 = step else: smooth
(08:19:38) mewse: Basically, your standard heightmap is concerned with a mesh grid, with vertices that can be moved vertically.  The Love approach is to think about grids of square prisms.  Each prism stores the heights of its four top corners, and whether those corners are snapped to the corners of its neighbors on each side.
(08:20:02) fartron: i see
(08:21:06) fartron: so each corner stores it's snapped status?
(08:21:14) fartron: that seems redudant
(08:21:17) mewse: Yeah.
(08:21:50) fartron: so one point is going to have the snapped data stored 4 times
(08:21:52) mewse: Well, it's a cheaper way to do it than to actually test equality against another prism which might be outside the cache.
(08:21:57) mewse: Yeah.
(08:22:10) mewse: It's four times as expensive as a heightmap, basically.
(08:22:44) fartron: i would figure you could put something in the heightmap rendering to do the same, but i guess memory isn't the limiting factor
(08:22:50) mewse: I mean, four times as expensive in memory.  Potentially also using a lot more CPU->GPU bandwidth, too, depending on how smart your rendering code is.

(10:05:48) Dragonene: RinkuHero: It's totally weird, too
(10:05:57) Dragonene: Well not really
(10:06:03) Dragonene: But I can't find the will to play on those tiny consoles
(10:06:08) Dragonene: When I can play on a proper one or my PC
(10:06:22) RinkuHero: i don't play on either much
(10:06:29) pyl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qC8T1AO-lM probably has the best voiceover ever
(10:06:30) RinkuHero: i just play ps2 games and pc
(10:06:31) Dragonene: Well, to be fair, I have played gameboy some
(10:06:35) Dragonene: gameboy original.
(10:06:42) RinkuHero: yes
(10:06:49) pyl: things are falling apart like a pack of cards
(10:06:50) RinkuHero: i played through ff legend, ff adventure, and zelda 4 on that
(10:06:56) Dragonene: I also have a GBA, but never played anything on it
(10:07:10) Dragonene: I bought THPS2 and some castlevania game for it
(10:07:13) Movius: KING OF MY VILLAGE
(10:07:22) Dragonene: but see, the screen was so dark I could hardly even see my own character in castlevania
(10:07:26) Dragonene: worst purchase I ever made
(10:07:29) Dragonene: couldn't see a damned thing
(10:07:38) Dragonene: damn, but I wished I'd waited for the backlit GBA :)
(10:07:43) pyl: i realized that loving him was like throwing my balls to the swine
(10:08:23) Rock_D: haha, that last video has the most hilarious proverb wrangulation ever
(10:08:38) Rock_D: "it all falls apart like a pack of cards"
(10:08:41) Sos: backlit gba sucks
(10:08:50) Dragonene: non-backlit gba sucks more
(10:08:56) Sos: no
(10:08:58) Movius: The Love doctor
(10:08:59) Dragonene: Yes
(10:09:10) Sos: it cann run for hours on cheapest tesco battery
(10:09:12) pyl: blockburster
(10:09:13) Dragonene: I couldn't even complete the first level of one of two games I bought
(10:09:17) Sos: unlike backlit one
(10:09:24) Dragonene: I have like 20 minutes of play time because I can't see a thing on it
(10:09:27) Dragonene: It's so bad
(10:09:34) Sos: btw my hamtaro save died [cries]
(10:09:35) Dragonene: Perhaps mine is exceptionally bad, I don't know
(10:09:41) Dragonene: But it's *entirely* unplayable
(10:09:55) Dragonene: aaanyway
(10:09:57) Dragonene: I'm off for bed
(10:09:58) Dragonene: 'night
(10:10:02) pyl: i sat down with a reading light and a decent pair of speakers when i got my unlit gba
(10:10:13) pyl: and played through the original gb zelda gain
(10:10:16) pyl: again
(10:10:20) pyl: was worth it just for that
(10:10:51) fartron: so wait, in nigeria they make movies in english?

(10:11:08) RinkuHero: yes
(10:11:12) lansing: i'd play super mario land 3 on my non-backlit gba again
(10:11:21) RinkuHero: just like in india they make them in english
(10:11:26) RinkuHero: (bollywood)
(10:11:29) fartron: no they don't
(10:11:33) pyl: isn't super mario land 3 the first wario land? :o
(10:11:33) Movius: no they don't
(10:11:35) fartron: those movies are in hindi
(10:11:39) lansing: pyl, yes

(10:11:47) pyl: that's an awesome game
(10:11:49) RinkuHero: many are in english
(10:11:51) pyl: i love all the super mario land games
(10:11:53) fartron: not many
(10:11:56) RinkuHero: english is also the official language of nigeria
(10:12:01) lansing: the original was a bit short imo
(10:12:08) pyl: i struggled with it for ages
(10:12:10) pyl: because i was a kid
(10:12:18) pyl: every now and then now i pick it up and run through the entire game
(10:12:24) pyl: in .. half an hour
(10:12:25) pyl: or something
(10:12:28) lansing: pyl, did you ever play bart and the beanstalk?
(10:12:38) pyl: lansing: no, never. was it good?
(10:12:52) pyl: i remember being really jelous of my friend who had mega man for the gameboy
(10:12:56) fartron: larry koldsweat
(10:13:08) RinkuHero: it isn't a common first language though, according to wikipedia
(10:13:08) lansing: pyl, no, it was terrible, the first level was so hard, you had to make jumps by 1 pixel, if you were off 1 pixel, fail you fall to the bottom of the level
(10:13:13) RinkuHero: but it's used in schools and such
(10:13:24) lansing: pyl, I only got to level 2 once in like 6 years
(10:13:37) Sos left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(10:13:43) KK_laptop: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phQJaPkeIIA this one looks cool
(10:13:58) KK_laptop: but this director is known for making goodlooking crap movies
(10:14:36) fartron: "things are falling apart like a pack of cards?
(10:14:38) fartron: "
(10:14:39) KK_laptop: hah the trailer is in english
(10:15:12) fartron: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K2v7IGS17Y&fmt=18
(10:15:15) fartron: this is going to be good
(10:15:31) KK_laptop: "their past becomes their future"
(10:16:20) RinkuHero: bollywood exceeds hollywood in revenues now i heard
(10:16:34) Movius: Bollywood movies are terrible
(10:16:35) fartron: that one isn't bollywood
(10:16:38) fartron: it's tegalu
(10:16:39) RinkuHero: ah
(10:16:44) Movius: and not in a hilarious Nigerian style
(10:16:48) lansing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwnN4z2a0fQ
(10:17:20) KK_laptop: i can never watch a bollywood movie
(10:17:35) KK_laptop: even though our cinema is as cheezy
(10:17:48) KK_laptop: another culture's cheesiness is like...
(10:17:50) KK_laptop: worse
(10:18:04) KK_laptop: americans should stop acting like indian cinema is "cool" and "hip"
(10:18:35) fartron: i like bollywood movies
(10:18:45) fartron: and it's not cause they're hip
(10:19:10) fartron: american cinema is almost completely divided by sex and age
(10:19:18) fartron: while in india the whole family goes to see a movie
(10:19:21) fartron: and the movies reflect that
(10:19:37) fartron: also bright colors and singing and dancing is fun
(10:19:40) Movius: all the indian movies (non bollywood) I've seen have a horrible unsubtle over-acting style
(10:19:44) RinkuHero: i haven't seen too many yet
(10:19:47) RinkuHero: but there are some pretty good ones
(10:19:51) RinkuHero: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholay
(10:20:08) RinkuHero: i like how the movie itself says it's the greatest story ever told
(10:20:10) Xander [chatzilla@5ad7f8f2.bb.sky.com] entered the room.
(10:20:15) shinygerbil: Tamil movies, now THOSE are fun
(10:20:30) fartron: did you see the srisailam trailer gerbil
(10:21:04) RinkuHero: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7e2ugGJQVw
(10:21:15) shinygerbil: don't think i have, fartron

(10:22:23) ***smn wants the next tigs compo to go down :|||
(10:22:31) Movius: I have a workmate of Sri Lankan heritage. He tells wacky stories of awkward silences after being introduced to Tamils at social gatherings by unknowing Aussies
(10:22:52) Movius: "how bout that cricket" is the appropriate way to deal with it apparently
(10:22:59) Xander: I want a new compo too
(10:23:16) jeb left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:23:18) fartron: "sippy films"
(10:24:02) RinkuHero: bollywood compo
(10:24:10) fartron: that's a good idea
(10:24:13) fartron: third world games
(10:24:31) fartron: games made by kids whose first computer was an OLPC
(10:24:47) KK_laptop left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:25:04) Movius: none of those
(10:26:18) Hempuli [Arvitei@a88-115-163-242.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(10:26:28) KareemK: i dunno
(10:26:41) KareemK: i think olpc's major userbase are wannabe altruist nerds
(10:26:52) Movius: basically
(10:27:04) Movius: after their "buy one, donate one" scheme or whatever
(10:27:05) KareemK: just like how nokia's maemo userbase is GNOME devs who got it for free
(10:27:42) Movius: whole thing is a massive personality clash between lunix zealots, corporate interests and glory-seekers
(10:28:22) KareemK: olpc? yeah
(10:28:27) Movius: yes
(10:28:29) KareemK: they sent people to cairo
(10:28:36) KareemK: and met with linux enthusiasts
(10:28:38) KareemK: i didnt go
(10:28:46) Hempuli_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:28:54) KareemK: that was 3 years ago or so though
(10:29:12) Movius: did you read the article by the OLPC security chief that quit?
(10:29:26) KareemK: i think only one guy is still with them, mostly for arabization stuff
(10:29:27) lemre: huh
(10:29:29) KareemK: Movius: no
(10:29:30) lemre: these burnout dlc cars are bullshit
(10:30:34) Jr [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:30:36) KareemK: how come after all these years, the ulitmate racing game isnt made yet
(10:30:41) Movius: I can't seem to find it
(10:30:52) KareemK: one with all the cars ever made
(10:30:54) RinkuHero: the ultimate racing game has been made
(10:30:56) RinkuHero: rad racer
(10:30:57) RinkuHero: for nes
(10:31:02) KareemK: be it user content or not
(10:31:07) KareemK: all tracks
(10:31:11) KareemK: all race styles
(10:31:18) KareemK: there was a free game called Racer
(10:31:23) KareemK: that sorta approached that
(10:31:26) Movius: guy was complaining about all the lunix fanboys who suddenly didn't want to help anyone once it looked like not being 100% open source
(10:31:30) Movius: I remember Racer
(10:31:39) Movius: I think it's still going
(10:31:53) RinkuHero: i think olpc is a good idea
(10:32:10) RinkuHero: but not for every country
(10:32:10) Movius: EEEPC's are cheaper
(10:32:15) KareemK: mobile linux is a mess
(10:32:21) Hempuli_ [Arvitei@a88-115-163-242.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(10:32:26) KareemK: each company trying to push its platform
(10:32:36) KareemK: you had olpc with Sugar by redhat
(10:32:40) KareemK: then Moblin by intel
(10:32:47) KareemK: which novell or suse forked
(10:32:48) Ciahnensy: Hempuli keeps all his celery in tight foil so it won't get chewy.
(10:32:58) KareemK: Maemo by nokia
(10:33:08) KareemK: which was absolutely useless although most openly developed
(10:33:18) Hempuli_: Ciahnensy - what?
(10:33:33) KareemK: ubuntu netbook version
(10:33:35) RinkuHero: they should have just went with windows
(10:33:43) KareemK: although stuff meant to run on phones
(10:33:44) RinkuHero: microsoft was offering it to the olpc project for free
(10:34:02) KareemK: like openmoko (a friend of mine was involved with that... it sucked)
(10:34:04) Hempuli left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:34:10) fartron: OLPC served its purpose of opening the market
(10:34:14) fartron: no one had a netbook before that
(10:34:20) KareemK: mobile gnome (which has no real definition)
(10:34:22) KareemK: and of course
(10:34:31) KareemK: the shock to freetards everywhere
(10:34:34) KareemK: Android
(10:35:49) RinkuHero: i don't think the purpose of the olpc proj was to start the netbook market though
(10:35:51) KareemK: i think moblin 2 .. from the video... looks like how netbooks should be
(10:36:04) Rock_D: Android isn't really failing yet though? Although I can imagine it will because I'm having a slightly hard time programming for the thing.
(10:36:06) RinkuHero: i thought the idea was to get people in the third world using computers more
(10:36:15) RinkuHero: children especially
(10:36:30) KareemK: it takes alot from the olpc's minimal interface
(10:36:35) KareemK: and makes it actually cool
(10:36:42) Movius: the idea was to provide easier/better tools for education
(10:36:50) Movius: thats why the security guy left
(10:37:02) Movius: cause the main boss just wanted to churn out as many as possible
(10:37:09) RinkuHero: ah
(10:37:10) GuitarBizarre left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(10:37:42) RinkuHero: quantity is important too though
(10:37:53) KareemK: i dont think a laptop with linux is very useful though
(10:37:56) RinkuHero: better to have 1000 okay-ish education tools than 100 great ones
(10:37:58) KareemK: not to mention it wont go in africa
(10:38:06) KareemK: because MS has a stronghold on govts here
(10:38:10) fartron: yeah but he kept changing the "goals" part of the web page
(10:38:13) fartron: and purging the education parts
(10:38:19) RinkuHero: ah
(10:38:20) Movius: the main good thing about OLPC is the ad hoc networking stuff
(10:38:31) Movius: and the low power usage
(10:38:43) RinkuHero: what about the crank
(10:38:47) RinkuHero: and the inbuilt wikipedia
(10:38:50) RinkuHero: i liked those ideas
(10:38:51) KareemK: that was taken out
(10:38:53) KareemK: crank
(10:38:53) RinkuHero: boo
(10:38:56) RinkuHero: the crank was great
(10:38:58) fartron: yeah
(10:39:24) fartron: i think OLPCs purpose was to show that with the hardware we have now there can be cheap powerful things
(10:39:40) fartron: and it showed that and now there is a whole subcategory of hardware to reflect that
(10:39:47) Rock_D: imagine someone going "wait a sec, have to crank it" on irc every hour or so
(10:39:55) RinkuHero: that'd be great
(10:40:03) RinkuHero: but i don't think it was every hour
(10:40:06) Hachi-Roku left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:40:14) RinkuHero: i think it was like 5 min of cranking for 6 hours of power or something
(10:40:17) Xander: I assume half the people I'm talking to on IRC are probably cranking it
(10:40:24) Movius: clockwork radios are common place 
(10:40:34) C418 [C418@p5B3D528C.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(10:40:39) Rock_D: RinkuHero, that would be amazing efficiency
(10:40:44) Movius: patented up the arse though
(10:40:47) RinkuHero: it was efficient
(10:40:53) C418: uiguzdtzteteza
(10:40:55) RinkuHero: its cpu was like 20 watts or something absurd
(10:41:03) Movius: very low power monitor too
(10:41:23) RinkuHero: it was also designed by alan kay
(10:41:23) fartron: some guy invented a metal detector powered by the motion of sweeping your hand back and forth
(10:41:27) fartron: was for finding mines in third world
(10:41:30) KareemK: a fun thing i was involved with, was a linux-based STB
(10:41:31) Rock_D: cellphone crank chargers certainly don't achieve that efficiency, so why would a laptop?
(10:41:32) RinkuHero: the same person who helped invent oop
(10:41:37) RinkuHero: and the windowed gui
(10:41:40) KareemK: i worked on that for like 5months
(10:42:28) Movius: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork_radio
(10:42:36) Rock_D: "After 2 minutes of cranking, you're supposed to get about 6 minutes of talk time and 30 minutes of standby time."
(10:43:12) Rock_D: note "supposed to", it's even worse than that
(10:43:22) Xander left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:44:35) Rock_D: Found a quote on the cord pull crank they also considered: "Warshawsky estimates that generator can, when pulled by an adult for about ten minutes, generate enough electricity to power the laptop for 40 minutes of intensive use, such as watching videos, and up to 60 minutes when typing or surfing the Web. "
(10:44:53) Rock_D: nowhere near 6 hours
(10:45:36) Movius: you can generate enough power by hand-cranking
(10:45:43) Movius: its storing it that is the problem

(21:32:37) Dragonene: Jammin'.
(21:32:48) Dragonene: Actually, I'm not
(21:32:50) Dragonene: I'm rather bored.
(21:34:23) cft [Mibbit@BAA2ef2.baa.pppool.de] entered the room.
(21:34:34) michael_: we're jammin
(21:34:40) michael_: and i hope you like jammin too
(21:36:14) Jr: michael_: question
(21:36:23) michael_: seed balls!
(21:36:25) Jr: do you have a recipe for flower bombs?
(21:36:27) Jr: yes
(21:36:29) Jr: that!
(21:36:47) michael_: what kinda seeds are you doing? just wild flower?
(21:36:57) Jr: I got some seedpackets from a thing downtown
(21:37:05) Jr: Comcast was giving out flower seeds
(21:37:10) Jr: so I took like 12
(21:37:16) michael_: schweet, its really simple
(21:37:18) Jr: in anticipation of this idea
(21:37:28) Jr: I also found some zinnia seeds
(21:37:34) Jr: and some sort of allium
(21:37:40) Jr: wait
(21:37:45) Jr: not allium, I don't think
(21:37:47) Dragonene: wtf
(21:37:51) Dragonene: did
(21:37:57) michael_: alliums are like onions
(21:37:58) Dragonene: michael_ just read Jr's mind?
(21:38:00) michael_: and shit
(21:38:00) Dragonene: Impressive
(21:38:02) Dragonene: and a bit scary
(21:38:14) Jr: creeping zinnia and verbena bonariensis
(21:38:19) Dragonene: Also, what are you making?
(21:38:23) Dragonene: Unconfuse me
(21:38:25) michael_: seed balls
(21:38:26) Jr: yea, they look like alliums
(21:38:31) Dragonene: Yes but what are they
(21:38:33) Jr: tall with purple round things
(21:38:45) Jr: they are balls of dirt
(21:38:51) Dragonene: What's the purpose of seed balls
(21:38:55) michael_: its really simple, 2 cups clay, 1 cup compost, .5 cup of seeds
(21:38:55) Jr: with seeds in them
(21:38:55) Jr: that you throw
(21:39:02) Jr: in hard-to-reach places and everywhere
(21:39:09) Jr: and then flowers grow
(21:39:09) michael_: theyre a very effective method of plant propagation 
(21:39:12) Dragonene: do they explode?
(21:39:15) Jr: no
(21:39:16) michael_: no
(21:39:19) Jr: they stay
(21:39:20) michael_: but you can throw them
(21:39:23) Dragonene: Aw :(
(21:39:24) Dragonene: But
(21:39:25) michael_: and you dont need to plant
(21:39:26) michael_: well
(21:39:27) Dragonene: Explosion!
(21:39:30) michael_: they explode slowly
(21:39:36) Jr: they explode into color
(21:39:44) michael_: mix all that stuff together
(21:39:47) Jr: okay
(21:39:57) michael_: and then add water until its mildly sticky
(21:40:05) michael_: enough to be able to clump it
(21:40:09) michael_: but not watery
(21:40:15) Dragonene: http://www.pathtofreedom.com/pathproject/gardening/seedballs.shtml
(21:40:18) michael_: or the seeds could rot
(21:40:18) Dragonene: The internet has guides.
(21:40:18) reetva left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(21:40:33) Dragonene: michael_ is a gardener.
(21:40:42) reetva [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(21:40:52) michael_: ive also seen people add some olive oil in place of some of the water
(21:41:00) Jr: what are good kinds of seeds?
(21:41:07) Jr: hardy things, I guess
(21:41:17) michael_: ya, depends on where youre planting
(21:41:33) michael_: quality wildflower mixes are good
(21:41:55) Jr: zinnia might be good then
(21:41:58) michael_: as well as herbs or nitrogen fixing plants like peas and clovers
(21:42:02) michael_: ya
(21:42:15) Jr: heat- and drought-tolerant blooms
(21:42:52) lansing: do you eat clovers michael?
(21:43:00) Jr: the verbena might not be so good
(21:43:02) Dragonene: More importantly
(21:43:04) Dragonene: Do you eat clowns?
(21:43:09) Dragonene: Because that'd be scary.
(21:43:13) Jr: clownfish
(21:43:16) michael_: not unless cute hippy girls shove them in my face
(21:43:31) Jr: anyway
(21:43:32) lansing: I've found them in my salad now and then, a bit tough but ok.

(21:43:43) michael_: they made me eat dandelions the other day
(21:43:50) Jr: I don't mind those
(21:43:52) Jr: oh man
(21:43:56) Jr: hickory nuts
(21:43:57) Jr: so good
(21:43:58) Dragonene: Dandelions are edible
(21:44:00) Dragonene: Well, in theory
(21:44:03) Jr: and plentiful around here
(21:44:06) Dragonene: I've never tried.
(21:44:11) michael_: theyre good when theyre young
(21:44:12) HannesP left the room (quit: Quit: HannesP).
(21:44:18) michael_: the dandelions are too
(21:44:23) Dragonene: I like dandelions
(21:44:25) Jr: they're like walnut/pecan
(21:44:39) Dragonene: There's a rather silly swedish song about dandelions
(21:44:46) Jr: SING IT
(21:44:47) Jr: NOW
(21:44:52) Dragonene: how everybody treats them as unwanted plants
(21:44:55) Dragonene: what's that called again?
(21:44:58) Dragonene: unwanted thingies
(21:45:06) michael_: weeds?
(21:45:09) Dragonene: thanks.
(21:45:29) Dragonene: And he goes "I let all my dandelions bloom"
(21:45:54) michael_: ya, that link that dragonene posted had a good list of plants
(21:45:54) michael_: Clover, alfalfa, alyssum, nasturtium, yarrow, carrot, dill, daikon, celery, radish, fennel, caraway, chervil, gypsophila, coriander, calendula, mustard, anise hyssop, phacelia, agastache, and amaranth
(21:46:15) lansing: dill is always good
(21:46:18) michael_:  i really like anise hyssop
(21:46:26) Jr: those are tiny
(21:46:27) michael_: its my favorite kind of mint
(21:46:35) Jr: I was thinking about 1" balls
(21:46:46) Jr: I don't like anise
(21:46:50) michael_: you can make them what ever size you want
(21:47:03) Dragonene: Make one kilogram seed balls
(21:47:06) Dragonene: !
(21:47:10) lansing: make some chocolate salty balls
(21:47:12) Jr: I guess larger is better for places without dirt?
(21:47:17) Jr: like
(21:47:25) reetva: Wait why did TF2 crash?
(21:47:27) reetva: :'(
(21:47:30) Dragonene: When you first started talking about seed balls and clay
(21:47:31) Jr: reetva
(21:47:37) Jr: http://www.pathtofreedom.com/pathproject/gardening/seedballs.shtml
(21:47:39) Jr: that
(21:47:39) Jr: do it
(21:47:44) Dragonene: I was imagining making balls filled with earth and seeds and a thin layer of clay on top
(21:47:47) Dragonene: You'd throw them
(21:47:49) Dragonene: and they'd explode
(21:47:53) Dragonene: scattering seeds in all directions
(21:48:00) Dragonene: Now that would be awesome.
(21:48:11) konjak [konjak@ua-83-227-162-228.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(21:48:27) Dragonene: konjak: We have determined what your next game will be about.
(21:48:28) konjak: hey, anyone here familiar with PHP
(21:48:30) mewse: Then throw a water balloon, and they'd sprout up wherever they landed.  Yay!
(21:48:36) konjak: oh?
(21:48:39) Dragonene: Seed balls.
(21:48:46) Pongball [pong@68-185-174-24.dhcp.mdsn.wi.charter.com] entered the room.
(21:48:47) konjak: sounds crap
(21:48:49) Dragonene: Preferrably explosive
(21:49:00) konjak: so, PHP anyone?
(21:49:01) Dragonene: I have very limited php knowledge.
(21:49:12) Dragonene: But I'm sure somebody will know the answer?
(21:49:15) konjak: so do I, that probably means you have more
(21:49:17) Dragonene: Just throw the question out there.
(21:49:43) konjak: Why can't I set a variable to the length of a damn string?
(21:49:45) konjak: $namelength=strlen($_POST["name"]);
(21:49:49) konjak: this doesn't work
