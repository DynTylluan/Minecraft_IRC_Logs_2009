(10:12:42) Stargoat: yo, Rinku
(10:12:57) Stargoat: make a non-boring, un-normal album
(10:13:20) RinkuHero: nothing is boring
(10:13:26) RinkuHero: boredom exists in the mind, not the album
(10:13:48) hao-1: could a slave be bored when picking cotton?
(10:13:52) Dragonene left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:13:55) RinkuHero: yes
(10:13:58) RinkuHero: but they could also not be bored
(10:14:06) Stargoat: not if the slave did not know anything other than how to pick cotton
(10:14:07) hao-1: that's why we have the blues, I guess
(10:14:25) RinkuHero: like if the slave's masters says 'pick this amount of cotton or be sold!!'
(10:14:26) Cait is now known as Cait|Classing
(10:14:30) RinkuHero: then they wouldn't be bored
(10:14:46) Stargoat: maybe they could gample on the chance to be sold to someone with more exciting work
(10:14:48) hao-1: still
(10:14:50) Stargoat: gamble!
(10:14:53) hao-1: one gets bored
(10:15:15) RinkuHero: as an aside, ever read frederick douglass's account of slavery?
(10:15:17) RinkuHero: it's pretty good
(10:15:19) RinkuHero: been reading it lately
(10:15:23) hao-1: also, it is not a good excuse to produce and release work that you consider to be boring
(10:15:51) Stargoat: the slave only wants to stop being a slave, because someone told them there's a world out there, in which they could not be a slave. In light of thise, don't talk to the slaves.
(10:15:57) RinkuHero: but that's a problem if the person making the album isn't easily bored
(10:16:04) RinkuHero: or not bored in the same way as people who consume the album
(10:16:16) hao-1: does this apply to you, C418?
(10:16:26) hao-1: are you easily bored?
(10:16:44) hao-1: ANSWER ME C418
(10:16:53) Stargoat: such anger
(10:17:02) hao-1: bored at work, sorry
(10:17:10) C418: good question
(10:17:13) C418: I don't know
(10:17:21) RinkuHero: i think boredom is related to dopamine levels
(10:17:37) RinkuHero: add people get bored very easily
(10:17:40) RinkuHero: and have low dopamine
(10:17:44) Thi3f [thi3f@62-20-191-11-no30.tbcn.telia.com] entered the room.
(10:17:46) Stargoat: hao-1, how can you justify working as something that bores you? It is an insult to your valuble time.
(10:17:54) hao-1: salary
(10:18:01) Stargoat: wage slave
(10:18:11) KareemK: making music is usually not boring
(10:18:13) hao-1: also, it doesn't bore me in principle, only in practice
(10:18:16) RinkuHero: just invest 50% of your money
(10:18:19) KareemK: or less boring than listening at least
(10:18:19) RinkuHero: and retire when you're 40
(10:18:27) hao-1: i realise that it's my own fault
(10:18:30) nihilocrat: making music is boring if you are really crappy at it
(10:18:34) anosou: Woop woop, Main Theme finished!
(10:18:35) nihilocrat: and can't manage to make anything you like
(10:18:40) Movius: I got a lecture today about taking sick leave when sick
(10:18:45) Movius: due to it making the dept. look bad
(10:18:46) anosou: with a 4 second lead-in before the loop too, I feel technical
(10:18:48) nihilocrat: and/or just uninspired
(10:18:56) fartronomicon: what i like to do is see how much cotton i can pick in an hour
(10:18:59) fartronomicon: and then try to beat that record
(10:19:00) hao-1: nice one movius
(10:19:02) RinkuHero: yes
(10:19:04) RinkuHero: i do that sometimes
(10:19:07) RinkuHero: how many lines can i write in a day?
(10:19:09) RinkuHero: then try to beat that
(10:19:10) LordMetroid [lordmetroi@90-224-93-243-no108.tbcn.telia.com] entered the room.
(10:19:10) Movius: quite
(10:19:10) RinkuHero: etc.
(10:19:19) fartronomicon: you and principal skinner
(10:19:20) Stargoat: farton would make a good slave. We should talk some time.
(10:19:27) Movius: I've been claiming time spent at the dentist as sick leave, as i was told to do
(10:19:30) Movius: hilarious
(10:19:31) doohan: Movius, clearly they prefer you to go in ill and infect everyone else
(10:19:39) doohan: So they can be ill
(10:19:44) doohan: And everyone can have sick leave
(10:19:47) Movius: cavities are rarely contagious
(10:19:52) KareemK: good times with dentists
(10:19:57) anosou: The key is saying you've got swine flu
(10:19:58) doohan: Oh, didn't notice the dentists bit
(10:20:00) doohan: Yeah
(10:20:05) doohan: I'd have gone with that one.
(10:20:13) doohan: You'd get all year off.
(10:20:13) C418: http://doihaveswineflu.org/
(10:20:14) anosou: whatever you've really got, it doesn't matter because no one argues with swine flu
(10:20:17) RinkuHero: anyway, take l-tyrosine for boredom
(10:20:19) RinkuHero: works well
(10:20:22) RinkuHero: take small amounts though
(10:20:37) doohan: Tyrosine? Isn't that for sore throats?
(10:20:42) RinkuHero: it's an amino acid
(10:20:43) Movius: is this toxic placebos?
(10:20:48) fartronomicon: The other day I was in that agora of Southern life, the 7-Eleven, and when the woman in front of me had her purchases totaled up, they came to $6.66. She became hysterical. The whole store became hysterical.
(10:20:49) RinkuHero: i don't know if it's also helpful for sore throat
(10:20:50) doohan: Wait, that tyrozets
(10:20:51) fartronomicon: http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/opinion/where-sin-is-taken-seriously.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Foreign%20Service&scp=3&sq=%246.66%20store&st=cse
(10:20:53) KareemK: GATC
(10:20:53) Movius: just placebos
(10:20:56) RinkuHero: it's a precursor to dopamine
(10:21:10) KareemK: wait its not in gatc
(10:21:15) RinkuHero: it's used as a natural remedy for add
(10:21:20) RinkuHero: and works as well as many drugs, and is cheaper
(10:21:22) KareemK: thats thymine i think
(10:21:42) RinkuHero: thymine is a nucleic acid
(10:21:52) doohan: A nuclear acid?!?!
(10:21:52) The_Doctor: Wow
(10:21:56) Movius: it will make your body stop producing dopamine
(10:22:06) RinkuHero: it will
(10:22:10) RinkuHero: which is why you don't take it perpetually
(10:22:16) RinkuHero: just take it during particularly bad moments of boredom
(10:22:36) KareemK: rinku is a chemist at heart
(10:22:42) RinkuHero: i majored in biochem, yes
(10:22:57) Stargoat: crazy. What are you doing now?
(10:23:02) RinkuHero: nothing
(10:23:07) RinkuHero: just making games and selling them online
(10:23:10) doohan: Crystal MEth is the answer to that question!!
(10:23:31) KareemK: i hated the biochem course i had two years ago
(10:23:38) RinkuHero: i liked mine
(10:23:41) doohan: Too many experiments?
(10:23:42) RinkuHero: but my teacher was very good
(10:23:48) KareemK: all estrases
(10:23:53) KareemK: and dehydrogenases
(10:23:54) Movius: Tyrosine, which can be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine
(10:23:59) KareemK: and g6p
(10:23:59) Movius: go drink some pepsi max
(10:24:03) doohan: Oh so dirnk more pepsi
(10:24:04) doohan: :)
(10:24:12) doohan: I have pepsi max in the fridge
(10:24:14) RinkuHero: yes, you can also take phenylalanine
(10:24:21) RinkuHero: but tyrosine seems to work better
(10:24:32) KareemK: MAO
(10:24:36) KareemK: COMT
(10:24:40) Stargoat: wuh
(10:24:54) The_Doctor: Yeah
(10:25:21) Stargoat: The_Doctor, show us some of your msuic.
(10:25:25) Stargoat: music!
(10:25:38) The_Doctor: This is... not the chat to start throwing around meth ingredients.
(10:25:51) Stargoat: sure it is
(10:26:14) Movius: making crystal meth eh? enjoy your house exploding
(10:26:24) Stargoat: explosions are awesome.
(10:26:40) fartronomicon: The_Doctor, there' is a tvshow on AMC now that tells you how to make meth
(10:26:45) fartronomicon: i think the cat is out of the bag
(10:27:01) The_Doctor: That's not the point.
(10:27:10) fartronomicon: meth is indie!
(10:27:11) KareemK: i was not throwing arounf meth ingredients
(10:27:21) KareemK: these where boring biochem terms
(10:27:25) Stargoat: yeah, that would be wasteful
(10:28:12) KareemK: were^
(10:29:12) fartronomicon: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/picturesoftheday/5355170/Pictures-of-the-day-20-May-2009.html
(10:29:51) The_Doctor: ...
(10:29:54) RinkuHero: ha
(10:29:58) The_Doctor: Seriously?
(10:30:00) Hachi-Roku is now known as Gillus
(10:30:05) fartronomicon: apparently
(10:30:10) RinkuHero: hachi- must be role playing
(10:30:13) Movius: it's for surgery
(10:30:27) RinkuHero: oh
(10:30:32) doohan: haha
(10:30:36) RinkuHero: i thought it was just to give them to quiet them down or something
(10:30:39) C418: it's for handheld games
(10:30:43) doohan: That's what I thought it was for
(10:30:43) C418: it has a drug
(10:30:48) Movius: hehe
(10:30:51) doohan: Keep me quiet
(10:30:56) RinkuHero: his teeth look weird
(10:31:02) RinkuHero: like he's missing calcium or something
(10:31:06) RinkuHero: or vit d more likely
(10:31:17) RinkuHero: or is that a girl
(10:31:19) RinkuHero: hard to tell
(10:31:23) fartronomicon: i think girl
(10:31:30) fartronomicon: also children have smaller teeth
(10:31:32) fartronomicon: it is natural
(10:31:59) Ina_: That smile is scary
(10:32:01) KareemK: its his gingiva that looks weird
(10:32:10) RinkuHero: her*
(10:32:22) fartronomicon: is that the gum line?
(10:32:38) Stargoat: KareemK knows all about teeth
(10:32:40) Ina_: Based on the small piece of clothing I can see, I think it's a girl.
(10:32:45) JohannesG left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(10:32:45) RinkuHero: true
(10:32:50) RinkuHero: looks flowery
(10:32:52) RinkuHero: still
(10:33:00) RinkuHero: some mothers dress up their boys in girls' clothing
(10:33:12) anosou left the room (quit: Quit: YOU READ IT, YOU CAN'T UN-READ IT!).
(10:33:15) RinkuHero: so clothes can't be trusted
(10:33:24) Movius: crazy mothers
(10:33:29) Xander: thats.. weird
(10:33:30) fartronomicon: something about the face said girl to me
(10:33:36) RinkuHero: yeah
(10:33:44) Stargoat: the fact that she's happy?
(10:33:48) RinkuHero: haha
(10:33:53) RinkuHero: anyone would be happy on that thing
(10:34:27) Stargoat: this is true. Look how stylish it is.
(10:34:38) fartronomicon: also it gives you drugs with your games automatically
(10:34:44) fartronomicon: while i have to do it the old fashioned way
(10:34:46) nihilocrat: wowwww
(10:34:48) nihilocrat: see
(10:34:58) nihilocrat: I thought the leashes they give kids now was a little odd
(10:34:59) Xander: So, it's designed to help children sleep relax
(10:35:11) nihilocrat: no, it's designed to get them to shut the hell up
(10:35:14) Xander: Only, it's going to knock them unconcious whilst they're playing a GBA game...
(10:35:25) Stargoat: my brother used to wear a harness with something resembling a dog-lead coming out the back of it.
(10:35:33) Stargoat: he called it his "dinosaur tail"
(10:35:39) fartronomicon: i think it's to over-come how easy games are now... if you are passing out they become harder
(10:35:39) nihilocrat: that's cute
(10:35:39) Stargoat: He was quite a rowdy youngster.
(10:35:48) Xander: I'd be stressed out if I had to reach a save point before collapsing
(10:35:51) Movius: I saw a kid on a leash in the mall the other day
(10:35:59) nihilocrat: I just think the human being == domesticated animal thing is a little odd
(10:36:07) nihilocrat: thought I completely understand the rationale
(10:36:19) nihilocrat: I'd just rather not have kids in the first place
(10:36:23) The_Doctor: Humans don't == domesticated animals yet.
(10:36:46) ***Stargoat is eagerly anticipating the robot apocalypse
(10:36:51) RinkuHero: http://www.curiosite.com/scripts/product/enproduct.php?idproducto=19126738
(10:37:07) RinkuHero: and that's for when they get older
(10:37:26) KareemK: hahaha
(10:37:30) KareemK: i should buy that
(10:37:34) nihilocrat: look at the 4th image ... I didn't know students could afford riot gear like that
(10:38:05) KareemK: "The gadget has a safety key that allows you to open the manacle at any time and interrupt the scheduled study time."
(10:38:05) KareemK: bah
(10:38:07) KareemK: useless
(10:38:25) RinkuHero: it's probably like
(10:38:28) RinkuHero: in case there's a fire
(10:38:28) Notch_: It's a bit low quality still, but here's a huge map: http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en&v=frJ45Y1r11o&gl=US
(10:38:52) RinkuHero: it's also surprisingly expensive
(10:39:00) RinkuHero: 115$ for a 20 pound ball and a timer?
(10:39:08) fartronomicon: seriously that will not make your kids like doing homework
(10:39:12) fartronomicon: if you make it seem like prison more
(10:39:40) Stargoat: fartron doesn't understand the prison-schoolwork relationship
(10:39:42) RinkuHero: 20 pounds is also not that much
(10:39:47) fartronomicon: i sure do
(10:39:51) Stargoat: "kids will love it!" -- man from street
(10:39:59) RinkuHero: i'm only 135 and i can walk around with 20 pounds without trouble
(10:40:03) Stargoat: notch: awesome
(10:40:06) KareemK: minecraft vid
(10:40:10) KareemK: as ciah would say
(10:40:11) fartronomicon: prisons factories and schools were all invented in concert at the beginning of the industrial revolution
(10:40:15) KareemK: "oh doggie"
(10:40:19) doohan: Also, if you're studying at a computer
(10:40:27) doohan: That's not going to stop your from procrastinating
(10:40:29) RinkuHero: yes
(10:40:30) Stargoat: notch, what sort of FPS should I be getting on the old map size?
(10:40:34) doohan: Fuck, the ball would become a game itself
(10:40:35) RinkuHero: since your distractions are also on the computer
(10:40:45) doohan: Do some weights
(10:40:52) doohan: Some squats
(10:41:20) Stargoat: only 20 more pushups, then it's time to work on INT
(10:41:22) doohan: notch lava :D
(10:41:28) doohan: haha
(10:41:32) KareemK: water too
(10:41:39) doohan: I saw water yesterday
(10:41:41) doohan: I'm waiting for save
(10:41:51) doohan: Number 1 most requested feature
(10:41:58) Stargoat: notch's water is weird. Cool, though. But weird.
(10:42:00) fartronomicon: multiplayer is number 2
(10:42:05) doohan: Hells yes
(10:42:08) fartronomicon: it's like DF water
(10:42:09) fartronomicon: i like it
(10:42:12) fartronomicon: because it's creepy
(10:42:14) Stargoat: not really
(10:42:15) thewreck_Away is now known as thewreck
(10:42:16) fartronomicon: like a horror movie stalker
(10:42:21) doohan: And then cannons
(10:42:22) KareemK: it's how respectable water should behave
(10:42:27) Stargoat: when water "flows", it just creates new water
(10:42:28) C418: I... should update my blog.
(10:42:30) doohan: So you blast holes in other peoples castles
(10:42:33) Stargoat: like, from no-where
(10:42:42) nihilocrat: yeah, technically it's magic water like that
(10:42:47) nihilocrat: well
(10:42:52) fartronomicon: yeah, it's not quite the df water
(10:43:00) fartronomicon: but it's still scary when you flood a cave
(10:43:00) doohan: df?
(10:43:02) fartronomicon: and it chases you
(10:43:14) RinkuHero: you should label that video 'minecraft'
(10:43:15) KareemK: bbk
(10:43:18) KareemK: bbl
(10:43:19) RinkuHero: so people who randomly come across that vid
(10:43:22) Stargoat: I would love accurate fluid dynamics water, but notch won't do it :(
(10:43:22) RinkuHero: will know what game to dl
(10:43:33) fartronomicon: yeah, also so all the other minecraft vids show up
(10:43:45) fartronomicon: doohan, dwarf fortress
(10:43:46) doohan: Oh man, you can sabotage people underground tunnels
(10:43:49) Stargoat: (still, some water is better than none)
(10:43:49) doohan: ahh yeah
(10:43:57) doohan: connect it to the sea :)
(10:44:00) Stargoat: notch, gonna add a breath mechanic?
(10:44:03) fartronomicon: stargoat that would drop the frames to 0
(10:44:06) Dragonene [none@202.171.170.5] entered the room.
(10:44:11) Gillus left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:44:11) doohan: Can lava flow into water?
(10:44:15) Stargoat: hmmmmmmmmmm
(10:44:19) fartronomicon: try it doohan
(10:44:20) Stargoat: I want to test that
(10:44:22) fartronomicon: i did
(10:44:23) Dragonene: there was another firewall.
(10:44:31) Stargoat: hi, dragonene
(10:44:34) fartronomicon: i was really hoping for steam
(10:44:36) nihilocrat: I couldn't even find lava, but I didn't spend too much time
(10:44:39) fartronomicon: again, like in df
(10:44:52) Stargoat: steam wouldn't make sense, because he's not implimenting pressure systems
(10:45:00) fartronomicon: steam traps
(10:45:02) fartronomicon: is why it would make sense
(10:45:06) Stargoat: haha
(10:45:07) Gillus [hdsakhjlas@c-76-31-99-98.hsd1.tx.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:45:09) Stargoat: awrite
(10:45:29) doohan: A menu!!
(10:47:14) C418: notch develops his game incredibly fast
(10:47:47) fartronomicon: yeah, it's awesome
(10:47:49) RinkuHero: not as fast as cactus
(10:47:51) RinkuHero: or increpare
(10:47:54) fartronomicon: makes me want to try java more
(10:47:57) tantan [tantan@c-98-213-201-216.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:48:03) fartronomicon: notch's game is much bigger than most cactus ones
(10:48:05) nihilocrat: yeah I usually just get caught up in dumb little bugs that make no sense and don't get fixed for hours
(10:48:06) tantan: woo, done with school
(10:48:13) tantan: i like notch
(10:48:15) C418: cactus and increpare don't do just a single game that improves a lot
(10:48:18) tantan: i like the cut of his jib
(10:48:21) C418: they do shitloads of experiments
(10:48:29) tantan: ooh did notch update mcraft?
(10:48:30) Notch_: yeah, some kind of breathing will be in survival mode
(10:48:36) fartronomicon: tantan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en&v=frJ45Y1r11o&gl=US
(10:48:41) Notch_: it's not updated yet, tantan, but there's a new vid
(10:48:45) Notch_: and a HUUUGE map
(10:48:56) Notch_: and I just tried making a 1024x64x64 map. It's nuts
(10:49:06) Notch_: it's basically a looong gauntlet of hills and lakes
(10:49:14) RinkuHero: i always get too ambitious with map sizes
(10:49:18) RinkuHero: or number of areas in a game
(10:49:26) RinkuHero: and then have to struggle to fill it all with interesting content
(10:50:16) C418: have some of you tried minecraft in chrome?
(10:50:21) The_Doctor: Anyone want a tarot reading?
(10:50:27) C418: am I the only one that has problems with that game in chrome?
(10:50:28) ***tantan watches video
(10:50:30) tantan: holy shit
(10:50:32) Stargoat: notch, I wanna be able to choose parameters :|
(10:50:33) tantan: no, c418
(10:50:40) tantan: my friennd had them
(10:50:46) tantan: i don't use chrome, myself
(10:50:48) C418: firefox is just fine
(10:50:56) C418: but in chrome the game randomly stops for a while
(10:51:19) Notch_: Stargoat: Yeah, that's coming
(10:51:25) Stargoat: ah, sweet
(10:51:25) nihilocrat: holy god those are ... huge maps
(10:51:28) Notch_: i need to speed up the huge maps though, haha
(10:51:40) Stargoat: 10 regenerations, no lava :|
(10:51:41) nihilocrat: It like the way that it seems to be generating them while you drop into the level... 
(10:51:45) Notch_: the framerate is ok (I get 300 with smaller rendering distances, 60 with entire map)
(10:51:46) nihilocrat: or is that just the rendering engine?
(10:52:05) Stargoat: by the way, I currently get around 70 fps. How's that compared to everyone else?
(10:52:08) Notch_: but the framerate is really uneven because of the ticks happening at a fixed rate, and level polling taking ages
(10:52:14) RinkuHero: i have tried minecraft in chrome and i tworks
(10:52:16) C418: you are too fast for me notch. I feel ashamed I still didn't start anything
(10:52:27) Notch_: don't worry about it, take your time. =)
(10:52:41) tantan: holy shit, this is going to be amazing
(10:53:10) RinkuHero: stargoat, let me check my fps with it
(10:53:11) tantan: stargoat, i get like 20 on the closest draw distance
(10:53:50) pyl: Notch_: i had an excellent time building a map-high chute to fall down, and a water-filled chute right next to it to get back up faster
(10:53:57) pyl: really made me want some kind of water pump though
(10:54:04) Massena [Massena@bl10-232-189.dsl.telepac.pt] entered the room.
(10:54:05) Notch_: =D
(10:54:09) RinkuHero: ugh
(10:54:11) RinkuHero: it used to work for me
(10:54:15) michael [michael@71-20-146-50.war.clearwire-wmx.net] entered the room.
(10:54:18) RinkuHero: but now minecraft randomly freezes in chrome
(10:54:23) RinkuHero: maybe it's the water?
(10:54:29) RinkuHero: used to work perfectly
(10:54:30) pyl: and making the chute striped with different blocks made it trippy as hell to fall down
(10:54:35) C418: wow. very big indeed
(10:54:42) jw: sup tigs
(10:54:46) jsticker: Anyone seen corpus? >:|

(10:56:20) RinkuHero: when i stand still, it works fine
(10:56:23) Praxagaros: high
(10:56:26) RinkuHero: and i get around 320 fps when standing still
(10:56:30) Xander: holy hell
(10:56:30) nihilocrat: I want map saving so I can create my own little Venice
(10:56:33) RinkuHero: then it goes to 0 when i move
(10:56:37) Stargoat: woah
(10:56:39) Stargoat: hmm
(10:56:47) Massena: Stargoat: I want that shit bad
(10:56:47) Stargoat: maybe I should try it in chrome
(10:56:48) nihilocrat: well, I can do that, but it takes awhile
(10:57:07) pyl: Notch_: by the way, i managed to get stuck inside a lavastone and see the inside of the mountain. got a screenshot on my desktop, i'll throw it up later
(10:57:17) pyl: it was awesome because you could see the location of the caves
(10:57:30) Notch_: yeah, heh, I need to fix it. =D
(10:57:42) Notch_: it's awesome, but ruins immersion. =)
(10:57:47) Massena: also jw, I want your game too
(10:57:51) pyl: fix it and add idspispopd
(10:57:51) Massena: I want it all

(11:01:53) nihilocrat: there's one in Norway today
(11:02:04) jsticker: Christi Himmelfahrt I believe

(11:02:28) fartronomicon: is it Laszlo Toth Art Appreciation Day?
(11:02:28) Massena: Stargoat: what is minecraft?
(11:02:35) Stargoat: ask notch
(11:02:44) Praxagaros: it must suck to have hepatitis.
(11:02:59) jsticker: Praxagaros, are you a bot or ciahnensy or naturally awesome
(11:03:05) Stargoat: massena: also, it's this --> http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/

(11:03:25) Stargoat: oh wow
(11:03:27) Massena: thank you, mighty goat
(11:03:33) Praxagaros: no i just say what comes to mind and hope people don't think i'm being gratuitous.
(11:03:36) Stargoat: I get around 300 FPS in chrome, in minecraft
(11:03:46) Praxagaros: say = type as it  comes to me.
(11:03:54) Stargoat: chrome is officially >> firefox for all things minecraft-wise
(11:04:28) jsticker: Cool, didn't know about that, fartronomicon
(11:04:43) fartronomicon: yeah, i made a holiday up about it
(11:04:45) RinkuHero: but it freezes for me in chrome :(
(11:04:57) C418: really? minecraft works just shitty in chrome
(11:05:00) Praxagaros: chromes is great in a practical sense but I'm not a huge fan of the layout.
(11:05:01) fartronomicon: on Laszlo Toth Art Appreciation day you destroy a piece of art as an act of creation
(11:05:15) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(11:05:16) nyarla: i get between 15 and 400 fps in safari @_@
(11:06:39) Stargoat: oh wow
(11:06:48) Stargoat: I just dug under a lake
(11:06:48) nyarla: cool, it just generated a level which was nearly entirely underwater, just a few little islands. like Wind Waker!
(11:06:53) Stargoat: to find a magma reserve
(11:06:54) Stargoat: awesome!
(11:07:05) Praxagaros: i take vitamins everyday and once every two months I buy a bottle for 14 bucks. i have no clue why i do.
(11:07:30) RinkuHero: which vitamins
(11:07:41) Praxagaros: central
(11:07:45) fartronomicon: there is little evidence that vitimins separated from the food actually helps
(11:07:46) jsticker: You're trying a bit too hard to not care about the current topic, you should fix that a bit, otherwise I already like you
(11:07:57) RinkuHero: there is a lot of evidence
(11:08:02) RinkuHero: there's just no evidence it reduces mortality
(11:08:05) Dragonene: why is there like a fire alarm a day in here
(11:08:09) RinkuHero: but there's evidence it does other things
(11:08:13) Dragonene: seems there's more magma in this village than in minecraft
(11:08:16) Praxagaros: Im not sure what they are talking about anyway jstick
(11:08:21) jsticker: :)
(11:08:32) fartronomicon: praxa: minecraft!
(11:08:33) fartronomicon: play it
(11:08:47) Praxagaros: what genre? premise?
(11:08:52) Praxagaros: addictive?
(11:08:55) C418: genre: playground
(11:08:58) C418: build with blocks
(11:09:00) hao-1: digging
(11:09:01) C418: addictive

(11:10:58) FinDude: pumps n pipes for playing around with the liquids
(11:11:14) Evil-Ville: Notch I just saw the new video I love you
(11:11:23) pyl: or just faucet tiles :)
(11:11:34) pyl: but water needs to be sorted out first
(11:11:43) pyl: and right now notch rightfully concentrates on save/load
(11:11:47) nihilocrat: you can kind of already make "pipes"
(11:11:49) Praxagaros: is this a multiplayer game?
(11:11:50) Dragonene: nice arne
(11:11:54) nihilocrat: more like just aqueducts
(11:11:56) C418: no
(11:12:00) nihilocrat: except there's no high water
(11:12:05) C418: multiplayer is still a to do
(11:12:18) Praxagaros: So those people jumping around are just insane ai kids?
(11:12:23) nihilocrat: yes
(11:12:30) nihilocrat: mobs
(11:12:31) Evil-Ville: Why do people think they are players?
(11:12:37) Impossible left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:12:37) Evil-Ville: They don't even do anything other than jump around
(11:12:40) C418: because they are random
(11:12:40) Praxagaros: good deal.
(11:12:45) C418: and the only moving things
(11:12:46) Praxagaros: I just started playing.
(11:12:50) hao-1: he did say "ai"
(11:12:59) Praxagaros: Like not even a minute ago.
(11:13:41) Evil-Ville: I was talking in general
(11:14:24) Rosetta [Rosetta@84.13.157.128] entered the room.
(11:15:38) Praxagaros: those kids are creeping me out.
(11:15:43) Praxagaros: just hit bedrock.
(11:15:57) JohannesG [Adium@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(11:16:02) FinDude: it was more entertraining where there was no bedrock
(11:16:10) FinDude: dig dig dig faaaaaaaaaaaall
(11:16:23) Stargoat: heh
(11:16:24) nihilocrat: honestly a deeper map is probably more entertaining than a wide map
(11:16:48) JohannesG: are we talking about minecraft?
(11:16:57) Dragonene: that they are
(11:17:00) nihilocrat: oh man, when level saving gets in, there are probably going to be some pretty ridiculously intricate maps
(11:17:11) nihilocrat: people with lots of time
(11:17:13) pyl: 128x128x128 woot
(11:17:17) Dragonene: Updated: http://x2d.org/categories/daily-sketches/
(11:17:20) JohannesG: i agree, deeper map gets my vote
(11:17:33) fartronomicon: deep AND wider!
(11:17:38) FinDude: lol
(11:17:40) FinDude: greedy
(11:17:55) JohannesG: WE WANT INFINITE MAP!
(11:18:01) fartronomicon: i want the fortress mode
(11:18:23) FinDude: one thing id like is to have the out-of-draw distance stuff to be drawn as water instead of gay black
(11:18:35) fartronomicon: fog
(11:18:35) jsticker: Dragonene, this one I like: http://www.x2d.org/pixels/dawn1-2x.png
(11:18:37) fartronomicon: fog would fix that
(11:18:42) Dragonene: jsticker: ta :)
(11:18:43) fartronomicon: also distant mountains should look faint
(11:18:44) jsticker: The nightly sky bit could be cut, but I like it
(11:18:45) nihilocrat: or, uh
(11:18:50) michael: god damnit, why is ratatats lp3 so good
(11:18:52) nihilocrat: you can just use GL fog
(11:18:56) nihilocrat: :P
(11:18:57) Dragonene: jsticker: less sky, you mean?
(11:18:59) fartronomicon: yeah, that's what i meant nihil
(11:19:08) jsticker: Yeah, Dragonene
(11:19:10) nihilocrat: k
(11:19:21) jsticker: But that's just if I were to print it out and hang it into my room
(11:19:30) Dragonene: Heh
(11:19:33) Dragonene: I don't think you'd do that :D
(11:19:40) michael: dragonene, kachin dolls!!! :D
(11:19:47) Praxagaros: this game makes me want to return to 1993
(11:19:51) jsticker: I dunno, maybe when I move somewhere with ugly walls or something, and I still remember your pic
(11:19:52) jsticker: :D
(11:21:15) nihilocrat: pueblo architecture is pretty cool
(11:21:30) Dragonene: michael: yeah, dock suggested I try that
(11:21:36) Dragonene: It was hard tho :P
(11:22:22) fartronomicon: what pueblo?
(11:22:22) Praxagaros: good day..
(11:22:30) Praxagaros left the room.
(11:22:38) nihilocrat: oh
(11:22:43) nihilocrat: the ones they tell us about in school
(11:22:50) nihilocrat: so I guess it's an inaccurate blanket term
(11:22:53) fartronomicon: oh i thought it was a pic
(11:23:24) fartronomicon: not in reference to anything in irc?
(11:23:37) Dragonene: my pixelled doll I believe.
(11:26:36) nihilocrat: the Pueblo in general
(11:26:53) nihilocrat: oh I see
(11:27:03) nihilocrat: Pueblo is the term for the village
(11:27:12) nihilocrat: the actual tribes are, well, their own tribes
(11:27:24) fartronomicon: yeah i know what they are
(11:27:28) fartronomicon: i was just wondering why you brought it up
(11:27:34) varmint left the room (quit: Quit: Client exiting).

(11:28:01) Stargoat: hmm
(11:28:05) Stargoat: you what?
(11:28:09) Stargoat: minecraft
(11:28:12) Stargoat: reminds me of lego
(11:28:15) Stargoat: which is fucking awesome.
(11:28:18) fartronomicon: it is similar
(11:28:32) fartronomicon: pre-specialization lego when you just got a bucket full of blocks
(11:28:52) Stargoat: not just on a "you build shit", but it's bringing up a feeling of nostalgia... freeform building shit, even though you know you'll destroy it as soon as it's built
(11:29:17) Stargoat: perhaps minecraft should never have saving implimented
(11:29:17) Stargoat: haha
(11:29:27) fartronomicon: maybe a game mode where you can't
(11:29:29) fartronomicon: and there's a timer
(11:29:31) fartronomicon: or something
(11:29:36) fartronomicon: like buddhist sand paintings
(11:29:40) nihilocrat: perhaps notch is going to implement sloped blocks
(11:30:02) nihilocrat: and then go whole hog and start putting little antennae and other bits everywhere
(11:30:16) nihilocrat: and then cross over to the dark side and having entire mountains be one big shaped block
(11:30:19) Dragonene: fartron: http://www.x2d.org/pixels/figurines1.png
(11:30:26) fartronomicon: press 9 for the "front of spaceship" block!
(11:30:33) nihilocrat: I have obvious bias, but I like the sort of transitional pieces the most
(11:30:38) nihilocrat: late 80s, early 90s
(11:30:40) fartronomicon: that looks good Dragonene
(11:30:59) fartronomicon: are you getting your palettes off colourlovers?
(11:31:01) Dragonene: fartronomicon: Oh, I just meant that that's probably why they started talking pueblos.
(11:31:13) Dragonene: I'm getting them off other people who are probably getting them from colourlovers.

(11:41:21) jsticker: They've lost a bit of their raw-ness in future songs, but their first album is really great
(11:41:22) fartronomicon: i downloaded it
(11:41:34) fartronomicon: plays music or whatever
(11:41:52) jsticker: Play Music For You, yeah
(11:41:59) jsticker: They made a second album called Your Heart Feels
(11:42:00) JohannesG: the best think about 700 spam comments to a placeholder blog post is that it is quite helpful when designing and styling the comment part of the blog :P
(11:42:04) jsticker: I think it might be an EP though
(11:42:12) fartronomicon: their name is a new order reference and they sampled daft punk in the first 10 seconds of that song
(11:42:17) fartronomicon: and i think that pretty much sums them up
(11:42:19) JohannesG: after i'm done designing this website i think i'll install some anti-spam module to the CMS :P
(11:42:32) jsticker: Sounds like you don't like them so much
(11:42:43) fartronomicon: no, i do
(11:42:54) fartronomicon: but i also think they have a limited range
(11:42:59) fartronomicon: between new order and daft punk
(11:43:20) fartronomicon: which are two bands i like
(11:44:12) C418: askimet is lovely
(11:44:59) JohannesG: i think i'll start with some simple captcha stuff
(11:45:18) JohannesG: then i'll look into some better anti-spam systems.
(11:45:35) JohannesG: askimet is worth a look i guess.
(11:45:35) C418: I don't like making music for other peoples game
(11:45:41) RinkuHero: why
(11:45:42) C418: but this time I feel really optimistic
(11:45:45) RinkuHero: do you hate people
(11:45:49) RinkuHero: :D
(11:45:50) fartronomicon: or do you hate games
(11:45:52) C418: no, its just...
(11:45:56) C418: I don't want to disappoint
(11:45:57) RinkuHero: ah
(11:45:59) RinkuHero: makes sense
(11:46:20) C418: but this game I really like. and I think I know what music could fit
(11:46:43) Dragonene: huh
(11:46:53) Dragonene: for some reason it's decided to cut off the rightmost part of a table
(11:46:55) Dragonene: it looks weird
(11:46:58) Dragonene: but I guess I can live with it
(11:47:06) fartronomicon: you are using tables?
(11:47:07) fartronomicon: with css?
(11:47:08) C418: I wasn't talking about dragonenes game, but I think it will be fun too :)
(11:47:17) fartronomicon: why not one or the other
(11:48:47) C418: it's cool nobody asks which games I mean
(11:48:50) C418: makes it even more fun :)
(11:49:32) fartronomicon: Dragonene, you should use divs
(11:49:59) Jr: C418
(11:50:06) Jr: Bam 52 is broken
(11:50:19) JohannesG: tables = EVIL
(11:50:23) Jr: The requested URL /bam.jpg/audio/konddnow.mp3 was not found on this server.
(11:50:23) JohannesG: divs = headache
(11:50:29) fartronomicon: divs are awesome
(11:50:32) Dragonene: fartron: I don't care
(11:50:37) Dragonene: I use both
(11:50:39) Dragonene: and I mix them
(11:50:40) Dragonene: with pride
(11:50:41) fartronomicon: ok
(11:50:48) JohannesG: divs are awesome and a lot better than tables, but still can be a horrible headache
(11:50:51) fartronomicon: but that may be causing you more headaches than you need to have
(11:50:53) Dragonene: people keep saying "go use divs" and I say "I've used both, I see no reason they're better."
(11:51:11) Dragonene: fartronomicon: Maybe. Or maybe not.
(11:51:18) C418: ah yes
(11:51:24) fartronomicon: ok :P
(11:51:25) C418: the podcast thing is broken
(11:51:31) nihilocrat: tables actually lay stuff out in a tabular format
(11:51:32) C418: just remove bam from the url
(11:51:38) nihilocrat: divs force you to do a bunch of fiddling in CSS
(11:51:41) nihilocrat: and wear a turtleneck
(11:51:44) fartronomicon: i stopped using tables for page layout in 98
(11:51:55) ***fartronomicon is hardcore
(11:52:10) Dragonene: fartronomicon: That's not hardcore?
(11:52:14) Dragonene: I stopped using tables as well
(11:52:17) Dragonene: then I started again
(11:52:25) fartronomicon: i'm still hardcore
(11:52:30) Dragonene: because I realized the "no-tables hype" was just bs :P
(11:52:44) nihilocrat: it's more style / personal opinion
(11:52:50) nihilocrat: plus flexibility
(11:52:52) Dragonene: yep.
(11:52:59) nihilocrat: most sites, when redesigned
(11:53:04) nihilocrat: are just going to be redone
(11:53:21) thewreck left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:54:11) Dragonene: Hah, I got it right!
(11:54:13) Dragonene: I'm a genius.
(11:54:30) fartronomicon: you are hardcore too
(11:54:44) hao-1: i have run out of internets
(11:54:50) RinkuHero: how
(11:54:50) jsticker: :(
(11:54:58) hao-1: not enough bookmarks
(11:54:59) jsticker: Do you want some of mine?
(11:55:06) hao-1: no i should be working
(11:55:13) jsticker: On Dyson?
(11:55:15) hao-1: stupid fish code
(11:55:16) jsticker: That is true
(11:55:17) hao-1: no
(11:55:19) RinkuHero: fish?
(11:55:19) jsticker: Work that Dyson
(11:55:23) hao-1: yeah fish
(11:55:27) RinkuHero: what type of fish
(11:55:42) hao-1: imagine trying to code a fish that swims in an arbitrary area of water
(11:55:51) RinkuHero: hmm
(11:56:04) RinkuHero: maybe you could like
(11:56:11) RinkuHero: pick an arbitrary point in that area at random
(11:56:15) RinkuHero: then make the fish swim there
(11:56:16) RinkuHero: then repeat
(11:56:24) RinkuHero: (finding a path to that point)
(11:56:25) hao-1: the water can move hehe
(11:56:28) RinkuHero: ah
(11:56:30) hao-1: i've got it following the water around, pretty much
(11:56:40) hao-1: falls out if the water moves too fast
(11:56:41) Massena left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:56:58) hao-1: also sometimes it floats out of the water and scoots to the back and falls out there
(11:57:22) hao-1: horrible
(11:57:32) fartronomicon: http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/nature/steering/
(11:57:33) OEP: it's a fish on the brink of evolution
(11:57:36) fartronomicon: i like these hao
(11:57:47) fartronomicon: the wander one might be useful
(11:57:47) hao-1: ah like red3d
(11:57:52) hao-1: yeah
(11:58:15) Dragonene: anybody used wordpress's php commands?
(11:58:17) hao-1: water's pretty much always in motion though. i think i don't need actual movement AI as much as keeping the thing inside the water while it moves around
(11:58:35) OEP: Dragonene: somewhat.. I've built themes before
(11:58:39) fartronomicon: i was thinking you could tweak the wander so it stayed inside the volume
(11:58:57) fartronomicon: but if the water is moving maybe you could give the fish it's own vector system
(11:59:00) fartronomicon: relative to the volume of water
(11:59:08) fartronomicon: with a transform or something
(11:59:09) RinkuHero: perhaps you could grade each segment of water on a scale
(11:59:18) RinkuHero: based on how likely it is that water will no longe be there soon
(11:59:24) RinkuHero: and then cause the fish to move up the scale
(11:59:36) RinkuHero: towards the areas of water that it's likely water will be next
(11:59:41) hao-1: at the moment what I do is scan the area for water particles (the water's made from particles) and use the velocities there to guide the fish around
(12:00:10) OEP: could you model the water as a vector field?
(12:00:24) hao-1: not without fundamentally rewriting the game
(12:01:16) RinkuHero: make the fish a particle of water
(12:01:20) RinkuHero: or follow a single particle
(12:01:27) hao-1: yeah, thought about that, that's not too bad
(12:01:31) hao-1: i tried that with the key before
(12:01:47) hao-1: designers didn't like it too much but maybe they'll fall for it this time
(12:03:37) OEP: is it physics-based?  you could just make the fish a really big water molecule and model it as the collisions which drive the fish.. all the particle stuff I think off seems too cpu-heav
(12:03:55) Dragonene: OEP: Do you know how to get the category being requested currently?
(12:04:03) Dragonene: if the page is, say, /categories/X
(12:04:11) OEP: the ID?
(12:04:14) OEP: or the name?
(12:05:05) Dragonene: the name
(12:05:05) JohannesG left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(12:05:24) OEP: hrm not off hand
(12:06:26) OEP: Dragonene: the_category() doesn't do what you want it to?
(12:07:33) Dragonene: I think the_category is used inside the loop to get the current post's category
(12:07:37) Dragonene: I want the page's category
(12:08:53) OEP: I think wordpress still goes through the loop even with pages... in a way
(12:09:07) OEP: did you try it?
(12:10:17) OEP: As well, I think pages can be in multiple categories
(12:10:43) Dragonene: nope, didn't try it yet
(12:10:43) OEP: Dragonene: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_the_category#Get_the_Post_Categories_From_Outside_the_Loop
(12:10:45) Dragonene: I will soonish
(12:11:30) Dragonene: hm
(12:11:36) Dragonene: that seems to still require a post to go by tho?
(12:11:52) OEP: that will give you an object with everything about the category
(12:12:17) OEP: what's your situation? you're viewing a page and just want the category printed in plaintext?
(12:12:22) OEP: I think this will do it
(12:12:44) michael left the room (quit: Quit: michael).
(12:12:44) Dragonene: well see
(12:12:49) nyarla left the room (quit: Quit: glurk ).
(12:12:51) Dragonene: I'm filtering my links based on category
(12:13:02) Dragonene: so different subpages can give different links.
(12:13:21) Jr left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(12:13:42) JohannesG [Adium@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(12:13:47) OEP: Are you using Exec-PHP? Or editing the code manually?
(12:13:56) Stargoat: hmm
(12:13:56) Dragonene: editing manually
(12:13:59) OEP: (I might suggest getting Exec-PHP if you haven't)
(12:14:16) OEP: it's pretty nice -- lets you define which widgets appear on the page using PHP code
(12:15:12) OEP: for pages, I usually avoid using categories and use subpages
(12:15:30) OEP: check out this: http://www.spranklestudios.com/
(12:15:51) OEP: click one of those thinks up top. I think it's doing what you want right?
(12:15:56) jsticker: If corpus joins, could someone tell him I'll be back in about an hour or two? :s
(12:16:08) RinkuHero: http://www.crispygamer.com/columns/2009-05-15/turtle-turtle-turtle-rtses-for-basebodies-3.aspx
(12:16:15) RinkuHero: review of ID there
(12:16:33) jsticker: Sites still review your game? That's cool
(12:16:41) FinDude [chatzilla@a91-153-160-97.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(12:16:42) RinkuHero: yeah, i like that it keeps getting new reviews 2 years after release
(12:16:48) jsticker: Oh, TD special
(12:16:51) RinkuHero: yeah
(12:16:53) RinkuHero: it's one of many
(12:17:05) jsticker: The opening sentence is quite charming
(12:20:28) Dragonene: wtf
(12:20:36) Dragonene: why does it refuse to remove the list thingies with css
(12:20:38) Dragonene: the bullet points
(12:20:40) Dragonene: They're ugly
(12:20:42) Dragonene: I don't want them
(12:21:56) jsticker: Dragonene says, "fuck that shit"
(12:22:02) Dragonene: aha
(12:22:03) Dragonene: found it
(12:22:27) Dragonene: no
(12:22:30) Dragonene: now it works even less :S
(12:22:39) Dragonene: Yay
(12:22:41) Dragonene: it works \o/
(12:24:42) Dragonene: wtf
(12:24:53) Dragonene: there's no way to change the ID of the links
(12:24:58) Dragonene: so I have to rename them to change the order
(12:25:00) Dragonene: that's stupid
(12:25:17) C418: I had to deactivate podpress on my homepage
(12:25:20) JohannesG: are u using some CMS?
(12:25:24) C418: this means almost nothing is downloadable anymore
(12:25:24) JohannesG: dragonene
(12:26:50) Dragonene: JohannesG: Wordpress
(12:27:39) fartronomicon: rinku that's a pretty glowing review
(12:28:01) Dragonene: what the fudge
(12:28:10) fartronomicon: you are the king of TD
(12:28:10) Dragonene: why did wordpress just decide my front page does not exist?
(12:28:11) Dragonene: !
(12:29:04) OEP: hey I was gonna suggest that instead of categories, use subpages for pages
(12:29:22) Dragonene: I could
(12:29:25) Dragonene: but you can't post to them
(12:29:31) Dragonene: I actually use a subpage for about
(12:29:34) gsoto [gsoto@r190-135-166-167.dialup.adsl.anteldata.net.uy] entered the room.
(12:29:35) Dragonene: and for contact
(12:29:36) Dragonene: but not for games
(12:29:52) Dragonene: by using a category for games I can post new games as separate posts and have an rss feed for it
(12:30:06) tantan: going to gamestop in a bit
(12:30:10) OEP: I gotcha
(12:30:16) tantan: what are some good not psp/ds/ps3 games
(12:30:34) Dragonene: but it bothers me that it just decide my front page doesn't exist.
(12:30:37) Dragonene: I have no idea why :S
(12:30:42) OEP: hrm...
(12:30:43) Dragonene: because it most definitely does
(12:31:18) OEP: <3 Wordpress
(12:33:09) JohannesG: <3 Drupal
(12:33:15) Xander: some good notpsp/ds/ps3 games?
(12:33:50) Dragonene: wtf :S
(12:33:53) Dragonene: now the entire site went down
(12:34:00) RinkuHero: what's notpsp/ds/ps3?
(12:34:00) Dragonene: I think something's wrong with my host
(12:34:13) Xander: I guess it could be anything on anything else
(12:34:19) RinkuHero: okay
(12:34:22) RinkuHero: get persona 3 and 4!
(12:34:25) RinkuHero: for ps2
(12:34:31) Xander: Princess Crown on the Saturn
(12:34:47) Dragonene: can anyone access www.x2d.org?
(12:34:52) xe0n left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:34:58) RinkuHero: i can
(12:35:01) RinkuHero: it says 'not found'
(12:35:05) fartronomicon: ditto
(12:35:26) Xander: tritto
(12:35:35) RinkuHero: quatto
(12:35:39) Dragonene: wtf :S
(12:35:49) Dragonene: so it just decided to block out my IP from accessing the domain
(12:35:55) RinkuHero: haha
(12:35:56) Dragonene: as in, I can't even access my own FTP
(12:36:03) RinkuHero: try a different browser
(12:36:08) RinkuHero: it might be a nameserver thing
(12:36:13) Dragonene: I did.
(12:36:15) RinkuHero: hm
(12:36:23) Dragonene: Tried opera, chrome and explorer for FTP
(12:36:29) Xander: "Charles. Get out the rifle. We're being fucked"
(12:36:44) Dragonene: well isn't that bloody great
(12:36:53) Dragonene: shutting me out of my own site while I'm editing it
(12:36:55) Dragonene: and while it's broken
(12:36:57) RinkuHero: haha
(12:37:01) RinkuHero: get a better host
(12:37:07) Dragonene: It's never once failed me before
(12:37:09) RinkuHero: like http://nearlyfreespeech.net
(12:37:13) Dragonene: I've had it for more than 5 years
(12:37:16) RinkuHero: ah
(12:37:17) RinkuHero: email them
(12:37:22) Dragonene: I would
(12:37:28) Dragonene: if I could access anything they have
(12:37:31) Dragonene: I can't even go to one.com
(12:37:31) RinkuHero: haha
(12:37:34) RinkuHero: weird
(12:37:34) varmint [varmint@S0106001195539758.vs.shawcable.net] entered the room.
(12:37:35) Dragonene: which is their domain
(12:37:47) Dragonene: might be this stupid australia internet
(12:37:50) Dragonene: australian* internet
(12:37:51) hao-1 left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(12:37:55) Movius: working for me
(12:37:59) Dragonene: yeah
(12:38:04) Dragonene: well it's not working for me
(12:38:13) tantan: minecraft is better than infiniminer
(12:38:15) fartronomicon: dragonene try changing your dns
(12:38:15) Dragonene: I can't access my own site or the one.com front page
(12:38:23) Dragonene: fartron: I don't think I can
(12:38:24) Movius: it's prime ISP servicing time
(12:38:26) fartronomicon: sure you can
(12:38:28) tantan: and is a better spelunking game than spelunky
(12:38:28) fartronomicon: are you on xp?
(12:38:34) Dragonene: Well see
(12:38:36) Xander: Stupid Devil Summoner and it's demon specific puzzles!
(12:38:43) Dragonene: I'm behind a NAT
(12:38:44) RinkuHero: devil summoner 2?
(12:38:48) RinkuHero: i ordered that recently
(12:38:50) Dragonene: and I bet it does DNS lookups from the NAT
(12:38:57) RinkuHero: from amazon
(12:38:57) fartronomicon: yeah but you can make it do opendns lookup
(12:39:04) fartronomicon: i guess you don't have access to the nat?
(12:39:09) Dragonene: no
(12:39:10) fartronomicon: because you could also force it to update
(12:39:13) Dragonene: It's the student village thingy
(12:39:28) Dragonene: okay
(12:39:29) fartronomicon: if you go into the connection properties there is a place to add dns servers
(12:39:32) Dragonene: what's the opendns?
(12:39:33) Xander: Yeah, it's pretty good, though really similar to the first
(12:39:38) RinkuHero: i didn't try the first
(12:39:44) RinkuHero: will i be missing much
(12:39:46) fartronomicon: http://www.opendns.com/
(12:39:47) RinkuHero: by not playing the first first
(12:40:16) Xander: Not really, they recap things at the start and none of it is really relevant beyond a couple of character introductions
(12:40:22) RinkuHero: ah
(12:40:47) Xander: Though awesomely you can encounter demons you worked with in the 1st game if you're using saved data and they join you without hesitation
(12:40:53) Xander: It's like a heart warming reunion
(12:40:55) Dragonene: fartronomicon: opendns.com doesn't work for me either.
(12:40:58) fartronomicon: ha
(12:41:04) nihilocrat: did anyone watch Lord of The Rings before reading the book?
(12:41:04) Dragonene: can you give me a dns IP?
(12:41:08) fartronomicon: yeah hold on
(12:41:12) Dragonene: ta
(12:41:19) nihilocrat: I thought Fellowship was pretty weird because they never introduced half the characters
(12:41:20) fartronomicon: Our nameservers are 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220.
(12:41:40) xe0n [jake@adsl-99-32-196-32.dsl.chcgil.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(12:41:45) nihilocrat: but I don't know what effect that would have had on someone who didn't know them already
(12:41:45) Xander: Kind of a shame that it's blatantly the low-budget offshoot of the SMT franchise, there's no voice acting at all. But I still really like both of them, they just aren't quite as good as the other SMT games
(12:42:34) Dragonene: let's see if the opendns stuff works then.
(12:42:34) LordMetroid left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(12:42:40) Xander: God I loved Nocturne/Lucifer's Call
(12:42:54) Dragonene: heh no
(12:42:56) Dragonene: It works for google
(12:43:03) Dragonene: but not for opendns.com, x2d.org or one.com
(12:43:06) RinkuHero: i liked nocturne
(12:43:10) RinkuHero: but i never finished it

(12:43:15) RinkuHero: since after i got very far in the game
(12:43:16) Dragonene: worst ISP ever apparently
(12:43:21) RinkuHero: the saved game memory card died
(12:43:26) fartronomicon: you have to put the opendns servers above your normal ones
(12:43:30) fartronomicon: so it checks them first
(12:43:55) Xander: Damn, that sucks
(12:43:57) Dragonene: Well I had "obtain DNS server automatically"
(12:44:00) Dragonene: now I only have the opendns ones
(12:44:02) Dragonene: that's all I can do
(12:44:05) fartronomicon: h
(12:44:05) fartronomicon: m
(12:44:10) Dragonene: it'll probably still use the NAT's dns:s

(12:48:13) Stargoat: hmm. What's some free screen-capture software, that allows you to record for more than a minute?
(12:48:16) RinkuHero: it's on the right side
(12:48:18) RinkuHero: upper right
(12:48:22) Dragonene: but it decided to also rename any *posts* with the news category to links.
(12:48:29) RinkuHero: also the fish reportedly direct you to where you need to go

(12:51:29) Stargoat: I wanna record this minecraft thingy
(12:51:34) fartronomicon: i used camtasia for mine
(12:51:38) Stargoat: been working on it for over 2 hours :|
(12:51:47) RinkuHero: i use fraps
(12:52:08) corpus: nah, the fish just seem to swim in a rotating figure 8
(12:52:09) RinkuHero: however
(12:52:12) RinkuHero: fraps may not work on java
(12:52:21) RinkuHero: since fraps tends to work best on full screen games
(12:52:24) RinkuHero: not browser games
(12:52:32) fartronomicon: camtasia is really easy, you can just click the part of the screen you want to record
(12:52:36) Siiseli: yeah
(12:52:39) fartronomicon: or drag a box
(12:52:41) Siiseli: camtasia is goodtastic
(12:53:27) fartronomicon: i don't like their compression so much
(12:53:35) fartronomicon: but it's cool they try to fit everything in one suite
(12:53:42) corpus: bah, i cba
(12:53:47) corpus: i isn't enjoyable
(12:54:53) Siiseli: fartronomicon, compression is up to you...
(12:54:59) fartronomicon: yeah i know
(12:55:07) fartronomicon: i just used their default youtube settings hoping it would be good
(12:55:10) fartronomicon: and it kind of looked like crap
(12:55:15) Stargoat: hmm
(12:55:21) fartronomicon: i mean not really crap
(12:55:24) fartronomicon: but worse than i wanted
(12:55:27) Stargoat: it's not very good
(12:55:33) Stargoat: I might just make a few screenies
(12:55:50) fartronomicon: might as well get camtasia in the meantime

(12:59:40) Dragonene_: "I don't particularly like the sidebar, but I couldn't think of another way to fit links."
(12:59:45) Stargoat: oh
(13:00:08) Stargoat: side bar?
(13:00:17) Stargoat: all I see is "links"
(13:00:21) Stargoat: and it's not a bar
(13:00:25) Stargoat: more like... a side square

(13:01:22) ***OEP posted his game to Feedback forum

(13:23:05) fartronomicon: you say it's good though?
(13:23:16) Arne: well, I'd give it a 3/5
(13:23:31) Arne: which is about as high grade games get from me
(13:24:03) Arne: It has some fun stuff, but it's obviously dated
(13:24:19) Stargoat: what does Super Mario Bros. 3 get?
(13:26:08) Arne: 2/5
(13:26:19) FuckPingOut is now known as Androu1
(13:26:23) fartronomicon: ouch
(13:26:26) Arne: It was nice and polished but it's not really my type of game in the end
(13:26:45) fartronomicon: i thought mario bros was everyones type of game
(13:26:53) Stargoat: woah, woah woah
(13:27:01) Stargoat: Arne officially has no taste in anything ever.
(13:27:01) Stargoat: :(
(13:27:11) Arne: well, most games get 1 or 0 / 5
(13:27:19) Stargoat: why, arn't you edgy
(13:27:24) Stargoat: haha
(13:27:25) konjak: what be MML
(13:27:28) Stargoat: so, what game gets a 5/5?
(13:27:33) konjak: Mega Man Leper?
(13:27:34) Stargoat: megaman legends
(13:27:35) Arne: my 5's are like OMG I'll play this forever N64 kid

(13:27:50) konjak: Arne's 5 are C64 games
(13:27:56) Stargoat: Starcraft is probably my 5/5, dispite its flaws
(13:27:57) Arne: mml gets 3/5
(13:28:09) Stargoat: I doubt a month has gone by where I haven't played it.
(13:28:16) konjak: Majora's Mask is my 6/5
(13:28:19) Arne: it's ok, as in partly fun or great fun, partly kinda boring
(13:28:25) jw: http://www.thepoppenkast.com/data/JW/crapgames.jpg
(13:28:52) Arne: 3/5 for me means ok enjoyable game
(13:28:57) Stargoat: MM is the best 3d zelda.
(13:29:07) Stargoat: this is objective fact.
(13:29:17) konjak: I was always a bigger fan of the 3D games than 2D
(13:29:24) fartronomicon: yeah but that's like saying rocky 5 is the best rocky sequel
(13:29:30) fartronomicon: it means nothing
(13:29:38) Stargoat: I actually quite liked Zelda 2, apart from its dripping difficulty.
(13:29:48) konjak: barely played it
(13:29:51) JohannesG [Adium@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(13:29:52) konjak: Played half of Zelda 1
(13:30:03) Arne: some games might get 3.5 from me, I played Quake 1 a lot, and TA
(13:30:12) fartronomicon: my NES used to be in my basement and when i see zelda 1 screens i can still smell that room
(13:30:26) fartronomicon: quake 1 is the best game ever
(13:30:31) Arne: I've just normalized my scale after 5=a real OMG jizzing for years
(13:30:32) Stargoat: what does battletoads get, Arne?
(13:30:37) konjak: I have a taste or scent associated with most great games I own
(13:30:38) Arne: never played it much
(13:30:44) Stargoat: ah
(13:30:50) doohan: I see what you did there jw
(13:31:05) jw: <3
(13:31:08) konjak: I think a 5-star system warrants several 5/5 games since it's, well, just five point
(13:31:10) konjak: s
(13:31:14) Stargoat: I prefer the out of five rating system, but the guy running GHr insists on out-of-10.
(13:31:38) konjak: IGN has a faux-10 system
(13:31:43) konjak: Using decimals
(13:31:48) konjak: so it's more like 100
(13:31:51) doohan: 0.000001?
(13:31:56) konjak: just the one
(13:32:03) Arne: My system leaves room for games which makes me really really excited
(13:32:13) konjak: Something smells either like iron or like blood in here
(13:32:31) Arne: I guess my 5/5 would be someone else's 9.5/5
(13:32:55) Arne: I mean people gave Twilight princess 10/10 or close
(13:32:56) konjak: Arne, do you review things professionally, because you've pondered this system a lot
(13:33:12) Arne: I doubt those people are still playing it until their balls turn blue
(13:33:27) Stargoat: TP isn't a great game.
(13:33:28) konjak: Some games are fantastic but hard to replay
(13:33:31) Arne: there are professional reviewers?
(13:33:36) konjak: TP is underrated
(13:33:46) Stargoat: ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
(13:33:49) konjak: But it's a bitch to replay because of its two-hour tutorial
(13:33:53) fartronomicon: TP sucks
(13:33:54) Stargoat: it was pretty uninspired, I though
(13:33:55) Stargoat: thought*
(13:33:56) Drakkar: DF is my 10
(13:34:01) nihilocrat: I think review scores give a bad message
(13:34:13) nihilocrat: I like the film reviews NPR does
(13:34:22) nihilocrat: they don't assign scores, they just review the film
(13:34:23) doohan: TP?
(13:34:28) Stargoat: the industry seems to think 80 = game is actually playable
(13:34:31) konjak: Turkish Prince
(13:34:32) nihilocrat: they do a good job of saying what sort of person would like the film, what sort of person would not
(13:34:35) Stargoat: and then anything slightly better than playable is 100
(13:34:44) nihilocrat: well
(13:34:52) doohan: Used to be 60 was an ok game
(13:34:54) nihilocrat: this might be due to grade inflation we've experienced as kids
(13:35:00) Arne: I'm just saying that my 3/5 is an enjoyable game which I can have some fun with for a few months, and maybe revisit years later.
(13:35:05) doohan: But they've fucked up the scoring by giving loads of games 100
(13:35:10) nihilocrat: if you get a 70 in high school, you are on the verge of complete failure
(13:35:21) nihilocrat: and you can regularly get scores above 100
(13:35:23) nihilocrat: by doing extra credit
(13:35:24) konjak: Stargoat, that's true. Some sites try not to abide the new standard but then the readers go WHAT THE FUCK when they give a big game 8/10
(13:35:37) doohan: It's nonsense
(13:35:50) nihilocrat: readers will always bitch if a game they like isn't perfect
(13:35:52) Arne: high score = free adspace on boxes
(13:35:54) nihilocrat: *rated perfect
(13:35:56) doohan: And bioshock isn't even that fun.
(13:35:58) Stargoat: it sucks when interesting games, with a few minor flaws, get shit-canned by the system, ending up with shitty-looking 60s. Not that 60 is a bad score, but when the next halo clone is a 90 average...
(13:36:01) Stargoat: something is wrong
(13:36:04) konjak: People were going nuts over a site giving TP 8.8, like it's the shittiest score ever
(13:36:16) nihilocrat: what's TP?
(13:36:22) konjak: Twilight Princess
(13:36:24) konjak: Zelda Wii
(13:36:24) Stargoat: twilight princess
(13:36:26) Arne: I wouldn't touch TP with a ten foot pole
(13:36:26) nihilocrat: ah
(13:36:29) nihilocrat: I played it
(13:36:32) fartronomicon: it doesn't deserve an 8
(13:36:34) nihilocrat: it was kinda boring in parts
(13:36:37) Stargoat: I wouldn't touch tp with MY 10 foot pole
(13:36:41) fartronomicon: i would give it a 4 at the very most
(13:36:42) Arne: I wonder if it's worse than Phantom Hourglass though
(13:36:45) fartronomicon: probably less
(13:36:50) konjak: Arne, PH is a turd
(13:36:56) nihilocrat: the 3d perspective tends to just make things annoying
(13:36:56) konjak: And I love TP
(13:36:59) Arne: a big poo poo turd
(13:37:13) nihilocrat: I'd prefer a 2D zelda any day
(13:37:17) Stargoat: phantom hourglass had some brilliant puzzles
(13:37:23) Arne: I have all the TP models
(13:37:26) Stargoat: but the game was waaay too fetchqeust heavy
(13:37:26) konjak: 3D is the evil, mirite
(13:37:39) doohan: marmite?
(13:37:46) nihilocrat: it's not evil, I just don't like 3d platformers
(13:37:47) Stargoat: vegemite
(13:37:48) Arne: They're decent, nothing more
(13:37:51) doohan: touche
(13:37:53) Arne: pretty boring designs
(13:37:54) nihilocrat: and 3d zelda is kinda a platformer
(13:38:01) konjak: PH was also full of artificial lengthening and unrealised potential in some puzzles
(13:38:10) Stargoat: zelda's totally not a platformer
(13:38:17) Stargoat: timing jumps is in no way a mechanic of the game
(13:38:18) konjak: Why have Link have to carry the boss key if the lock is RIGHT NEXT TO where you find it?!
(13:38:43) konjak: it could've been an interesting puzzle
(13:38:45) Arne: I don't mind the TP engine though
(13:38:45) doohan: That's a whole fetch quest itself
(13:38:51) Arne: it looks nice for a DS game
(13:38:56) doohan: tp is on the wii
(13:38:57) Stargoat: PH, arne*
(13:39:04) Arne: it's the philosophy of the design which disgusts me
(13:39:12) doohan: You mean the same game again?
(13:39:13) konjak: disgusts you?
(13:39:18) doohan: And again?
(13:39:19) doohan: And again?
(13:39:27) Arne: sorry, I meant PH
(13:39:28) fartronomicon: yeah tp isn't on ds
(13:39:44) fartronomicon: i can agree to that
(13:39:54) Stargoat: more games need to be Time Splitters
(13:40:00) konjak: Zelda is becoming repeditive, sure... I love Majora because it does do a whole lot different
(13:40:01) RinkuHero: zelda2 is a platformer
(13:40:10) RinkuHero: sort of
(13:40:18) Stargoat: I just want some classic, arcadey, FPSing fun
(13:40:21) Arne: It has some nice lowpoly stuff, effects, and I dodn't feel anything in special about the controls so I guess they were ok
(13:40:26) konjak: Lots of original "items" in being able to change shape with new abilities
(13:40:32) Stargoat: but every recent FPS takes its-self way too seriously
(13:40:35) Stargoat: except maybe TF2?
(13:40:37) Stargoat: I dunno.
(13:40:42) Stargoat: Time Splitters is an awesome series.
(13:40:49) Stargoat: is what I'm trying to say.
(13:41:13) konjak: Stargoat, Timesplitters is great. I did cheat in TS2 to get everything because it's ridiculously hard on Hard
(13:41:22) Stargoat: yeah man
(13:41:24) KonamiCode [chatzilla@cpe-76-174-91-167.socal.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(13:41:29) konjak: Everything had to be done right
(13:41:33) Stargoat: I never fgot through the whole game on hard
(13:41:42) michael [michael@96-25-78-24.war.clearwire-wmx.net] entered the room.
(13:41:43) Stargoat: but I did get gold or higher on all the arcade challenges
(13:41:47) konjak: I caved to cheating at the James Bond level
(13:41:59) konjak: since it's TIMED
(13:42:02) Stargoat: heh
(13:42:08) Stargoat: yeah, that stage is pretty ridiculous
(13:42:13) fartronomicon: i only ever played multiplayer timesplitters
(13:42:14) konjak: I beat TS3 on Hard
(13:42:18) fartronomicon: and found the gameplay inferior to halo
(13:42:31) Stargoat: :|
(13:42:38) Stargoat: TS3 is an easier game
(13:42:41) konjak: Halo's art design is the worst
(13:42:43) fartronomicon: but i didn't play much of it
(13:42:45) Kobel [Miranda@208.179.112.170] entered the room.
(13:42:49) konjak: yeah, it's a lot easier
(13:42:52) michael_ [michael@71-20-185-102.war.clearwire-wmx.net] entered the room.
(13:42:57) Arne: Spore would've been a 4/5 if it had been like I thought it was gonna be during the first vidoes/hype, but then it quickly became apparent that it wasn't much of a simulation
(13:43:02) Stargoat: I liked the single player more, in TS3, though
(13:43:11) Stargoat: but the multiplayer and arcade were way better in 2.
(13:43:25) Parthon [cheeeese@124-169-88-39.dyn.iinet.net.au] entered the room.
(13:43:40) Stargoat: Spore is 80% god 20% darwin. Or less.
(13:43:56) Parthon: what's darwin got to do with it?
(13:44:27) Stargoat: well, during the hyper-phase, it was all "evolution this, evolution that"
(13:44:27) Arne: Natural selection sim
(13:44:33) Stargoat: hype*
(13:44:41) Arne: yeah
(13:44:46) RinkuHero: yes, they changed the design midway
(13:44:49) RinkuHero: made it less sciency
(13:44:51) Stargoat: but it turned into a selection of creation-based minigames :p
(13:44:53) konjak: Stargoat, they TOOK AWAY flame tag in TS3?
(13:44:57) konjak: What was the point of doing that
(13:44:58) michael left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(13:44:59) nihilocrat: I'd argue Spore is more like 90% god
(13:45:00) Stargoat: hmm
(13:45:02) Stargoat: did they?
(13:45:03) nihilocrat: if not 100%
(13:45:06) Stargoat: I can't remember...
(13:45:08) konjak: yes
(13:45:11) Stargoat: I seem to recall it was still in?
(13:45:15) Stargoat: maybe as virus?
(13:45:17) konjak: Did they even keep Galdiator
(13:45:17) nihilocrat: I wish they had made it 50% / 50% like they were suggesting in the hype
(13:45:17) Stargoat: I dunno
(13:45:18) Parthon: it's like 45% god, 5% evolution and 50% drawing app
(13:45:30) konjak: Virus and Flame Tag aren't the same
(13:45:30) Arne: yeah, is there any natural selection and genetics in there, Memetics  comping from players aside?
(13:45:35) corpus [corpus@92-238-188-32.cable.ubr14.newc.blueyonder.co.uk] entered the room.
(13:45:47) Arne: coming*
(13:45:49) konjak: Virus is last man standing, Flame Tag is who burned the least amount of time, and only one person burns at one time
(13:45:52) Stargoat: I guess my only complaint is the weapons in the TS games feel weaker than they should. Perfect Dark got weapon meatyness perfect.
(13:46:31) Stargoat: ah right
(13:46:35) corpus: TS2 was awesome
(13:46:39) corpus: multiplayer was, I mean
(13:46:47) corpus: the singleplayer modes were never tat great
(13:46:53) Stargoat: they were fun in co-op
(13:46:59) Stargoat: more games need co-op.
(13:47:03) corpus: better in multiplayer proper, though
(13:47:04) Arne: if a game is going to appeal to me it needs persistent world simulation and ecology, and not a lot of games have that.
(13:47:06) Stargoat: Also, i like that style of level structure
(13:47:07) konjak: Too bad coop removed all the cutscenes
(13:47:20) Stargoat: independant levels, objectives, higher difficulty levels have more objectives
(13:47:22) konjak: or a lot of them
(13:47:29) corpus: that's pretty specific, Arne
(13:47:37) Stargoat: it makes it more interesting than "higher difficulty = enemies take more hits to kill"
(13:48:00) Stargoat: the story wasn't great, but there were some fun situations.
(13:48:02) ***corpus wears a scarf at Stargoat
(13:48:24) Stargoat: corpus is dangerous
(13:48:41) Arne: I don't know, it can be any tope of game, like DF is an asci game
(13:48:46) Arne: it could be a mario game
(13:48:51) Arne: or an RTS game
(13:49:07) corpus: but world simulation and ecology would be completely superfluous to a mario game
(13:49:11) fartronomicon: no way
(13:49:12) corpus: assuming you mean the platformers
(13:49:21) Arne: nah, it would work fine
(13:49:24) corpus: +persistent
(13:49:33) corpus: it might work fine, it just wouldn't add anything
(13:49:37) fartronomicon: yes it would
(13:49:39) Arne: sure it would
(13:49:52) Arne: you could defeat bowser by attacking his supply line
(13:49:57) fartronomicon: you're not thinking through what you are saying
(13:50:00) fartronomicon: corpus
(13:50:01) Arne: it would give the game a ton of depth
(13:50:03) konjak: that's dumb
(13:50:14) jw: does increpare go to irc
(13:50:20) konjak: Bowser was defeated because they cut off his food supply so he eventually starved in two years
(13:50:22) corpus: tends not to any more, jw
(13:50:24) konjak: But then so did Peach
(13:50:35) jw: I played judith
(13:50:44) corpus: fartronomicon: I can't tell if you're kidding or not
(13:50:50) fartronomicon: yeah i get that sometimes
(13:50:51) jw: and I felt like totally not wasting my time
(13:50:51) fartronomicon: but i'm not
(13:50:54) jw: want to talk to him about it
(13:50:55) corpus: because you're not arguing with what I'm saying
(13:50:57) corpus: so I can't
(13:51:06) fartronomicon: yeah, i know
(13:51:08) corpus: yeah
(13:51:14) Stargoat: Arne, you'd probably like Jagged Alliance 2!
(13:51:23) fartronomicon: did you see arne's platformer stuff recently
(13:51:26) corpus: I am going to castrate you, fartronomicon
(13:51:28) fartronomicon: with the spores and everything
(13:51:30) corpus: cow-style
(13:51:30) fartronomicon: ono
(13:51:43) Arne: Some would say it would be silly to being persistent world simulation and ecology into an ascii rougelike. What would you do in such a game, if not killing monsters in endless randomized caves? 
(13:51:58) corpus: but yeah, it could work in platformers
(13:52:02) fartronomicon: persistence and emergence can definitely add to a platformer
(13:52:05) corpus: I don't think it would be appropriate in mario, though
(13:52:15) corpus: or did you mean mario more as a generic example of a platformer
(13:52:15) fartronomicon: what if mushrooms grew
(13:52:17) The_Doctor: Zelda
(13:52:18) fartronomicon: and spread
(13:52:22) fartronomicon: but could be wiped out
(13:52:22) Stargoat: only mario is appropriate in mario
(13:52:26) fartronomicon: by over use
(13:52:29) Stargoat: Nintendo should stop fucking around with the classic IPs
(13:52:35) Stargoat: and start new IPs for new ideas
(13:52:36) Stargoat: :|!
(13:52:48) corpus: mario works because of its simplicity and purity of design, though
(13:52:57) fartronomicon: ok, so if your point is that mario is mario is mario
(13:52:58) fartronomicon: then yes
(13:52:59) RinkuHero: they'd make less money that way
(13:53:01) corpus: it's about the flow of the game, getting an ossum run
(13:53:05) RinkuHero: nintendo isn't an indie developer
(13:53:19) fartronomicon: i didn't think we were talking about changing mario though
(13:53:23) corpus: but yeah I can see that it could add something to [a platformer]
(13:53:24) Arne: Yeah, well, I meant the Mario world, I obviously wouldn't force the scroll, I'd make a network of levels with destructible terrain or whatever
(13:53:33) Stargoat: phht, what ever happened to professional integrity?
(13:53:42) RinkuHero: the only people who care about destructable terrain and ecosystems and such are techies though
(13:53:46) konjak: Miyamoto got to squeeze in Pikmin at least. Hopefully he gets such a chance again sometime.
(13:53:49) Stargoat: "oh hey, here's our new game, Mario 64. What? No, it doesn't play anything like the old games."
(13:53:52) corpus: Stargoat, Nintendo always has been and always will be a business
(13:54:00) nihilocrat: it's not about professional integrity when you've got a commodity
(13:54:01) Arne: it's not about the tech at all, it's about the emergence
(13:54:02) RinkuHero: i liked pikmin, yes
(13:54:08) RinkuHero: i'm looking forward to pikmin 3
(13:54:15) Stargoat: pikmin is good shit.
(13:54:17) konjak: I didn't play Pikmin
(13:54:27) corpus: destructible terrain was the only good thing about Red Faction
(13:54:29) Arne: Mario has destructible terrain already, and look at the emergent gameplay stuff which comes from it
(13:54:40) Arne: Imagine mario without crushable blocks
(13:54:43) corpus: my brother and I used to sit for ages on multiplayer mode, building tunnels from one base to the other
(13:54:43) fartronomicon: the new red faction demo is awesome btw
(13:54:46) corpus: using the rocket launcher
(13:54:48) corpus: it was mint
(13:54:54) RinkuHero: but imagine mario where everything was crushable
(13:54:57) RinkuHero: it'd lose something
(13:55:01) Stargoat: can you blow up the terrain, fartron?
(13:55:09) fartronomicon: you can smash everything
(13:55:10) fartronomicon: buildings
(13:55:11) fartronomicon: people
(13:55:12) Arne: no, it'd have to be different levels of crushability
(13:55:20) fartronomicon: driving a tank into a big building is very satisfying
(13:55:25) Stargoat: can I create a bunker out of a series of craters, though?
(13:55:27) corpus: I never played the sequel
(13:55:29) konjak: But that's not Mario, make it something else for crying out loud
(13:55:30) fartronomicon: not in the demo
(13:55:34) fartronomicon: i was concerned about that part
(13:55:34) Stargoat: hmm
(13:55:36) corpus: was it any good?
(13:55:39) jw left the room (quit: Quit: cowboyninjas are cooler then robotpirates).
(13:55:41) fartronomicon: but even if you can't, smashing everything was very very fun
(13:55:52) fartronomicon: you have a big sledge hammer
(13:55:54) konjak: If you need mario, make it a new Wrecking Crew
(13:55:54) fartronomicon: and it's sick
(13:56:01) Stargoat: dispite the fact that it wasn't a great game, Red Faction 2 was a lot of fun.
(13:56:05) Stargoat: especially the multiplayer
(13:56:09) fartronomicon: this one is huge huge huge
(13:56:12) Stargoat: despite*
(13:56:13) fartronomicon: and open in a gta way
(13:56:19) Stargoat: hmmmmmmmmmmm
(13:56:21) fartronomicon: plus the ability to break everything
(13:56:28) Stargoat: open in a gta way...
(13:56:35) fartronomicon: while running a guerilla conflict
(13:56:37) Stargoat: does it suffer from the same lack of direction as GTA?
(13:56:40) corpus: I really need to try that blocky mining game
(13:56:59) corpus: though deleting cubes isn't as fun as blowing tunnels through a rock face
(13:57:11) Arne: I just meant the Mario universe and the mario sidescroller thing and basic feel of the characters, naturally there would be differences, like the persistent simulation and ecology that I mentioned
(13:57:17) corpus: GTA, for me, has always been entirely about the emergent gameplay
(13:57:27) Stargoat: Arne doesn't violate copyright.
(13:57:32) Stargoat: oh wait...
(13:57:32) corpus: the missions have been repetetive and not overly interested since GTA3
(13:57:40) corpus: in my opinion, obviously
(13:57:45) corpus: repetitive*
(13:57:49) Arne: but yeah, it doesn't have to be graphically mario either
(13:57:57) Arne: it could be Giana Sisters
(13:58:04) Arne: or turrican
(13:58:05) fartronomicon: i'm not sure about lack of direction, the demo only has one level
(13:58:12) Stargoat: hmm.
(13:58:18) fartronomicon: but i spent a long time not doing the objective
(13:58:22) fartronomicon: because everything else was so fun
(13:59:01) Stargoat: the thing I have about most open-world/"sandbox" games, oblivion, gta etc... is sure, you can do whatever you want... but there's no real incentive past "fucking around" to deal with a situation creatively... because the outcome is always the same.
(13:59:16) Arne: Naturally some types of gameplay wouldn't work at all in a persistent world /ecology game, like pattern learning shooter stuff, knowing where all the baddies are in Probotector
(13:59:25) fartronomicon: by outcome do you mean the storyline?
(13:59:32) fartronomicon: because the outcome of car chases in gta is never the same
(13:59:41) fartronomicon: and in my mind gta is an action scene generator
(13:59:47) Stargoat: hmm
(13:59:57) Stargoat: perhaps
(13:59:59) nihilocrat: it's a very amusing sort of "action scene"
(14:00:06) nihilocrat: it's like an action scene where the director is high
(14:00:12) fartronomicon: the first time i played gta3 i was like "action movies are finished"
(14:00:26) Stargoat: I guess a better example is FarCry. Linearity aside, you can tackle an objective in almost any way you want...
(14:00:29) fartronomicon: because you could put t2, heat, almost anything in that engine
(14:00:32) fartronomicon: and it would better than the movie
(14:00:48) Arne: You could make Asteroids/Sinistar/Oids/Gravitar into a persistent sim / eco game.
(14:00:51) Stargoat: but because there's no reward for playing creatively, there's no reason to not attack in the eiest way possible
(14:00:55) Arne: Or Solar Jetman
(14:01:00) Stargoat: hmm
(14:01:05) Stargoat: Solar Jetman is a fantactic game.
(14:01:09) fartronomicon: sinistar was already somewhat persistant
(14:01:13) Stargoat: it could work with any thrust-esq game
(14:01:16) Arne: Tedious though
(14:01:24) Arne: Yeah fart
(14:01:29) Arne: it was in a way
(14:01:41) Arne: But you had no clear overview of it
(14:01:48) Arne: it was a bit claustrophobic
(14:01:57) fartronomicon: yeah, which made it scarier
(14:02:33) Arne: Yeah, perhaps that's the positive aspect
(14:02:59) Stargoat: speaking of thrust-esq games, Gravitron II is awesomesauce.
(14:03:11) Arne: Hmmm
(14:03:17) Arne: I'll have to chack that out
(14:03:22) Arne: Gravity Force 2 was
(14:03:27) Stargoat: it's something absurd like $5 on steam
(14:03:44) Arne: oh, a modern remake
(14:03:57) Arne: it's doing the glowy lines thing!
(14:03:58) Stargoat: you know what also rocked?
(14:04:09) Stargoat: unlocking lunar lander in Time Splitters 2.
(14:04:12) Stargoat: and snake
(14:04:16) Stargoat: and... whatever the last one was
(14:05:44) nihilocrat: I wonder how these people get the glowly line look
(14:05:51) nihilocrat: textures or proper shaders
(14:08:24) Arne: Exile would get 4/5 if it was more accessible, less bumpy and was less linear
(14:08:25) Stargoat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nspt8gzWaOw&feature=related
(14:09:01) Stargoat: astro lander from TS2
(14:09:11) Arne: Warlords was kind of awesome in how hte entire game was just a single map with all races on
(14:09:45) Arne: a bit like taking all of hte scenarios in a strategy game, merging the maps and let everyone have a go
(14:11:08) fartronomicon: haha.. that comment thread is funny
(14:11:15) fartronomicon: I don't wanna get personal here but one of your favorites is a see through bra.... 
(14:11:43) Stargoat: heh
(14:12:04) Arne: see though bra?
(14:12:19) fartronomicon: comments on stargoats video
(14:12:20) Arne: I don't care about bras
(14:12:23) Arne: ah
(14:12:34) Arne: see though panties is where it's at
(14:12:42) fartronomicon: true
(14:12:43) doohan: no panties is where it's at.
(14:12:54) Stargoat: you're all wrong
(14:13:01) Stargoat: crotchless is the way to go
(14:13:12) Kobel: Panty fetish = coprophilia? Discuss.
(14:13:28) Arne: no panty fetish = gay
(14:14:03) Arne: panties are only fun when they're on, of course
(14:14:22) ***OEP returns
(14:14:23) Arne: it's about teasing the imagination instead of plainly showing
(14:14:45) Kobel: So would really thick bushy pubes achieve the same effect?
(14:15:00) Arne: then it looks like a man
(14:15:06) Kobel: Not THAT thick
(14:15:09) Arne: it could be hiding a penis
(14:15:26) Kobel: Pubes of less-than-dick width
(14:15:45) fartronomicon: !topic
(14:15:46) Kobel: Arne panties could be hiding a penis.
(14:15:49) Kobel: It is possible.
(14:15:51) Arne: pubes are a part of the genitals in a way
(14:16:02) Arne: so it wouldn't hide anything per se
(14:16:08) Kobel: No if they were then shaving them would hurt like hell
(14:16:22) Kobel: Instead of just being kind of itchy.
(14:16:46) fartronomicon: incoming burn:
(14:16:50) Arne: just because they don't have nerves doesn't mean they're not apart of the body
(14:16:53) fartronomicon: kobel thought he had a pube once but then he peed out of it
(14:17:12) Kobel: Hohoho that joke brings me back!
(14:17:56) Arne: the panties would naturally have to be the proper size or they're hide too much
(14:20:48) Massena left the room (quit: Quit: Massena).
(14:23:39) Arne: Bajs!
(14:24:15) nihilocrat: ciao
(14:24:15) Stargoat: ?
(14:24:17) Stargoat: oh
(14:24:22) nihilocrat: (i guess?)
(14:24:41) WrkEcho [1@h216.94.9.98.rev.fatbanana.ca] entered the room.

(14:26:14) Arne: I'm not sure if I should work on this: http://androidarts.com/gamedev/space_barnacle_mockups2.gif
(14:26:24) RinkuHero: i remember space barnacle
(14:26:26) RinkuHero: that was fun
(14:26:36) Arne: I had a huge design doc for it but I forgot that it was all in my head and then I forgot
(14:26:37) fartronomicon: i think you should arne
(14:27:15) RinkuHero: did you draw that worldmap before
(14:27:18) RinkuHero: making each individual level
(14:27:19) RinkuHero: or after?
(14:27:29) Arne: it's just an image I drew
(14:27:36) RinkuHero: ah
(14:27:44) Arne: I'll save it as a 256color raw and load that as a game map
(14:27:53) Arne: then write a proper editor
(14:28:30) Arne: it's 300*400
(14:28:51) RinkuHero: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_oV2jH-NLzx8/RoAOb6MfQmI/AAAAAAAAANo/m_LKPrUdhWM/s1600-h/smart_devmap.jpg
(14:28:58) RinkuHero: original design doc for super metroid map
(14:29:10) Arne: so that's 12 screens wide
(14:29:35) fartronomicon: spoiler alert!
(14:29:39) Arne: heh, looks like the M1 map I drew as a kid
(14:30:55) fartronomicon: oh look time to go
(14:30:56) fartronomicon left the room (quit: Quit: quittin' time).
(14:31:22) nihilocrat: cool
(14:32:13) Arne: I think I could use a bucket solution for the lava
(14:32:15) doohan: That's awesome
(14:32:23) Arne: boulder dash routine and buckets
(14:32:36) Arne: so stable areas are not updated unless disturbed
(14:33:01) Arne: that would speed things up a lot
