(11:10:30) Xander: I insist that Bionic Commando is a terribly average game. I don't know then why I'm playing it through a second time
(11:10:47) SimonTheDigger: Because even terribly average games have one really good aspect to them
(11:10:56) SimonTheDigger: it's rare that you find a game that's completely average in every way, on all levels
(11:11:17) RinkuHero: ugh, another 'this game isn't as good as people say it is!' discussion :D
(11:11:21) Xander: I'm getting that Mirrors Edge feeling. Where the few defining aspects are really the driving fun..
(11:11:31) Movius: BIONIC COMMANDO IS A PLATFORMER
(11:11:57) Movius: have you seen the consolevania review of Pirates?
(11:12:09) RinkuHero: i've never heard of consolevania
(11:12:10) RinkuHero: nor pirates
(11:12:16) Xander: I don't think anyone is really conflicted over Bionic Commando being averageish. It seems to be general feeling
(11:12:16) RinkuHero: unless you mean sid meier's pirates
(11:12:21) Movius: thats the game 
(11:12:28) RinkuHero: what's consolevania
(11:12:29) RinkuHero: a site?
(11:12:30) Bigger: I like finding things so good they hurt

(11:12:40) Movius: www.consolevania.com
(11:12:46) Xander: Can't say I've ever watched it either
(11:12:46) Movius: start with season 2
(11:13:07) Movius: they had a video game show on the BBC called Video Gaiden too that was less offensive and slightly less good
(11:13:42) Movius: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBnFwYOrWic

(11:15:00) RinkuHero: haha
(11:15:03) Movius: then realises he's been playing for 8 hours straight 
(11:15:22) RinkuHero: he sounds like

(11:15:53) corpus: scrooge mcduck is a badass
(11:16:03) corpus: he can dive into a pool of gold coins and come out unscathed
(11:16:19) RinkuHero: this seems to be some newer pirates game
(11:16:22) RinkuHero: rather than the original
(11:16:24) RinkuHero: did they remake it?
(11:16:30) Movius: yes
(11:16:34) corpus: sid meier's?
(11:16:36) RinkuHero: yes
(11:16:38) corpus: yeah, two years ago or so
(11:16:40) corpus: or three

(11:17:29) SimonTheDigger: hmm
(11:17:31) corpus: but I never got around to trying it

(11:20:37) RinkuHero: i haven't played the halo series
(11:20:47) Movius: you don't need to have
(11:21:17) Movius: Ken Loach = mediocre leftish art film director
(11:21:38) Movius: his films look exactly like that
(11:23:33) corpus: ooh, jeff minter? where?

(11:32:25) RinkuHero: i thought it was you
(11:32:30) Xander: *on
(11:33:08) Xander: I don't mean inserting it in the post. Though that would be a pretty great prank. I'll have to remember that sometime
(11:33:43) Xander: Some commentor just keeps putting it in there. It's kind of weird.. though I guess it's good they keep reading. I guess?
(11:33:47) corpus: ah, man
(11:33:53) corpus: did something happen, Movius?
(11:33:57) corpus: or had they just had enough
(11:34:05) Movius: lack of motivation I'm guessing

(11:34:37) Movius: Adelaide is infested too
(11:34:39) Dataflashsabot: Super (copyright symbol)?
(11:34:48) Xander: I like 'infested'
(11:34:59) Dragonene: I wonder why I wrote swine flu with capital first letters, and melbourne in all lowercase
(11:35:02) Xander: It's all really a publicity stunt for Prototype
(11:35:08) RinkuHero: virtualdub is a good free video conversion program
(11:35:15) RinkuHero: though its interface is tricky
(11:35:17) Movius: it is what i use
(11:35:27) RinkuHero: like most open source software the gui is arcane
(11:35:44) Movius: you're lucky you get a GUI
(11:35:48) RinkuHero: hehe
(11:35:59) RinkuHero: yes, a lot are just like
(11:36:01) RinkuHero: command line tools
(11:36:07) Movius: a command line like vdub -o-oawf-af ao-f af a.avi d-a-dw-oqwfiqa we- gfaegka-g a0ga is more usable
(11:36:14) Dragonene: command lines are evil :P
(11:36:26) corpus: newcastle's had swine flu for ages
(11:36:37) corpus: we're rock solid

(11:36:44) Dragonene: a school kid had swine flu here
(11:36:47) corpus: has swine flu
(11:36:52) Dragonene: they closed down the school for a week apparently
(11:37:04) Bezzy left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:37:05) corpus: they did that here as well
(11:37:07) Movius: the kid in Adelaide that caught it attends a 5-story school in the CBD
(11:37:08) corpus: one of the first ones in england
(11:37:10) corpus: it was hilarious
(11:37:11) RinkuHero: sounds paranoid
(11:37:18) nyarla: SUPER is the best super magic easy GUI video converter i've found, if you can actually find the download link on their website
(11:37:18) Movius: and they're wondering how she came in contact with it
(11:37:18) Bezzy [aubrey.hes@93-97-195-169.zone5.bethere.co.uk] entered the room.
(11:37:20) corpus: apparently everyone was crying and saying they were going to die

(11:37:57) corpus: the interview with the girl who had it was perfect
(11:38:06) corpus: it was on the breakfast news, live

(11:38:23) corpus: all sitting motionless on the sofa
(11:38:26) corpus: slouched right down
(11:38:32) corpus: with their mouths hanging open
(11:38:47) RinkuHero: it's no more dangerous than normal flu though

(11:39:06) Dragonene: Let's un-bring-it-up
(11:39:06) Movius: it can spread easier than normal flu though
(11:39:10) Dragonene: I don't want to talk about it.
(11:39:13) Movius: due to lack of herd immunity
(11:39:17) Dragonene: I'm easily scared by diseases.
(11:39:20) corpus: this was when the news was hot on it though
(11:39:20) Xander: It's funny, the only people who are really afraid of swine flu are being..
(11:39:21) Bigger: SWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE FLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
(11:39:22) Dragonene: It's the closest thing to a phobia I have.
(11:39:23) Xander: ...PIG IGNORANT
(11:39:28) Movius: normal flu is just as fatal
(11:39:29) adamrobo left the room (quit: Quit: adamrobo).
(11:39:31) corpus: now, they're milking the MPs' expenses scandal for all its worth
(11:39:40) Bigger: Xander, high five o/
(11:39:41) Dragonene: Xander: Or maybe it's not rational :P
(11:39:41) Movius: thats even in the news here
(11:39:47) Xander: \o
(11:39:48) Dragonene: You know how fear works.
(11:40:02) corpus: and potentially causing a huge amount of damage if all the idiots who're so swayed by the news media vote for anyone but the main three parties
(11:40:05) Movius: a good distraction for the current government post-budget
(11:40:05) corpus: in the EU elections, I mean
(11:40:08) Xander: I love this expense scandal
(11:40:14) corpus: which, for a lot of areas, means voting for the BNP
(11:40:24) Xander: It's at least entertaining. The guy who claimed for cleaning his moat? That was brilliant
(11:40:27) corpus: the more power the BNP have, the closer we are to being fucked
(11:40:29) RinkuHero: the eu has elections?
(11:40:32) corpus: yeah
(11:40:34) RinkuHero: is there a president of the eu?
(11:40:36) corpus: we have a european parliament
(11:40:36) Movius: Adam Spencer was making jokes about the Moat guy at the APS debate i attended
(11:40:37) RinkuHero: that everyone votes on?
(11:40:45) Xander: yeah, we're a little boned
(11:40:52) corpus: no, every country is divided into areas
(11:40:58) corpus: like, north-east of england for me
(11:41:08) Xander: I really want to join the EU, but the tories are very anti-eu, and then we have 2/3 other parties completely against it too
(11:41:13) corpus: and each constituency can elect a candidate to represent it in the EU parliament
(11:41:40) Movius: haven't they just redistributed the EU constituencies
(11:41:47) Movius: screwing over large populous countries
(11:41:53) Movius: much like the Senate in Aus
(11:41:56) ljnc: ukip
(11:42:05) corpus: the EU seems pretty good, really
(11:42:19) Xander: So I'm a little torn. I kind of have to vote lib dem, because I don't like what labour have been doing, and I don't like what everyone else wants to do
(11:42:19) corpus: it's pushed through a lot of laws on the environment which wouldn't have been successful otherwise
(11:42:23) corpus: or not so quickly
(11:42:31) corpus: UKIP just go on about how much it costs us a year to be a member of the EU
(11:42:37) Dataflashsabot left the room.
(11:42:38) Movius: I vote for the Lib Dems here. completely different party to the UK one though
(11:42:40) corpus: they never mention how much we earn as a result of it
(11:42:43) corpus: so they're full of shit, probably
(11:42:47) PossumFawkes: Hello.
(11:42:57) shinygerbil: Pfwks
(11:43:04) PossumFawkes: politicizing are we?
(11:43:10) PossumFawkes: American politics are stupid :(
(11:43:27) corpus: lib dems and green party seem most in line with what I'd like to vote for atm
(11:43:32) PossumFawkes: Well, sure
(11:43:33) ljnc: but it's like tax.. how can tax evar be any good? you have to pay people.. and for what?! so they can take money away from you!
(11:43:39) corpus: but the lib dems are the underdogs of the main 3 parties
(11:43:47) Movius: pay for the privilege of breathing
(11:43:50) corpus: and the green party are even underdoggier
(11:43:53) Xander: Yeah, UKIP and the BNP are just the classic nationalist idiots. Keep britain british! Except Britain is the name given to a collection of various nationalities anyway, especially given how many times we've been invaded through history
(11:44:01) PossumFawkes: Have you seen the recent "National Tea Party" here, though?
(11:44:11) PossumFawkes: asking for removal of taxes while raising defence spending
(11:44:11) Movius: yes
(11:44:15) Xander: oh, and our monarchy are german. how british.
(11:44:20) PossumFawkes: Cause that works so well :D
(11:44:20) GuitarBizarre: raving monster loony party
(11:44:21) corpus: tax is good because it pays for things like the national health service, ljnc
(11:44:25) corpus: the NHS may be flawed
(11:44:34) corpus: but we're still far better off having it than not having it at all
(11:44:49) PossumFawkes: I've never understood the keep britan british thing
(11:44:51) corpus: though, of course, tax can be done badly
(11:44:57) PossumFawkes: I mean, Britain had a lot of colonies, right
(11:45:04) Xander: Yeah, I'd prefer it to the insurance/private health care of other places
(11:45:07) ljnc: um... i was hardly being serious :<
(11:45:11) corpus: it's called xenophobia / racism / ignorance / stupidity, PossumFawkes
(11:45:14) PossumFawkes: So understandably a lot of different races are British, though
(11:45:15) corpus: oh, okay! sorry, ljnc
(11:45:18) Xander: We certainly did. Across so much of the globe!
(11:45:21) Movius: private health care is pretty awesome
(11:45:21) PossumFawkes: Yes
(11:45:26) ***Movius taps repaired teeth
(11:45:29) Movius: money well spent
(11:45:39) PossumFawkes: You could "keep it british" and still have all sorts of cultures and races
(11:45:40) Xander: Infact we kind of raped the US a bit too.. I need to learn about that side of history sometime
(11:45:41) PossumFawkes: >.>
(11:45:49) corpus: I am going to sort my teeth the fuck out if I ever have enough money
(11:45:55) Xander: They don't really teach us the war of independence because we lost.. I think
(11:46:00) PossumFawkes: ?
(11:46:07) corpus: my dickhead of an orthodontist would never give me braces when I blatantly needed them
(11:46:12) PossumFawkes: Also the war of 1812, which was a bad idea on both sides
(11:46:17) Xander: What a cockbag
(11:46:20) PossumFawkes: American history is rather depressing :(
(11:46:31) corpus: and I don't want to get them now, because having braces at 18/19 would be an awful move
(11:46:42) corpus: so I will wait until I got the moolah
(11:46:42) Jr [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(11:46:46) Xander: haha
(11:47:09) Movius: just make sure you get your wisdom teeth out if you need to
(11:47:10) Xander: Christ, there was a guy on Embarassing Bodies a little while back who grinded his teeth to the point that his nerves were exposed
(11:47:21) Movius: you're bordering on the smashed-jaw age
(11:47:22) Xander: A little off topic.. but yeah, that was something
(11:47:31) ljnc: eww
(11:47:38) corpus: smashed-jaw age, Movius?
(11:47:51) Movius: once you get over a certain age they have to smash your jaw to get them out
(11:48:00) Movius: usually late 20s but sometimes earlier
(11:48:04) Pongball [pong@68-185-174-24.dhcp.mdsn.wi.charter.com] entered the room.

(11:48:32) corpus: hey jxn

(11:48:56) shinygerbil: mine suddenly erupted one day
(11:48:56) corpus: I'll get them out if they dare to rear their heads
(11:48:58) PossumFawkes: it's genetic
(11:48:59) corpus: lick whackamole
(11:49:01) Movius: I've had the two top ones out. a relatively painless experience

(11:49:37) shinygerbil: <3

(11:49:39) Jr: and glisteninggobbets too
(11:49:39) KareemK: i should have that on shirt
(11:49:41) Xander: Yeah, I've a couple at the edges of my mouth that just haven't gone anywhere. They've been 'partially erupted' for about 3 years now

(11:50:05) corpus: no doubt I would mind it without anaesthetic
(11:50:09) KareemK: which is teh fun :P
(11:50:11) Xander: When I had my teeth out I had both the gas and an injection
(11:50:14) corpus: but I've got used to the horrible rubbery yanking back and forth
(11:50:16) Movius: I only had one at a time

(11:50:35) PossumFawkes: :D
(11:50:38) corpus: the injection is worse than the teeth-pulling, for me
(11:50:39) Xander: That was insane, it felt like every one of my limbs had twisted around eachother like fusilli and my dentists became penguins

(11:51:13) Jr: I'm still getting orders from that play I did
(11:51:20) Jr: I shot the cast of a kid's play
(11:51:21) corpus: you did a play?
(11:51:22) corpus: oh
(11:51:24) corpus: nice
(11:51:25) Xander: Painful Extractions = Birthing
(11:51:27) Jr: and sold the photos to the moms
(11:51:35) Movius: I need to get my teeth fixed before KareemK comes to practice here
(11:51:38) Jr: and I've got a few stragglers who want some
(11:51:39) corpus: I need to get an exhibition sorted out for the summer
(11:51:43) corpus: to get some dough in
(11:51:45) Jr: yes you do
(11:51:56) corpus: I managed to find a guy who does really good-quality giclee prints
(11:52:03) corpus: for fairly reasonable prices
(11:52:08) Jr: Giclee is heckspensive
(11:52:15) KareemK: to be honest all my extractions went smoothly
(11:52:18) Jr: for stupid inkjet prints
(11:52:20) KareemK: but i didnt do that much
(11:52:23) KareemK: like 7 maybe
(11:52:27) corpus: worth it though, Jr
(11:52:27) Movius: good news
(11:52:32) corpus: but yeah, this guy does uh
(11:52:36) Jr: corpus: yes
(11:52:41) corpus: well, for the initial scanning
(11:52:42) KareemK: and was assisted by older doctors on most of them
(11:52:46) corpus: A2 scan + 12" proof
(11:52:51) Movius: my current dentist has taken to not using the topical anesthetic pre-injection
(11:52:52) corpus: is like... £20?
(11:52:53) Jr: do you get the scan?
(11:52:53) Movius: lunatic
(11:52:58) corpus: and A3 is £35
(11:53:00) Jr: or just the like, print
(11:53:02) corpus: yeah, I think so
(11:53:03) corpus: I would be
(11:53:07) KareemK: Movius: its of little effect really
(11:53:08) corpus: I would ask for it
(11:53:10) Jr: that's pretty ace then
(11:53:11) Movius: yeah
(11:53:14) corpus: wouldn't be paying for it every time
(11:53:27) KareemK: mostly to lessen the needle prick and get you distracted on gum parathesia i guess
(11:54:07) KareemK: the anasthesia tech for lower molars is a bitch
(11:54:17) nyarla left the room (quit: Quit: glurk ).
(11:54:20) ljnc: so wikipedia says giclees are fancy inkjet prints?
(11:54:26) Movius: thats where my last filling was
(11:54:30) BadassKamina [beans@nc-71-55-87-101.dhcp.embarqhsd.net] entered the room.
(11:54:32) corpus: bah, lost the sheet where I worked out the prices
(11:54:53) PossumFawkes: man
(11:54:55) KareemK: a friend of mine got the needle out of the patient's cheek while doing it
(11:54:56) SimonTheDigger left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(11:55:00) corpus: but yeah, A2 prints would be like £20, and A3 would be £40-odd
(11:55:03) ***PossumFawkes is bored, recording records
(11:55:06) corpus: so not too bad
(11:55:08) BadassKamina is now known as SimonTheDigger
(11:55:16) corpus: just need to sell multiple if possible, to offset the cost of scanning
(11:55:18) Movius: haha, awesome
(11:55:24) corpus: ljnc: yeah, it's basically fine art quality printing
(11:55:30) corpus: on archival paper
(11:55:34) corpus: and using lightfast inks
(11:55:42) KareemK: i usually play it safe with that technique
(11:55:43) corpus: that shouldn't fade for at least 25 years or so, IIRC
(11:56:05) Movius: poking a needly through the cheek is relatively harmless
(11:56:09) Movius: and painless done right
(11:56:21) ljnc: is most of the cost the paper or what? i mean.. what about some colour laser on glossier paper?
(11:56:25) KareemK: its pretty freaky from a dentist though
(11:56:27) Movius: it's a trick of "mystics" to prove they can stand pain
(11:56:33) corpus: nah, most of the cost is the ink
(11:56:58) ljnc: (<- also interested in printing processes)
(11:57:04) KareemK: palatal injection is most painful i think
(11:57:14) Movius: roof of the mouth?
(11:57:16) KareemK: we only give like 0.2 ml or so there
(11:57:19) KareemK: yea
(11:57:24) corpus: and normal laserjet printing isn't high enough quality
(11:57:25) Movius: ow
(11:57:34) KareemK: its supposed to be done in all maxillary work
(11:57:37) KareemK: if going by the book
(11:57:40) corpus: giclee involves special high-end printers
(11:57:40) KareemK: i.e at school
(11:57:49) corpus: I can't recall the DPI
(11:57:52) corpus: it is huge
(11:57:58) corpus: but yeah, so there's no pixellation visible
(11:58:17) corpus: it's as close as you can get to a perfect reproduction with digital printing atm
(11:58:32) ljnc: well i figured it wouldn't just be some hp all-in-one type dealy
(11:59:38) KareemK: Movius: heirs are good btw
(11:59:54) Movius: nice
(12:00:06) KareemK: http://denovali.com/download.php?id=25
(12:00:34) Movius: cheers
(12:00:51) corpus: yeah
(12:01:04) corpus: but yeah, ljnc, it's pretty specialised
(12:01:17) corpus: it took me quite a while to find anyone that did it where I live
(12:01:32) corpus: because even most professional printers don't know much about it
(12:02:03) corpus: I just had to interrogate artists and galleries until I got a response from one who used a nearby chap
(12:02:06) ljnc: i guess they mostly do offset because they usually deal with larger runs anyway
(12:02:42) corpus: yeah
(12:03:09) corpus: and most printing applications don't really have any need for the type of quality you accomplish with giclee
(12:03:22) corpus: anyway, I'm off
(12:03:31) corpus: have to get stuff sorted out before I go out. later
(12:03:33) corpus left the room (quit: Quit: corpus).
(12:03:59) shinygerbil: let's all make out in tf2
(12:04:24) GuitarBizarre left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(12:07:29) PossumFawkes: only if it's TF2 360 :D
(12:07:35) Xander: heh
(12:07:48) ***PossumFawkes listens to the Beatles
(12:07:56) Massena: bah
(12:08:00) PossumFawkes: :D when me father was a kid he won all the beatles albums
(12:08:02) PossumFawkes: on vinyl
(12:08:02) Massena: I need some programan help
(12:08:08) gandhi [gandhi@pool-71-178-240-50.washdc.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(12:08:23) PossumFawkes: so I am recording them all
(12:08:55) PossumFawkes is now known as PFawkes
(12:09:03) Arne: divisions are really slow
(12:09:20) Massena: any of you totally awesome programers bored enough? :D
(12:09:37) Arne: actually + is slower :O
(12:09:50) Massena: seriously? :O
(12:09:55) Jr: W the F!
(12:09:58) Jr: stupid nikon
(12:10:38) Arne: I get the same time for +-/*  
(12:11:11) FinDude left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:11:21) Bigger left the room.
(12:11:40) Arne: hahahha
(12:11:49) Arne: wow, my menchmark was flawed
(12:11:59) Arne: I removed the computation from my look
(12:12:07) PFawkes: :( curse you windows vista microphone software
(12:12:12) Arne: seems the frro loop was responsible for most of the time
(12:12:17) Siiseli: woo fucking hoo
(12:12:20) Jr: poopnuggets, I can't install my nikon raw converting software on here
(12:12:21) Siiseli: made an uploader 
(12:12:22) Siiseli: :po
(12:12:24) Siiseli: :p
(12:12:26) Siiseli: so leet I am
(12:12:28) Arne: 33ms for a 1million loop
(12:12:28) PFawkes: :D
(12:12:35) Jr: what can you upload?
(12:12:36) PFawkes: I upload things with my mind
(12:12:40) PFawkes: but yours is cool too
(12:12:41) Siiseli: Jr, anything \:D
(12:12:44) PFawkes: to anywhere?
(12:12:46) PFawkes: or to where
(12:12:47) Arne: then 3ms for the 1million computations
(12:12:48) Siiseli: to my own computer
(12:12:51) Jr: linx
(12:13:03) Jr: I have an account, I want to upload things
(12:13:04) Siiseli: it's only open for me though, cos' I don't want to put restrictions in and I just want to use it myself
(12:13:11) Siiseli: Jr, YOU CANT :---D
(12:13:17) Siiseli: unless I make you an admin
(12:13:21) Siiseli: which I won't :3
(12:13:23) Jr: MOAR LIKE B======D
(12:13:39) Siiseli: cos' then you could do stuff you shouldn't be able to :D
(12:14:17) Jr: pfft
(12:14:20) Jr: like what
(12:14:23) Jr: upload porn?
(12:14:25) PFawkes: I would so steal your identity
(12:14:26) Jr: naaaah
(12:14:33) Jr: I wouldn't
(12:14:36) Jr: it's usesless
(12:14:37) PFawkes: and then set fire to your computer remotely
(12:14:40) Jr: useless
(12:14:40) PFawkes: (not really)
(12:14:54) PFawkes: I wouldn't really do that >.>
(12:15:22) PFawkes: Besides, I am busy ripping every beatles song from records
(12:15:24) PFawkes: it's difficult
(12:16:28) Jr: Oh man
(12:16:29) Jr: http://futurestorm.blogspot.com/2009/05/hr-1966-offend-someone-online-go-to.html
(12:16:37) Jr: that's scary
(12:16:40) Jr: I don't like that
(12:17:09) Jr: why is that even a bill
(12:17:18) Dragonene: Jr: 
(12:17:23) Dragonene: I love you even though you don't make games
(12:17:25) Jr: of couse, it can't get passed
(12:17:32) Dragonene: But only on the condition that you start making them
(12:17:33) Dragonene: !
(12:17:36) Jr: pah
(12:17:44) Jr: games are for little children
(12:17:46) Jr: as I've said
(12:17:51) Jr: I am an artist
(12:17:52) PFawkes: oh my god
(12:17:57) Jr: I deal with EMOTION
(12:17:57) PFawkes: :(
(12:17:59) Jr: and meaning
(12:18:03) Jr: and yes pfox
(12:18:31) Movius: thats a poorly worded anti-stalking bill
(12:18:38) PFawkes: you can't angrily email people
(12:18:45) PFawkes: or even just email and then upset by accidenty
(12:18:45) Movius: or harassment more specifically
(12:18:52) PFawkes: oh, accident is ok
(12:19:00) Movius: still ridiculous
(12:19:03) PFawkes: with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person"
(12:19:08) PFawkes: that is IDIOTIC
(12:19:18) PFawkes: see why I hate American politics?
(12:19:28) Jr: yes
(12:19:32) Movius: you'll find most laws worded like that in most countries
(12:19:34) PFawkes: the news ignores this to focus on Obama's burger choices
(12:19:41) Jr: I can't see how this will get passed though
(12:19:42) PFawkes: and on Biden's ties
(12:19:44) PFawkes: and so on
(12:19:46) PFawkes: it will
(12:19:48) PFawkes: >.>
(12:19:58) Jr: I doubt it
(12:19:59) PFawkes: the DMCA got passed, right?
(12:20:01) Jr: I mean
(12:20:04) PFawkes: and the Patriot act
(12:20:11) PFawkes: which was even voted for by democrats
(12:20:22) Jr: that was under pressure from bigbiz
(12:20:29) PFawkes: So
(12:20:32) Jr: and from wartime crazieness
(12:20:44) Jr: I don't see stuff like that happening now
(12:20:45) Jr: also
(12:20:45) PFawkes: This is under pressure from normal craziness
(12:20:52) PFawkes: We have a lot of that
(12:21:01) Jr: yes, normal
(12:21:02) PFawkes: I live where they still have the Death Penalty
(12:21:04) Movius: this law isn't anything particularly scary
(12:21:15) Jr: no, but it leads to scary things
(12:21:19) PFawkes: and where they urged people to buy like 50 shotguns in case Obama took 'em way from us poor folk
(12:21:19) Xander: eugh
(12:21:25) PFawkes: >.>
(12:21:41) Movius: it's some standard blogger who has probably never read the full-wording of any legislation
(12:21:44) Movius: so thinks its unusual
(12:21:55) PFawkes: but it does say that anything intended to upset someone
(12:21:58) PFawkes: is illegal
(12:22:12) PFawkes: no more blogs which criticize the government or religion
(12:22:16) PFawkes: or anything
(12:22:30) PFawkes: according to the letter, if not the intent, see?
(12:22:34) Movius: it doesn't
(12:22:35) PFawkes: that's why it's dangerous
(12:22:48) Movius: it says "coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress "
(12:23:07) Jr:  (a) Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person, using electronic means to support severe, repeated, and hostile behavior, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.
(12:23:08) ljnc: this law causes me substantial emotional distress :<
(12:23:17) PFawkes: it can be interpreted that way
(12:23:19) PFawkes: though
(12:23:22) PFawkes: especially in religion
(12:23:32) PFawkes: mostly because of the political climate here
(12:23:38) Jr: hm
(12:23:42) Movius: coercion means blackmail
(12:23:47) Movius: intimidate threaten with violence
(12:23:53) Movius: both crimes
(12:24:06) Jr: using electronic means to support severe, repeated, and hostile behavior
(12:24:09) Jr: what's that bit?
(12:24:16) Movius: it means you have to do it a lot
(12:24:23) Movius: and targetted
(12:24:41) Jr: (2) the term `electronic means’ means any equipment dependent on electrical power to access an information service, including email, instant messaging, blogs, websites, telephones, and text messages.’.
(12:24:43) PFawkes: Yes, i know what it's supposed to do
(12:24:51) PFawkes: which is prevent like, harassment and such
(12:24:55) Movius: it's a ridiculous law because it covers stuff that is already illegal
(12:24:56) ljnc: so what is this? a law that makes things that were illegal illegal?
(12:25:02) PFawkes: yes
(12:25:12) Movius: but there isn't anything particularly horrifying in the wording
(12:25:15) Jr: I think what it is TRYING to do is apply current laws to online
(12:25:19) ljnc: good job, government
(12:25:23) PFawkes: yes
(12:25:23) Jr: but
(12:25:26) PFawkes: woo government\
(12:25:29) Movius: current laws do apply online generally
(12:25:30) Jr: it's not working quite well
(12:25:35) Jr: yeah, exactly
(12:25:47) Jr: and it's really pretty poorly worded
(12:25:49) PFawkes: yes, see, it's supposed to amend an already implemented law
(12:25:52) Jr: which is Not Good
(12:25:54) PFawkes: to add cyberbullying
(12:26:04) krabbo [terithom@d75-155-120-107.bchsia.telus.net] entered the room.
(12:26:07) PFawkes: which is a really stupid word but whatever
(12:26:52) PFawkes: Sixty percent of mental health professionals who responded to the Survey of Internet Mental Health Issues report having treated at least one patient with a problematic Internet experience in the previous five years
(12:26:53) PFawkes: WHAT
(12:26:54) tantan [tantan@c-98-213-201-216.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(12:26:55) Jr: yes and nyes
(12:27:02) Jr: and what
(12:27:05) tantan: hi
(12:27:12) tantan: hwhat
(12:27:13) PFawkes: so, since there aren't too many psychiatrists
(12:27:13) Jr: and tantan, my lover! <3
(12:27:22) Rosetta [Rosetta@84.13.137.157] entered the room.
(12:27:25) Movius: only one in five years?
(12:27:28) tantan: i think i have strep throat
(12:27:29) PFawkes: yes
(12:27:33) Jr: who responded to the Survey of Internet Mental Health Issues
(12:27:36) Jr: I don't like that
(12:27:43) PFawkes: Jr, I'm just sayibng
(12:27:46) tantan: i have a fever and my throat hurts when i swallow
(12:27:50) PFawkes: even if you extrapolate that to all shrinks
(12:27:52) PFawkes: it's not many people
(12:27:53) Jr: that makes it sound like voluntary response
(12:28:00) PFawkes: you know?
(12:28:00) Jr: which is a Bad Thing
(12:28:04) Jr: yes
(12:28:14) Jr: it's enough
(12:28:33) Jr: you don't need too many- wait
(12:28:45) Jr: I'm looking at the mechanics of the thing
(12:28:46) PFawkes: these statistics are misleading
(12:28:48) Jr: not the content
(12:28:49) Jr: yes
(12:28:52) Jr: they are
(12:28:57) PFawkes: 54 percent of these clients were 18 years of age or younger.
(12:29:09) Jr: and technically those are proportions
(12:29:12) Jr: not stats
(12:29:16) PFawkes: yes
(12:29:46) Jr: still don't like that voluntary response thing
(12:29:50) Jr: that's bad
(12:30:15) PFawkes: >.>
(12:30:30) PFawkes: at least they seem to not be lying in their statistics
(12:30:34) PFawkes: or they would be much higher
(12:30:46) Movius: where was the study published?
(12:30:53) PFawkes: it doesn't say
(12:31:08) Nightro left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:31:16) Movius: thats generally a more reliable way of inferring the quality of the study
(12:31:27) Movius: big journals have stringent peer-review
(12:31:54) PFawkes: it just says "findings"
(12:31:58) PFawkes: and then lists them
(12:33:14) DragonSix left the room (quit: Quit: blah).
(12:33:15) Ciahnensy: I have a good feeling that Movius has a sexcellent macaroni salad for me to use on monday.
(12:33:20) Ciahnensy: Recipe
(12:33:24) Movius: I do not
(12:33:28) Ciahnensy: Oof
(12:34:34) C418 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:35:03) PFawkes: Hm
(12:35:32) PFawkes: It just concerns me that people don't seem to care about what's going on in the legislature
(12:36:04) Ciahnensy: Fawkes wants the terrorists to remain at Guantanamo Bay.
(12:36:07) PFawkes: http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/consumerist/2009/05/paypal.gif
(12:36:14) PFawkes: What
(12:36:15) PFawkes: ?
(12:36:28) PFawkes: Why would you think that
(12:36:39) Ciahnensy: No questions.
(12:36:49) Movius: it is concerning that people would be alarmed at that, very specific and uncontroversial, wording, rather than other potential laws or the general excess of laws
(12:37:00) Ciahnensy: I like the way Movius talks.
(12:37:01) PFawkes: Yes, that too
(12:37:21) Ciahnensy: Even though he hates macaroni salad.
(12:37:31) Movius: you don't win friends with salad
(12:37:37) Ciahnensy: Filthy truths.
(12:37:40) PFawkes: Ciahnensy, I believe that if they ARE criminals, which has generally not been shown, then they can be put into actual, non-tortury prisons
(12:37:40) Movius: the vegetarian place near work is quality though
(12:38:03) Jr left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(12:38:06) PFawkes: do you know what I mean?
(12:38:13) Ciahnensy: Yes answers.
(12:38:34) PFawkes: But you can't just say that they are guilty because they're in the prison
(12:38:38) PFawkes: since that is clearly untrue
(12:38:42) ***Ciahnensy gets the belt.
(12:38:48) PFawkes: Many people do say that, though, and it scares me :(
(12:38:57) Ciahnensy: Everyone says everything.
