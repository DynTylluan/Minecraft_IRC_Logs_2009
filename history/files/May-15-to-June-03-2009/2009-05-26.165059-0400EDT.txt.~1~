(16:51:07) fartron: it's not like it starts the first half then says "please buy the album for the conclusion of this song"
(16:51:09) Dock: Like xbl then
(16:51:24) genericuser: fartron: careful, you might give someone ideas
(16:51:29) fartron: it's also useful for pop music because a lot of the time people only even want the one song
(16:51:40) fartron: because that song is the big hit that summer
(16:51:42) fartron: or whatever
(16:51:48) michael: ya, cause they create false hype for the track
(16:51:53) genericuser: that must kinda suck, actually
(16:52:00) genericuser: if you actually care about doing music
(16:52:12) fartron: it doesn't seem that negative
(16:52:14) genericuser: and you end up having your one track looped over and over
(16:52:19) C418: my big summer hit is family galaxy by tim exile
(16:52:19) Dock: Same as any industry 
(16:52:31) C418: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKHEyUIErEk&fmt=18
(16:52:33) genericuser: depends, I guess
(16:52:36) Z80: <michael> like HOLY SHIT WE HAVE A NEW SINGLE <michael> GOD TOLD US
(16:52:38) Z80: Hahaha.
(16:52:42) fartron: it's the difference between pop and other forms of music
(16:52:53) Androu1: pop sux
(16:52:56) fartron: not always
(16:53:01) Androu1: IMO
(16:53:07) C418: the music video is very terrible tho
(16:53:13) Jr: I do not like pop
(16:53:16) Dock: I gtg
(16:53:19) fartron: do you like the beatles?
(16:53:20) fartron: so shut up
(16:53:22) C418: what is pop
(16:53:24) Dock: Laters
(16:53:25) Jr: pretty much anything on the radio currently
(16:53:27) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(16:53:36) Jr: beatles is classic rock
(16:53:39) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(16:53:44) fartron: classic rock is pop
(16:53:46) C418: then family galaxy is not a pop song
(16:53:48) Dock left the room (quit: Quit: Get Colloquy for iPhone! http://mobile.colloquy.info).
(16:54:00) fartron: classic rock invented pop that's why it's still on the radio
(16:54:05) C418: but this song is so incredibly different from anything else I have ever heard
(16:54:10) Jr: what
(16:54:11) PiratePoo: Isn't anything that is popular pop? :O
(16:54:15) Jr: no
(16:54:18) genericuser: no
(16:54:19) Jr: unfortunately
(16:54:23) Z80: FZOOF:  I CALL UPON YOU AND THE ELDER GODS TO MAKE MY CONNECTION BETTER.
(16:54:47) Jr: he standard format of pop music is the song, customarily less than five minutes in duration, with instrumentation that can range from an orchestra to a lone singer. Pop songs are generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and traditional structure. Rare variants are the verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, w
(16:54:48) Z80: Oh, God, I can see all.
(16:54:54) Jr: Mainstream style
(16:54:57) Jr: that's the bit
(16:55:11) fartron: oh hail wikipedia
(16:55:18) KK_laptop: i just made music!
(16:55:20) Z80: Jr is one indie motherf***er.
(16:55:21) KK_laptop: that i sorta like
(16:55:40) fartron: if he were really indie he wouldn't have an irrational fear of pop
(16:55:43) fartron: but instead he's a reactionary
(16:55:49) michael: there are a lot of talented pop producers, but the pop icons usually ruin the tracks
(16:55:51) KK_laptop: FUCK YES!
(16:56:05) genericuser: michael: QFT
(16:56:16) genericuser: :/
(16:56:23) genericuser: that was probably the wrong way to use QFT
(16:56:28) Z80: Genericuser, you must quote it to make that...
(16:56:28) genericuser: sorry
(16:56:29) Z80: Yeah.
(16:56:33) michael: example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCIo_HBNjhM
(16:56:41) genericuser: <michael> there are a lot of talented pop producers, but the pop icons usually ruin the tracks
(16:56:42) michael: awesome track
(16:56:49) genericuser: like that :P
(16:56:57) michael: horrible singer
(16:57:36) Z80: My favorite pop band is BLACKOUT.  FUCK YEAH MAN I MEAN HOLY FUCK THEY ARE SO AMAZING.
(16:57:39) Z80: Wait waht.
(16:58:22) Jr: whoa huh
(16:58:26) Jr: the intro song
(16:58:28) Jr: for House
(16:58:40) Jr: is a song by Massive Attack
(16:58:43) michael: i also like a of timberlakes stuff
(16:58:44) Jr: Teardrops
(16:58:48) michael: ya

(16:58:58) Z80: Good song indeed.
(16:59:10) Androu1 left the room (quit: Quit: I quit!!!).
(16:59:38) Z80: I would watch TV, but I can't sit still without having something to occupy my mind.  And TV does not do that.
(16:59:39) C418: this acid including boring britney spears acapella
(16:59:50) Z80: Well, not most TV.
(17:00:25) C418: I actually think the madonna dance album would be kind of nice if she would shut the fuck up
(17:00:34) michael: reetva has seen through the illusion
(17:00:37) Z80: I just space out and start walking around if I try to watch TV.
(17:00:48) michael: i agree c418
(17:01:41) C418: I wonder if there is a instrumental album version
(17:02:17) C418: nope
(17:02:24) Jr: I don't like pop vocals
(17:02:29) Jr: usually
(17:02:41) Jr: that's my main thing
(17:02:43) C418: fucking lyrics destroy everything
(17:02:48) Jr: naw
