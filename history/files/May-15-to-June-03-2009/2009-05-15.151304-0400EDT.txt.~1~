(15:13:36) RinkuHero: to go to the site
(15:13:44) RinkuHero: so that's also one click
(15:13:50) tantan: hey guys and probably  a girl or two
(15:13:54) Kobel: Yeah was just saying that would be something that would help
(15:14:03) tantan: i'm going to watch the usual suspects now
(15:14:07) tantan: i know nothing about it
(15:14:07) Kobel: Ooh, good
(15:14:15) RinkuHero: i never seen it
(15:14:20) tantan: doesn't that make you jealous?
(15:14:28) Kobel: Spoiler alert: Usual Suspects is an awesome movie
(15:15:00) Hempuli: Hey, would any of you guys know a good place where I could listen to Klezmer for free? In the nets
(15:16:00) Xander: Yes it is
(15:16:37) Xander: Ragdoll Kungfu is currently free on US PSN. I'd appreciate this if it featured less goddamn controller shaking
(15:17:07) paul|not: yeah that was the whole thing
(15:17:10) paul|not: it's like wii wagglan
(15:19:02) BlademasterBobo: RinkuHero: Is there any windowed mode or something for immortal defense?
(15:19:04) Xander: I shit you not, to heal using the chi powered stored up, you have to turn the controller upside down
(15:19:24) BlademasterBobo: oh there we go
(15:19:26) BlademasterBobo: nmv
(15:19:28) BlademasterBobo: *nvm
(15:20:17) Kobel: Xander that is to symbolice drinking from your life-chalice.
(15:20:40) Xander: or, pouring my life onto the seat of my pants
(15:21:44) RinkuHero: yes
(15:21:45) nihilocrat: that's interesting
(15:21:48) RinkuHero: you just use alt+enter
(15:21:50) RinkuHero: like in most games
(15:21:54) Siiseli: I return
(15:21:55) RinkuHero: to switch between full screen and windowed
(15:21:56) BlademasterBobo: yeah that slipped my mind
(15:21:57) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(15:21:59) RinkuHero: you can also change it on the stage select
(15:22:24) Xander: sensational, I also managed to crash the game
(15:22:25) nihilocrat: you can buy (with real money) a VP boost in battlefield heroes, it means you get an XP boost when you play for the next 30 days
(15:22:31) nihilocrat: so you're not /really/ buying XP
(15:22:35) Kobel: Mmm Full Throttle
(15:22:36) Siiseli: :D
(15:22:37) nihilocrat: but you kind of are
(15:22:50) Kobel: The delicious beverage not the delicious game

(15:23:47) Xander: ....
(15:23:49) Kobel: What game?
(15:23:49) Xander: 71 to 1?

(15:24:13) Cow [mccow28@d75-159-212-38.abhsia.telus.net] entered the room.
(15:24:20) Kobel: I got 42:2 once in gunz. That is about the best I have done in a game like that.
(15:24:21) nihilocrat: ferret is a beast, but that's pretty ridiculous

(15:29:17) paul|not: nihilocrat: retail offers y'know a shitton of perks
(15:29:23) paul|not: other than that it's about the same gameplay
(15:30:26) nihilocrat: ok

(15:43:18) jw: infiniminer good?
(15:43:23) nihilocrat: yessss
(15:43:38) fartron: it's not fun yet
(15:43:41) fartron: it has a lot of promise though
(15:43:56) nihilocrat: oh I think it's fun already, but it's confused
(15:44:08) fartron: it gets boring pretty quickly
(15:44:09) nihilocrat: you sort of have the goal of getting loot
(15:44:14) nihilocrat: but then people just dick around
(15:44:19) fartron: yeah but that's a lame goal that doesn't connect to the building at all
(15:44:22) nihilocrat: so you need to have fun with dicking aorund
(15:44:24) nihilocrat: exactly
(15:44:30) nihilocrat: the building is just sort of a convenient
(15:44:33) nihilocrat: *convenience
(15:44:37) nihilocrat: to build stairs or bridges
(15:44:39) fartron: it's not a convenience it's a distraction
(15:44:57) nihilocrat: well yeah, building anything but the bare minimum
(15:44:59) nihilocrat: well
(15:45:03) nihilocrat: the bare minimum is technically nothing
(15:45:05) fartron: which is why it needs real goals
(15:45:14) fartron: you can just dig out stairs to the gold
(15:45:38) nihilocrat: the terrain doesn't always cooperate to make it easy to get from the gold to topside
(15:45:56) nihilocrat: so I tend to get some ore and then make stairs / bridges to the gold
(15:46:02) fartron: it's not that hard to find room for stairs
(15:46:03) nihilocrat: if it's not easy to dig out natural ones
(15:46:16) fartron: but my point is the building should be the focus
(15:46:24) nihilocrat: but yeah, it seems like it's a digging game with building tacked on
(15:46:39) nihilocrat: yeah, building should have some sort of goal about it
(15:46:51) fartron: which is why i'm psyched for notch's project
(15:46:57) nihilocrat: it has mobs!
(15:47:02) nihilocrat: I think notch is cool anyways
(15:47:03) fartron: build a fort with your friends, connect to some other friends and CTF battle
(15:47:17) notch: :D
(15:47:27) notch: I've got dirt now, and grass. Grass spreads to dirt. =D
(15:47:33) notch: grass in shadow turns into dirt
(15:47:38) fartron: woa
(15:47:43) nihilocrat: I have a feeling that mr. Infiniminer isn't going to spend a huge amount of time on it
(15:47:44) fartron: put in birds
(15:47:53) nihilocrat: just because he seems to make games, do some updates, then move onto a new one
(15:48:09) fartron: i just wish infiniminer were moddable
(15:48:11) jsticker [nnscript@p4FD58E07.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] entered the room.
(15:48:16) fartron: i would be all over it
(15:49:15) fartron: i think my neighbor forgot to pay his comcast bill
(15:49:20) nihilocrat: hmm
(15:49:25) fartron: because when i connected to his wireless all i could get was an account activation page
(15:49:34) Kobel: Doop doop doop
(15:49:50) Kobel: Today is a good day I think to convert this game engine to using bitmapanimations

(16:01:34) The_Doctor: Thanks
(16:01:40) C418: I hope people get the difference between mixing and creating
(16:01:50) C418: mixing means not creating
(16:01:59) C418: although I do create music
(16:02:01) C418: but only for me
(16:02:05) C418: see, I am egoistic

(16:20:47) Cow: analord is the bomb

(16:20:51) Cow: booooom
(16:20:53) fartron: anal or d?
(16:20:53) notch: analoooord! =D

(16:21:10) C418: analord is an anagram to a roland. he uses mostly roland synths in it
(16:21:13) Arne: spore hero looks rather dull
(16:21:22) C418: yes, the tuss was grand
(16:21:34) notch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBwUJMZNOgQ

(16:23:24) C418: I'm surprised richard actually goes to warp again
(16:23:32) C418: I thought after the contract ended, he would stop releasing there
(16:23:46) fartron: http://necrowafer.tumblr.com/post/106553781/cavalry-by-stephen-s-sawyer-if-i-was-gonna
(16:23:58) notch: i wasn't aware it ended. I thought that was why he did that whole tuss thing. ;)
(16:24:10) notch: then again, that was a few years ago
(16:24:23) C418: chosen lords was the last warp release
(16:24:36) Cthulhu32: whoops back
(16:24:37) C418: well, "last" for now
(16:24:40) notch: Donkey Rhubarb was the song that made me like electronic music
(16:24:51) Cthulhu32: Kobel: home ownership for me was more like I was wasting $1200 a month on somebody else's mortgage
(16:24:54) Cthulhu32: and they were getting kind of cockish
(16:25:01) C418: I came to aphex twin in a very young age
(16:25:08) C418: it spoiled my musical taste
(16:25:12) Cthulhu32: C418: aphex twin is great
(16:25:20) notch: late one night, on MTV's altenative nation, this totally messed up song showed up. With dancing bears with creepy faces
(16:25:24) Kobel: Wow that sounds like a shit situation
(16:25:31) Kobel: There's other solutions though, haha
(16:25:33) Cthulhu32: Kobel: yeah colorado housing is stupid
(16:25:39) C418: imagine me at school. nobody liked what I heard
(16:25:54) Cthulhu32: plus the market is low, I got a ridiculously low interest rate, and I really do like walking into my own house
(16:26:05) Cthulhu32: C418: my brother would give me skinny puppy cds when I was in junior high
(16:26:50) Cthulhu32: Front242 I think was somewhere along that time line
(16:27:11) C418: oh well, good times
(16:27:18) C418: drukqs is still one of my most beloved albums
(16:27:35) C418: I still love the sound of prepared pianos
(16:27:38) Cthulhu32: Drukqs is lovely
(16:27:44) Cthulhu32: I really like the window licker ep
(16:27:52) notch: C418: God those ones took me ages to appreciate..
(16:28:00) notch: i was a bit narrow minded getting that cd
(16:28:04) Kobel: "// TODO: This is fucking stupid."
(16:28:08) notch: Taking Control is amazing, if a tad cheesy
(16:28:13) C418: coming to ep's... I think come to daddy is the best ep. although i have to admit, I don't like the daddy mix. the popular one
(16:28:30) C418: well, I think taking control uses samples of his mother
(16:28:51) Cthulhu32: come to daddy is also pretty awesome
(16:29:03) Kobel: I'll use samples of your mother
(16:29:04) Cthulhu32: they mixed that with porn at this defcon party I was at in 2007 on a projector
(16:29:06) fartron: dillinger escape plan?
(16:29:08) notch: ventolin's good, but not exactly easy listening
(16:29:17) notch: I played it at work once, and got very angry looks
(16:29:22) C418: ventolin is tinitus at it's best
(16:29:37) C418: but if you listen to the lovely deep gong mix...
(16:29:37) C418: aah
(16:30:12) Cthulhu32: I really need to get headphones for work
(16:30:28) notch: deep gong mix? I've missed that
(16:30:28) fartron: http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/evil-lair-on-architecture-of-enemy-in.html
(16:30:30) fartron: evil in games
(16:30:39) C418: well, it's not really from aphex twin...
(16:31:39) notch: the best part about aphex twin is how many other great artists he's inspired
(16:31:48) Cthulhu32: damnit that article just ruined the end of shadow of the colossus
(16:31:54) Cthulhu32: oh well, I guess I wasn't going to beat it anyways

(16:32:29) C418: the real song begins after the first half
(16:32:32) C418: this one's nice too
(16:32:34) notch: venetian snares, of course, but that guy is insane.
(16:32:36) Arne: the famicom version used a different chip, so they had an intro to
(16:32:48) Cthulhu32: Arne: the japanese Gryzor is so much better :/
(16:32:58) Cthulhu32: intros + better chip turnes
(16:33:00) Cthulhu32: tunes*
(16:33:05) C418: ah, the song begins at 1:40
(16:33:07) C418: hmm, lovely
(16:33:10) C418: almost chiptune
(16:33:11) C418: :D
(16:33:24) Cthulhu32: and the ending of Gryzor fami is better
(16:33:32) DeM0nFiRe [kvirc@71-87-212-46.dhcp.oxfr.ma.charter.com] entered the room.
(16:33:37) DeM0nFiRe: Hey there
(16:33:37) Arne: I like Probotector's robot theme better though
(16:33:49) Arne: it's KonToRa in japanese
(16:33:51) Cthulhu32: they ganked the entire ending of probotector
(16:34:08) Arne: Gryzor was... somewhere else?
(16:34:40) Cthulhu32: ahhh
(16:34:41) Cthulhu32: I see

(16:34:49) krys: hello al
(16:34:52) krys: all
(16:34:53) Arne: I saw this arcade game as a kid
(16:35:04) Arne: and thought the guy got into that tunnel looking thing
(16:35:11) krys: i am a french developer and that's my first time here
(16:35:13) Arne: to go to the 3D gameplay
(16:35:15) Cthulhu32: hey krys
(16:35:32) Cthulhu32: Arne: the arcade version was a lot different
(16:35:38) Cthulhu32: it felt weird if you're used to the NES
(16:35:45) krys: i am working on a indie game
(16:35:49) Arne: I'm gonna research it
(16:35:54) Cthulhu32: Mame 100% emus it
(16:35:59) C418: oh, I remember now
(16:36:00) Arne: cuz it totally looked like it was an exploration game
(16:36:02) Cthulhu32: theres a lot of diffs
(16:36:08) C418: gta 4 has actually music from aphex twin
(16:36:16) Cthulhu32: krys: got links?
(16:36:16) Arne: or maybe the demo just cut when the guy was in front of a door looking thing
(16:36:23) krys: yes
(16:36:28) krys:  i have a devblog

(16:36:59) krys: i have begined 2 months ago and i must work again
(16:37:01) Cthulhu32: cool, iphone dev
(16:37:03) Cthulhu32: are you using an engine?
(16:37:07) C418: well, fenix funk is kind of ... more easily recognizable
(16:37:11) krys: yes unity 3d
(16:37:19) Cthulhu32: cool a lot of iphone devs are using that now
(16:37:26) C418: gta 4 uses z twig for that ambient radio channel
(16:37:36) krys: i am a flash dev and unity is similar
(16:37:53) C418: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCPdPiaQljI&fmt=18
(16:38:39) Cthulhu32: yeah I've poked at Unity a bit, seems pretty solid, a lot of devs here are getting into it
(16:39:04) krys: If you know flash, unity is very easy
(16:39:04) notch: no, Naks Acid. =)
(16:39:12) krys: that's the same philosophy
(16:40:02) C418: there is a good possibility that the next afx album would be... straight dnb
(16:40:17) fartronomicon [kish@69.142.74.127] entered the room.
(16:40:44) notch: why do you say that?
(16:41:07) C418: as far as I know, his newer live sessions are just normal dnb

(16:41:18) C418: and he has some very rare normal dnb remixes
(16:41:22) C418: smojphace
(16:41:25) fartron left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(16:41:50) C418: but I'm just speculating
(16:42:27) notch: sounds.. potentially quite bad. =)
(16:42:34) krys: With unity 3d , you can export syandalone for pc, mac, iphone and for the web
(16:43:19) Cthulhu32: yeah thats what the Blurst guys are planning
(16:43:27) Cthulhu32: free to play, $5 for a standalone I think it was
(16:43:52) C418: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwLikpMRh-c&fmt=18 could be something like this again, who knows

(16:46:49) jw: 12 sales will be a year of radio

(16:48:18) C418: oh well, what I don't get. everyone knows aphex twin. strangely enough, a lot of people in the indie scene

(16:49:35) C418: I'm still wondering if his idea is actually legal
(16:49:47) C418: he still sells something and probably wouldn't pay taxes
(16:50:01) BlademasterBobo: I'd imagine paypall deals with that
(16:50:03) Cthulhu32: under a certain dollar amount you can write off as a gift
(16:50:06) BlademasterBobo: and you don't have to under a certain-

(16:51:11) C418: last.fm listeners

(16:55:27) Cthulhu32: they messed with a lot of weird things in probotector
(16:55:35) BlademasterBobo: I like his games but he irritates me

(18:03:07) Arne: the bars would've gotten me though
(18:03:22) Pepe: I could've gone through it over three times with the Contra Code, the last time I played.
(18:03:31) Arne: stupid bars after the end boss is worse than those in megaman
(18:03:34) Evil-Ville: My biggest achievement is wasting over 200 hours on Donkey Kong 64 without even beating it

(18:46:25) notch: four days or so
(18:46:43) KK_laptop: is there a new wave of miner cube-based games
(18:46:53) jsticker: The kay kay
(18:46:54) KK_laptop: not that i even played infiniminer
(18:47:00) Siiseli: notch, wow
(18:47:14) KK_laptop: tha jay ess
(18:47:16) Siiseli: extraordinary, especialyl for such a small time to be working on it
(18:47:22) KK_laptop: essen
(18:47:25) notch: thank you. =)
(18:47:35) notch: I'm going to try cranking out a multiplayer alpha this weekend
(18:47:42) Siiseli: fuck yes
(18:47:44) Siiseli: I will test
(18:47:45) Z80: Actually, I think that I can change the title to fit my meaning.
(18:47:51) Z80: Maybe that would help.
(18:47:51) Z80: :D

(18:48:23) Evil-Ville: Holy shit notch it looks amazing
(18:48:27) notch: Siiseli: Awesome. I'll both announce in here and on the blog when it's available. =)
(18:48:37) jsticker: haha, good luck, KingAl
(18:48:38) jsticker: KK_laptop
(18:48:52) jsticker: I love the woman's dress
(18:48:55) jsticker: The blue one
(18:49:09) jsticker: I wish people would wear that here
(18:49:12) PFawkes [chatzilla@24-155-231-191.dyn.grandenetworks.net] entered the room.
(18:49:16) jsticker: Colourful, imaginative clothes
(18:49:20) Siiseli: oh and a suggestion
(18:49:26) Z80: Hi, PFawkes.
(18:49:31) Evil-Ville: I can't be bothered to play infiniminer anymore
(18:49:45) PFawkes: hello
(18:49:47) Siiseli: notch, make the blocks that you are about to put somewhere show in like this ghost image of it
(18:49:48) KK_laptop: what dress
(18:49:52) KK_laptop: oh
(18:49:55) KK_laptop: they're pants
(18:49:59) KK_laptop: its not a dress :P
(18:50:06) Siiseli: a tslightly transparent version
(18:50:07) PFawkes: Hah, funny thing
(18:50:13) notch: Siiseli: Yeah, that'd help a lot. Right now I've got LMB to add a block and RMB to remove one
(18:50:13) PFawkes: was playing game over interweb
(18:50:14) Siiseli: so you may better see where it'll go
(18:50:25) Arne: is it one byte per block?
(18:50:27) PFawkes: via voice chat
(18:50:29) PFawkes: you know
(18:50:35) Siiseli: notch, yeah just make it so that when you point somewhere it'll show the ghost block
(18:50:36) PFawkes: people thought I was Irish
(18:50:38) notch: ideally, I'd highlight the hovered block in remove mode, and ghost the new block in create mode, but then I have to make it separate modes..
(18:50:45) KK_laptop: jsticker: lots of bored people waiting for their name to be called
(18:50:46) Arne: even at suck a low resolution, it must use a lot of memory
(18:50:50) KK_laptop: i couldnt get a seat
(18:50:57) notch: Arne: 4mb for the map data
(18:51:07) PFawkes: Commencement >.>
(18:51:13) Arne: what's the third root of that?
(18:51:16) notch: the actual tesselated data does get pretty big on the gpi. :-\
(18:51:19) KK_laptop: jsticker: funnily enough that woman was in the queue with me.. and was at the window next to me
(18:51:26) notch: 256*256*64 blocks, one byte each
(18:51:34) Arne: ah
(18:51:46) notch: I want this to work in an applet, so I can't go bigger.
(18:51:52) Siiseli: it's not that much memory usage.. :C
(18:51:56) KK_laptop: i remember her having an argument with them, cos her husband is german and her daughter is german but she is not
(18:52:04) KK_laptop: and i think they sent her back
(18:52:23) PFawkes: :(
(18:52:24) Arne: you need quake textures: http://androidarts.com/misc/qtex2.png
(18:52:26) KK_laptop: jsticker: very mean embassy that one :P
(18:52:34) KK_laptop: nowadays at least
(18:52:44) PFawkes: couldn't she get citizenship?
(18:52:44) notch: hehe arne
(18:52:51) PFawkes: in that circumstance
(18:52:55) Siiseli: vector textures
(18:52:56) KK_laptop: yea,.. i dunno
(18:52:57) Arne: different for the bottom sides and top of the blocks
(18:53:07) KK_laptop: she continued the argument in german
(18:53:10) PFawkes: well, if she is married to someone of some nationality
(18:53:15) notch: i kinda like my horrible programmer art. My main focus it to make the textures clear and clean so you can see what is what
(18:53:16) PFawkes: she should be able to get citizenship
(18:53:18) KK_laptop: maybe she doesnt want to
(18:53:24) PFawkes: hm
(18:53:25) Arne: oh, the grass ones are different
(18:53:26) notch: then the blockiness and low res lets the imagination add the rest.
(18:53:35) notch: yeah, there's support for different textures per side. =)
(18:53:37) PFawkes: then she can't go in the embassy >.>
(18:53:44) PFawkes: that's how embassies work
(18:53:45) Siiseli: notch, I like your art
(18:53:49) Arne: yeah but quake is awesome
(18:53:54) KK_laptop: PFawkes: she was applying for a visa
(18:53:58) KK_laptop: not trying to get in
(18:53:59) Arne: you need little shalraths and shamblers too
(18:54:01) notch: thanks! And yeah, quake IS awesome
(18:54:02) PFawkes: ah
(18:54:03) KK_laptop: visitor visa
(18:54:08) PFawkes: >.>
(18:54:16) PFawkes: that's complicated, though
(18:54:21) PFawkes: maybe her paperwork was not in order?
(18:54:23) PFawkes: in some way
(18:54:36) KK_laptop: yea i guess she needs a written invitation or something
(18:54:36) notch: I'm working on the particle system now. When you break a tile, it'll spawn a bunch of billboards containing segments of the texture the block had. :D
(18:54:49) notch: the billboards will bounce around with proper physics for a short time and fade out
(18:54:55) Siiseli: <3
(18:54:56) KK_laptop: although family members of EU citizens have much more lax rules
(18:54:57) Siiseli: notch, I love you
(18:54:58) Arne: is that world wraparound?
(18:54:59) PFawkes: Yeah
(18:55:02) KK_laptop: when it comes to visas
(18:55:02) PFawkes: true
(18:55:11) notch: Arne: No. But I'm considering making it wrap around. :D
(18:55:15) PFawkes: going from America to the EU is.. not as easy
(18:55:19) PFawkes: especially for extended stays
(18:55:24) Arne: I mean vertically
(18:55:33) PFawkes: you know
(18:55:36) notch: ahh, no. I pressed the magic reset button. =)
(18:55:40) KK_laptop: heh
(18:55:41) Arne: ah
(18:55:43) KK_laptop: my application
(18:55:43) notch: you won't be able to mine out of the map later on
(18:55:48) KK_laptop: said the request is for 8 days
(18:55:52) notch: there will be super rock (with a different texture) there
(18:55:52) Evil-Ville: notch where's water and lava on your list of things to be done
(18:55:55) KK_laptop: i hoping they grant me the 8 days
(18:55:56) KK_laptop: :p
(18:56:01) Arne: are you gonna use different hardness for the blocks?
(18:56:04) KK_laptop: hope^
(18:56:10) Arne: boulderdash
(18:56:11) Siiseli: notch, iy would be cool to drop from the bottom of the map and fall through layers of clouds and end up on the groudn
(18:56:16) notch: yeah, I'm going to steal the system from dwarf forrtess for the water
(18:56:24) PFawkes: Gonna buy NWN today :D
(18:56:27) PFawkes: happy
(18:56:36) Z80: I j:D
(18:56:39) Z80: Haha.
(18:56:40) Evil-Ville: Will you add stuff like pumps too?
(18:56:41) Z80: *:D
(18:56:41) notch: Arne: Yes, absolutely. And different walk speeds and whatever else I can think of
(18:56:59) PFawkes: At least, I hope it's still there :D it
(18:57:01) PFawkes: it
(18:57:03) notch: Evil-Ville: That depends on how much longer I keep working on it. I'm making it easy to add new things
(18:57:17) notch: if people like it and play it, I'll probably keep working on it for a long time. =)
(18:57:18) PFawkes: it's not a very stable supply in the store (they have only one copy
(18:57:52) Arne: the light is baked in?
(18:58:02) Siiseli: notch, also if it'll be gold mining.. make it more interesting than in infiniminer
(18:58:06) notch: the light is VERY simple, for maximum speed. The topmost tile in each column is lit. ;)
(18:58:29) notch: yes, mining rock will be a slow process, and the stuff you mine will have a purpose
(18:58:49) notch: there WILL be a free design mode with infinite mining speed and materials, of course
(18:58:53) notch: but that won't work for the game modes
(18:58:56) PFawkes: Siiseli, you don't like infiniminer?
(18:59:01) PFawkes: a good game is a lot of fun
(18:59:06) KK_laptop left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(18:59:07) notch: it kicks ass =D
(18:59:10) PFawkes: yes it does
(18:59:27) PFawkes: yes it does.
(18:59:28) notch: I'm going to be very open about stealing the basic idea from there.
(18:59:42) notch: 'cause that guy needs all the credit he can get
(18:59:51) Siiseli: PFawkes, I do love infiniminer
(18:59:59) Siiseli: but I think the gold mining itself could be better
(19:00:14) PFawkes: ... wow.
(19:00:22) Siiseli: so what is this being developed in
(19:00:31) Z80: I just churned out an IF that people who don't know me wouldn't get.  Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu--
(19:00:34) notch: Java with LWJGL for opengl and sound
(19:00:36) ***PFawkes is listening to Karma Police
(19:00:40) PFawkes: REGGAE style
(19:00:55) Z80: Also it takes probably twenty seconds or less to get all the endings.
(19:01:07) PFawkes: hmm
(19:01:19) PFawkes: Z80, maybe you could read IF for inspiration
(19:01:35) Z80: I have been.
(19:01:38) PFawkes: hmm
(19:02:21) Siiseli: notch, cool
(19:02:24) Z80: This is like a very simple autobiography... Except not really.
(19:02:26) Siiseli: so it'll be multiplatform?
(19:02:27) PFawkes: There are some very good yet small games
(19:02:28) PFawkes: you know
(19:02:33) Siiseli: oh yay mob in da hosue
(19:02:35) Siiseli: house*
(19:02:43) notch: yes, and hopefully browser as well
(19:03:25) Z80: PFawkes, my problem is that there's not much point in this being IF besides the multiple endings.
(19:03:31) PFawkes: hm
(19:03:32) PFawkes: I see.
(19:03:57) Siiseli: notch, mhoho
(19:03:57) PFawkes: I don't know what to do about that :(
(19:04:11) Z80: So, yeah...
(19:04:12) Z80: :(
(19:04:55) PFawkes: hm
(19:04:57) PFawkes: can I see
(19:05:28) PFawkes: ?
(19:05:36) Z80: Yeah, I guess.
(19:05:42) Arne: you can easily modify the boulderdash mechanic to make a lava routine
(19:06:04) Siiseli: yyes, make lots of boulders
(19:06:13) Arne: just jitter them around 
(19:06:18) PFawkes: hm
(19:06:24) Arne: to the sides
(19:06:25) Siiseli: that are in fact.. lava!
(19:06:28) Arne: if possible
(19:06:44) Arne: then they'll eventually stack neatly
(19:08:09) Siiseli: tadaa
(19:08:52) Z80 is now known as Z8000

(19:11:27) C418: I make music and giggle at giggles
(19:11:47) Siiseli: Giggles giggles*

(19:12:20) Siiseli: whaever could you mean
(19:12:24) Siiseli: you silly tit
(19:12:32) PFawkes: your giggles are made of communism!
(19:12:36) Siiseli: it is not
(19:12:42) PFawkes: is yes!
(19:12:42) Siiseli: it is made of sugar love and sugary love

(19:13:26) C418: well, I don't

(19:14:53) Z80: PFawkes is lamenting that he had to read my awful IF.
(19:15:17) Z80: He needs some good writing to keep him from not exploding.
(19:15:28) PFawkes: You should read All Roads
(19:15:30) PFawkes: er, play
(19:15:34) PFawkes: something!
(19:15:45) Siiseli: playfully read
(19:16:07) PFawkes: rlay?
(19:16:11) PFawkes: plead
(19:16:12) Siiseli: yes
(19:16:14) Siiseli: realy
(19:16:18) Z80: In terms of that, there are two types of IF.
(19:16:20) Siiseli: relay
(19:16:30) Z80: IF that you play and IF that you read.
(19:16:34) Z80: But there are some...
(19:16:35) PFawkes: true
(19:16:47) PFawkes: this is more literary-ish
(19:16:55) PFawkes: it's pretty trippy though
(19:16:57) LordMetroid: if(awful) { exit(); }
(19:17:14) Z80: Teehee.
(19:18:03) Siiseli: if(bored){talk(crap,#tigsource);}

(19:18:23) PFawkes: so I remember a lot of good ones
(19:18:26) PFawkes: of both types
(19:19:23) Siiseli: a girl I know is trying to get me to play visual novels

(19:21:11) Siiseli: noooo
(19:21:13) Siiseli: too anime
(19:21:14) Siiseli: ;_;
(19:21:23) PFawkes: >.>
(19:21:32) PFawkes: Radical Dreamers is the Chrono Trigger series visual novel
(19:21:35) PFawkes: it's kind of obscure
(19:21:40) Siiseli: ..
(19:22:12) PFawkes: :D
(19:22:15) Kobel: I feel like a leak haxare

(19:22:29) Ourobobos: ?
(19:22:32) Ourobobos: what does that do
(19:22:33) PFawkes: I don't know, most visual novels are terrible
(19:22:35) PFawkes: this is a fact
(19:22:46) Siiseli: I think that's why I'd rather not play them
(19:22:48) Ourobobos is now known as BlademasterBobo
(19:22:50) Siiseli: but she insists
(19:22:52) BlademasterBobo: koebl what does that do
(19:22:55) Kobel: Nothing too fancy, just inserts the contents of one array into another
(19:23:01) Arf left the room (quit: Quit: Hardware failures are so much fun).
(19:23:01) BlademasterBobo: o_O
(19:23:05) Kobel: I'm using it for an array collapsing function

(19:23:13) PFawkes: Bobo
(19:23:15) PFawkes: !
(19:23:17) Siiseli: fancypants
(19:23:19) Kobel: Which breaks down all arrays in an array into their elements
(19:23:21) BlademasterBobo: PFawkes
(19:23:21) BlademasterBobo: !
(19:23:25) PFawkes: I want to write things :(
(19:23:36) Kobel: So that I don't end up passing arrays when I want to pass other things
(19:23:37) Siiseli: well write osme
(19:23:51) PFawkes: I know
(19:23:54) Kobel: I'll pastebin it because I think it's pretty elegant
(19:23:54) PFawkes: I want to write with others

(19:26:55) BlademasterBobo: you should unobsc it
(19:27:00) BlademasterBobo: *uobscuficate
(19:27:06) Kobel: Mm like how?
(19:27:19) BlademasterBobo: line 8
(19:27:21) BlademasterBobo: :P
(19:27:41) BlademasterBobo: or at least put a comment there
(19:27:48) Kobel: Do you know .apply?
(19:28:09) BlademasterBobo: >_> nope
(19:28:19) Kobel: Don't feel bad it's undocumented
(19:28:23) Kobel: But it's INCREDIBLY useful
(19:28:37) Kobel: It lets you call functions using arrays as parameter lists
(19:28:42) BlademasterBobo: ah
(19:28:52) Pepe left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(19:29:04) BlademasterBobo: so what are you applying
(19:29:04) Kobel: So the NaN is a placeholder thing you don't need to worry about, and the rest is a parameter list
(19:29:08) BlademasterBobo: ah
(19:29:10) Kobel: splice
(19:29:19) Kobel: Which is the most useful member function fo Array
(19:29:24) BlademasterBobo: yes
(19:29:32) BlademasterBobo: so you're..
(19:29:41) BlademasterBobo: splicing
(19:29:45) BlademasterBobo: ..
(19:29:47) BlademasterBobo: something
(19:29:49) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(19:29:59) Kobel: I'm splicing the contents of Object in
(19:30:47) BlademasterBobo: oh, it's moving object contents into an array?
(19:31:27) farticles: the vehicle controls in mass effect are atrocious
(19:31:34) Kobel: Well by once it's done there'll only be one array, right?
(19:31:41) Kobel: That's what I mean by collapsing the array
(19:31:48) paul|not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems
(19:32:02) Kobel: So I'm recursively taking the contents of each array and dropping it into its parent array
(19:32:16) BlademasterBobo: what does [i, l] do
(19:32:25) Kobel: Those are the first two parameters of splice
(19:32:28) BlademasterBobo: oh
(19:32:44) BlademasterBobo: why the . then
(19:32:51) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(19:32:59) Kobel: the one before concat?
(19:33:02) BlademasterBobo: yeah
(19:33:10) Kobel: [i, 1] makes an array
(19:33:15) Kobel: I call concat on that array
(19:33:20) BlademasterBobo: oh
(19:33:20) BlademasterBobo: ok
(19:33:24) Kobel: To make a new one with all of that other stuff
(19:34:22) BlademasterBobo: oh, so this is like for an array of arrays
(19:34:35) BlademasterBobo: ok I get it now
(19:34:37) Kobel: Yeah
(19:35:10) Z80: http://www.daylife.com/photo/05QR51Y2Ga7NL | OH FUCK THOSE ARE EARS.
(19:35:53) Self-hatred is now known as Howsexy
(19:36:23) BlademasterBobo: what?
(19:36:44) Z80: There are ears where they do not belong.
(19:36:58) BlademasterBobo: I don't see it
(19:37:01) Z80: Well, one ear.
(19:37:24) Z80: The woman's foremost nipple, Blobo.
(19:37:33) Howsexy is now known as Obadiah
(19:37:44) BlademasterBobo: you been starin' at that nipple a little too closely z80
(19:37:50) Z80: Hahahahaha.
(19:37:52) Z80: Actually, no.
(19:38:28) Kobel: Okay I should stop admiring this function and do more work XD
(19:38:44) Thi3f: Kobel, only after you marry it :O
(19:39:02) Kobel: Next
(19:39:05) BlademasterBobo: kobel is a fart sniffer
(19:39:05) Kobel: I need to figure out
(19:39:12) Kobel: How to do time-independent movement damping
(19:39:37) Kobel: Not time-independent:
(19:39:37) Kobel: mLocation.x += (mLocation.x - mLastLocation.x) * mDamping;
(19:39:53) BlademasterBobo: that sounds impossible
(19:39:59) Kobel: what?
(19:40:03) Kobel: You're so negative.
(19:40:06) Thi3f: Hardly impossible
(19:40:08) BlademasterBobo: your face is negative
(19:40:13) BlademasterBobo: your face is impossible
(19:40:26) Thi3f: mLocation.x += ((mLocation.x - mLastLocation.x) * mDamping) / timeSinceLastUpdate;
(19:40:42) Thi3f: Err
(19:40:47) Thi3f: Yeah
(19:40:48) Thi3f: Maybe
(19:40:50) Thi3f: Sorta
(19:40:51) Thi3f: Kinda?
(19:40:51) Kobel: Yeah that doesn't work even slightly
(19:40:54) Kobel: XD
(19:40:58) Thi3f: :(
(19:40:59) BlademasterBobo: lol
(19:41:00) Kobel: Sorry
(19:41:02) Siiseli: sleep
(19:41:05) Obadiah is now known as Willow
(19:41:09) Thi3f: It works in my world
(19:41:17) BlademasterBobo: how can you dampen movement without time; time is intrinsincly linked to movement
(19:41:18) BlademasterBobo: :l
(19:41:27) Kobel: Sorry, I meant framerate independent
(19:41:31) El_Shamro [Shamro@c-67-184-96-210.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(19:41:48) Thi3f: Or just multiply the mDamping by time since last update
(19:41:49) BlademasterBobo: use timers?
(19:41:50) Thi3f: And adjust it
(19:42:04) BlademasterBobo: I think you might be looking at it from the wrong angle
(19:42:06) Kasran: Hello
(19:42:07) Kobel: Multiplying damping by time would make it smaller
(19:42:10) Kobel: Almost always
(19:42:11) BlademasterBobo: you'd have to make movement time independent first
(19:42:12) Thi3f: Yes?
(19:42:22) BlademasterBobo: erm
(19:42:23) Kobel: Smaller means that things stop faster
(19:42:25) BlademasterBobo: frame, rather
(19:42:27) Kobel: Smaller is more damping
(19:42:35) Willow: this channel is maddeningly active
(19:42:38) Thi3f: So reverse it
(19:42:45) Willow: almost 20k lines since I last peeked in
(19:42:51) Kobel: That... doesn't really address the problem?
(19:43:02) Thi3f: Then the problem is stupid :(
(19:43:17) BlademasterBobo: the dampening is just something you apply to movement
(19:43:19) Kobel: Also, yeah, the frame independent movement mixed with verlet stuff is actually far trickier than I thought it would be
(19:43:21) BlademasterBobo: so you have to change how you move
(19:43:55) BlademasterBobo: the above dampening thing isn't really linked to frames, the part that decides how far you moved is
(19:44:13) Kobel: Well the problem with the dampening thing is it gets compounded more often
(19:44:19) Kobel: If the framerate's higher
(19:44:57) BlademasterBobo: well how do you do frame independent movement?
(19:45:17) BlademasterBobo: can't you apply dampening at the part where he moves?
(19:45:31) Thi3f: Dampen the velocity instead of the incremental movement
(19:45:34) Thi3f: ?
(19:45:53) Kobel: I don't see what you mean? Velocity vs incremental movement?
(19:45:55) Kobel: Oh
(19:46:04) Hachi-Roku [hdsakhjlas@c-76-31-99-98.hsd1.tx.comcast.net] entered the room.
(19:46:04) BlademasterBobo: also, .2(1 + 1 + 1) is the same as if you increased frame rate and did .2(1) + .2(1)
(19:46:05) Kobel: With this system velocity == incremental movement
(19:46:12) Pepe [pepe@174-148-221-253.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(19:46:13) Kasran: Hello Hachi-Roku
(19:46:29) BlademasterBobo: so the only way this could be causing it to dampen more with increased frame rate is if you have dampening frame based and movement not
(19:46:31) BlademasterBobo: which doesn't make sense
(19:46:37) BlademasterBobo: or I'm overlooking something
(19:47:01) Kobel: Well with this _Velocity is derived from how much it moved from frame to frame
(19:47:12) Kobel: Which is why there's the mLocation - mLastLocation stuff
(19:47:23) Kobel: So the damping gets compounded more often
(19:47:28) Thi3f: Isn't that a bit backwards
(19:47:36) Kobel: It's useful for a lot of things
(19:47:40) Thi3f: Yeah, but backwards
(19:47:44) El_Shamro left the room (quit: Quit: Off to play video games or something.).
(19:47:46) Kobel: It means if something runs into something you just move it back
(19:47:56) BlademasterBobo: kobel: So is actual movement time based instead of frame based?
(19:47:58) Kobel: And then it stops moving automatically
(19:48:04) Kobel: It WAS frame based
(19:48:09) Kobel: I'm making it time based now
(19:48:13) BlademasterBobo: ah
(19:48:17) BlademasterBobo: but if both are frame based
(19:48:26) BlademasterBobo: I don't see how dampening would get compounded more often
(19:48:30) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(19:48:32) Kobel: If both are frame based the line I copypastad above totally works
(19:48:38) BlademasterBobo: ok
(19:48:57) BlademasterBobo: then just change the velocity thing to look at the timebased shit instead?
(19:48:57) BlademasterBobo: o_O
(19:49:22) Kobel: What?
(19:49:26) BlademasterBobo: wat
(19:49:39) BlademasterBobo: why would you even have them on different types of steps
(19:49:41) BlademasterBobo: >_>
(19:49:42) Kobel: I don't understand the thing you said
(19:49:43) Kobel: They aren't
(19:49:49) Kobel: They're both going to be time-based
(19:49:50) BlademasterBobo: then there isn't a problem?
(19:50:02) Kobel: The problem is that if it runs faster movements will get damped faster
(19:50:12) Kobel: So things will be more slippery whenever the framerate drops
(19:50:13) BlademasterBobo: not if they're both frame based or both time based
(19:50:44) Kobel: Okay
(19:50:49) Kobel: Before you were saying
(19:51:03) BlademasterBobo: pretty much the same thing
(19:51:25) Kobel: 0.2 * 1 + 0.2 *1 + 0.2 * 1 = 0.2 * (1+1+1)
(19:51:31) Kobel: Which is true but that's not what happens
(19:52:22) Kobel: 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 *1 != ( 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 ) * 1
(19:52:40) BlademasterBobo: well
(19:52:50) El_Shamro [Shamro@c-67-184-96-210.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(19:52:54) BlademasterBobo: oh ok
(19:53:05) BlademasterBobo: no
(19:53:09) BlademasterBobo: it is, isn't it?
(19:53:16) Kobel: What?
(19:53:27) BlademasterBobo: if you're applying it to the moved space of the last frame
(19:53:36) Kobel: Well okay, if we're moving at 1fps and with a damping of 0.2
(19:53:38) BlademasterBobo: then that's not .2*.2
(19:53:41) BlademasterBobo: that's .2*1
(19:53:45) Kobel: It gets multiplied by 0.2 every second
(19:53:49) Z80 is now known as Z80isAGHway
(19:53:55) BlademasterBobo: just the movement each frame though
(19:53:59) BlademasterBobo: not the entire thing
(19:54:05) Kobel: The movement each frame IS the velocity!
(19:54:12) BlademasterBobo: what
(19:54:14) Kobel: I've said that like 3 times :\
(19:54:22) Kobel: That's what mLocation - mLastLocation means
(19:54:25) BlademasterBobo: ok, x += (movedSpace) * dampening
(19:54:29) Kobel: Yeah
(19:54:32) BlademasterBobo: movedSpace is a different variable each time
(19:54:39) BlademasterBobo: so it's not getting multiplied more than once.
(19:54:50) BlademasterBobo: so it's movedSpace * dampening + movedSpace * dampening
(19:54:51) Kobel: What.
(19:54:56) BlademasterBobo: not movedSpace * dampening * dampening
(19:54:57) BlademasterBobo: .
(19:55:04) BlademasterBobo: if the frame rate drops
(19:55:07) Kobel: Bobo. Multiplying it by dampening CHANGES how much it moves
(19:55:10) Kobel: That's kind of the point
(19:55:12) BlademasterBobo: what
(19:55:31) Kobel: So the movedSpace gets damped each frame
(19:55:45) BlademasterBobo: yes
(19:55:51) BlademasterBobo: but movedSpace also changes each frame
(19:55:53) BlademasterBobo: it's not the same value
(19:55:55) BlademasterBobo: :l
(19:55:56) Kobel: And that movement is used to derive the NEXT movedSpace
(19:56:00) BlademasterBobo: oh
(19:56:04) BlademasterBobo: well you never said that 
(19:56:07) BlademasterBobo: ;|
(19:56:12) Kobel: mLocation - mLastLocation!
(19:56:33) BlademasterBobo: ok yeah I misread it
(19:56:34) BlademasterBobo: ;_;
(19:56:35) Thi3f: You're gonna have to change that part, because location and lastlocation isn't frame rate independant
(19:56:36) Kobel: I think I've solved at least the first part of this before

(19:57:08) PFawkes: ?
(19:57:10) Thi3f: Or a real velocity that isn't based on frame movement
(19:57:10) Kobel: And I divide it by that to find its movement per second (rather than over the last frame)
(19:57:17) Kobel: Mmbmbm
(19:57:23) Z80isAGHway: Activision is making DJ Hero.

(19:58:22) C418: I assume so too
(19:58:35) SMRobot [littleripp@CPE-143-238-120-117.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.

(20:00:30) Kobel: Hm
(20:00:30) Kobel: _Velocity.x *= pElapsedTime * (pElapsedTime / mLastElapsedTime);

(20:01:03) Kobel: Yeah I think so
(20:01:10) SDHawk\Sleep is now known as SDHawk

(20:03:15) EdgelordPyl: looks fun
(20:03:43) Thi3f: Kobel, no, I don't think you should involve lastelapsed time
(20:03:56) Thi3f: Because then it won't be framerate independant
(20:04:13) Thi3f: You have to calculate each frame with stuff only related to that frame
(20:04:35) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(20:05:09) Kobel: How is that not framerate independent?
(20:05:35) Thi3f: Using data from how long the last frame took will only be stable if the framerate is stable
(20:05:55) hide: say "framerate dependant"
(20:06:34) Lunaway is now known as Lunawayaway
(20:06:40) Kobel: Thi3f, I don't see why that should be true.
(20:07:06) Kobel: I'm using the ratio of frame times to make the motion smooth
(20:08:09) Thi3f: Derive the movement from velocity, dampening and elapsed time, that's it
(20:08:35) Z80isAGHway: <buick> http://www.gametrailers.com/video/japanese-debut-muscle-march/49346
(20:08:41) Z80isAGHway: Huzzah for the Japanese.
(20:08:50) buick: I love the Japanese 
(20:08:54) Thi3f: You can try it the other way, but I'm pretty sure it won't work, for the reasons I supplied
(20:09:22) Thi3f: There's always a chance I'm wrong though, or that it won't be noticeable because you can't provide an environment where the framerate isn't stable
(20:09:26) Thi3f: Or not instable enough
(20:09:36) Thi3f: unstable*?
(20:10:23) Kobel: Your explanation didn't make any sense to me anyway
(20:10:25) Kobel: XD
(20:10:38) Thi3f: And it makes too much sense for me to be able to elaborate :(
(20:10:44) Kobel: Hahaha
(20:10:45) Thi3f: to me for me*
(20:11:25) Kobel: I just think it's weird that you're picking out a thing I added in explicitly TO make it stable across frames as something that will destabilize it across frames
(20:13:15) Thi3f: Mm, but to stabilize a frame you divide what you're gonna do by elapsed time, so that you move in time units instead of movement units :/ I feel as if adding another parameter, that comes from a frame with different time unit, will fux it up :(
(20:14:00) Kobel: I multiply by the ratio of this frame to last frame

(20:15:18) SMRobot: hi all
(20:15:40) Thi3f: Which makes sense why? :( It can vary greatly between frames in worst case scenarios, you'd be compensating for lost time twice
(20:15:58) Kobel: Yes? Because twice as much time has passed?
(20:16:03) Thi3f: No?
(20:16:12) Kobel: So it should move twice as far in this frame
(20:16:24) Thi3f: Why?
(20:16:30) lolilover [l@ppp118-208-58-185.lns4.bne1.internode.on.net] entered the room.
(20:16:32) Thi3f: It should've moved enough last frame
(20:16:37) Thi3f: Because you're using time units
(20:16:43) Kobel: dsfjpoghsdfpo
(20:16:53) BlademasterBobo: lol
(20:16:57) Thi3f: I don't think we're capable of having this discussion with eachother
(20:17:00) Kobel: mLocation - mLastLocation! There is no velocity!

(20:17:17) ***Thi3f goes to watch Grey's Anatomy
(20:17:19) BlademasterBobo: you're not dealing with the problem
(20:17:24) BlademasterBobo: you're just sticking goop on it
(20:17:35) Kobel: How is that not dealing with the problem?
(20:17:48) BlademasterBobo: goop creates other problems down the road
(20:17:48) Kobel: All it is is a solution that completely fucking works
(20:17:56) BlademasterBobo: Does it, Kobel?
(20:17:56) Kobel: As long as I don't run into precision errors
(20:17:58) BlademasterBobo: Does it really?
(20:18:02) BlademasterBobo: Look deep within your soul
(20:18:06) Kobel: Bobo. EVERYTHING creates other problems down the road
(20:18:13) Thi3f: I like Bobo's way of discussing things
(20:18:16) Kobel: I've used at least a very similar system before and I think it worked then
(20:18:24) Kobel: But I can't remember for sure
(20:18:30) Kobel: If it doesn't work then I'll fucking
(20:18:31) Kobel: FIX IT
(20:18:44) BlademasterBobo: also
(20:18:59) BlademasterBobo: that doesn't seem like it'll work
(20:19:23) BlademasterBobo: oh wait
(20:19:28) BlademasterBobo: yeah that seems like it'd make sense
(20:19:32) Kobel: XD
(20:19:35) BlademasterBobo: haha
(20:19:55) BlademasterBobo: it'd probably be better to just make it time based in the first place
(20:20:01) BlademasterBobo: especially with how easy flash makes it to do that
(20:20:07) Kobel: Well the problem isn't the time-basedness
(20:20:19) Kobel: It's using this velocity integration which is really very useful
(20:20:42) BlademasterBobo: why does it have to be frame rate based though?
(20:20:50) Kobel: It isn't
(20:21:01) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:21:09) BlademasterBobo: doesn't flash automatically make timesteps equal lengths apart?
(20:21:16) BlademasterBobo: if you're using a timer or w/e
(20:21:17) BlademasterBobo: ?
(20:21:21) Kobel: Man
(20:21:34) Kobel: Maybe I should go back to a separate velocity variable
(20:21:43) Kobel: I'd probably get in fewer arguments
(20:21:45) Kobel: XD
(20:21:49) BlademasterBobo: lol
(20:22:46) Kobel: Goddammit this just works SO well with collisions though
(20:22:54) BlademasterBobo: just use it
(20:23:08) BlademasterBobo: why does it work well?
(20:23:11) BlademasterBobo: just curious
(20:23:11) Kobel: You just say "no you can't occupy this space there's already something here" and it's like "okay" and it all just WORKS
(20:23:19) BlademasterBobo: haa
(20:23:31) Kobel: Because it automatically cancels its velocity by not moving into that space, see?
(20:23:37) Kobel: Bouncing is trickier though
(20:23:50) BlademasterBobo: oh, is it the Metanet type of velocity?
(20:24:01) BlademasterBobo: where when it collides it gives you a vector that will move things out of each other?
(20:24:22) BlademasterBobo: That is a Good Thing to check out if you haven't
(20:24:26) Kobel: Well that's projecting a vector
(20:24:31) Kobel: Which I have checked out yeah
(20:24:48) Kobel: Not really the same thing... Hm.
(20:25:13) Kobel: I think I need to set this up to use both verlet and standard vectors
(20:25:22) Kobel: Otherwise I'm going to end up Pissed Off at some point
(20:25:24) Kobel: I can tell.
(20:26:03) Kobel: Fortunately... it seems that's already what I've been doing. :)
(20:26:41) BlademasterBobo: haha
(20:26:45) BlademasterBobo: verlet vectors?
(20:26:59) BlademasterBobo: oh
(20:27:01) BlademasterBobo: calculus shit
(20:27:26) BlademasterBobo: I need to grind calculus more
(20:27:31) Kobel: Is it calculus? I had no idea
(20:27:36) BlademasterBobo: I'm pretty not a very high level right now
(20:27:40) Kobel: Here let me link you to the thing I learned about it from

(20:28:35) Kobel: This one really opened my eyes about a lot of things when I was in school
(20:28:42) BlademasterBobo: yeah that looks like calculus
(20:28:43) Kobel: Just in terms of how these sorts of systems work
(20:28:44) BlademasterBobo: :U
(20:28:51) SMRobot [littleripp@121.218.181.173] entered the room.
(20:28:55) Kasran: Hello
(20:29:00) Kobel: Well... if so, it's easy enough for a guy who never took calc to understand, haha
(20:29:11) BlademasterBobo: well
(20:31:02) Jrsquee [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(20:31:43) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: When you're passing around Function references is there a way to check the parameters?
(20:32:15) Jrsquee: HEY GUYS
(20:32:18) BlademasterBobo: HEY SQUEEE
(20:32:25) notch: SQUEE HELLO
(20:32:55) SMRobot: hi all
(20:33:08) Jrsquee: Guess what
(20:33:15) Jrsquee: I went to see colleges today
(20:33:26) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: Also, apply is in the docs
(20:33:27) Jrsquee: I skipped skool and partied in Boston
(20:33:28) BlademasterBobo: under function
(20:33:38) BlademasterBobo: Jrsquee nice
(20:33:38) Jrsquee: At Northeastern and MassArt
(20:33:49) Jrsquee: Northeastern is really really nice
(20:33:53) Jrsquee: I like it lots
(20:34:09) Jrsquee: MassArt I was not enamored with
(20:34:38) Jrsquee: I went to the ICA and looked at the Shepard Fairey exhibit again
(20:34:46) Jrsquee: and bought a watercolor paper moleskine
(20:35:23) Jrsquee: then I went and played in a water fountain in some park in the middle of boston near south station
(20:35:26) EdgelordPyl: oh fucking moleskinethings
(20:35:31) Jrsquee: and that was crazy fun
(20:35:51) Jrsquee: that was probably the most fun I've had in the last 3 weeks
(20:36:12) Jrsquee: I was soaked, but it was a beautiful day
(20:36:14) fartron [kish@69.142.74.127] entered the room.
(20:36:18) Jrsquee: warm and slightly breezy
(20:36:23) Kobel: Hm, it's undocumented somewhere at least
(20:36:35) Jrsquee: but then the fountain shut off
(20:36:40) Kobel: Maybe in Flash's online help thing
(20:36:53) fartron: STOP HAVING BORING TUNA!
(20:36:54) Jrsquee: I bet someone saw that kids were having fun, so the called the fuzz and made them shut it off
(20:37:03) Jrsquee: *so they
(20:37:12) Jrsquee: THE MAN GOT US DOWN
(20:37:12) fartron: STOP HAVING A BORING LIFE ASSHOLES
(20:37:29) raina left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(20:37:32) Jrsquee: fartron, that is the opposite of what happened to me today
(20:37:41) fartron: you had exciting tuna?
(20:37:50) Jrsquee: not tuna
(20:37:54) Jrsquee: but the Man got me down
(20:37:55) fartron: tuna = life
(20:38:03) Thi3f: I had really exciting tuna yesterday
(20:38:03) Jrsquee: and said "STOP HAVING SO MUCH FUN"
(20:38:14) Jrsquee: and removed the source of fun
(20:38:19) fartron: did you go home and listen to rage against the machine
(20:39:06) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:39:10) Jrsquee: No, I went home without letting the man get me down
(20:39:20) notch: and now I sleep. Tomorrow I code.
(20:39:26) notch: gnite!
(20:39:28) notch left the room (quit: Quit: *thud*).
(20:39:59) Jrsquee: I just left, feeling like I had the most fun I've had in a while
(20:40:06) fartron: that's a good feeling
(20:40:19) fartron: you deserve a jerry rubin video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgeonR275aA&fmt=18
(20:41:12) Jrsquee: Just before Having Fun In A Fountain, I had gone to the ICA
(20:41:19) Jrsquee: and see shepard fairey
(20:41:26) PiratePoo left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(20:41:56) fartron: it was those damn bohemians who put the idea in your innocent young head
(20:42:11) lansing [jeffz@yesterday.jeffz.name] entered the room.
(20:42:49) Kobel: Okay, had my calculation a little wrong, but the basic idea seems to work fine
(20:43:13) Kobel: I accidentally had elapsedtime squared
(20:44:00) Jrsquee: GUYS
(20:44:02) Jrsquee: HEY GUYS

(20:44:09) Jrsquee: Wolfram alpha live
(20:44:19) Jrsquee: watch them Get Things Ready
(20:45:18) fartron: i am going to try to ask it a question it cannot answer
(20:45:20) fartron: like why
(20:45:22) fartron: to make it explode
(20:47:38) SMRobot [littleripp@124.184.237.158] entered the room.

(20:49:00) FourbitFriday: :O
(20:49:01) Kobel: Now I just gotta figure out damping
(20:49:18) FourbitFriday: just throw some water on it
(20:49:22) FourbitFriday: that'll make it damp
(20:49:33) Kobel: Hohohohohooh you are the living end
(20:49:36) Kobel: I do declare
(20:49:53) FourbitFriday: :)

(21:06:07) DeM0nFiRe: Hey BlademasterBobo what free RTSes do you play?
(21:06:12) PhoenixJ: :]
(21:06:13) BlademasterBobo: none
(21:06:29) BlademasterBobo: there aren't really any good free rts
(21:06:30) BlademasterBobo: es
(21:06:34) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, weren't you guys talking about something like house global or something
(21:06:38) BlademasterBobo: oh
(21:06:48) BlademasterBobo: that's at oxeye.com
(21:06:53) BlademasterBobo: I haven't tried it yet
(21:07:28) DeM0nFiRe: Man, I so want to make an RTS, but I don't have time to do so :(
(21:07:34) PhoenixJ: what was that one
(21:07:37) PhoenixJ: that was based on bridges?
(21:07:42) PhoenixJ: isn't that one good, and now free?
(21:07:45) BlademasterBobo: ne'er heard of it
(21:07:48) BlademasterBobo: or wait
(21:07:49) EdgelordPyl: bridge story
(21:07:50) BlademasterBobo: the island one?
(21:07:57) BlademasterBobo: like floating islands or w/e?
(21:08:08) PhoenixJ: yeah
(21:08:17) BlademasterBobo: don't remember the name

(21:08:21) PhoenixJ: some tiger was a fan of it
(21:08:23) PhoenixJ: mmm
(21:08:23) DeM0nFiRe: Any of you guys ever check out the Spring RTS engine?
(21:08:28) PhoenixJ: trailblazer maybe?
(21:08:29) BlademasterBobo: that's not free
(21:08:36) BlademasterBobo: you have to get ahold of TA technically
(21:09:02) Kobel: The world wants to get punched in the face
(21:09:16) DeM0nFiRe: Well you do to play the TA Spring
(21:09:17) PhoenixJ is now known as PhoenixJisAway
(21:09:23) DeM0nFiRe: But not to use the engine, right?
(21:09:30) Kobel: FlashDevelop is crashing, the vending machine just ate $2.25, and my elbow hurts
(21:09:30) BlademasterBobo: I guess
(21:09:36) BlademasterBobo: lol
(21:09:52) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: Can you use the prototype variable to see what the parameters for a function are/
(21:09:53) BlademasterBobo: ?
(21:09:54) DeM0nFiRe: I'm just looking at fooling around with the source code
(21:10:11) BlademasterBobo: DeM0nFiRe: Aren't you doing that RPG thing?
(21:10:14) Kobel: I've never really used prototype
(21:10:17) hide left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(21:10:19) Kobel: I think it's kind of deprecated
(21:10:25) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, I am. I'm not talking about seriously using it
(21:10:29) DeM0nFiRe: Just taking a look at it
(21:10:37) BlademasterBobo: oh
(21:10:37) BlademasterBobo: :(
(21:10:45) DeM0nFiRe: Think about maybe making an RTS in the future
(21:11:02) Kobel: You should make a game that's like Halo but with like 50 guns
(21:11:04) Kobel: That'd be sweet
(21:11:15) DeM0nFiRe: Eeew, Halo is awful :(
(21:11:29) Kobel: Sorry I just have to say things like that. I think it's your screen name.
(21:11:30) BlademasterBobo: oh that's something else
(21:11:35) BlademasterBobo: hahaha kobel
(21:11:49) DeM0nFiRe: Kobel: Yeah, I understand :p
(21:12:00) DeM0nFiRe: Like I said, I picked it 8 years agoi
(21:12:02) DeM0nFiRe: -i
(21:12:11) BlademasterBobo: Now might be time for change
(21:12:17) BlademasterBobo: Check your horoscope
(21:12:19) DeM0nFiRe: Nah, I'm sentimental
(21:12:27) DeM0nFiRe: Or maybe just mental
(21:12:29) lansing: morning
(21:12:38) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: Prototype is for something else anyways, nvm
(21:12:42) Jrsquee is now known as Jr
(21:12:51) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: So is there a way to make sure function references take certain paramters?
(21:12:58) BlademasterBobo: like, in C++ you have typedefs and shit
(21:13:03) DeM0nFiRe: Man, I want to start coding that RPG project, but I haven't been able to talk to the producer about hiring some artists yet
(21:13:06) BlademasterBobo: oh
(21:13:12) BlademasterBobo: Could I make a function inherited thing
(21:13:21) BlademasterBobo: hm
(21:13:25) BlademasterBobo: no that wouldn't work
(21:13:34) buick [buick@c-71-231-106-98.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] entered the room.
(21:13:38) BlademasterBobo: hi buick
(21:13:50) DeM0nFiRe: Man, there are so many cool engines that I want a chance to play around with.
(21:13:54) Kobel: Mmm Bobo splain a little
(21:13:55) buick: hi
(21:14:25) BlademasterBobo: kobel: Like, I want a manager class to be able to take functions as arguments so I can have it apply different functions to a list of objects
(21:14:27) Kobel: Hi byook
(21:14:37) BlademasterBobo: this might be too much to bother with but I digress
(21:14:54) Kobel: Okay
(21:15:03) BlademasterBobo: so what if I want one thing to be able to only take functions with two parameters that are class X
(21:15:17) Kobel: Then... only send parameters like that?
(21:15:25) BlademasterBobo: no, like
(21:15:41) Kobel: Usually when I do things like that I have it take the function as one argument and an array of parameters as the second argument
(21:15:46) BlademasterBobo: public function func(x:Function, y:Function)
(21:15:48) Kobel: And it applies one to the other
(21:15:52) BlademasterBobo: ah
(21:16:07) BlademasterBobo: in this case the arguments would be elsewhere though
(21:16:23) Kobel: Like where?
(21:16:30) BlademasterBobo: well, it'd have a list of objects
(21:16:32) Kobel: Also:
(21:16:33) Kobel: http://megaswf.com/view/d5cc6ddcf40ddbf9b7ca6d25cf8174a9.html
(21:16:36) BlademasterBobo: and it'd apply the functions to those objects
(21:16:39) Kobel: I find this utterly delightful
(21:16:48) BlademasterBobo: ?
(21:16:52) Kobel: Except it's not fucking working?
(21:16:56) Kobel: What the fuck?
(21:16:58) BlademasterBobo: it's just one star
(21:16:59) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(21:17:05) Kobel: Why
(21:17:23) BlademasterBobo: I guess I could just let runtime errors do their magic if someone uses it wrong
(21:17:29) BlademasterBobo: *do = work
(21:17:42) Kobel: Wow that's some bullshit
(21:17:51) Kobel: It works in FlashDevelop test but nowhere else
(21:17:54) Kobel: :|
(21:17:55) BlademasterBobo: lol
(21:18:00) Trianglehead left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(21:18:14) Kobel: Bobo that's generally how I go with things like that
(21:18:33) Kobel: Just assume that if anyone does something really stupid it will become apparent pretty fast
(21:19:24) DeM0nFiRe: No one here knows what Spring RTS is licensed under, do they?
(21:19:48) Kobel: For fuck's sake what IS this shit
(21:19:59) Kobel: It's a basic keyboard listener attached to the stage, how can this not work
(21:20:12) lansing: DeM0nFiRe, doesn't come with license info?
(21:20:38) DeM0nFiRe: Well I haven't downloaded the source yet
(21:20:47) DeM0nFiRe: I'm kinda hoping to know what the license is before I download it
(21:21:00) lansing: most projects I know have a LICENSE file
(21:21:40) DeM0nFiRe: I'm sure the source distro has the license, but I want to know what the license is before I download it.
(21:22:50) Kobel: Also what the fuck
(21:22:54) Kobel: Like 1 time out of 10
(21:22:58) Kobel: The star ISN'T THERE
(21:23:43) BlademasterBobo: lol
(21:23:51) BlademasterBobo: what buttons?
(21:23:54) Kobel: And FlashDevelop crashes AGAIN
(21:23:58) Kobel: OIHGpoidhsgfp[sdpgjod
(21:23:59) Kobel: sdfo;i[
(21:24:04) BlademasterBobo: try reinstalling FD?
(21:24:11) Pepe left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(21:24:12) Kobel: Yeah good idea this is fucking shit
(21:24:17) Kobel: Plus I'm a couple versions behind
(21:24:27) BlademasterBobo: what's the latest?
(21:24:31) Kobel: RC3
(21:25:10) DeM0nFiRe: Does FD let you develop flash without having to buy anything from Adobe?
(21:25:14) Kobel: Yeah
(21:25:20) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, that's hot.
(21:25:24) DeM0nFiRe: I need to learn flash.
(21:25:32) BlademasterBobo: do you know any C based language
(21:25:35) Kobel: AS is a good language
(21:25:37) DeM0nFiRe: Yep, C++
(21:25:43) BlademasterBobo: AS3 should be easy to learn then
(21:25:48) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, I'm sure of it.
(21:25:50) BlademasterBobo: It took me like 2 days to get most of it down
(21:25:51) BlademasterBobo: :l
(21:25:57) DeM0nFiRe: I just didn't want to pay adobe $500 or whatever it is
(21:26:06) Kobel: ARGH
(21:26:06) BlademasterBobo: Use FlashDevelop then
(21:26:07) BlademasterBobo: :U
(21:26:11) Kobel: Why is this computer such GARBAGE?
(21:26:12) DeM0nFiRe: Sounds like plan!
(21:26:15) Pepe [pepe@173-131-173-30.pools.spcsdns.net] entered the room.
(21:26:25) BlademasterBobo: kobel: It doesn't work for me either :l
(21:26:28) BlademasterBobo: or wait
(21:26:32) BlademasterBobo: you're talking about something else
(21:26:43) Kobel: Everything's all bogged down and shitty
(21:26:59) DeM0nFiRe: Wht OS do you have?
(21:27:05) DeM0nFiRe: What*
(21:27:19) Kobel: xp 64 I think
(21:27:43) DeM0nFiRe: Might be time to wipe and reinstall, then. I find with Win XP it's not a bad idea to start fresh every few months to a year
(21:27:51) Kobel: yeah well
(21:27:54) Kobel: Not my fucking computer
(21:28:03) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, is it just hardware troubles?
(21:28:03) Jr: "start fresh every few months to a year"
(21:28:04) Kobel: There's a lot of things I'd do differently on here if I had my say
(21:28:11) Jr: I don't like that idea
(21:28:18) DeM0nFiRe: Why, Jr?
(21:28:19) BlademasterBobo: DeM0nFiRe: Kobel is actually at work
(21:28:28) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, ok
(21:28:29) BlademasterBobo: he kind of has an awesome job
(21:28:33) Jr: An OS should be able to support itself
(21:28:36) DeM0nFiRe: I get you
(21:28:42) Jr: for, well
(21:28:47) Jr: forever
(21:28:53) DeM0nFiRe: BlademasterBobo: what is the job?
(21:28:56) Jr: You shouldn't have to wipe and reinstall
(21:28:56) BlademasterBobo: jr: Porn says otherwise
(21:28:57) Kobel: It has its moments
(21:29:01) Kobel: :\
(21:29:03) Jr: Yeah, even that
(21:29:08) BlademasterBobo: DeM0nFiRe: Ask Kobel :P
(21:29:15) DeM0nFiRe: Kobel, what is your job?
(21:29:20) Kobel: If I have an awesome job I'd hate to think of how angry I'd be with a shitty job XD
(21:29:21) Jr: system running slow because you filled up your disk and your disk is slow?
(21:29:26) Jr: sure, I can understand that
(21:29:30) Arf [telnet@190.176.215.177] entered the room.
(21:29:33) Kobel: I make soulless promotional games in Flash
(21:29:34) Jr: slow because you don't have enough ram?
(21:29:35) Jr: sure
(21:29:42) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: What job where you can pretty much use IRC all day long isn't awesome
(21:29:46) DeM0nFiRe: Jr: it's not a matter of the OS deteriorating, it's a matter of Win XP is the biggest target for malware
(21:30:01) DeM0nFiRe: And stuff slips by occasionally and builds up over time.
(21:30:07) Jr: but just because the OS deteriorating (whether because of malware or otherwise)
(21:30:14) Jr: is not acceptable, in my eyes
(21:30:27) Jr: Of course, that
(21:30:31) Jr: is a hard thing to prevent
(21:30:32) DeM0nFiRe: Haha, well, 98% of viruses are written for windows because 99% of the population uses Windows.
(21:31:19) DeM0nFiRe: But yeah, windows obviously has it's problems, but it does what it claims to do so I am happy with it. About the only MS product I am happy with, oh and Direct X of course
(21:31:25) BlademasterBobo: Jr: It's the users fault 99% of the time, though
(21:31:26) BlademasterBobo: :P
(21:31:47) PFawkes: Hm.
(21:31:51) PFawkes: I don't know.
(21:31:57) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, and VS. Damn, I use MS stuff more than I hought.
(21:31:58) PFawkes: I don't know about that at ALL.
(21:32:01) DeM0nFiRe: thought*
(21:32:02) BlademasterBobo: Plus, installing loads of shit slows it down, and most people keep stacking programs that start on logging on
(21:32:11) PFawkes: Bobo, also, windows does not manage ram well
(21:32:23) DeM0nFiRe: That is true
(21:32:34) PFawkes: not as well as, say, linux, which while it has its own issues IS good at memory management, you know?
(21:32:40) BlademasterBobo: I don't know though, I've had my copy installed for a year or so with no real slowdown
(21:32:47) PFawkes: they could surely take that sort of idea
(21:32:48) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, I mean, every OS has it's ups and downs
(21:32:49) ***BlademasterBobo knocks on wood
(21:32:53) PFawkes: it would make people happier
(21:33:03) PFawkes: and they could lie less about "vista capable" and so on
(21:33:18) paul|not left the room.
(21:33:18) DeM0nFiRe: Well, BlademasterBobo I also am a tool and don't use any continuous anti-malware software
(21:33:28) BlademasterBobo: well
(21:33:30) DeM0nFiRe: I honestly think it's easier to wipe every 6 months to a year
(21:33:38) PFawkes: Spybot S&D is a good anti-malware thing though
(21:33:39) BlademasterBobo: use avast
(21:33:41) BlademasterBobo: avast is good
(21:33:44) BlademasterBobo: and free
(21:33:58) DeM0nFiRe: Well, when I do use anti-malware, I use Comodo, Comodo is good
(21:34:07) PFawkes: I liked S&D because it does have a thing which blocks malware webpages and so on even
(21:34:09) PFawkes: which is nice
(21:34:17) BlademasterBobo: I'd also trust a free av more than a pay one
(21:34:24) PFawkes: avast I have heard good things about yeah
(21:34:25) BlademasterBobo: since I've been infested by pay-av adverts before
(21:34:35) PFawkes: McAfee is crap.
(21:34:37) PFawkes: sorry.
(21:34:50) DeM0nFiRe: Now
(21:34:51) BlademasterBobo: McAfee advertisements have gotten a computer of mine infested before
(21:34:52) BlademasterBobo: :U
(21:34:56) PFawkes: yeah
(21:35:02) Jr: I hate having to use antivirus
(21:35:03) PFawkes: it's memory heavy and not very effective
(21:35:08) DeM0nFiRe: I have heard that Norton is a big one for becoming just spyware after teh license runs out
(21:35:09) Jr: and worrying about stuff like that
(21:35:11) DeM0nFiRe: Is that true?
(21:35:13) PFawkes: yes
(21:35:15) PFawkes: it does that
(21:35:15) BlademasterBobo: probably
(21:35:20) BlademasterBobo: that's why I'd use a free one
(21:35:23) DeM0nFiRe: Ok, that's what I thought
(21:35:25) PFawkes: it keeps bugging you to register as well
(21:35:28) PFawkes: it's very annoying
(21:35:28) BlademasterBobo: if they're not attempting to get money out of you
(21:35:34) BlademasterBobo: you should be able to trust them more
(21:35:37) Arf left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(21:35:38) BlademasterBobo: (ironically)
(21:35:40) PFawkes: it's like RENEW YOUR LICENSE
(21:35:48) PFawkes: even two years later
(21:35:51) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, a friend said her friend told her Norton became a virus I was like "Well, I doubt it becomes a virus, but probably spyware, yeah"
(21:35:52) BlademasterBobo: lol
(21:36:06) PFawkes: but Norton is, I think, ok when paid for
(21:36:15) PFawkes: I know a few people who have good results with it
(21:36:36) DeM0nFiRe: Comodo is supposed to be just as good, though
(21:36:38) PFawkes: hm
(21:36:44) SMRobot: avast! for me
(21:36:47) PFawkes: I like AVG for some reason?
(21:36:50) PFawkes: is that bad?
(21:36:58) DeM0nFiRe: It's made by a professional security company, but they make their money off of live support and website certification
(21:36:59) Androu1 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(21:37:02) DeM0nFiRe: Yes
(21:37:05) DeM0nFiRe: AVG is awful
(21:37:07) PFawkes: hah
(21:37:09) PFawkes: yeah
(21:37:12) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-46-247.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(21:37:13) PFawkes: avast is much better true
(21:37:30) DeM0nFiRe: AVG like digs into your OS and won't let you uninstall it, and then it won't let you actually run a damn scan
(21:37:34) PFawkes: yeah
(21:37:44) PFawkes: on the other hand
(21:37:52) DeM0nFiRe: AVG is actually the reason I usually just don't bother with AV anymore
(21:37:57) PFawkes: it's one of the small list of maintained linux antivirus
(21:38:12) PFawkes: which are free
(21:38:22) DeM0nFiRe: Speaking of linux
(21:38:23) PFawkes: avast seems to have one too though, which is good
(21:38:29) BlademasterBobo: AVG also deleted all mmf files taht one time
(21:38:30) PFawkes: though you must register
(21:38:34) BlademasterBobo: xerus loves AVG though
(21:38:35) DeM0nFiRe: I have been using Xubuntu for a while, but it is the shakiest shit I've ever seen
(21:38:36) Jr: huh, linux antivir
(21:38:39) PFawkes: :D
(21:38:39) DeM0nFiRe: How is Fedora Core?
(21:38:39) Jr: HA
(21:38:40) Jr: HA HA
(21:38:43) PFawkes: Xubuntu?
(21:38:45) PFawkes: I like XFCE
(21:38:48) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah
(21:38:52) DeM0nFiRe: XFCE based Ubuntu
(21:38:56) PFawkes: I know
(21:38:58) xerus: avg digs into your os and doesnt let you uninstall it?
(21:39:01) Jr: Xfce is the dog's bollox
(21:39:01) xerus: the fuck version is that
(21:39:10) PFawkes: I finally switched back to gnome because I mucked up my xfce settings somehow
(21:39:22) PFawkes: but I really like it
(21:39:23) BlademasterBobo: xerus: Didn't it like, uninstall some important OS files once for you or something?
(21:39:24) Jr: I love openbox
(21:39:28) PFawkes: yes, it's ok
(21:39:33) PFawkes: if you don't like having a desktop
(21:39:36) xerus: uhh like 2 years ago it thought svchost was a virus
(21:39:39) xerus: and somehow deleted it
(21:39:39) ***PFawkes relies on his desktop
(21:39:45) Kobel: This is very odd!
(21:39:47) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(21:39:50) Jr: I don't like a desktop
(21:39:51) Kobel: At 60fps it breaks
(21:39:53) PFawkes: but I do
(21:39:54) fartron left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(21:39:54) Kobel: At 30fps it works
(21:39:57) DeM0nFiRe: Is Fedora Core good, though?
(21:39:58) PFawkes: otherwise I might use it
(21:39:58) Jr: I try to keep mine as clean as possible
(21:40:02) DeM0nFiRe: I've heard good things about it
(21:40:04) PFawkes: rox-filer is terrible
(21:40:08) PFawkes: you know
(21:40:09) Jr: yes
(21:40:12) Jr: it is
(21:40:16) Jr: I like nautilus
(21:40:18) Jr: a lot
(21:40:19) PFawkes: have you looked at fluxbox?
(21:40:22) Jr: which is why I use gnome
(21:40:24) Jr: I have not
(21:40:28) PFawkes: ot'
(21:40:30) Jr: I hear it is nice
(21:40:36) PFawkes: it's not bad
(21:40:40) PFawkes: certainly very light
(21:40:49) Jr: it's basically openbox, I've heard
(21:40:53) Jr: but a little different
(21:41:01) Jr: or other way 'round
(21:41:03) DeM0nFiRe: I am trying to decide what linux distro I should use when I get around to setting up a dual boot on this machine
(21:41:03) Jr: whatever
(21:41:08) Jr: ubuntu
(21:41:16) DeM0nFiRe: I dunno, I'm not a fan of Ubuntu
(21:41:18) BlademasterBobo: Ubuntu?
(21:41:20) Jr: it's well supported
(21:41:24) PFawkes: they both come from blackbox I think
(21:41:25) BlademasterBobo: I might install a linux thing one day
(21:41:28) Jr: that's what matters to me
(21:41:29) PFawkes: but they're branches
(21:41:30) BlademasterBobo: although I'd rather do a VM thing
(21:41:35) BlademasterBobo: I don't like rebooting
(21:41:35) Jr: no, don't
(21:41:36) PFawkes: :D
(21:41:39) Jr: do it the other way
(21:41:40) PFawkes: do a USB
(21:41:41) Jr: that's what I do
(21:41:47) BlademasterBobo: ?
(21:41:48) PFawkes: if you want to test out linux
(21:41:52) PFawkes: do a USB install
(21:41:53) Jr: win-in-lunicks
(21:41:54) PFawkes: and try it out
(21:41:58) PFawkes: or! Portable Ubuntu!
(21:42:00) BlademasterBobo: Jr: But I use Windows more
(21:42:01) PFawkes: that's new-ish
(21:42:03) BlademasterBobo: or I would, rather
(21:42:11) PFawkes: http://portableubuntu.demonccc.com.ar/
(21:42:12) Jr: then stick with windows
(21:42:16) BlademasterBobo: well
(21:42:18) DeM0nFiRe: Haha, yeah of course you use windows more now, 'cos you don't use linux at all yet :D
(21:42:20) BlademasterBobo: I'd do it for testing mostly
(21:42:21) PFawkes: it gives you a gnome panel AND a windows panel
(21:42:24) BlademasterBobo: if I did a dual install thing
(21:42:30) Jr: oh, I guess, then
(21:42:31) DeM0nFiRe: I need a linux distro for cross platform games
(21:42:37) Kobel: Iiiiiinteresting
(21:42:40) BlademasterBobo: Koebl
(21:42:42) BlademasterBobo: Hi
(21:42:42) PFawkes: see, ubuntu would be good for gaming
(21:42:47) Kobel: Hi
(21:42:52) Jr: IF IT HAD DRIVERS
(21:42:53) Kobel: So I'm tracing velocity over time here
(21:42:54) PFawkes: because all the people who try to game on linux use it
(21:42:55) BlademasterBobo: what is so interesting
(21:42:56) PFawkes: see
(21:42:58) Jr: then it would be good
(21:43:03) Jr: BUT IT HAS NO DRIVERS
(21:43:03) PFawkes: debian though might work?
(21:43:05) Kobel: And I see that once velocity drops under 3 it kicks down to 0
(21:43:06) PFawkes: or fedora
(21:43:09) PFawkes: fedora maybe
(21:43:11) Jr: FOR GRAPHIC CARDS
(21:43:12) DeM0nFiRe: I don't know, is there a significant stability difference between Ubunto and Xubuntu?
(21:43:15) Kobel: So that's why it's not working at 60fps
(21:43:20) BlademasterBobo: lol
(21:43:23) Jr: DeM0nFiRe: what version?
(21:43:26) PFawkes: most companies that release any linux drivers use fedora
(21:43:28) DeM0nFiRe: 8.10
(21:43:30) Jr: 9.04?
(21:43:30) PFawkes: RPMs you know
(21:43:31) Kobel: Hmmmm
(21:43:32) BlademasterBobo: I hate trace statements
(21:43:36) DeM0nFiRe: 8.10 is the last I tried
(21:43:38) Kobel: I think I know what's wrong
(21:43:39) BlademasterBobo: I really wish there was a good step debugger
(21:43:40) BlademasterBobo: that was free
(21:43:45) Kobel: Trace statements are super useful
(21:43:47) DeM0nFiRe: Maybe I will try FC then
(21:43:48) PFawkes: Hm
(21:43:51) PFawkes: yeah
(21:43:55) BlademasterBobo: I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too
(21:43:57) Kobel: I like them even when I have step debugger
(21:43:57) DeM0nFiRe: Because I definitely need video drivers XD
(21:43:58) BlademasterBobo: or eat most of it
(21:44:00) PFawkes: :D
(21:44:03) Jr: I've never had any problems with ubuntu
(21:44:08) Jr: any time it broke
(21:44:12) BlademasterBobo: yeah, but it's like using printf statements
(21:44:13) BlademasterBobo: :l
(21:44:14) Kobel: can figure out what's going on a lot faster with a trace sometime
(21:44:17) DeM0nFiRe: I tried Ubuntu with my ATI X1650 on my other machin
(21:44:18) Kobel: Yeah it's primitive
(21:44:20) Jr: was because I screwed things up
(21:44:24) PFawkes: ati is not so good with linux
(21:44:24) BlademasterBobo: plussss, a good step debugger will have expression testing
(21:44:27) Kobel: I just put them in for a minute or two and then take them out
(21:44:27) PFawkes: nvidia seems best, no?
(21:44:29) DeM0nFiRe: And I installed trhe prprietary driver for it and it killed the OS 0_0
(21:44:30) BlademasterBobo: which is pretty much the same thing
(21:44:36) BlademasterBobo: if used right
(21:44:40) PFawkes: I think nvidia is best supported
(21:44:43) PFawkes: no idea
(21:44:48) DeM0nFiRe: Well, this machine has an Nvidia GeForce 9500
(21:44:48) Jr: by me screwing things up
(21:45:00) PFawkes: ah well, no idea
(21:45:05) DeM0nFiRe: But, you know, I'd like to get my games working on an ATI card in linux as well XD
(21:45:07) PFawkes: I want to maybe try SuSE someday
(21:45:07) Jr: I mean like dicking around with GRUB and my X and stuff
(21:45:13) PFawkes: SuSE is cool.
(21:45:19) Jr: and uninstalling important packages
(21:45:19) DeM0nFiRe: I want to try MuSE
(21:45:25) PFawkes: or maybe Freespire
(21:45:31) DeM0nFiRe: 'cos it comes with some cool music junk, apparently
(21:45:40) DeM0nFiRe: I wish someone would finish ReactOS!
(21:45:40) PFawkes: which is basically like shooting all the opensource activists with a gun
(21:45:42) PFawkes: but it's nice
(21:45:56) PFawkes: they have proper licenses for free proprietary everything, basically
(21:46:01) PFawkes: no idea how
(21:46:12) DeM0nFiRe: What, Freespire?
(21:46:15) PFawkes: yeah
(21:46:21) DeM0nFiRe: I should check it out
(21:46:28) PFawkes: you don't like ubuntu
(21:46:37) Kobel: Okay
(21:46:40) PFawkes: it's based on ubuntu I think?
(21:46:54) Kobel: Turns out it was just a victim of my statement that killed speed once it dropped under a minimum amount
(21:47:02) Kobel: The minimum amount was too big at 60fps
(21:47:07) DeM0nFiRe: If it's Ubuntu, it's Kubuntu, it uses KDE
(21:47:22) Kobel: So I changed it to 1 pixel/second, which should be fine
(21:47:23) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, you're right
(21:47:26) DeM0nFiRe: Ubuntu + KDE
(21:48:19) Thi3f left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(21:48:33) PFawkes: "builtin support for nvidia etc"
(21:48:37) PFawkes: that seems like a good sign
(21:48:58) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, that's true
(21:49:11) DeM0nFiRe: Seems like it'd be a viable option for OEM's too
(21:49:49) DeM0nFiRe: Man, I need to talk to the guy with the money!
(21:49:56) PFawkes: though I have to wonder how on earth someone got permission to freely distribute windows media codecs
(21:50:00) PFawkes: like, at all
(21:50:03) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah
(21:50:05) DeM0nFiRe: That is odd
(21:50:42) PFawkes: as far as I know it's legit though
(21:50:47) Kobel: http://megaswf.com/view/4d30030211c98557b17ceb594c91cded.html
(21:50:57) BlademasterBobo: still doesn't do anything
(21:51:03) DeM0nFiRe: So, I think I have asked but has anyone here had any luck wrapping C++ code for Ruby?
(21:51:04) Kobel: What?
(21:51:06) Kobel: Click on it
(21:51:10) BlademasterBobo: oh
(21:51:11) Kobel: Then press arrow keys
(21:51:16) BlademasterBobo: ok, it spins and moves
(21:51:17) BlademasterBobo: haha
(21:51:23) BlademasterBobo: make it have a trail of spinning particles!
(21:51:25) BlademasterBobo: :P
(21:51:26) qubodup_ [qubodup@brln-4db90022.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(21:51:32) PFawkes: it doesn't come with dvd playback, though, apparently
(21:51:34) DeM0nFiRe: Kobel, I could move and spin with it since the first link you posted a while back
(21:51:35) PFawkes: you'd have to buy that
(21:51:47) Kobel: Probably because your computer's slow, haha
(21:52:00) DeM0nFiRe: My computer?
(21:52:11) Kobel: But at stable 60fps it was having problems because the movement was falling under the cutoff value
(21:52:14) Kobel: And getting zeroed out
(21:52:18) BlademasterBobo: haha
(21:52:22) Kobel: Because the cutoff value wasn't time independent
(21:52:26) DeM0nFiRe: Why would it working for me indicate a slow computer?
(21:52:32) Kobel: I just explained why
(21:52:33) BlademasterBobo: he just said why.
(21:52:35) BlademasterBobo: sheesh
(21:52:49) DeM0nFiRe: Oh, whoops
(21:52:53) DeM0nFiRe: Ok, I get you
(21:53:07) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, I get less than 30FPS
(21:53:11) qubodup left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(21:53:16) BlademasterBobo: Oh man I'm pretty close to having a working game engine
(21:53:17) BlademasterBobo: :OO
(21:53:18) DeM0nFiRe: Strange, my computer isn't a beast or anything, but it's not too bad
(21:53:32) DeM0nFiRe: Are you, BlademasterBob? That's cool. What sort of game engine?
(21:53:35) BlademasterBobo: how does he get <30 frames with one particle
(21:53:37) BlademasterBobo: Flash
(21:53:40) BlademasterBobo: Component
(21:53:45) Kobel: Anyway, I don't think you get why this is cool Bobo. The animation speed is scaled  to movement speed
(21:53:46) BlademasterBobo: Ripping off Alec's Monocle idea
(21:53:52) BlademasterBobo: which is ripping off Unity
(21:54:00) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: Yeah, I see
(21:54:01) Kobel: Flash doesn't have any native support for scaled animation speeds
(21:54:02) BlademasterBobo: *saw
(21:54:08) Kobel: It isn't rotating, it's an animation
(21:54:13) BlademasterBobo: oh
(21:54:15) BlademasterBobo: tight
(21:54:15) Kobel: The same technique can be used for character movement
(21:54:16) PFawkes left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(21:54:28) DeM0nFiRe: That is pretty cool
(21:54:29) BlademasterBobo: you should make a trail, though
(21:54:30) Kobel: Also this isn't a particle, it has significant overhead particles don't
(21:54:37) Kobel: Collision tests and stuff
(21:54:42) BlademasterBobo: you should still make a trail
(21:54:45) BlademasterBobo: and why <30fps
(21:54:50) buick left the room (quit: Quit: Laptop is probably asleep ....).
(21:54:51) BlademasterBobo: still just one object
(21:55:00) BlademasterBobo: just curious
(21:55:01) Kobel: Haha probably but I need to do some work on it first
(21:55:08) Kobel: On particle distributions
(21:55:11) Kobel: Well
(21:55:18) Kobel: a) he probably has Flash 9 which is way slower
(21:55:25) Kobel: b) this is in debug mode which is also way slower
(21:55:31) Kobel: c) his computer sucks
(21:55:54) DeM0nFiRe: Haha, my computer doesn't suck. I mean, it's not top of the line, but I've got a HT 3.06 Ghz Proc, 2GB DDR2 RAM
(21:56:04) BlademasterBobo: oh, yeah
(21:56:12) DeM0nFiRe: But yeah, I think I have Flash 9
(21:56:12) BlademasterBobo: I forgot to do the multiple window test thing
(21:56:12) BlademasterBobo: :P
(21:56:15) Kobel: Oh that sounds pretty good, then it's probably mostly the Flash 9 thing
(21:56:17) BlademasterBobo: It doesn't slow down ever
(21:56:25) Kobel: The other thing is
(21:56:36) Kobel: I coded these classes BEFORE I knew about Flash's absurd function call overhead
(21:56:42) BlademasterBobo: ...?
(21:56:46) Kobel: I may have to restructure them a little now that I know
(21:56:51) BlademasterBobo: there's an absurd function call overhead?
(21:56:52) BlademasterBobo: ;3;
(21:57:06) Kobel: I was screaming about it all day yesterday XD
(21:57:11) BlademasterBobo: I guess that kind of makes sense
(21:57:17) BlademasterBobo: since functions are technically objects
(21:57:19) BlademasterBobo: :l
(21:57:22) Kobel: Yeah
(21:57:26) DeM0nFiRe: Nah, strange
(21:57:31) DeM0nFiRe: Still <30 FPS
(21:57:33) Kobel: But basically, a function call costs maybe a little more than a sqrt operation
(21:57:34) DeM0nFiRe: That is really wierd
(21:57:36) BlademasterBobo: DeM0nFiRe: Dual core?
(21:57:41) BlademasterBobo: Kobel: What/?!
(21:57:45) BlademasterBobo: that's bullshit
(21:57:47) DeM0nFiRe: No, but it's Hyper Threaded
(21:57:47) Kobel: Yes.
(21:58:03) Kobel: Well maybe I'm exaggerating a little
(21:58:03) BlademasterBobo: Oh man
(21:58:11) Kobel: But SERIOUSLY, if you're trying to optimize
(21:58:14) BlademasterBobo: I might have to completely scrap this component thing if that's the case
(21:58:15) BlademasterBobo: :l
(21:58:19) Kobel: I recommend cutting down on function calls first
(21:58:19) BlademasterBobo: haha
(21:58:38) Kobel: I cut down one call in my particle system and gained 2fps with 2000 particles

(21:59:00) Jr: wait, nevermind
(21:59:15) DeM0nFiRe: Kobel, what are the specs for teh machine with which you are getting 60FPS?
(21:59:19) DeM0nFiRe: the*
(22:00:17) Kobel: Bottom of the line quad core thing with a bunch of crap on it
(22:00:29) Kobel: Things tend to run better on my 1.8 laptop though for some reason
(22:00:34) BlademasterBobo: I'm getting 60 on a 3ghz dual core
(22:00:37) Kobel: Probably because I don't put a bunch of CRAP on it
(22:01:02) Jr: OH SNAP CAP AMERICA
(22:01:03) DeM0nFiRe: I am getting 18-23 on a Hyper Threaded 3.06 Ghz. That makes no sense
(22:01:04) BlademasterBobo: plachenko: It's not like that for me
(22:01:17) BlademasterBobo: DeM0nFiRe: Hyper threaded != dual core

(22:03:38) BlademasterBobo: the spy has no red dot on his head for me
(22:03:40) Jr: 2.4ghz single without hyperthreading
(22:03:45) plachenko: yeah
(22:03:46) Jr: and 2gb ddr1 ram
(22:03:49) plachenko: they constantly take images down
(22:03:52) Jr: I get like 18-38fps
(22:03:52) plachenko: and put them up
(22:03:59) plachenko: that's what they did with the spy before
(22:04:04) BlademasterBobo: kobel you need to work on your engine
(22:04:04) plachenko: being cloaked behind the sniper
(22:04:11) Kobel: Which one Bobo?
(22:04:12) plachenko: so it's going to be a sniper/spy war now
(22:04:22) BlademasterBobo: this one
(22:04:35) BlademasterBobo: Your target audience isn't going to be able to run your game
(22:04:35) BlademasterBobo: XD
(22:05:20) Kobel: Oh come on, don't be a dramafag bobo :P
(22:05:25) BlademasterBobo: haha

(22:06:00) Kobel: There might even be a trace left
(22:06:27) Kobel: Yeah it's tracing out every frame, that'll bog it down
(22:07:17) BlademasterBobo: plachenko : What'd the page show when the spy was still cloaked? just that part of the picture?
(22:07:23) plachenko: hold up
