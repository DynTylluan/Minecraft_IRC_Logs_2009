(18:05:55) Solarblade: I heard tanks are good for clearing highway traffic.
(18:06:01) corpus: I'd like to get one of those blackbird, fly things, if I ever see one
(18:06:25) corpus: medium format is a dick on for me, though, cos nowhere in newcastle seems to be trustworthy for developing it
(18:06:32) Turgid: Tanks are a good solution for most problems.
(18:06:35) corpus: other than the massively expensive place
(18:06:42) Turgid: If not tanks, lava.
(18:06:46) Solarblade: If it's broken, bring a tank?
(18:06:50) Solarblade: that shoots lava?
(18:06:59) Jr: corpus, yeah, I guess
(18:07:00) corpus: if I lived in new yawk, I could stroll over to B&H whenever I wanted
(18:07:01) Turgid: Now you're just getting ridiculous.
(18:07:06) Jr: I <3 medium format
(18:07:13) corpus: I <3 B&H
(18:07:19) Solarblade: Me? RIDICULOUS? MADNESS!
(18:07:22) Turgid: I <3 <3
(18:07:22) Jr: I just bike down to the local photo place
(18:07:27) Jr: and give them my film
(18:07:40) Jr: if it's color
(18:07:57) Jr: I don't shoot much color film anymore
(18:07:58) corpus: the place I went to chopped the prints up by machine, I guess
(18:08:07) corpus: which doesn't work so well with the holga, when you're winding it yourself
(18:08:27) corpus: though you do keep the number in the middle of the window on the back, so actually, bullshit
(18:08:35) corpus: but yeah, they cut half of my pictures in half
(18:08:45) corpus: or had them coming off at weird angles
(18:08:54) genericuser left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(18:09:05) corpus: where do you develop your b&w film, btw?
(18:09:13) corpus: you used to do it at the photo place you worked at, didn't you?
(18:09:15) Solarblade: And tanks shooting lava could totally happen.
(18:09:32) corpus: deffoz
(18:09:34) Solarblade: but would probably not be practical. At all.
(18:09:36) Jr: that's how it goes, corpus
(18:09:43) Jr: ask them to manually scan them
(18:09:50) ThreebitThor: forget I'm here, I always do.
(18:09:55) Jr: hey xion
(18:10:06) corpus: yo xion

(18:11:31) Jr: you can do it
(18:11:33) corpus: anyway, Jr, in the summer you can slap me whenever I'm taking a shitty photo
(18:11:34) ThreebitThor: well my sister helped
(18:11:38) Jr: corpus, no
(18:11:40) Jr: I will not
(18:11:43) ThreebitThor: and she's got like a degree of some degree in cooking
(18:11:46) corpus: and calmly explain to me the tricks of the trade
(18:11:46) Jr: you  must be shamed from within
(18:11:53) corpus: I already am

(18:12:00) corpus: but I have grown to resist my shame
(18:12:03) Jr: no
(18:12:06) Jr: embrace it
(18:12:13) corpus: when I do something awful, I am usually thinking, "this is an awful thing to do"

(18:12:45) corpus: mahyar rahmantalab shaved his head
(18:12:46) corpus: nooo
(18:12:48) Jr: the trick to having 2 good pictures is shooting about a million bad ones
(18:12:49) Jr: really
(18:13:06) Jr: notice I have not put anything photo on flickr for a while
(18:13:12) Jr: that is because I have not been shooting much
(18:13:16) Jr: and it's all been crap
(18:13:29) Solarblade: I still think we need more cookie machine guns and lava-spewing tanks.
(18:13:44) siiseli: indeed we do
(18:13:46) corpus: Solarblade tries in vain, but fails
(18:13:53) ThreebitThor: flamethrowers were a horrible invention
(18:14:06) corpus: so were guns
(18:14:08) ThreebitThor: and they also tend to be pretty crappy in games
(18:14:10) corpus: and the guillotine
(18:14:11) Solarblade: Psychological horror more then actual use.
(18:14:13) corpus: and microwaves
(18:14:16) corpus: fuck you, microwaves
(18:14:18) ThreebitThor: microwaves
(18:14:20) ThreebitThor: are the shit
(18:14:21) Jr: corpus, I still think it's weird
(18:14:27) Jr: that you're going to america
(18:14:34) Jr: about 30 min from here
(18:14:38) corpus: hah
(18:14:38) reetva: Hell, even VIDEO GAMES were bad ideas.
(18:14:40) Solarblade: Microwaves will be the end of us when they mutate into our robot overlords.
(18:14:40) Jr: or less, by train
(18:14:50) corpus: I secretly tracked you down, Jr
(18:14:54) corpus: went back in time

(18:15:17) corpus: well, I'm certainly going to a nation
(18:15:21) corpus: NH
(18:15:24) corpus: the less famous one
(18:15:28) Jr: okay, never mind then
(18:15:38) Solarblade: Someone should make a game where you travel back in time and destroy mankind
(18:15:41) corpus: but they're quidistant from whaddayacallit, more or less
(18:15:44) corpus: fuck, what is it called
(18:15:49) corpus: all I'm getting is Berlin
(18:15:53) corpus: this is ridiculous
(18:15:54) Jr: Salem MA to NBPT is $1.70 on the train
(18:15:59) corpus: also, equidistant*
(18:16:02) corpus: BOSTON
(18:16:05) corpus: fuck yes
(18:16:10) Jr: hahah
(18:16:17) ThreebitThor: but at least guns have a cool application in videogames
(18:16:30) corpus: and that sounds hot, Jr
(18:16:31) ThreebitThor: whereas flamethrowers just suck all around
(18:16:38) corpus: how much is it on the train from NH?
(18:16:42) Jr: ,.oO( ... berlin ... berlin ... berlin ...)
(18:16:43) Solarblade: But flamethrowers let you set things on fire.
(18:16:44) ThreebitThor: you never see anyone dual-wielding flamethrowers
(18:16:44) Lakmir [Lakmir@c-71-192-107-195.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(18:16:45) Jr: I don't know
(18:16:46) Solarblade: Easier.
(18:16:46) corpus: maybe more, just because you're crossing the state line?
(18:16:50) Jr: well
(18:16:57) Jr: I don't know if the train goes there
(18:17:04) corpus: and that is exactly how it went
(18:17:06) reetva: Egoraptor has officially gone insane.
(18:17:11) corpus: american public transport is bollocks, Jr
(18:17:15) corpus: I have to level with you on this one
(18:17:17) ThreebitThor: or throwing them into the air while they slice something up and then catch the flamethrower again and burn the cut thing to a crisp
(18:17:18) Jr: you could probably take salem to boston and then boston to nbpt if you wanted to
(18:17:22) Jr: corpus yes
(18:17:23) corpus: disgusting
(18:17:26) Jr: terrible
(18:17:29) reetva: Proof of Egoraptor's insanity: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/497076
(18:17:33) Jr: hideous
(18:17:34) corpus: why don't we just fly there pardner hyuck hyuck
(18:17:40) Jr: yes
(18:17:45) Jr: basically
(18:17:47) ThreebitThor: they'd be marginally cooler if they caused exploding rather than just burning
(18:17:49) corpus: let's strap a plane onto the humvee
(18:17:57) corpus: because what the fuck's the environment
(18:18:00) ThreebitThor: or like
(18:18:03) ThreebitThor: a flamethrower
(18:18:06) Jr: don't forget the ggrill
(18:18:08) ThreebitThor: that also spewed bullets
(18:18:11) corpus: I am mad dissing your countrymen, Jr
(18:18:11) ThreebitThor: as it flamed
(18:18:15) ThreebitThor: flaming bullets
(18:18:15) corpus: stand up for what you believe in
(18:18:23) Jr: corpus, those are the weirdos down south
(18:18:26) corpus: haha
(18:18:27) Jr: I'm a yank
(18:18:28) Solarblade: flamethrower with a bayonet that also shoots flaming bullets.
(18:18:32) Solarblade: AND SHOT LAVA
(18:18:38) Jr: We're better up here
(18:18:38) ThreebitThor: lava
(18:18:43) ThreebitThor: is waaay better than fire
(18:18:58) ThreebitThor: I could see awesomeness in a lavathrower
(18:19:09) corpus: hm, I'll probably have to get the bus
(18:19:17) Solarblade: it'd be like throwing fire
(18:19:21) Jr: the bus is cheap too
(18:19:25) Solarblade: except it travels along the ground
(18:19:32) Solarblade: and melts people
(18:19:35) ThreebitThor: strategic applications too
(18:19:36) Jr: train is cheap if you show you're a student
(18:19:41) Jr: students get half-price
(18:19:42) ThreebitThor: lavathrow a nice big pool
(18:19:49) ThreebitThor: and lure/knock enemies into it
(18:19:50) Solarblade: and could totally be poured from ceilings
(18:19:50) Jr: also never buy a two-way ticket
(18:19:52) corpus: haha
(18:19:53) corpus: http://www.bostonexpressbus.com/locations.html
(18:19:57) corpus: every stop looks the saaaame
(18:20:04) Solarblade: ...I'M SEEING A GAME FORMING IN MY HEAD
(18:20:22) corpus: is that one of those little, like, shopping and convenience and eatin' islands you have?
(18:20:22) ThreebitThor: maybe you could lavathrow some lava into water
(18:20:25) ThreebitThor: to make some stones
(18:20:31) Solarblade: "Use the Lavathrower 3000 to infiltrate the enemy HQ!"
(18:20:32) ThreebitThor: that you can use as platforms
(18:20:47) corpus: then some trees and roads, and everyone lives 5 mins away by car and drives in then retreats to their street in the distance
(18:20:49) ThreebitThor: although that might be a little difficult since rock sinks
(18:20:58) Solarblade: still
(18:21:00) corpus: that's what it was like in new england
(18:21:07) Solarblade: maybe it could float for a few seconds then sink?
(18:21:11) corpus: or massachusettes
(18:21:14) ThreebitThor: yeah maybe
(18:21:16) Super-Dot: I understand that lava is sort of dense
(18:21:18) corpus: MA is more precise, right?
(18:21:21) corpus: I think it was mashpee.
(18:21:24) corpus: so many names.
(18:21:24) Super-Dot: So rock would probably sink slowly
(18:21:36) corpus: why should I never buy a two-way ticket, Jr?
(18:21:38) ThreebitThor: dense?
(18:21:43) ThreebitThor: wouldn't that sink faster?
(18:21:44) corpus: and how would I go about showing I'm a student?
(18:21:45) ThreebitThor: you mean porus?
(18:21:57) Super-Dot: Lava is dense
(18:22:05) ThreebitThor: oh
(18:22:07) ThreebitThor: I get you
(18:22:13) Solarblade: pumice is porus if I remember my rocks correctly
(18:22:15) Super-Dot: And the rock in question could be porous
(18:22:15) ThreebitThor: rock would sink slowly in lava
(18:22:18) Jr: corpus, on the train don't buy a twoway ticket because they don't check half the time and you don't save anything
(18:22:23) Super-Dot: If you want it to stay floating forever
(18:22:41) corpus: yeah but if they check will I get deported and never be able to come back to america everr
(18:22:42) Jr: and just say you're a student
(18:22:47) Jr: you probably look young enough
(18:22:51) Massena left the room (quit: Quit: Massena).
(18:22:55) ThreebitThor: well we are all in agreement that lavathrower > flamethrower?
(18:22:56) Jr: or show some id with a date of birth
(18:22:59) corpus: well, I am a student
(18:23:10) Solarblade: Indeed, Lavathrower > Flamethrower
(18:23:11) corpus: or does student not include university for you
(18:23:12) Jr: the commuter rail is pretty lax about that stuff
(18:23:17) ThreebitThor: good
(18:23:18) Jr: that counts, corpus
(18:23:24) corpus: well, I'll be half way inbetween not-university and university anyway
(18:23:25) Solarblade: I wanna see the Lavathrower in a game now :/
(18:23:33) Jr: still counts, corpus
(18:23:40) Jr: until you get out of school for forever
(18:23:40) corpus: Jr, how do you go about finding out how to travel from one place to another in america?
(18:23:47) Jr: I don't know
(18:23:47) corpus: is there a helpful website you know of
(18:23:48) RinkuHero: http://pics.livejournal.com/rinku/pic/000xgxsa/
(18:23:50) Jr: nope
(18:23:50) corpus: ah, ok
(18:23:51) ThreebitThor: I wonder...If I could fit it into undeRLord
(18:23:55) corpus: I'll return to the wilds of google
(18:24:01) RinkuHero: (a weird game i found)
(18:24:33) Super-Dot: Hmmm
(18:24:38) Super-Dot: I have a JAR file
(18:24:40) corpus: how do you get anywhere, Jr
(18:24:43) corpus: it's so confusing
(18:24:44) Super-Dot: Which contains a PNG
(18:24:49) Super-Dot: And I want to modify the PNG
(18:24:53) Jr: corpus, I walk
(18:24:56) Jr: or take the train
(18:24:57) Super-Dot: How might I go about doing that?
(18:25:03) Jr: or get a ride
(18:25:04) Solarblade: I think the Lavathrower would be a weapon you'd throw into the game just to screw with everyone's heads cause you added another gimmick
(18:25:05) Jr: http://www.mbta.com/
(18:25:13) Jr: is the train I use to go to boston and the like
(18:25:24) Solarblade: SO MUCH COULD BE DONE WITH A LAVATHROWER
(18:25:31) corpus: oh sweet
(18:25:32) Super-Dot: Also, the JAR file is executable and I want it to stay that way

(18:27:16) Jr: The Fung Wah bus has been involved in several safety-related incidents. In 2005, the company was given a federal safety rating of 73 out of 100, 100 being the worst, and 75 or above considered at risk of being unsafe and subject to crashes.

(18:28:35) Jr: hahaha
(18:28:36) Jr: Ian Grossman of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reported that Fung Wah drivers rated in the worst 2 percent of drivers nationwide based on regulatory violations, and nine out of 71 Fung Wah drivers were suspended after inspection between 2004 and 2006.[3]

(20:35:39) reetva: Ah, okay.
(20:35:55) Solarblade: and I wasn't really fond of the minigames, I'd rather beat the snot out of everyone on the free battle with the rentals

(20:37:40) Solarblade: one of the characters used the mouse
(20:37:52) Solarblade: another had blades
(20:38:12) Solarblade: and the last one was more like Megaman

(20:58:31) reetva: Ah, okay.
(20:58:49) lansing: reetva vs siiseli in MORTAL KOMBAT
(20:58:51) shinygerbil: anyway, http://animalcrossingtragedy.ytmnd.com/ :'(((
(20:58:58) ***reetva kicks siiseli in the balls.
(20:58:59) siiseli: morrtaal combaat
(20:59:09) reetva: Do I win?
(20:59:14) siiseli: hah hah haa reetva your pitiful attack doesn't do no damage
(20:59:15) Evil-Ville: Let's not make a game siiseli
(20:59:17) siiseli: Iron balls of steeeel
(20:59:21) siiseli: Evil-Ville, sure
(20:59:31) reetva: Oh, so it does damage? Sweet!
(20:59:40) Evil-Ville: I hate msx it's the worst computer ever made
(20:59:42) siiseli: sure
(20:59:47) Evil-Ville: It's worse than bbc micro
(20:59:49) siiseli: Evil-Ville, hoho
(21:00:03) siiseli: let's kung fu fight over our opinions
(21:00:35) Evil-Ville: All old computers are terrible why do people obsess over that old junk
(21:00:43) siiseli: :/
(21:00:47) siiseli: msx has good games.
(21:00:49) BlademasterBobo: no siiseli 13 years hasn't given you time to properly develop your muscles
(21:00:54) Evil-Ville: I can't touch any hardware older than two years without vomiting
(21:01:02) siiseli: BlademasterBobo, !! oh you

(21:01:57) BlademasterBobo: hi
(21:01:57) shinygerbil: bobo
(21:02:00) shinygerbil: hey there.
(21:02:05) reetva: Siiseli, I do believe that if someone is unintentionally annoying you, you shouldn't threaten them.  Inform them in a nicer way and be done with it.  Note that I said "be done with it."
(21:02:23) BlademasterBobo: wat?
(21:02:23) reetva: Oh, that came out wrong.
(21:02:23) siiseli: I didn't threaten you?
(21:02:25) siiseli: I said stop that
(21:02:27) siiseli: or did
(21:02:28) siiseli: I

(21:02:47) siiseli: oh, right, I said don't.
(21:02:53) BlademasterBobo: siiseli
(21:02:54) siiseli: reetva, doesn't mean I was gonna kick you?
(21:02:57) siiseli: BlademasterBobo, mnyes

(21:03:07) Evil-Ville: Why is siiseli op he's too young to be op
(21:03:08) BlademasterBobo: fuck you shiny
(21:03:12) Solarblade: I shed manly tears shinygerbil
(21:03:14) siiseli: sure
(21:03:15) reetva: It seemed implied given your... uh... track record.  Okay, I am fucked.
(21:03:18) Solarblade: MANLY TEARS OF SORROW
(21:03:21) shinygerbil: have a biscuit, bobo
(21:03:23) siiseli: but yeah, off to sleep with me ->
(21:03:29) BlademasterBobo: reetva go away while you still can

(21:03:59) BlademasterBobo: siiseli is (not so) secretly angry
(21:04:04) BlademasterBobo: and offended
(21:04:05) Evil-Ville: Don't worry one day you'll be a big man like me and you'll never have to sleep again
(21:04:07) Solarblade: Everyone
(21:04:08) shinygerbil: ugh why is tigirc drama today
(21:04:09) siiseli: truly.
(21:04:12) Solarblade: Eat cookies and share some root beer.
(21:04:13) BlademasterBobo: but he knows we'll harass him more if he says so
(21:04:15) reetva: I guess I'll be banned if it means standing up for myself.  But this is enough.
(21:04:16) Solarblade: >:3
(21:04:24) mewse [mewse@c122-107-189-4.eburwd5.vic.optusnet.com.au] entered the room.
(21:04:25) BlademasterBobo: reetva what?
(21:04:30) reetva: Get off this topic.
(21:04:30) BlademasterBobo: oh.
(21:04:33) siiseli: I'm on the verge of mental breakdown becouse of my incontrollable anger.
(21:04:33) BlademasterBobo: siiseli is an op.
(21:04:36) BlademasterBobo left the room (quit: Quit: fuck).
(21:04:43) shinygerbil: :o
(21:04:52) siiseli: reetva, what?
(21:05:02) lansing: everyone... get back to the game making
(21:05:09) Solarblade: So
(21:05:15) reetva: Siiseli, please don't fight with me.
(21:05:17) Evil-Ville: I don't make games I hate making games
(21:05:20) Evil-Ville: Not sarcasm
(21:05:24) siiseli: reetva, I'm not fighting with you, jesus
(21:05:27) Solarblade: someone should invent a machine gun that shoots cookies
(21:05:35) Solarblade: it'd be the ultimate war machine
(21:05:40) reetva: Yeah, siiseli, but you would have if I had continued.
(21:05:46) reetva: Fuuuck.
(21:05:52) reetva: LET'S STOP THIS.
(21:05:56) shinygerbil: oooops
(21:06:01) siiseli: ...
(21:06:02) shinygerbil: don't use the all caps
(21:06:11) lansing: kerthunk.
(21:06:12) Evil-Ville: Wouldn't it just be a normal machine gun with a cookie shaped barrel and special cookie cartridges
(21:06:19) shinygerbil: his anger meter is nearly full
(21:06:21) Evil-Ville: I don't know how gunpowder behaves with cookies though
(21:06:22) RinkuHero: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDMlk3kSYg
(21:06:34) Evil-Ville: But that's the way the cookie crumbles
(21:06:35) Evil-Ville: 8)
(21:06:42) shinygerbil: (8
(21:06:48) Evil-Ville: >8-)
(21:06:50) Solarblade: we'll use a rubberband system to launch the cookies
(21:07:02) siiseli: Evil-Ville, it starts to dance if you light it on fire.
(21:07:25) Solarblade: what does? Cookies or me?
(21:07:25) shinygerbil: ugh god why am i here instead of revising
(21:07:31) shinygerbil: tigirc is not even fun right now
(21:07:55) Solarblade: somehow
(21:08:06) Solarblade: that reminded me that I need to do walljumping sprites
(21:08:13) Solarblade: ~whoosh~
(21:08:25) shinygerbil: i mentioned productivity, hehe
(21:08:48) reetva: Siiseli, you have seen me type in all caps for so long.  And now you're upset?  I guess that you think being an op makes you more responsible for everyone else, even when nobody else minds it.  Okay, now ban me if you want.  I suppose I'm trolling.
(21:09:04) siiseli: reetva, I really just don't remember you typing all in caps 
(21:09:15) Evil-Ville: What's wrong with typing in all caps
(21:09:16) shinygerbil: i typed in all caps
(21:09:20) shinygerbil: and I'm not ashamed
(21:09:26) shinygerbil: i'd do it again
(21:09:30) shinygerbil: READILY
(21:09:32) fartron: I NEED TO CHILL OUT
(21:09:32) siiseli: and stop acting like I'm going about randomly banning everyone who presents an opinion.
(21:09:33) shinygerbil: for my country
(21:09:36) fartron: I NEED TO CHILL OUT
(21:09:41) siiseli: you do that.
(21:10:01) Solarblade: I think everyone should just sit back, talk about random crap, and eat cookies.
(21:10:01) siiseli: but yeah reetva it mostly caught my eye becouse it was near the humongously long ;(
(21:10:13) fartron: i smell bacon
(21:10:17) fartron: do you smell bacon reetva
(21:10:18) Solarblade: Bacon Cookies.
(21:10:22) Evil-Ville: Maybe you should reconsider your position as an operator you take it too seriously
(21:10:29) shinygerbil: when you say, <siiseli> shinygerbil, don't write all in caps and post smilies that are more lengthy than my screen - i assume you're telling me not to do those things as they are not allowed
(21:10:34) siiseli: but it annoys me how you guys manage to squeeze drama out of everything and will go to sleep ->
(21:10:42) fartron: YOU GUYS
(21:10:46) fartron: listen to the man now that he's an op
(21:10:48) shinygerbil: YEW GUISE :3
(21:10:50) siiseli: shinygerbil, that's me giving you my opinion upon what is annoying.
(21:10:52) Evil-Ville: Heh siiseli has a tiny screen
(21:10:55) Succendo: hey guys
(21:10:59) Succendo is now known as Dragonmaw
(21:11:00) shinygerbil: no, that's you telling me not to
(21:11:01) #tigirc: mode (+o Dragonmaw) by ChanServ
(21:11:03) Dragonmaw: You know what time it is
(21:11:04) siiseli: Evil-Ville, nope, 1680 pixels in length.
(21:11:06) Dragonmaw: FREEWARE TIME
(21:11:09) shinygerbil: TENACIOUS D TIME?
(21:11:12) Solarblade: ...huh
(21:11:13) shinygerbil: Awww
(21:11:15) Evil-Ville: Then you're lying
(21:11:15) siiseli: it was actually.. one ( longer than my screen
(21:11:18) shinygerbil: freeware is good too
(21:11:18) reetva: Well, then, being an op has made you much more aware, so my point still stands.  Siiseli, ban me.  It's for the best right now.  Also, I have done the huge smileys in the past, too.  Though, you weren't an op back then.  Oh, maybe Dragonmaw can ban me, if you don't want to.
(21:11:23) Solarblade: I don't think I actually need to do wall-jumping sprites
(21:11:23) Evil-Ville: Then your font is too big
(21:11:31) fartron: siiseli is a narc
(21:11:34) ***shinygerbil sets ban on Reetva
(21:11:37) siiseli: reetva, I haven't really noticed but if you had I'd have pointed it out.
(21:11:41) ***shinygerbil has kicked Reetva (lol)
(21:11:46) siiseli: Evil-Ville, its a bit bigger than normal so I see it better
(21:11:58) siiseli: but really all this drama pisses me off, sleep ->
(21:12:02) shinygerbil: also, you're reetva again! not Z80
(21:12:05) reetva: Siiseli, I can go all night.  Ban me for a bit and no drama.
(21:12:12) Evil-Ville: My font size is 9 and I can see it just fine
(21:12:13) fartron: siiseli the cop
(21:12:21) Evil-Ville: But I have supersight
(21:12:32) Solarblade: I'm wearing contacts :D
(21:12:46) fartron: SUPERVISION
(21:12:51) shinygerbil: smellovision
(21:13:00) Solarblade: Course
(21:13:09) Solarblade: I've been sitting at the computer about all day
(21:13:11) reetva: Solarblade is intense.  Touching your eyeballs is awesome.
(21:13:18) Solarblade: so my eyes are hurting right about now
(21:13:27) Solarblade: and it takes practice :/
(21:13:36) shinygerbil: time for a cup of tea. anyone want a cup of tea?
(21:13:37) Evil-Ville: I sit on my computer all day long every day
(21:13:38) shinygerbil: Too late
(21:13:49) shinygerbil: shoulda said something quicker
(21:13:55) Evil-Ville: That's right, on my computer
(21:13:57) shinygerbil: ha ha ha
(21:13:59) Evil-Ville: I use it as a chair
(21:14:00) Solarblade: haha
(21:14:04) Solarblade: that's awesome
(21:14:11) Evil-Ville: It's also not true
(21:14:19) Solarblade: ...we should make comp-chairs
(21:14:24) reetva: Dragonmaw, ban me.
(21:14:32) fartron: shaddap
(21:14:33) Solarblade: the chair is not only extra comfy and provides great backsupport
(21:14:39) Solarblade: but is also your computer!
(21:15:02) reetva: Fartron would ban me.  You trust fartron's opinion, no?  Oh, wait.
(21:15:10) fartron: i would mute you
(21:15:22) Ina: My Regex is working!
(21:15:35) reetva: Okay, fine.  No bans tonight, I see.
(21:15:36) siiseli: what, Ina, you made your own regex?
(21:15:41) siiseli: I salute ye.
(21:15:42) reetva: I'll shut up.
(21:15:47) reetva: Oh.
(21:15:52) reetva: SIISELI IS STILL HERE.
(21:15:59) siiseli: darned
(21:16:05) fartron: I STILL SMELL BACON
(21:16:07) Evil-Ville: siiseli can't stay away from the action
(21:16:10) Ina: "(\d+)[Dd](\d+)(\S*?)(\s.*?)?;" <- lovely, innit?
(21:16:13) reetva: Seriously, someone ban me.
(21:16:59) reetva: I am in RAGE MODE.
(21:17:04) Solarblade: Mode Rage?
(21:17:14) reetva: THAT TOO.
(21:17:15) fartron: SO RAGE QUIT
(21:17:29) Solarblade: Grants extra damage at the loss of most self-control and some defense?
(21:17:54) Solarblade: I really need to stop thinking of life like a game :/
(21:17:55) fartron: apparently grants no initiative bonus
(21:18:35) reetva: Woah.
(21:18:38) siiseli: Solarblade, just eat a green mushroom and jump off a cliff
(21:18:43) siiseli: that'll work!
(21:18:46) Solarblade: ok!
(21:18:51) Solarblade: 8D
(21:18:59) reetva: Singularity Grenade in Red Faction.  Hahaaha.
(21:19:01) Solarblade: ...waaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiit
(21:19:20) Solarblade: but seriously
(21:19:24) Solarblade: I see things
(21:19:33) Solarblade: and will be like "How would this work in a game..."
(21:19:43) Solarblade: or worse, think of how it'd be programmed >>
(21:19:48) Evil-Ville: What does singularity grenade mean
(21:19:51) Jr: "First you jump off the cliff and you build wings on the way down. "
(21:19:51) Jr: ? Ray Bradbury
(21:19:59) Jr: That has been my Main Thing for a long time
(21:20:05) Evil-Ville: Isn't singularity when human invents a machine that is smarter than human
(21:20:10) reetva: *the new Red Faction.
(21:20:13) Jr: after I heard him say it in an interview
(21:20:14) fartron: and that's why ray bradbury is no longer with us
(21:20:21) Jr: but I have a quote now
(21:20:25) Jr: fartron

(21:21:53) Jr: he is one of my Main People

(21:22:40) Jr: "You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them."
(21:22:40) Jr: ? Ray Bradbury
(21:22:41) Jr: there
(21:23:00) reetva: Fartron.  I actually realized that.  Nobody else ever did.
(21:23:05) Jr: that's about it
(21:23:05) fartron: "I'm a douchebag."
(21:23:06) fartron: ? Ray Bradbury
(21:23:13) Jr: :|

(21:24:19) Jr: I realized that once I started to get annoyed
(21:24:24) Jr: but then I was like
(21:24:33) Jr: "oh, it's fartron.  he's usually not a douche"
(21:24:35) Solarblade: Internet is serious business folks~
(21:25:46) siiseli: indeed

(00:45:45) lansing: rape is usually a lesser offence than murder, yet games involving murder are not banned?
(00:46:16) Bigger: because in games, murder is justified and rape never is
(00:46:21) Zaratustra: people are less prone to murder than rape
(00:46:54) lansing: Bigger, justified? pretty sure the only time you're permitted to kill another person is in self defence
(00:46:58) Cthulhu32 left the room.
(00:47:19) Bigger: that counts as justification, apparently
(00:47:25) Zaratustra: This is society policing itself and doing it correctly. Things like this shouldn't exist for public consumption regardless of how much you believe in free speech.
(00:47:25) Zaratustra: What people do privately is a different story. 
(00:47:34) lansing: I guess it's also justified in war.

(00:47:38) Zaratustra: not to roll...

(00:48:20) lansing: Bigger, rape is justified by some governments as an interrogation technique
(00:48:31) lansing: problem solved, it's justified now
(00:48:39) HaircutBillyIsSoGrapes: A SEXY interrogation technique.
(00:48:56) Zaratustra: you don't see many games about torturing people either
(00:49:14) Bigger: I can sort of just see all these japanese companies just changing the rape scenes into S+M scenes or something
(00:49:34) Zaratustra: to be fair japan -is- rather obsessed with rape
(00:49:46) lansing: if anything, banning it probably makes it more popular

(01:27:49) Zaratustra: no
(01:28:34) Evil-Ville: I also defended the old system
(01:28:53) reetva_: Basically I was implying that the Spy would actually be the Scout, who stole the Spy's cloak.
(01:28:54) Evil-Ville: I just like whining about whiners
(01:29:04) reetva_: And travelled through time.
(01:29:07) reetva_: To shoot himself.

(01:29:33) Evil-Ville: Well I did get bonk energy drink which I didn't have before

(01:33:20) reetva_: Shinygerbil...
(01:33:22) reetva_: :D
(01:33:26) Evil-Ville: Also you can still get the old weapons from achievements

(01:33:29) Evil-Ville: That's really stupid
(01:33:39) shinygerbil: yeah, that is very stupid
(01:33:58) shinygerbil: i mean, how hard would it be to either remove the old milestones, or add milestones for the new updates?
(01:34:20) shinygerbil: yes reetva, your dream has come true :D
(01:34:24) reetva_: It is so clever that... dudes, everything is melted.
(01:34:34) reetva_: Shinygerbil, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
(01:34:40) shinygerbil: i like tf2 again
(01:34:48) Evil-Ville: These are the people who included weapon deletion system before any way to get them back
(01:35:15) shinygerbil: i wonder how long they will string out the remaining character updates

(01:38:30) iFire`: more maps?
(01:38:35) Evil-Ville: Like +5 reload speed or something
(01:38:39) iFire`: I want more double payoad maps
(01:38:43) Evil-Ville: Me too
(01:38:46) iFire`: it's an awesome game mode
(01:38:53) iFire`: flanking is so fun
(01:38:57) Evil-Ville: It's better than regular payload by far
(01:39:02) iFire`: especially with pyros
(01:39:30) shinygerbil: as i was saying last night, they need to get cracking on remaking all the rest of the TFC maps. <3
(01:39:32) Evil-Ville: My favourite map right now is sawmill though
(01:40:17) shinygerbil: hmm, I'm still a fan of attack/defend, where one team is doing all the attacking, but yes, double payload is fantastic
(01:40:53) shinygerbil: my favourite maps has still got to be dustbowl

(02:39:56) Dragonene: in fact, come to think of it, this might've been before gta4 was released
(02:40:06) Bigger: FUCK
(02:40:09) SnakeyAtWork: reetva: Yeah, most people said "Cool" to the idea
(02:40:09) Dragonene: so it may have been a vice city or san andreas map or something
(02:40:11) Dragonene: not quite sure
(02:40:20) SnakeyAtWork: but she's all like "You're not allowed swords in a church"
(02:40:32) Bigger: I went to save a preset for this cool synth I had and I accidentally loaded a new one
(02:40:35) Bigger: and there is no undo
(02:40:42) SnakeyAtWork: And I'm thinking, half the catholic faith spreading is about the swords and killing and pillaging
(02:41:16) lansing: so long as you're not sword fighting, I doubt they'd have a problem with it
(02:41:32) SnakeyAtWork: It's just an ornament
(02:41:39) SnakeyAtWork: It won't even come out of the sheath
(02:41:42) Bigger: sword fights in churches are pretty cool
(02:41:54) SnakeyAtWork: I can think of several arguments
(02:41:55) lansing: duel at the alter, winner gets the bride
(02:42:05) SnakeyAtWork: Even the apostles had swords on them when walking around with Jesus
(02:42:18) lansing: it's possible
(02:42:45) SnakeyAtWork: well according to one part, when Jesus was nabbed by the Jews or whatever, Simon cut off a boy's ear
(02:42:56) SnakeyAtWork: how could he do that without a sword? Unless he has cool magic.
(02:43:14) SnakeyAtWork: So yeah I was kind of surprised at the response anyways ...
(02:43:33) lansing: yeah, it's possible :)
(02:43:35) reetva: He used a knife, SnakeyAtWork.
(02:43:39) reetva: CLEARLY.
(02:44:03) KonamiCode left the room.
(02:44:18) Bigger: hmm, I wonder if the church would allow ornamental lasers
(02:44:28) reetva: They would.
(02:44:29) SnakeyAtWork: Clearly, but you know it's like "Oh you know you can do whatever you want" before I made it clear we'd marry
(02:44:41) Bigger: ornamental buster launchers
(02:44:49) SnakeyAtWork: and now that it's sort of serious thing, it's now like "You can do only some of things you want"
(02:44:49) reetva: My old church had lasers all over the place.
(02:44:55) reetva: Not even ornamental.
(02:45:07) Bigger: http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/5/50/BusterRancherPGD-EN-C.jpg
(02:45:13) reetva: They fired them to burn blasphemers.
(02:45:16) Bigger: I mean who doesn't want that at their wedding
(02:45:22) reetva: Shit was awesome.
(02:45:25) C418: dj hero is terrible
(02:45:40) ThreebitThor left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(02:45:51) SnakeyAtWork: Bigger: Ha ha awesome.
(02:45:53) reetva: C418, HOW WUD YOO NOH.
(02:45:56) Bigger: Is DJ hero like guitar hero?
(02:45:59) C418: yes
(02:46:05) C418: and thats not what a dj is supposed to do
(02:46:25) reetva: The other one has a crossfader and works with PCs.
(02:46:31) reetva: As a MIDI device.
(02:46:33) Bigger: sounds like a bad version of beatmania
(02:46:54) SnakeyAtWork: It almost feels like a silly management project or something
(02:47:03) SnakeyAtWork: "You get to own this project, it's your baby"
(02:47:06) C418: oh well. the kojima game contains raiden? that is unsurprising
(02:47:18) SnakeyAtWork: "Can I get more workers?" "Can I fire workers?" "Can I get more petty cash?"
(02:47:21) SnakeyAtWork: "No no no"
(02:47:50) Bezzy [aubrey.hes@93-97-195-169.zone5.bethere.co.uk] entered the room.
(02:47:57) Bezzzy left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(02:48:25) reetva: C418, some people were saying that it wasn't Raiden because Raiden has blue eyes or something.
(02:48:32) ThreebitThor [WickedbitW@c-67-188-18-170.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
(02:48:41) C418: raidens unknown sister then
(02:48:42) ThreebitThor: :\
(02:48:42) reetva: They were saying that it was the adult version of someone else.
(02:49:01) C418: it will probably be an metal gear mmorpg. something not cool
(02:49:16) C418: and that other familiar face? big boss?
(02:49:46) reetva: Raiden: http://ps3media.ign.com/ps3/image/article/713/713050/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots--20060616024420416_640w.jpg
(02:49:57) reetva: This dude has blue eyes.
(02:50:02) reetva: And the other dude does not.
(02:50:03) reetva: So!
(02:50:12) C418: maybe it isn't even a dude
(02:50:23) reetva: Clearly, Raiden got his eye color changed.
(02:50:29) C418: you can't really tell with that animeface and lipless thing
(02:50:42) SnakeyAtWork: You can never tell with Raiden
(02:50:58) C418: yeah, maybe he shot out one of his eyes and got a new pair
(02:51:03) Dragonene: C418
(02:51:10) Dragonene: How's your minecraft OST coming?
(02:51:32) C418: kind of slow. but I think I'll continue this weekend
(02:52:05) C418: two songs and a bunch of ambient loops, not to mention those footsteps I had to record
(02:52:41) nfreakct left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(02:57:08) Dragonene: :)
(02:59:53) ThreebitThor is now known as FourbitFriday
(03:00:35) shinygerbil: THE CHANGE IS UPON US
(03:00:49) foxboy2 [rofl_ident@CPE00226b5998df-CM001ac31048a4.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com] entered the room.
(03:01:23) FourbitFriday: first time I've been timely in a while
(03:01:43) shinygerbil: [08:00:01] * ThreebitThor is now known as FourbitFriday
(03:01:47) shinygerbil: :D
(03:01:52) FourbitFriday: :|
(03:02:08) FourbitFriday: [00:00] =-= YOU are now known as FourbitFriday
(03:02:36) FourbitFriday: timezones, go to the right one.
(03:02:45) shinygerbil: ?_?
(03:03:09) C418: fuck timezones. let's have a global time
(03:03:24) shinygerbil: there is already such a thing, isn't there?
(03:03:44) FourbitFriday: yeah it's midnight
(03:03:45) FourbitFriday: now
(03:03:47) FourbitFriday: everywhere
(03:03:49) FourbitFriday: all at once
(03:03:52) Dragonene: damn
(03:03:54) Dragonene: I have to go to bed
(03:04:00) Dragonene: It's pretty bright outside for midnight
(03:04:12) C418: http://kotaku.com/5272418/dj-hero-screens-show-off-gameplay
(03:04:14) FourbitFriday: not if you close your eyes
(03:04:15) C418: that guy is so badass
(03:04:17) shinygerbil: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time
(03:04:20) Evil-Ville: In a way timezones are really retarded
(03:04:22) C418: he has his headphones over his hoodie
(03:04:23) Evil-Ville: Look at this map
(03:04:24) Evil-Ville: http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/world_time2.gif
(03:04:31) Evil-Ville: Why can't the lines be straight
(03:04:42) shinygerbil: -_-
(03:04:49) shinygerbil: that would create many more problems
(03:05:11) FourbitFriday: no
(03:05:14) Evil-Ville: Yes well they atleast shouldn't OVERLAP
(03:05:28) Evil-Ville: It kills the 'sperg in me
(03:05:31) Dragonene: Quick
(03:05:37) Dragonene: calculate which time zone has the biggest area
(03:05:50) FourbitFriday: what the hell time does central australia have?
(03:05:55) FourbitFriday: it's not connected to anything
(03:06:09) shinygerbil: why don't we all just buy intelligent watches that calculate our personal time based on our own longitude/latitude, then, eh...
(03:06:09) C418: either the asian or the european one
(03:06:20) Dragonene: Central australia doesn't have time
(03:06:23) Dragonene: It has the Never-Never
(03:06:29) FourbitFriday: shiny; I'm down.
(03:06:34) shinygerbil: :D
(03:06:37) Dragonene: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never-Never
(03:06:40) nyarla: nevernever, aka GMT +9.5 :>
(03:06:47) Turgid: shinygerbil, cause the whole point is to synchronize people. personal time isn't useful.
(03:07:04) shinygerbil: Turgid: hence, my sarcasm regarding the idea
(03:07:05) FourbitFriday: sure it is
(03:07:11) Turgid: Oh.
(03:07:13) Evil-Ville: Pacific Ocean is messed up time zone-wise
(03:07:14) FourbitFriday: it isolates us even further from one another
(03:07:22) FourbitFriday: which is something we can all use
(03:07:37) FourbitFriday: eventually nobody will know anything about anyone else
(03:07:41) C418: it's a war zone
(03:07:44) FourbitFriday: and that is when we will strike
(03:08:06) FourbitFriday: all of me
(03:08:27) shinygerbil: and I for one, welcome our new indie overlords
(03:08:34) shinygerbil: all one of them
(03:08:50) Evil-Ville: Look at Iceland in the map I linked
(03:08:55) Evil-Ville: There's no excuse for that shit
(03:08:56) Evil-Ville: None
(03:09:03) FourbitFriday: haha
(03:09:20) FourbitFriday: that is indeed pretty damn pointless
(03:09:38) shinygerbil: o_O
(03:09:45) FourbitFriday: and those weird-ass isolated rectangles in the middle of the pacific
(03:09:54) shinygerbil: i don't see how it is pointless
(03:10:09) FourbitFriday: how isn't it pointless?
(03:10:15) FourbitFriday: enlighten
(03:10:19) Evil-Ville: Also France is all HEH NO WAY WE'LL USE SAME TIME ZONE AS UK
(03:10:20) shinygerbil: better than creating arbitrary borders in the middle of nowhere, saying, CHANGE YOUR WATCH HERE LOL
(03:10:37) FourbitFriday: the line would have gone through the ocean
(03:10:53) shinygerbil: eh?
(03:10:53) FourbitFriday: the ocean
(03:10:57) shinygerbil: eh?
(03:11:06) FourbitFriday: wait
(03:11:10) jstickeur: shinygerbil why are you awakerish
(03:11:11) FourbitFriday: where is iceland 
(03:11:14) shinygerbil: Iceland is an ocean now?
(03:11:18) BlademasterBobo: shiny has a test soon
(03:11:24) BlademasterBobo: but he's not studying like a good gerbil
(03:11:25) jstickeur: bobo has test icles
(03:11:25) shinygerbil: go to bed bobo
(03:11:28) BlademasterBobo: he's on irc like a rodent
(03:11:31) shinygerbil: :3
(03:11:33) FourbitFriday: a shiny one
(03:11:38) BlademasterBobo: luminous
(03:11:38) shinygerbil: :33
(03:11:40) shinygerbil: :333
(03:11:45) BlademasterBobo: what test is it shiny
(03:11:48) BlademasterBobo: are you going to fail
(03:11:51) Evil-Ville: shinygerbil can you explain why france and uk have different time zone
(03:11:53) shinygerbil: yes
(03:11:53) FourbitFriday: it's radioactive
(03:11:57) FourbitFriday: that's why it glows
(03:12:00) BlademasterBobo: Why shiny
(03:12:00) FourbitFriday: and has 3 mouths
(03:12:06) BlademasterBobo: 2 hours is enough time to cram
(03:12:09) BlademasterBobo: snap to it
(03:12:18) shinygerbil: i have to, e.g. travel to the exam
(03:12:19) FourbitFriday: no seriously guys where is iceland
(03:12:36) BlademasterBobo: ?
(03:12:40) Evil-Ville: How do you not know
(03:12:46) BlademasterBobo: it's the big one
(03:12:47) FourbitFriday: it's that island right?
(03:12:48) BlademasterBobo: in the middle
(03:12:56) BlademasterBobo: of america and europe
(03:13:02) FourbitFriday: I thought that was greenland?
(03:13:04) BlademasterBobo: oh
(03:13:06) BlademasterBobo: duh
(03:13:08) shinygerbil: i don't see how it makes a difference, countries can choose their own timezone
(03:13:09) BlademasterBobo: >____>
(03:13:32) FourbitFriday: it makes a difference because they choose stupid timezones.
(03:13:43) BlademasterBobo: the only real time zone is out here
(03:13:47) BlademasterBobo: it's 12:13
(03:13:49) shinygerbil: better an arbitrary but well-defined system, than one attempting to "make sense" but causing trouble
(03:13:51) BlademasterBobo: all you other folks are living a lie
(03:13:55) FourbitFriday: word, bobo
(03:13:58) BlademasterBobo: shinygerbil
(03:14:09) shinygerbil: (imho)
(03:14:13) BlademasterBobo: that's the type of thinking that has US not using the metric system.
(03:14:30) shinygerbil: inches, mother fucker can you count them
(03:14:32) shinygerbil: :D
(03:14:34) ***Dragonene smites Evil-Ville
(03:14:34) FourbitFriday: hahaha
(03:14:46) Dragonene: NS2 IS GREAT
(03:14:51) FourbitFriday: I'm terrible at measuring anything by eye
(03:15:04) BlademasterBobo: don't you have to to paint
(03:15:04) Evil-Ville: I am great at measuring NS2 by eye
(03:15:06) FourbitFriday: I usually give vague suggestions like "this much"
(03:15:18) FourbitFriday: no, bobo
(03:15:24) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(03:15:25) BlademasterBobo: I don't believe you
(03:15:29) shinygerbil: at anything below a foot or so, I tend to use metric, but above that and I'll switch to imperial
(03:15:38) BlademasterBobo: shinygerbil is a weirdo
(03:15:41) shinygerbil: (=30cm)
(03:15:51) shinygerbil: just because it's easier to gauge feet than metres
(03:15:57) FourbitFriday: word
(03:16:01) FourbitFriday: meters are too big
(03:16:18) FourbitFriday: but I still say "that long"
(03:16:33) shinygerbil: and also, 3 feet is approx 90 cm so i can usually do quick conversion if necessary
(03:16:43) shinygerbil: more like 91 iirc
(03:16:46) shinygerbil: but yeah
(03:16:54) FourbitFriday: 3 ft = ~ 1m?
(03:16:56) Evil-Ville: feet are retarded
(03:17:01) Evil-Ville: miles too
(03:17:03) FourbitFriday: I don't like feet
(03:17:07) Stargoat is now known as Starboat
(03:17:09) FourbitFriday: they are the creepiest thing
(03:17:11) Starboat is now known as Stargoat
(03:17:15) FourbitFriday: and also they are hard to draw
(03:17:16) ***Dragonene sails-
(03:17:17) Dragonene: Dammit
(03:17:26) Dragonene: switch back to boat
(03:17:42) ***Dragonene sails away to Alpha Centauri on the Starboat
(03:17:48) SnakeyAtWork: Opinon: I may be making a game where you collect 'runes' and you combine them together like Diablo 2 to create new things
(03:17:48) FourbitFriday: feet are best when covered with shoes
(03:17:54) shinygerbil: 1m ~ 3 feet, 3and a half inches
(03:17:55) FourbitFriday: and the toes are hidden
(03:18:02) SnakeyAtWork: Should the receipes be public knowledge, or is finding the receipes half the fun?
(03:18:12) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork: Why not both
(03:18:17) Stargoat: Dragonene, you arn't allowed to.
(03:18:18) Dragonene: Have most recipes known
(03:18:23) Dragonene: and few hidden ones
(03:18:28) FourbitFriday: no no no
(03:18:28) Dragonene: Stargoat: :'(
(03:18:33) FourbitFriday: have a few recipes known
(03:18:37) FourbitFriday: and most be hidden
(03:18:58) DragonSix [DragonSix@ivr94-4-82-229-164-12.fbx.proxad.net] entered the room.
(03:19:09) Dragonene: the danger in hiding recipes is that you quickly run the risk of wasting almost everything you have
(03:19:22) shinygerbil: I'd like to see a "realtime recipe system" where all ingredients have properties, and any "recipes" are merely the result of natural interaction between ingredients
(03:19:23) Dragonene: you need to limit the number of combinations or have *lots* of recipes if you intend to have hidden ones.
(03:19:34) Dragonene: Possible a recipe for every possible combination.
(03:19:45) SnakeyAtWork: The number of runes is pretty large
(03:19:50) SnakeyAtWork: Something like 20 or 30 runes
(03:20:00) Dragonene: Then you probably need to make most recipes available
(03:20:11) Dragonene: I mean, let's say every recipe uses 3 runes
(03:20:17) Dragonene: then you have 3^30 combinations
(03:20:27) Dragonene: guessing and trying to find one of those is not feasible
(03:20:32) FourbitFriday: shiny that would be cool
(03:20:40) Dragonene: nor is making 3^30 recipes for the game
(03:21:00) FourbitFriday: how much is that?
(03:21:03) SnakeyAtWork: If you try to mix an incompat recipe, nothing happens
(03:21:10) shinygerbil: that's shitloads and shitloads
(03:21:16) FourbitFriday: ah okay
(03:21:44) shinygerbil: 205891132094649
(03:21:51) FourbitFriday: I don't believe you
(03:21:59) shinygerbil: http://www58.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3%5E30
(03:22:09) Dragonene: http://www63.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3%5E30
(03:22:11) Dragonene: dammit
(03:22:13) Dragonene: you beat me to it
(03:22:16) Dragonene: wolfram alpha to the rescue
(03:22:21) shinygerbil: hehe
(03:22:29) FourbitFriday: I now believe you slightly more
(03:22:29) shinygerbil: wolfram is my new god
(03:22:31) SnakeyAtWork: having 20 or 30 runes is a lot of potential combinations.
(03:22:41) Dragonene: Yep.
(03:22:48) Dragonene: So you'd have to make almost all recipes known
(03:22:53) FourbitFriday: why are they different urls?
(03:22:59) Dragonene: or help finding them somehow
(03:23:02) shinygerbil: different servers i guess
(03:23:05) FourbitFriday: dragon: I don't see that reasoning
(03:23:15) Dragonene: FourbitFriday: Okay, let me explain it
(03:23:15) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonmaw: I think doing both is possible.
(03:23:27) shinygerbil: oh noes you beeped the wrong dragon
(03:23:30) SnakeyAtWork: Some receipes are common knowledge, and some are hidden.
(03:23:35) shinygerbil: i have to leave, for my exam D:
(03:23:56) FourbitFriday: the hidden ones, they would be found sometime though, yes?
(03:24:08) FourbitFriday: one would not be dependent on trial and error to discover them, yes?
(03:24:10) Dragonene: FourbitFriday: Let's say you had 1000 recipes in the game
(03:24:17) Dragonene: and every recipe uses 3 runes
(03:24:20) Dragonene: and there are 30 runes
(03:24:24) Dragonene: if you checked one recipe per second
(03:24:38) Dragonene: you'd have to keep going for about 6 million years
(03:24:38) FourbitFriday: that would take a long time, I presume
(03:24:41) SnakeyAtWork: One thing I sort of plan to do
(03:24:42) Dragonene: before you found a single valid recipe
(03:24:46) FourbitFriday: yeah but why would you do that?
(03:24:51) FourbitFriday: that would be stupid
(03:24:53) Dragonene: yes
(03:24:57) Dragonene: that's precisely my point
(03:24:57) SnakeyAtWork: is that once someone finds a receipe
(03:24:58) FourbitFriday: you'd wait until you found a recipe
(03:25:02) Dragonene: oh
(03:25:04) SnakeyAtWork: it become public knowledge
(03:25:07) Dragonene: if you'd be able to *find* them
(03:25:10) Dragonene: on little scrolls
(03:25:12) Dragonene: then that's fine
(03:25:20) Dragonene: I assumed he meant to do it the way it's done in diablo 2
(03:25:20) FourbitFriday: that's what I was thinking snakey meant
(03:25:25) FourbitFriday: I don't know that way
(03:25:26) Dragonene: in diablo 2, there's no way to find new recipes
(03:25:33) Dragonene: you have to try them out yourself
(03:25:37) FourbitFriday: ah
(03:25:39) Dragonene: and you'll lose all the runes if you fail
(03:25:42) FourbitFriday: that would be annoying as fuck
(03:25:42) Dragonene: to find one
(03:25:45) Dragonene: yes.
(03:25:46) SnakeyAtWork: Oh you don't lose runes when you fail.
(03:25:52) Dragonene: even if you didn't snakey
(03:25:55) SnakeyAtWork: you just get them back and they don't do anything
(03:25:56) Dragonene: six million years is a long time
(03:26:06) Dragonene: and that's if you try out one per second, never eat, and never sleep
(03:26:07) Dragonene: :D
(03:26:16) SnakeyAtWork: Oh, did I mention its a web based game?
(03:26:21) Dragonene: oh
(03:26:24) Dragonene: so add loading time
(03:26:27) FourbitFriday: haha
(03:26:28) Dragonene: now it's 18 million years
(03:26:29) Dragonene: congratulations
(03:26:31) shinygerbil left the room (quit: Quit: bye <3).
(03:26:38) SnakeyAtWork: No, as you can get multiple people to do it
(03:26:47) SnakeyAtWork: i.e form a team of people that do the combinations
(03:26:47) FourbitFriday: ehh
(03:26:57) FourbitFriday: seems like a waste of the players' time
(03:27:03) FourbitFriday: to just stand around trying different things
(03:27:05) SnakeyAtWork: Well that's sort of why I asked.
(03:27:18) SnakeyAtWork: Whether to have them all public knowledge, or to hide some
(03:27:26) FourbitFriday: I didn't know you meant there'd be no way of actually discovering them though
(03:27:41) Dragonene: you can hide them
(03:27:48) Dragonene: *if* you make it possible to discover them
(03:27:54) Dragonene: by, say, finding scrolls
(03:27:54) FourbitFriday: word
(03:27:57) Dragonene: or having patterns in the recipes
(03:28:03) FourbitFriday: maybe most of the combos could just be variations on known ones
(03:28:03) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonmaw: Ahh I see .. yeah that's a plausible idea
(03:28:04) mewse [mewse@c122-107-189-4.eburwd5.vic.optusnet.com.au] entered the room.
(03:28:07) Dragonene: like every combination that sounds like a word is a recipe
(03:28:19) Dragonene: or every 100 combinations (regular pattern) is a recipe
(03:28:21) Dragonene: or somthing like that
(03:28:24) FourbitFriday: wrong dragon again
(03:28:28) Dragonene: indeed
(03:28:30) Dragonene: wrong dragon
(03:29:57) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: I think finding scrolls might be a cool idea
(03:30:06) SnakeyAtWork: but mostly I just wanted people to experiment too
(03:30:24) SnakeyAtWork: And I wanted to encourage that by doing things like syngerism and stuff
(03:30:35) BlademasterBobo: snakey isn't snake is he
(03:30:47) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork: it wasn't my idea
(03:30:52) Dragonene: xion thought of that.
(03:31:04) Dragonene: BlademasterBobo: he's not snake the pixel artist, no
(03:31:04) SnakeyAtWork: Ahh sorry, thanks for the idea FourbitFriday
(03:31:12) Dragonene: I think
(03:31:13) Dragonene: :D
(03:31:24) Dragonene: Snakey didn't make the colossal katamari. Correct?
(03:31:28) FourbitFriday: np
(03:31:30) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: As in when you bring runes together, they can have a syngeristic effect
(03:31:39) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: No, not the same person.
(03:31:44) FourbitFriday: yep, nope.
(03:31:56) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork: Yeah, that's always nice
(03:32:09) Dragonene: but it would still be unfeasible to expect anybody to ever find a recipe
(03:32:38) SnakeyAtWork: Dragonene: There would be quite a lot of recepies and some of them would be as small as two runes even 
(03:32:41) SnakeyAtWork: but I suppose you're right
(03:32:50) Dragonene: we're talking about chances that are about a million times smaller than winning millions of dollars on the lottery
(03:33:11) SnakeyAtWork: The mathematical odds of finding even finding a three rune receipe is small
(03:33:14) FourbitFriday: you could have discoverable via scroll combinations
(03:33:25) SnakeyAtWork: So perhaps 50-60% of combinations are already known
(03:33:28) FourbitFriday: which could be the basis for others which vary by just a single rune or so
(03:33:28) Dragonene: wait what
(03:33:29) SnakeyAtWork: and 40% are hidden
(03:33:32) Dragonene: I just realized
(03:33:35) Dragonene: my calculations are way off
(03:33:50) Dragonene: It wouldn't actually be that hard to find the combinations.
(03:33:55) Dragonene: Forget everything I said.
(03:33:57) Dragonene: I'm too tired.
(03:33:58) Dragonene: :)
(03:34:00) FourbitFriday: hahaha
(03:34:50) FourbitFriday: the findable combos would enable many combos to be discovered gameplayly, and the variations could still allow for a little player experimentation
(03:35:13) Dragonene: I calculated the powers the wrong way around
(03:35:18) SnakeyAtWork: :)
(03:35:25) Dragonene: as in, instead of doing 3 slots with 30 possibilities
(03:35:25) SnakeyAtWork: It should be factorial by the way I think
(03:35:26) FourbitFriday: like "hey what if I change the combination for the Divergent Flame power to include a water instead of a fire"
(03:35:30) Dragonene: I calculated 30 slots with 3 possibilities
(03:35:36) FourbitFriday: and then they discover the Divergent Water power
(03:35:42) FourbitFriday: which would not be on any scroll
(03:36:08) FourbitFriday: (I have no idea what combining runes would do btw)
(03:36:13) SnakeyAtWork: :)

(03:36:26) adam_ left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(03:36:32) SnakeyAtWork: When you combine runes, they create cards 
(03:37:04) Zaratustar left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(03:37:18) Dragonene: Have you played gem TD for wc3?
(03:37:19) Dragonene: SnakeyAtWork?
(03:37:41) Dragonene: It's a cool map
(03:37:42) SnakeyAtWork: I've played one called RuneTD
(03:37:48) SnakeyAtWork: Where you combine runes to make towers
(03:37:49) Dragonene: RuneTD is sorta the same thing
(03:37:52) Dragonene: I like gem td a lot better
(03:37:52) SnakeyAtWork: Cool :)
(03:37:57) Dragonene: you can combine gems as well
(03:38:04) Dragonene: in much the same way as you combine runes
(03:38:11) SnakeyAtWork: Ahh cool, in this game you sort of combine runes together to create cards
(03:38:15) Dragonene: but you can also upgrade them by combining more than one of them
(03:38:18) SnakeyAtWork: but runes do a lot of things in this game
(03:38:23) Dragonene: just as with diablo 2 gems
(03:38:25) SnakeyAtWork: Yes, same here
(03:38:32) Dragonene: so gem td gems are sorta like a gem/rune hybrid
(03:38:41) SnakeyAtWork: combining the same runes will generate a better one
(03:39:42) SnakeyAtWork: When you have some cool cards, you can then go and battle someone
(03:40:00) SnakeyAtWork: At the moment there are only two key resource types
(03:40:03) SnakeyAtWork: Runes and Mana
(03:40:51) SnakeyAtWork: You get more mana by creating them with rune receipes (this is definately public knowledge)
(03:40:59) Dragonene: Runes and Mana, that's not very indie
(03:41:22) SnakeyAtWork: You can summon miners who go and mine for more runes for you (although they occasionally find something else of interest)
(03:41:24) Dragonene: rename then "Collectible Fruit" and "Super Chakra" or something
(03:41:27) Dragonene: >)
(03:41:30) SnakeyAtWork: Ha ha :D
(03:41:51) SnakeyAtWork: Miners use your mana on a non linear scale.
(03:42:04) SnakeyAtWork: And when you battle someone, you also use mana
(03:42:16) Dragonene: what do you mean, "non-linear scale"
(03:42:19) Dragonene: that can mean anything
(03:42:21) SnakeyAtWork: we're sort of just toying with the idea and it seems kind of cool
(03:42:36) SnakeyAtWork: oh, it just means that the miners you have the more mana you expend
(03:42:44) Dragonene: right
(03:42:47) Dragonene: so exponential.
(03:42:49) SnakeyAtWork: The first few miners cost you 1 mana each, but then after that they start costing more
(03:42:54) SnakeyAtWork: well, it may not be exponential
(03:42:55) Dragonene: non-linear could also mean the opposite
(03:42:59) Dragonene: well okay
(03:43:02) SnakeyAtWork: like there could be bumps
(03:43:13) Dragonene: but non-linear could also mean that you get mass discount
(03:43:14) SnakeyAtWork: as in, to go from 12-13 is a much bigger jump than going from 13 to 14
(03:43:19) SnakeyAtWork: yeah, thats true
(03:43:21) Dragonene: and can buy 100 miners for only slightly less than 8u0
(03:43:22) Dragonene: 80*
(03:43:54) thewreck left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:44:29) SnakeyAtWork: The game is semi realtime
(03:44:34) SnakeyAtWork: or at least, we want it to be
(03:46:07) SnakeyAtWork: that is, you tell a miner to go dig for stuff, and it'll take 2 hours or so
(03:46:16) SnakeyAtWork: after two hours, you get a report from said miner
(03:50:52) SnakeyAtWork: It might be fun
(03:50:56) SnakeyAtWork: we'll find out in due time
(03:52:57) SnakeyAtWork: right, almost time to go home

(05:23:25) Stargoat: I still think Primal Rage needs a proper sequel. That game was bad ass. Keyword being bad.
(05:23:30) jstickeur: Oh, youtube comments
(05:23:51) reetva: Jstickeur, that second one was a Joystiq comment.
(05:24:39) Stargoat: my internet is being crazyslow
(05:24:44) Stargoat: this is unacceptable.
(05:25:41) jstickeur: Oh man, keyboard cat
(05:25:45) jstickeur: best meme
(05:26:04) PiratePoo: I wonder what Brink will look like
(05:26:15) PiratePoo: The teaser has teased me sufficiently!
(05:26:42) PiratePoo: So medieval, old timey scifi and now proper scifi?
(05:26:49) Stargoat: http://www.dongs.com/ <-- SFW

(05:30:16) Cosmic_Fool: Live at Woodstock is one hefty album
(05:30:29) Cosmic_Fool: 4 songs - 25 minutes
(05:30:31) reetva: Also, at the end of the video, "Dong" (as we shall call him) says "Here is your wood..."
(05:30:34) reetva: He is cut off.
(05:30:59) reetva: IT'S A CONSPIRACY, I TELLS YA!
(05:31:25) Stargoat: reetva is on to Dong
(05:32:23) jstickeur: Youtube be broken for anyone else?
(05:32:25) jstickeur: No videos play
(05:32:40) reetva: It works for me.

(05:35:11) PiratePoo: Man, some of these trailers are so bad....
(05:35:55) reetva: The video that I posted is a trailer for Nintendo's E3 '09 Conference.
(05:35:55) PiratePoo: Just Cause 2 is Bionic Mercenary?
(05:37:10) Stargoat: Just Cause was kind of fun
(05:38:00) PiratePoo: This looks kind of fun too
(05:38:08) PiratePoo: but the trailer is just bad
(05:38:19) PiratePoo: The Supreme Commander 2 trailer was like this as well
(05:38:37) PiratePoo: "FATES... WILL BE SEALED." "FRIENDS... WILL BECOME ENEMIES"
(05:38:39) PiratePoo: Bullshit like that
(05:39:01) PiratePoo: "Oh nooo, my fate, it has been sealed!"

(05:39:41) Bezzy| [aubrey.hes@82.108.138.49] entered the room.
(05:40:07) Bezzy|: well, it looks like everyone at work is really famous now because we got the game announced
(05:40:11) reetva: I did not make that, despite what you may have thought.
(05:40:22) reetva: Bezzy, what?
(05:40:25) PiratePoo: reetva, this is why we think kids are annoying
(05:40:35) Bezzy|: there's all these people in the streets, and they're avoiding eyecontact with me, because they know how hard it is to be famous, and get asked for your autograph all the time
(05:40:41) Bezzy|: the people of bromley are very considerate
(05:40:45) reetva: Kids this stupid, PiratePoo?  Yes.
(05:40:54) jstickeur: Poor Bezzy
(05:41:09) jstickeur: The lifestyle of the rich and famous will destroy his tender soul

(05:41:25) reetva: When he says "More Better," I squeal like a little girl.
(05:41:31) jstickeur: :|
(05:41:43) reetva: Hahahahaha.
(05:42:14) jstickeur: Good rap video though
(05:43:39) reetva: It is beyond "Good," jstickeur.  It is "Oh, God.  This sensation in my ears is either pure happiness or blood rushing through them faster than any river EVER."
(05:43:47) jstickeur: Best about it is that ps3 owners are actually offended and reply accordingly in the comments
(05:44:04) jstickeur: Your only 5, your retared, you don't know what good is, and you never played a ps3 so I wouldn't be talking. I have a wii and it sucks hot ass. Get a life wii fanboy!
(05:44:29) PiratePoo: Hahaha
(05:44:48) reetva: I love Humanity.
(05:44:55) PiratePoo: Says the PS3 fanboy to some silly video
(05:45:01) PiratePoo: Get a life, that is
(05:45:15) reetva: Wait, "Garfield Gets Real" is the title of an actual game?
(05:45:22) reetva: Or anything ever?
(05:45:32) reetva: "It's time to get real with you, John."
(05:45:34) reetva: "What?"
(05:45:45) reetva: "I love you in a very romantic way, John."
(05:46:24) reetva: I'm not going any further with that, but if someone who is really into fan-fiction and bestiality wants to, they may.
(05:46:33) jstickeur: Man, stop
(05:46:44) jstickeur: We had calvin and hobbes ruined by slash yesterday
(05:46:51) jstickeur: Leave us garfield, you monster
(05:46:58) reetva: Garfield is terrible, anyway.
(05:47:05) jstickeur: NOOOOU
(05:47:14) bagu: garfield minus garfield, google it
(05:47:20) Parthon: hehe
(05:47:20) bagu: it's genious
(05:47:23) Parthon: gmg is good
(05:47:25) C418: garfield minus garfield is genius
(05:47:28) PiratePoo: Garfield minus garfield is pretty funny
(05:47:30) Parthon: although it's lost it's luster recently
(05:47:31) jstickeur: As if people would have to google it, bagu
(05:47:45) bagu: you have a point
(05:47:47) C418: GENIUS
(05:47:48) PiratePoo: There's also one where they just edit away everything garfield says
(05:47:54) PiratePoo: which makes him look insane also
(05:48:09) bagu: GENITALS
(05:48:10) Parthon: yeah
(05:48:13) bagu: ooops
(05:48:16) Parthon: open air vs silent cat .. really
(05:48:17) C418: well, it makes garfield even more funny than he was
(05:48:21) C418: he commented every joke
(05:48:25) C418: which was lame
(05:48:27) reetva: http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/post/97160408

(05:50:25) C418: the gmg book is actually only the stuff that is on the page already
(05:51:18) Dragonene: wow
(05:51:21) Dragonene: is there a gmg book?
(05:51:22) Dragonene: awesome.
(05:52:08) C418: jim davis even made some strips himself
(05:52:20) C418: and I heard they are not as good
(05:52:22) C418: :D
(05:54:17) Dragonene: haha
(05:54:18) Dragonene: cool.
(05:54:28) Dragonene: I'm off to buy a recharge voucher thingy for my phone
(05:54:32) Dragonene: then cook some dinner I guess
(05:55:30) hao-1 [alex@host-82-45-180-173.static.telewest.net] entered the room.
(05:55:33) #tigirc: mode (+o hao-1) by ChanServ
(05:56:54) Bezzy|: I don't know how to cope with fame anymore :(
(05:57:03) hao-1: did you ever
(05:57:13) Bezzy|: The paparazzi are trying to take upskirts of me
(05:57:22) hao-1: wear no knickers
(05:58:12) Bezzy|: I haven't been mobbed yet, but that's only because my fans are keeping a respectful distance. They know how hard it is to be famous.
(05:58:23) jstickeur: give them what they want
(05:58:23) PiratePoo: It's a shame that Dragon Age looks so goddamn generic :(
(05:58:34) PiratePoo: so far at least
(05:59:11) hao-1: it's bioware
(05:59:18) jstickeur: it's most important that you have someone you can trust in these times, Bezzy. Someone who wouldn't exploit you. Someone like me
(05:59:19) hao-1: it will suck
(05:59:41) PiratePoo: I dunno, I kind of liked Mass Effect...
(06:00:02) PiratePoo: It wasn't the best thing ever, but it was enjoyable and stuff
(06:00:32) Bezzy|: j you have always been there for me and if it was up to me, you'd get world exclusives and you can add whatever stupid graphics subtitles you like over the top of them, and cut the final line short, and i'd still be your friend.
(06:00:35) hao-1: but anyway DA is supposed to be a kind of baldur's gate homage right? how would it do that and not look generic?
(06:00:55) jstickeur: the subtitles really bug you, huh? :D
(06:01:14) PiratePoo: But even Baldur's Gate had this "Thing" to it
(06:01:28) hao-1: true
(06:01:28) PiratePoo: That world felt dirty and alive
(06:01:34) Bezzy|: nah, i'm cool with the subtitles
(06:01:36) PiratePoo: This just feels generic...
(06:01:41) Bezzy|: i mean, they were the wrong choice
(06:01:58) Bezzy|: it robbed the reveal of being a proper reveal. clearly.
(06:02:06) Bezzy|: but i'm over it.
(06:02:09) PiratePoo: "Oh noes, here is a long forgotten enemy that is now coming back to try n destroy us all! We must set grievances aside and unite to defeat this common enemy!"
(06:02:09) Bezzy|: definitely over it.
(06:02:23) jstickeur: Your PR engineers should have done a better job
(06:02:26) Bezzy|: i'm not gonna keep thinking and talking about it, any time the opportunity presents itself.
(06:02:35) Bezzy|: our angineers?
(06:02:38) jstickeur: heh
(06:02:52) jstickeur: Well, I suppose you got PR people?
(06:03:01) Bezzy|: yes.
(06:03:05) Bezzy|: they do PR.
(06:03:29) jstickeur: I call them PR engineers when it's their job to "engineer" a certain kind of situation
(06:04:02) jstickeur: Ie. in this case they should have engineered an "ohsh- the new SD game is what? IT IS BRINK" thing I guess?
(06:04:04) Dragonene: I should cook some dinner.
(06:04:13) jstickeur: But instead it was "brink, cool. Oh, SD, I know them. Might be cool"
(06:04:27) jstickeur: I'm just pulling your leg though :s
(06:04:38) jstickeur: Until it rips off and you trade your leg for some exclusive info
(06:04:50) jstickeur: Then I'll give it back
(06:06:37) PiratePoo: What the hell are you two talking about
(06:06:53) Dragonene: I'm thinking "Penne Rigate + Bolognes"
(06:07:04) Dragonene: bolognese*

(06:13:56) PiratePoo: I wonder what Brink will be about and if it'll be an open world game like Oblivion and Fallout 3 :O
(06:13:57) PiratePoo: I hope so
(06:14:17) PiratePoo: Then again, I also hope that they improved their technology this time around
(06:14:23) PiratePoo: because Fallout 3 animation was shit
(06:14:44) PiratePoo: And so was the AI
(06:14:48) reetva__: Crane Wars looks great.

(06:30:07) Bezzy|: Bioshock minus Ayn Rand plus Al Gore
(06:30:31) Bezzy|: PiratePoo - Brink is developed by splash damage, not bethesda.
(06:30:57) PiratePoo: Eh? It is?
(06:31:36) PiratePoo: Is it being published by Bethesda then?
(06:32:16) Bezzy|: yes
(06:32:30) Bezzy|: well. zenimax if we're going to get technical
(06:32:35) PiratePoo: Lame
(06:33:01) Bezzy|: zenimax is the publishing arm of bethesda
(06:33:08) Bezzy|: it's a bit like the holy trinity
(06:33:13) PiratePoo: "The new game from Bethesda."
(06:33:19) PiratePoo: Yea, I know who Zenimax is
(06:33:27) Bezzy|: they are two entities when they're in a fight, but one entity when they want to get a ticket on a train
(06:33:31) Ina left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(06:34:20) PiratePoo: I wonder what Brink is then, but it probably won't be open world scifi which makes me less excited for it :( /speculation
(06:34:31) Bezzy|: i guess it's like "steven speilburg presents" or whatever.
(06:34:34) jeb left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(06:34:56) PiratePoo: It's misleading
(06:35:29) Bezzy|: it's common practice.
(06:35:40) Bezzy|: but it is still wrong
(06:35:50) Bezzy|: i believe that games shouldn't be allowed any marketing
(06:35:59) Bezzy|: they should spread by word alone
(06:36:08) Bezzy|: this marketing arms race has gotten us nowhere!

(06:42:27) Pasteletsap: lifeplus-pastel.blogspot.com
(06:42:57) Pasteletsap: http://i39.tinypic.com/rwi43s.png Also, how should I do the text? Should I handwrite it or make a spritefont?
(06:43:20) pyl: handwrite
(06:43:21) pyl: :)
(06:43:31) PiratePoo: footwrite
(06:43:33) PiratePoo: LOOOOOOLZ
(06:43:35) Pasteletsap: Awrite
(06:44:00) Pasteletsap: Hey, what about a hand-written spritefont?
(06:44:08) pyl: that would be good
(06:44:08) pyl: :)
(06:44:15) PiratePoo: or a spritefonted handwrite
(06:44:20) pyl: the illustration is kinda non-intuitive
(06:44:37) Pasteletsap: How so?
(06:44:49) PiratePoo: Yea, I don't really get what is going on there
(06:44:57) PiratePoo: I assume its demonstrating ledge grabbing?
(06:45:14) Pasteletsap: Yeah, I guess it'd make more sense with the explanation
(06:45:23) pyl: oo falls down, hi5s the ledge before falling to death
(06:45:30) Pasteletsap: Right
(06:45:31) pyl: meanwhile, arrows
(06:45:37) Pasteletsap: lmao
(06:45:40) PiratePoo: And giant boulders?
(06:45:54) PiratePoo: Oh
(06:45:56) PiratePoo: Those arrows
(06:46:08) PiratePoo: OR
(06:46:13) PiratePoo: Clones
(06:46:21) pyl: if you could put the buttons you need to press in the different situation, make it more apparent that oo is grabbing the ledge by putting the hand on top of it
(06:46:34) pyl: and maybe draw oo one more time, this time standing on the ledge
(06:46:49) Pasteletsap: Ohh, good ideas
(06:46:56) PiratePoo: thanks.
(06:47:02) Pasteletsap: Not you mang
(06:47:03) pyl: otherwise i love the style
(06:47:04) Pasteletsap: No offense
(06:47:13) Pasteletsap: Thanks :D
(06:47:20) PiratePoo: I am offended! My advice was so helpful!
(06:47:22) PiratePoo: Haha
(06:47:29) Siiseli: good morning
(06:47:35) Pasteletsap: Mornin
(06:47:50) pyl: if you draw this thing right and put the buttons you gotta push in there
(06:47:55) pyl: you won't even need text
(06:47:56) pyl: to explain
(06:47:57) pyl: :)
(06:48:02) Pasteletsap: Oh, good point
(06:48:10) pyl: the whole screen could just be the drawing of the action
(06:48:23) pyl: i should find some nintendo booklet scans
(06:48:27) pyl: to demonstrate
(06:48:31) pyl: but i won't bother
(06:48:55) Siiseli: ah, my fucking shell has fucked up again
(06:48:56) Pasteletsap: Naw I see what you're saying
(06:49:19) Siiseli: thank god I'm getting a new one soon
(06:49:44) pyl: making illustration intuitive enough to do without words is difficult, but i think it's worth it
(06:49:47) pyl: especially in this case

(07:26:03) smn: how umm

(07:26:07) Dragonmaw: For years
(07:26:27) smn: but y!
(07:26:28) Dragonmaw: This has got to be the single most terrifying game I have ever played.
(07:26:30) Dragonene: Is it this week's freeware friday?
(07:26:33) Dragonmaw: Yes
(07:26:42) Dragonmaw: It can't not be

(07:27:59) smn: why doesn't my head support foreach commands?
(07:28:17) Dragonene: It does
(07:28:22) Dragonene: It's just very slow at running them
(07:28:26) smn: foreach($coins as $coin) { $total += $coin->getValue() }
(07:28:28) smn: :D
(07:28:52) smn: $coins being an array of coin objects.
(07:29:19) smn: i has 9 euros in coins.
(07:29:23) Dragonene: Pasta analysis: Quite edible, but sauce needs more onion (and possibly garlic).
(07:29:29) doohan: mmm
(07:29:34) smn: enough to go pizza all over the place!!1
(07:29:51) Dragonene: Also needs more tomato
(07:29:59) ***mewse ponders.. you know.. like.. maybe writing a little code or something.
(07:30:16) Dragonene: mewse: Upcoming week
(07:30:21) Dragonene: Go places
(07:30:23) Dragonene: Acceptable?
(07:31:01) mewse: Where/when?
(07:31:24) smn: pizza is 8,90 euroz
(07:31:27) smn: i dig
(07:31:34) hao-1: mewse are you full time indie?
(07:31:48) mewse: Um..
(07:32:34) mewse: I'm full-time employee of a game studio, but am on a year-long sabbatical, during which I'm doing some indie stuff.  So yes and no, depending on how you look at it.
(07:32:41) hao-1: whoah
(07:32:44) hao-1: that's nice :D
(07:32:56) hao-1: is that something you saved for then?
(07:33:15) mewse: Saved cash and saved leave.  Had accumulated more than six months of paid leave.
(07:33:18) Dragonmaw: hao
(07:33:20) smn: heh
(07:33:21) Dragonmaw: you a full-time indie?
(07:33:27) hao-1: no
(07:33:35) smn: the pizza page has a "comments / time of delivery" textarea
(07:33:40) smn: i entered "ASAP!!!"
(07:33:40) Dragonene: mewse: Exact details haven't been decided on
(07:33:41) smn: :D
(07:33:42) hao-1: unless you count working for an indie studio as being indie, which i don't
(07:33:48) Dragonene: I have only spoken to stargoat
(07:33:54) Stargoat: hmmmmm?
(07:33:55) Dragonene: frezned is sort of missing from irc and nyarla hasn't been around yet
(07:33:59) Stargoat: 'sup
(07:34:02) mewse: Dragonene:  let me know when there are exact details.
(07:34:05) Stargoat: PM frezned
(07:34:15) Dragonmaw: I want to be a full-time indie someday
(07:34:19) Stargoat: mewse is all about clarity
(07:34:19) hao-1: mewse: six months of paid leave? how is that possible?
(07:34:22) Dragonmaw: Preferably with my bud Gravious
(07:34:35) Dragonmaw: We can call ourselves "Studio"
(07:34:39) Gravious: eh, what?
(07:34:41) Dragonene: Stargoat: I guess I should
(07:34:45) Dragonmaw: To match our game naming scheme!
(07:34:47) ***Gravious reads up
(07:35:00) mewse: hao:  Combination of annual leave accruing, and long service leave.
(07:35:09) Gravious: ahh, yes
(07:35:23) hao-1: bonkers
(07:35:35) Stargoat: I hate it when dragonmaw and dragonene speak in this channel./
(07:35:36) smn: gotta go to the front desk
(07:35:41) Dragonmaw: shut up Stargoat
(07:35:43) Dragonmaw: >:O

(07:35:47) Stargoat: >=|
(07:35:53) Dragonmaw: >>:O
(07:36:03) Dragonene: Stargoat: You can't stand seeing two so beautiful persons speak at once?
(07:36:14) mewse: (I've been working in the industry for a frighteningly long time.  Old man, now.  ;) )
(07:36:16) Stargoat: Dragonmaw, have you played JA2 with the 1.13 mod?
(07:36:28) Dragonmaw: not yet
(07:36:31) Stargoat: oh man
(07:36:32) Dragonmaw: I hear I need to
(07:36:33) Stargoat: you should
(07:36:36) Dragonmaw: It like
(07:36:38) Stargoat: makes the game 10x + better
(07:36:38) Dragonmaw: Ups the resolution
(07:36:42) Dragonmaw: to 1280x1024
(07:36:47) Dragonmaw: From what I heard
(07:36:48) Dragonene: Hah
(07:36:50) Dragonmaw: Which is what I want
(07:36:52) Dragonmaw: XD
(07:36:53) Stargoat: the best part is the re-working of the combat engine
(07:36:59) Dragonene: I love "ups-the-resolution" mods/patches
(07:37:06) Dragonene: Like the diablo 2 expansion
(07:37:10) Stargoat: it increases the tactics a bunchfold
(07:37:10) Dragonene: BUY IT DAMMIT YOU GET 800*600
(07:37:17) Dragonmaw: mewse: I've only been "in the industry" for 2 years 8C
(07:37:36) Stargoat: Anyway, maw, check out 1.13 if you ever get the chance.
(07:37:40) Dragonene: What does maw work with?
(07:37:49) hao-1: mewse: yeah and a long time without taking holiday I guess!
(07:37:50) mewse: Think I have 12 years, now.
(07:37:50) Dragonmaw: Used to test for Cyan Worlds.
(07:37:57) mewse: Exactly, hao!
(07:37:59) Dragonene: ah
(07:38:00) Dragonmaw: Now I just write shit.
(07:38:06) Dragonene: For somebody?
(07:38:09) Dragonmaw: uhm
(07:38:12) Dragonmaw: Freeware Friday
(07:38:15) Dragonmaw: Gadoink
(07:38:16) hao-1: I've been in it 8 or so years and I have 6 days left
(07:38:18) Dragonene: Oh
(07:38:19) Dragonmaw: REMEMBER
(07:38:20) hao-1: holiday I mean.
(07:38:22) Dragonene: write in that manner
(07:38:29) Dragonene: I thought you meant write as in "write code"
(07:38:33) Dragonmaw: haha no
(07:38:34) Dragonmaw: i could
(07:38:34) Dragonene: Do you get payed to write?
(07:38:39) Dragonmaw: paid, and yes
(07:38:47) Dragonene: oh
(07:38:48) Dragonene: Paid.
(07:38:49) Dragonene: :P
(07:38:54) mewse: We get a lot of annual leave in Australia.
(07:38:55) Dragonene: I'm not a native english speaker.
(07:39:00) Dragonmaw: it's okay
(07:39:20) Dragonmaw: it's a common mistake that even native speakers make
(07:39:26) hao-1: how much, mewse?
(07:39:33) Dragonene: That's no excuse :)
(07:39:37) KareemK: yea, because of the bushfires... and the dingos
(07:39:41) Dragonmaw: anyway
(07:39:44) Dragonmaw: i could write code
(07:39:48) Dragonmaw: but a.) lazy
(07:39:51) mewse: Four weeks every year.
(07:39:52) Dragonmaw: b.) out of practice
(07:39:56) hao-1: what!
(07:39:58) Dragonmaw: c.) i like normal writing way more
(07:40:02) mewse: By law.
(07:40:17) Dragonene: Dragonmaw: I can appreciate that
(07:40:20) hao-1: oh wait yeah. so 20 days?
(07:40:24) mewse: Right.
(07:40:27) hao-1: right. we get the same
(07:40:31) Dragonene: I'd be interested in doing normal writing if I wasn't so bad at it :)
(07:40:31) hao-1: pretty much
(07:40:33) Dragonmaw: i want to be able to write some serious code
(07:40:37) Dragonmaw: but like
(07:40:45) Dragonmaw: the last time i seriously wrote code was when i was 14
(07:40:47) hao-1: but I guess you've stayed at your company for the whole of those 12 years?
(07:40:54) Dragonmaw: ...over half a decade ago
(07:40:54) mewse: Then we get bonus leave when we complete projects, and etc.
(07:41:15) Movius: I get 23 days of rec leave a year
(07:41:16) Dragonene: How old is Maw?
(07:41:18) Movius: + sick leave
(07:41:29) hao-1: i want a year off :<
(07:41:33) Movius: of which 5 days are "without evidence"
(07:41:43) Movius: + 2 days "special leave"
(07:41:47) Movius: and flex time
(07:41:49) mewse: All but the first six months.  I've been at the current company through three different owners and two different buildings, across 12 years.. and I'm not even in the top ten list of "old-timers" at the company.  ;)
(07:41:53) Movius: and 13 public holidays
(07:42:02) Siiseli: hoho
(07:42:06) aezo is now known as mezo
(07:42:16) Dragonene: Maw is questiondodging
(07:42:19) smn: pizza ordered!
(07:42:21) Movius: *23 is up from 20. However the working day was changed from 7 hrs 21m, to 7:30
(07:42:24) smn: NO ONE CAN STOP ME NOW
(07:42:25) Stargoat: mewse, are there any plans for another TY game?
(07:42:40) Dragonene: wtf
(07:42:44) Dragonene: 7 hours 21 minutes?
(07:42:48) Dragonene: what sort of a bizarre exact time is that
(07:42:53) Dragonene: Who came up with that idea
(07:42:59) mewse: I don't have any inside information on that, Stargoat.  And if I did, I'd have to tell you that I didn't have any inside information on that.  ;)
(07:43:01) KareemK: The Man
(07:43:06) KareemK: came up with that
(07:43:06) Stargoat: oh dear.
(07:43:07) Movius: Thats union negotiated deals for you
(07:43:14) mewse: (But honestly, I don't know)
(07:43:18) hao-1: 7 of my 8 years have been with the same guys, they've made me redundant twice, and they've never given me extra leave like at the end of projects and stuff... did you have to crunch hard?
(07:43:19) Stargoat: haha, okay
(07:43:23) Dragonene: Dragonmaw :'(
(07:43:31) Movius: basically everyone worked 7hrs 30 normally and built up 9 minutes of flextime every day
(07:43:48) Dragonene: hao-1: Uh, they've made you redundant twice?
(07:43:49) GameTrailers [aubrey.hes@93-97-195-169.zone5.bethere.co.uk] entered the room.
(07:43:53) Dragonene: I'm confused
(07:43:55) Movius: *the time worked doesn't include lunch
(07:43:57) hao-1: sure
(07:43:57) Dragonene: How does that work
(07:44:06) Bezzy left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:44:08) Movius: flextime?
(07:44:17) Dragonene: no
(07:44:18) hao-1: well the first time i went to work for Climax for 6 months, then the second time I went to work for Kuju for 8 months
(07:44:20) Dragonene: double redundancy
(07:44:37) Dragonene: ah
(07:44:45) mewse: We've had to crunch hard a few times, but nothing compared to the sorts of things that you hear about from EA and the like.
(07:44:56) Dragonene: Uh hao-1, I'm still not sure what that means
(07:44:58) Dragonene: But oh well :P
(07:45:06) Dragonene: Are those two companies the same or something?
(07:45:27) hao-1: they made me redundant. i got another job. i left that job and returned to the previous job. they made me redundant again. I got another job. then I went back again
(07:45:28) mewse: We wouldn't have so many people who've hung around for >10 years, if the working conditions were bad.  :)
(07:45:31) Movius: I think the popular idea of "crunches" is over-stated
(07:45:38) Movius: not saying there aren't horrible ones though
(07:45:43) Dragonene: hao-1: I see
(07:45:46) Dragonene: Sounds messy
(07:45:50) Movius: and of course they are very unproductive
(07:45:51) KareemK: the only IT job i had was a weird experience.. lasted only 6 month or so
(07:45:52) mewse: "crunches" were never a popular idea.
(07:46:17) KareemK: i only had to work 15 hours a week
(07:46:25) KareemK: but ended up doing more usually
(07:46:32) KareemK: and showed up at whatever time i liked
(07:46:36) KareemK: which they hated
(07:46:41) KareemK: and they threw all my code away
(07:46:44) KareemK: which i hated
(07:47:05) Movius: heh
(07:47:07) KareemK: then gave me a one week deadline for a large thang
(07:47:09) KareemK: so i quit
(07:47:16) Movius: I work crazy hours
(07:47:24) Movius: 10-6 most days with 1/2 hour lunch break
(07:47:26) Dragonene: I craze on working hours.
(07:47:30) KareemK: almost a year after i did, they havent finished that thing
(07:47:40) Dragonene: Movius: not bad
(07:47:55) Dragonene: Damn, but I'm not looking forward to the prospect of working
(07:48:11) Dragonene: If somebody happens to make more money than they need
(07:48:15) anosou [Mattias@92-32-37-37.tn.glocalnet.net] entered the room.
(07:48:18) Dragonene: Would they be willing to share some with me?
(07:48:21) Dragonene: Ta.
(07:49:07) KareemK: i think in current conditions
(07:49:14) KareemK: most people are unwilling to quit though
(07:49:24) KareemK: unless they have another job sure in the pocket
(07:49:29) Movius: exactly
(07:49:42) Movius: never quit unless you've lined up a replacement job
(07:49:54) Movius: or are exceedingly wealthy
(07:50:11) Movius: like have at least ~1-2 years income lying around
(07:50:30) smn: my pizza order was 7 minutes ago
(07:50:34) smn: WHERE IS MY PIZZA
(07:50:35) smn: :D
(07:52:25) ***Dragonene reads about climate change and the great barrier reef
(07:54:15) Stargoat: don't do that
(07:54:19) Stargoat: it'll turn you in to a hippy
(07:54:20) jstickeur: Poor smn
(07:54:33) jstickeur: Yeah, you'll start to care about the planet and shit
(07:54:42) Stargoat: yeah, fuck that
(07:54:54) Stargoat: 'sup JSticker
(07:54:59) Stargoat: caps?
(07:55:01) Stargoat: jsticker*
(07:55:12) jstickeur: I tell you what's up
(07:55:27) jstickeur: Pirate party in sweden is up
(07:55:36) Stargoat: that sounds awesome.
(07:55:41) Stargoat: arn't you in germany?
(07:55:45) jstickeur: I am
(07:56:02) Stargoat: so. What does sweden have to do with things?
(07:56:06) jeb: hello Stargoat, jstickeur
(07:56:06) ***Dragonene goes to look at http://java.dzone.com/videos/google-wave-most-innovative
(07:56:10) Stargoat: yo, jeb!
(07:56:11) Dragonene: It's like an hour og google video
(07:56:16) jstickeur: Hi jeb
(07:56:21) Dragonene: of
(07:56:22) HannesP: pirate party will get my vote
(07:56:43) Stargoat: hmmm
(07:57:04) jeb: i think i will try to find a candidate who is against ipred and software patents and cross him/her instead
(07:57:09) jeb: i mean... from a "real" party
(07:57:13) Stargoat: urgh
(07:57:27) Stargoat: bundaberg rum taste quite terrible.
(07:58:14) HannesP: unfortunately, i think it wouldn't make any difference voting for a such person as long as they're in a "real" party
(07:59:08) jeb: maybe, i don't know... i'm just suspicious about single-issue parties
(07:59:19) jeb: i have no idea what their other ideologies are
(07:59:47) HannesP: i don't have a problem with single-issue parties, as long as they're still relatively unpopular
(08:00:02) jeb: heh that's a good point
(08:00:02) Stargoat: wait... you mean a pirate political party?
(08:00:03) HannesP: jeb: did you see the vid on youtube with amelia andersdotter, answering questions about the environment etc?
(08:00:10) jeb: Stargoat: yeah
(08:00:27) Stargoat: haha
(08:00:30) jeb: HannesP: no i didn't look at it because i thought that it probably was embarrasing
(08:00:42) Stargoat: I thought jsticker meant a costume party where the theme is pirates :(
(08:00:46) HannesP: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE2tvikFfB8 ← she makes some points, imho
(08:00:47) KareemK: are pirate party in eu elections
(08:00:52) KareemK: that'd be badass
(08:00:56) jeb: KareemK: yes
(08:00:57) HannesP: jeb: it's not embarrassing for her, rather for the kd guy :P
(08:01:06) jeb: currently have about 8% or something in sweden
(08:01:07) HannesP: except her hair, which you jsut have to... uh, ignore :D
(08:01:10) jeb: HannesP: aha, ok
(08:01:15) jeb: i love her hair
(08:01:17) jeb: it's the shit
(08:01:20) HannesP: heheh
(08:01:22) KareemK: although eu elections are dominated by fuckwad center-right and center-left parties i think
(08:01:39) KareemK: like everywhere else
(08:01:45) jeb: HannesP: this is one of my friends: http://www.lenaquist.com
(08:02:18) C418: this is a weird portfolio
(08:02:23) jeb: KareemK: hehe not like USA... they've only got center-right and right to choose from =)
(08:02:58) Stargoat: at least that's better than Australia. We have boring or more boring to choose from.
(08:03:00) slv: then there's always LaRouche
(08:03:01) slv: lol
(08:03:12) HannesP: jeb: haha nice :D
(08:04:07) jeb: i can recommend her fashion shows
(08:04:11) jeb: bare breasts and stuff ;D
(08:04:43) HannesP: :P
(08:04:48) jeb: i think the next one is in london
(08:05:01) Stargoat: A true story of sex, drugs and rock' n' roll design. 
(08:05:35) slv: glamrock retro
(08:05:37) slv: gotta love it
(08:06:15) KareemK: jstickeur votes grünen
(08:06:34) jstickeur: We got a pirate party too :p
(08:07:44) Stargoat: I went to a pirate party once. Everyone was smacked out on heroin.
(08:08:33) Movius: vote LDP
(08:08:37) Movius: drugs, guns and porn
(08:08:44) Stargoat: sounds good
(08:09:04) Dragonmaw: When is submission for next year's GDC
(08:09:07) Dragonmaw: anybody know?
(08:09:36) Movius: generally around october isn't it?
(08:09:36) PiratePoo: It ain't no motherfucking pirate party without PiratePoo
(08:09:46) SMRobot [littleripp@124.179.45.218] entered the room.
(08:09:53) SMRobot: hey all
(08:10:35) SMRobot: hello?
(08:10:50) SMRobot: well you're a lively lot
(08:10:50) Stargoat: yo
(08:10:56) Stargoat: :p
(08:10:57) SMRobot: hey
(08:11:03) Stargoat: you didn't give us much of a chance to respond
(08:11:07) SMRobot: lol
(08:11:09) SMRobot: I know
(08:11:21) SMRobot: U need to update my blawg
(08:11:22) Stargoat: 'sup?
(08:11:31) Stargoat: I need to update your blog?
(08:11:33) SMRobot: I need to update my blawg*
(08:11:38) SMRobot: nm
(08:11:44) SMRobot: wirking on stuff in XNA
(08:11:48) Stargoat: no, I will mind.
(08:11:58) Stargoat: don't tell me what I should mind or not
(08:12:11) SMRobot: trying to make a super flexible animatable sprite class
(08:12:19) Siiseli: :3 how flexible
(08:12:20) SMRobot: it's going pretty good actually
(08:12:46) SMRobot: as in usable for everything that's getting drawn in my game with the possible exeption of interface
(08:13:22) Hima left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(08:13:23) SMRobot: what's going on with you?
(08:13:24) mewse: In my current codebase, I have a class called a "FlexSprite".
(08:13:25) Siiseli: hmm, nice.
(08:13:33) Movius: I copied the AGS structure for sprite class
(08:13:34) SMRobot: lol
(08:13:38) Siiseli: :P
(08:13:43) SMRobot: AnimatedSprite
(08:13:56) SMRobot: AGS?
(08:13:59) Stargoat: I'm drinking bundie. And it's not so great.
(08:14:01) Movius: Adventure Game Studio
(08:14:08) SMRobot: kk
(08:14:13) Movius: a frame being one frame
(08:14:16) Movius: view = one animation
(08:14:32) SMRobot: k
(08:14:34) Movius: AnimatedSprite is a combination of views with different names
(08:14:35) mewse: My FlexSprite is kind of an encapsulated physics system.  Point masses connected by springs, so it can automatically distort and stuff as you move it around by one of the point masses.
(08:14:59) SMRobot: I'm using nice simple sprite sheets
(08:15:17) Stargoat: how 1990s
(08:15:28) SMRobot: and I have parallax background =D
(08:15:42) SMRobot: soooo goo-d
(08:15:49) Stargoat: make Mario 3
(08:15:53) Stargoat: SMB3*
(08:15:56) Stargoat: then we'll talk
(08:16:06) SMRobot: lol
(08:16:21) SMRobot: raccoon suit would be annoying to code
(08:16:44) Stargoat: you could make it better. You could make it so the tail actually flaps when mario is crouched.
(08:16:52) SMRobot: lol
(08:17:07) SMRobot: I got that with my GBA when I was younger
(08:17:17) HannesP: raccoon suit, that's the one which gives mario the ability to petrify himself, isn't it?
(08:17:27) Stargoat: no, that's tanuki
(08:17:32) jeb: Dragonmaw: usually it is november 1st
(08:17:35) doohan: racoon == flight
(08:17:56) SMRobot: anyone seen google wave yet?
(08:18:04) Stargoat: SMRobot, buy a NES, and a SNES, and collect games. Then we'll talk.
(08:18:22) SMRobot: I want a SNES :(
(08:18:29) Stargoat: ebay!
(08:18:35) Stargoat: you could pick one up for pretty cheap
(08:18:39) SMRobot: I need a job
(08:18:45) Stargoat: then get one
(08:18:56) Stargoat: it's of utmost importance that we uphold the modern gaming herritage
(08:19:07) SMRobot: I have about 50 in the bank, but I'm planning to buy the new burnout DLC
(08:19:12) SMRobot: god I love burnout
(08:19:26) SMRobot: and I need a headset
(08:19:53) SMRobot: I've applied at a couple of places
(08:19:56) SMRobot: but no luck
(08:20:06) Stargoat: you don't need a headset
(08:20:23) SMRobot: I need a headset
(08:20:31) SMRobot: your jedi mind tricks don't work on me
(08:20:33) Stargoat: no, you don't. Why do you need one?
(08:20:43) Stargoat: to talk with shitty people in a shitty game.
(08:20:54) Stargoat: :(
(08:21:00) SMRobot: to talk with awesome friends in FUCKING BURNOUT!
(08:21:07) Stargoat: No.
(08:21:13) SMRobot: burnout is good
(08:21:19) Stargoat: go play F-Zero. Then we'll talk.
(08:21:27) Stargoat: (apart from its lack of online)
(08:21:32) Stargoat: (but it's still very good)
(08:21:39) Fraeon: Which one?
(08:21:41) SMRobot: I played it once
(08:21:43) SMRobot: on SNES
(08:21:44) Gravious: burnout paradise is amazing
(08:21:46) slv: doesn't zsnes let you do onloine play now?
(08:21:49) slv: you could play f-zero online
(08:21:50) SMRobot: I know rite
(08:22:01) Fraeon: slv, except F-Zero has no multiplayer at all
(08:22:05) Fraeon: Not even split screen
(08:22:11) Stargoat: Fraeon: I actually don't like the original that much
(08:22:12) slv: wow really? i forget
(08:22:13) Gravious: its the second best racing game ever
(08:22:16) Stargoat: but X and GX are very, very good
(08:22:17) Gravious: after GRiD
(08:22:26) Stargoat: also, there's a rom hack for the original, giving it netplay
(08:22:29) Stargoat: which is very cool.
(08:22:31) Dragonene: http://java.dzone.com/videos/google-wave-most-innovative seriously, it's a collabotaleengine
(08:22:32) SMRobot: It's practically my favourite Xbox game rite now with the possible exception of Fallout
(08:22:32) Dragonene: I'm telling you
(08:22:37) Dragonene: COLLABOTALEENGINE
(08:22:41) Fraeon: The original has some sweet tracks, though
(08:22:42) SMRobot: I need to buy GRiD
(08:22:43) Fraeon: Like SILENCE
(08:22:48) Fraeon: And Mute City
(08:22:53) Fraeon: And and and...
(08:23:09) Nightro [Nightro@60-241-47-103.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(08:23:14) SMRobot: I could probably borrow it from a friend
(08:23:15) Stargoat: GRiD?
(08:23:16) Fraeon: That snow zone
(08:23:19) SMRobot: ya
(08:23:31) SMRobot: Racing game with time manipulation
(08:23:31) Stargoat: X/GX are amazing games. This is pure fact. Don't try to dispute it.
(08:23:43) Stargoat: sense of speed, control (once you get used to it...), perfect
(08:23:49) SMRobot: I always preferred WipEout
(08:23:53) Stargoat: phht
(08:24:08) Stargoat: (actuatually, wipeout is prettyy good)
(08:24:12) SMRobot: WipEout is awesome
(08:24:19) SMRobot: and effing brutal
(08:24:20) Stargoat: F-Zero is pure, though.
(08:24:24) SMRobot: difficulty wise
(08:24:51) SMRobot: god I sucked at WipEout Pure/Pulse
(08:24:54) Fraeon: I like Wipeout when it isn't about shooting your opponent
(08:24:58) Stargoat: there's no luck element in F-Zero, it's pure skill. Well, except for the rubberbanding (?)
(08:25:06) Fraeon: Like the tracks where every lap makes you go faster
(08:25:29) SMRobot: Zone I think
(08:25:31) Stargoat: hmm
(08:25:42) Stargoat: I wouldn't mind playing WipeOut HD
(08:25:45) Stargoat: but I am not of PS3
(08:26:08) Fraeon: Oh yeah
(08:26:10) Fraeon: White Land
(08:26:26) Stargoat: that sounds like an F-Zero track
(08:26:31) Androu1 left the room (quit: Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by FuckPingOut))).
(08:26:31) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-27-95.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(08:26:35) SMRobot: HD had to be resubmitted due to failing epilepsy testing
(08:26:47) Stargoat: Nintendo needs to make a new one. But they suck now, so they'd probably fuck it up.
(08:26:56) Fraeon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNeYHreYyhU&feature=PlayList&p=717A6D56078B8AB2&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&index=8
(08:27:09) SMRobot: you can race with your miis
(08:27:22) SMRobot: we've made it more accesible to the casual audience
(08:27:39) Stargoat: X/GX > original. Probably because I played them first, I dunno.
(08:27:56) Stargoat: the original just feels... unnatural
(08:28:02) SMRobot: ya
(08:28:26) Stargoat: good music though
(08:28:56) smn: DUDE THAT PIZZA WAS HUGE
(08:29:05) Stargoat: smn likes it big.
(08:29:07) smn: I FEEL VIOLATED
(08:29:07) smn: :D
(08:29:09) SMRobot: I watched Gataca
(08:29:11) SMRobot: it
(08:29:13) SMRobot: is
(08:29:14) SMRobot: awesome
(08:29:17) Fraeon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVziZLO87us&feature=related
(08:29:17) smn: wat
(08:29:25) Fraeon: That's my favourite from F-Zero :o
(08:29:28) Stargoat: GATTACA is a good film.
(08:29:35) SMRobot: it was so good
(08:29:47) Stargoat: luckily I'd been kicked out of English before we had to watch it ;)
(08:29:55) SMRobot: it was like 'Holy shit this could happen!'
(08:29:55) smn: dammit, gotta get my headphonez
(08:30:19) Stargoat: SMRobot: Read Neuromancer.
(08:30:52) smn: Fraeon, f-zero music is so FAWESOME
(08:30:54) SMRobot: I should eh. I love cyberpunk styled games like dystopia and warsow
(08:30:59) SMRobot: I need to get Deus Ex
(08:31:08) smn: i love mute city most tho
(08:31:14) Stargoat: Dystopia is a very fine game.
(08:31:15) Fraeon: We need more futuristic racers
(08:31:15) smn: gives me frickin' goosebumps
(08:31:16) smn: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WvubjKUkCI&feature=related
(08:31:28) smn: as it winds up to total awesomeness
(08:31:31) smn: i love it :>
(08:31:36) Stargoat: Deus Ex is also a very fine game
(08:31:44) Stargoat: also, SMRobot, play System Shock 2
(08:31:53) Stargoat: one of the best FPS games I've ever played
(08:31:58) SMRobot: well I thought bioshock was a bit meh
(08:32:08) SMRobot: but SS2 is apparently great
(08:32:14) Stargoat: Bioshock is nothing compared to System Shock
(08:32:27) C418: NOTHING
(08:32:30) SMRobot: lol
(08:32:30) Stargoat: I wasn'r particularly impressed with Bioshock.
(08:32:39) C418: except maybe for the cheesy story
(08:32:43) SMRobot: it was all overhyped
(08:32:56) smn: i remember playing f-zero's mute city on my good ol' snes, just standing around. played it just for the music. :D
(08:33:07) SMRobot: night all
(08:33:11) smn: nn SMR
(08:33:12) SMRobot: gotta sleep
(08:33:14) C418: it is bright day
(08:33:16) C418: don't lie
(08:33:21) SMRobot: it is 10:30
(08:33:32) C418: bright day then
(08:33:37) SMRobot: TIME EFFING ZONES!
(08:33:38) C418: DONT SAY PM
(08:33:40) SMRobot: AEST
(08:33:45) SMRobot: PM
(08:33:55) SMRobot: Australian Eastern Standard Time
(08:33:58) Stargoat: SMRobot, Shock 2. go. now.
(08:33:58) SMRobot: GMT +10
(08:34:03) C418: oh, I thought tez
(08:34:03) SMRobot: night all
(08:34:08) Stargoat: you can't call yourself an awesome gamer without having played it.
(08:34:12) SMRobot: k
(08:34:14) Stargoat: oh
(08:34:17) Stargoat: :(
(08:34:20) Stargoat: later SMRobot
(08:34:21) SMRobot: I need a new copy of SC
(08:34:25) SMRobot: I'll be on tomorrow
(08:34:26) SMRobot: night
(08:34:28) SMRobot left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(08:34:28) Stargoat: Starcraft is a great game.
(08:34:29) C418: system shock 2 has amusing oldschool dnb
(08:34:37) Stargoat: that it does.
(08:34:48) C418: yeah, eidos is full of acid fans
(08:34:55) C418: not the drug I mean
(08:34:57) Stargoat: engineering, running through tunnels, killing mutants, with D&B
(08:35:27) Stargoat: there's nothing wrong with the drug. Apart from the potential psychological problems.
(08:36:27) Stargoat: there's something wrong with bundaberg rum though
(08:36:32) ***C418 thinks
(08:36:35) C418: was it really eidos?
(08:36:36) Stargoat: my, does that stuff taste awful.
(08:36:40) Stargoat: um
(08:36:43) Stargoat: no, it wasn't
(08:36:48) C418: hm. who was it again?
(08:36:49) Stargoat: it was looking glass studios
(08:36:53) C418: my mind is full of acid
(08:36:59) C418: ah yes. looking doesn't exist anymore glass
(08:37:13) C418: ...eidos just published them... I think
(08:37:15) Stargoat: but LGS only financed its development I think
(08:37:22) Stargoat: um....
(08:37:32) C418: at least here in europe
(08:37:45) Stargoat: eidos had something to do with looking glass
(08:37:53) C418: yeah, that was back then
(08:37:54) Stargoat: right
(08:37:58) Stargoat: it was made by Irrational
(08:38:00) C418: when everything was equally awesome
(08:38:02) Stargoat: the engine was by Looking Glass
(08:38:08) C418: oh yeah
(08:38:10) Stargoat: it was published by EA
(08:38:22) Stargoat: looking glass was acquited by eidos
(08:38:23) C418: could be
(08:38:30) Stargoat: acquired*
(08:38:36) C418: I always thought it was from looking glass. so I guessed eidos
(08:38:47) Stargoat: EA owns the publishing rights to the system shock series
(08:38:52) Stargoat: which is why 2k made bioshock
(08:39:07) C418: not biological system shock
(08:39:20) Stargoat: shock 2 used the dark engine
(08:39:25) Stargoat: which was designed for Thief
(08:39:59) C418: yes. too much similarities
(08:40:01) Stargoat: also, Ken Levine is a bullshit artist :(. Either that, or he was under pressure from publishers.
(08:40:05) C418: in the engine at least
(08:40:39) Stargoat: When making Bioshock, anyway
(08:40:58) C418: never looked at the art direction
(08:41:02) C418: I thought it was kind of decent
(08:41:03) Stargoat: incidently, the original System Shock was made by Looking Glass, not Irrational
(08:41:09) C418: I see
(08:41:23) Notch: System Shock 2.. Greatest.. reveal.. ever
(08:41:23) Stargoat: yep.
(08:41:35) Notch: Not very unexpected, perhaps, but wow.
(08:41:39) Stargoat: I love Notch even more every time he says something.
(08:41:42) C418: I think I know the reveal without having played through the game
(08:41:46) Notch: lol, what? =D
(08:41:55) Notch: I never beat SS2 :-(
(08:41:57) Stargoat: you're like, a pool of great taste in games.
(08:41:57) C418: I don't because I'm not gay. nothing personal of course
(08:41:59) hd_ [nothad@253.176.233.220.exetel.com.au] entered the room.
(08:42:01) Stargoat: oh man, you should
(08:42:03) Stargoat: it's great
(08:42:08) Notch: it got too difficult
(08:42:13) Notch: and, to be honest, scary, haha
(08:42:18) Stargoat: D:
(08:42:23) Stargoat: but it's sooooooooo gooooooooood
(08:42:25) Stargoat: haha
(08:42:33) C418: I was pissed when I had to fight against monkeys
(08:42:46) Stargoat: yeah, the monkeys are a bit annoying
(08:42:55) C418: and the game is only scary because the engine is not really good
(08:43:03) C418: like, the zombies don't even have walking sounds
(08:43:05) Stargoat: a good tip is, if you have to hit them with a crowbar, duck.
(08:43:10) C418: you never know they are there until they hit you
(08:43:24) Stargoat: you totally know. They say "The many sings to us" etc.
(08:43:25) Notch: and the horrible animations make things look corrupted and evil
(08:43:38) Stargoat: it creates a distressing atmosphere. Not a shock-horror one.
(08:43:50) C418: but it helped the thief series too I guess
(08:43:53) C418: fuck I hated those gost
(08:43:55) C418: s.
(08:43:58) C418: plus h of course
(08:44:15) C418: instant death can creep a gamers soul out
(08:44:17) Stargoat: I would love to play a new, proper Shock game. The same ideas and depth, but on a "current gen" engine.
(08:44:41) Stargoat: Bioshock was not this game./
(08:45:17) Stargoat: :9
(08:45:20) Stargoat: :(*
(08:45:53) C418: I call bioshock decent
(08:45:59) Stargoat: sure
(08:46:00) Stargoat: decent
(08:46:04) C418: I would have called that game good. wouldn't it be for the cheesy ending
(08:46:09) Stargoat: but Shock 2 was beyond decent.
(08:46:13) C418: very very very horribly cheesy
(08:46:18) PiratePoo: Bioshock was a consolite System Shock :O
(08:46:30) PiratePoo: Not to sound like a PC snob...
(08:46:33) RinkuHero: i never played any of those games
(08:46:42) Stargoat: did you know Shock 2 was actually supposed to be a DC game?
(08:46:47) Stargoat: or at least, a port of it was planned
(08:47:08) Stargoat: RinkuHero: You should!
(08:47:10) Stargoat: also, 'sup.
(08:47:12) RinkuHero: i will one day
(08:47:20) RinkuHero: i bought bioshock when it was on sale for 5$ on steam
(08:47:23) RinkuHero: but didn't try it yet
(08:47:32) PiratePoo: Bioshock was fun though :O
(08:47:33) Stargoat: I'd pay $5 for Bioshock.
(08:47:44) C418: start talking a nostalgic talk about why thief is so awesome
(08:47:56) RinkuHero: if theif was 2d
(08:47:59) RinkuHero: it would have been perfect
(08:48:02) C418: it would have failed
(08:48:03) RinkuHero: but the 3d made sneaking hard
(08:48:03) Stargoat: Bioshock was fun for the first half. After that, the lack of meaningful character development, and sloppy AI, meant the game became a chore to play through.
(08:48:10) PiratePoo: Ypi
(08:48:11) PiratePoo: roasj?
(08:48:15) PiratePoo: You're wrong, RinkuHero
(08:48:18) PiratePoo: >:(
(08:48:33) PiratePoo: If Thief were 2D then it wouldn't be Thief
(08:48:38) RinkuHero: yes
(08:48:41) RinkuHero: cause then it'd be perfect
(08:48:42) C418: you just never watched your stone
(08:48:46) RinkuHero: the perfect game formerly known as thief
(08:48:48) Stargoat: it would be Trilby: Art of Theft
(08:48:53) PiratePoo: You just sucked at Thief then
(08:48:59) HannesP: most games i like are 2d
(08:49:00) Stargoat: (which is an awesome game, incidentally)
(08:49:07) HannesP: 3d is hugely overrated
(08:49:18) RinkuHero: yes
(08:49:20) RinkuHero: i wish sc2
(08:49:22) RinkuHero: would have been 2d
(08:49:22) fratron: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci40ae8BlcE
(08:49:26) PiratePoo: Oh fuck off :(
(08:49:28) Stargoat: you know what? 3d isn't bad. It's not a bad medium. There's lots of great stuff there.
(08:49:31) RinkuHero: the 3d makes it hard to understand the units
(08:49:44) Stargoat: But you know what, also? that doesn't mean there's no room for 2d
(08:49:50) PiratePoo: Yea.
(08:49:53) Stargoat: and this is my major beef with the current industry
(08:49:57) Stargoat: not that they make 3d games
(08:50:03) Stargoat: but that they -only- make 3d games
(08:50:03) RinkuHero: they mostly make 2d games still
(08:50:09) RinkuHero: there are more ds games than next gen console games
(08:50:11) Stargoat: none of the big companies
(08:50:11) RinkuHero: and they sell better
(08:50:14) RinkuHero: no, all
(08:50:18) Stargoat: eh.
(08:50:21) RinkuHero: all of the big companies still make ds games
(08:50:22) RinkuHero: most anyway
(08:50:31) RinkuHero: and ds games sell better than console games or pc games
(08:50:31) Stargoat: what was the last "AAA" title fo the PC, that was 2d?
(08:50:37) RinkuHero: the sims maybe
(08:50:46) Stargoat: :|
(08:51:09) RinkuHero: but pc video cards are built for 3d
(08:51:11) RinkuHero: rather than 2d
(08:51:15) RinkuHero: so i tmakes sense to make 3d games for the pc
(08:51:23) Notch: distressing is better than shock, imo
(08:51:34) Notch: doom 3 = not scary. ravenholm = scary
(08:51:38) Stargoat: Notch: This is true.
(08:52:00) Stargoat: distress is more... intelligent.
(08:52:01) mewse: In modern games, "scary" == "faulty lights".
(08:52:13) Stargoat: anyone can make shock horror effective.
(08:52:30) PiratePoo: [14:50] <RinkuHero> so i tmakes sense to make 3d games for the pc << Your reasoning doesn't make any sense though
(08:52:41) Stargoat: I would like to see something more abstract, like an RL, pull off horror effectively.
(08:52:58) Notch: lol mewse
(08:53:00) gandhi [gandhi@pool-71-178-240-50.washdc.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(08:53:07) Stargoat: RinkuHero: As for SCII, while the graphics are 3d, the gameplay is still predominantly 3d.
(08:53:10) Stargoat: 2d******
(08:53:13) RinkuHero: yes
(08:53:20) RinkuHero: but it still makes the units harder to distinguish
(08:53:20) Notch: horror in a roguelike would be interesting..
(08:53:22) RinkuHero: they're less iconic
(08:53:25) Stargoat: perhaps
(08:53:42) Notch: I've been scared of color-changing l's, though..
(08:54:03) Stargoat: hah
(08:54:04) fratron: permadeath is scary
(08:54:08) Stargoat: karmic creatures :(
(08:54:17) PiratePoo: I wonder if this spatial orientation will improve once we actually get proper 3D displays
(08:54:17) ***mewse is kind of infamous at work for watching people play games like Dead Space, and pointing out all the complicated ship systems and computers which work properly, but that the ultra-simple room lighting couldn't be made in such a way that it didn't flicker.
(08:54:28) Stargoat: Notch: Best class to play in ADOM? Archer. Or mage.
(08:54:33) Stargoat: Fighters have the worst time of all./
(08:54:34) PiratePoo: I mean, it should, shouldn't it?
(08:55:09) Stargoat: Not much resists arrows, and with a fast character, you can play without being hit at all.
(08:55:10) Movius: fighters are designed for neophytes
(08:55:10) Notch: Stargoat: I always play dwarven paladin
(08:55:13) Gravious left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving.).
(08:55:15) hao-1: flickering lights and other darkness is such cheap horror
(08:55:16) Movius: so you can just bash into things
(08:55:19) Notch: It sucks, but I'm gotten used to it
(08:55:25) PiratePoo: 3D makes units harder to distinguish?
(08:55:25) mewse: budget horror.
(08:55:35) Movius: seen ju-on hao-1?
(08:55:48) fratron: hao-1, i guess you didn't like doom
(08:55:50) Movius: the first (japanese) remake
(08:56:05) RinkuHero: you can like something despite it using cheap techniques
(08:56:15) mewse: I didn't like Doom.
(08:56:18) Stargoat: speaking of flickering lights, I actually quite enjoyed FEAR.
(08:56:24) fratron: my point is they weren't cheap when doom came out
(08:56:31) fratron: they were the opposite of cheap
(08:56:32) Movius: terrible movie, but one of the sections manages to make a well-lit room in the middle of the day terrifying
(08:56:38) RinkuHero: true, but only for games
(08:56:41) Stargoat: sure, the horrow was cheap, but the game was fun. And the AI felt challenging in a non-more-hitpoints-than-me-way
(08:56:43) RinkuHero: it was still cheap in movies
(08:56:46) RinkuHero: even when doom came out
(08:57:19) Stargoat: mewse: What did you not like about doom?
(08:57:21) Movius: it was very unusual to have a game so dark when doom came out
(08:57:27) mewse: It was stupid.
(08:57:33) Movius: and one that whored lighting instead of millions of polygons
(08:57:35) Stargoat: you're trolling.
(08:57:42) Movius: doom3 i mean
(08:57:44) mewse: Yes, but I'm also serious.
(08:57:49) Stargoat: :|
(08:57:49) fratron: i mean doom 1
(08:57:53) fratron: no game had lighting before doom 1
(08:58:00) fratron: and they used it well
(08:58:04) Movius: indeed
(08:58:04) Stargoat: DooM, controls arn't great, but it's a fun, arcadish game.
(08:58:16) Stargoat: ZDooM makes it a more pleasant experience
(08:58:19) hao-1: it's a cheap technique
(08:58:33) Movius: it doesn't scare you the second time
(08:58:33) hao-1: plays off animalistic fear
(08:58:39) Stargoat: fear of dark?
(08:58:41) Movius: cause you know what will happen
(08:58:41) hao-1: yes
(08:58:42) RinkuHero: yes
(08:58:45) mewse: Fear of faulty wiring.
(08:58:46) RinkuHero: another one is
(08:58:49) RinkuHero: sudden loud sounds
(08:58:49) Stargoat: haha
(08:58:51) hao-1: yeah
(08:58:53) RinkuHero: horror movies do that a lot
(08:58:57) Stargoat: FEAR played off this too.
(08:59:06) hao-1: but horror that comes from uniquely human traits is more interesting
(08:59:18) Stargoat: hmm.
(08:59:25) Stargoat: throw us an example, hao-1
(08:59:29) Movius: original Alien is my favourite horror
(08:59:29) RinkuHero: silent hill perhaps
(08:59:32) RinkuHero: and the zombie children
(08:59:47) RinkuHero: animals wouldn't be afraid of such things, since
(08:59:53) RinkuHero: it's their bizarre nature that makes them scary to people
(09:00:07) hao-1: yeah people getting scared for other reasons than just "i could be in physical danger here"
(09:00:10) Movius: cause the alien's looks designed half for hot-sexing and half for tearing you to shreads
(09:00:22) Stargoat: fear of zombies is fear of death. All animals have this fear.
(09:00:22) RinkuHero: i never saw alien
(09:00:28) Movius: you are missing out
(09:00:34) hao-1: alien is superb
(09:00:39) Movius: the series went off the track after that
(09:00:40) RinkuHero: it's not fear of zombies exactly
(09:00:47) Movius: though I love aliens, it is completely different
(09:00:49) Stargoat: you didn't like Aliens, Movius?
(09:00:51) RinkuHero: the zombies in silent hill were horrible in a different way than the zombies in zombie movies
(09:00:55) Stargoat: ah
(09:01:02) Movius: I like aliens. but i don't like the subsequent ones
(09:01:06) mewse: Aliens was really an action film, where Alien was horror.
(09:01:09) Movius: Aliens is an action movie
(09:01:12) Stargoat: I have not actually played Silent Hill
(09:01:17) RinkuHero: what
(09:01:18) Stargoat: hmm
(09:01:20) Stargoat: this is true
(09:01:20) RinkuHero: there's a movie called alien
(09:01:22) fratron: http://futurismic.com/2009/05/27/grand-theft-auto-iv-exploring-the-mundane/#more-7597
(09:01:23) RinkuHero: and one called aliens??
(09:01:25) RinkuHero: that's confusing
(09:01:26) Movius: yes
(09:01:26) Stargoat: yeah
(09:01:29) Movius: aliens is the sequel
(09:01:29) Stargoat: Aliens is the second
(09:01:31) fratron: rinku
(09:01:37) Stargoat: named such because there's more than one alien!
(09:01:37) fratron: every single video game is based on these movies
(09:01:39) fratron: you should have seen them
(09:01:42) RinkuHero: haha
(09:02:49) Movius: rinkuhero: you will recognise half the terran soundbites from Aliens
(09:03:02) Stargoat: I found parts of Killer 7 to be quite... not horrorfying, alienating to a degree that I was put off by the game. In such a way that i wanted to play more of it.
(09:03:03) Movius: *starcraft terrans
(09:03:14) Stargoat: if that makes sense. Which it doesn't.
(09:03:30) Movius: are you familiar with the over-arching story of killer7 stargoat?
(09:03:31) Stargoat: the Dropship's quotes are all from Aliens
(09:03:38) Movius: the actual game is a small excerpt
(09:04:02) Movius: though much is speculation along the Braid = Nuclear bomb lines
(09:04:04) Stargoat: Movius: There are a bunch. The main storyline is about a potential nuclear war between america and japan perhaps?
(09:04:26) Movius: the overarching story goes hundreds of years
(09:04:31) Stargoat: hmm
(09:04:41) Stargoat: I need to play that game again.
(09:04:54) Stargoat: it's been a few years
(09:05:39) Movius: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/562551/38193 
(09:05:55) Movius: wow, this has been updated a lot since i last read it
(09:06:00) Stargoat: this will take a while to read. I will bookmark it.
(09:06:09) MisterX [MisterX@p5DDE608E.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(09:06:23) Movius: cut to the Hand in Killer 7 appendix at the end
(09:06:37) Movius: it is a translation of a japanese book grasshopper made
(09:06:52) Stargoat: hmm
(09:08:13) tametick left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84-rdmsoft [XULRunner 1.9.0.7/2009031309]).
