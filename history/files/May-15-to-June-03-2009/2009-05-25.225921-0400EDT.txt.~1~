(22:59:29) reetva: Then he went under an enemy microscope.
(22:59:29) PiratePoo: But yea, it's definitely worth the price of admission
(22:59:29) lansing: I have this one http://www.wacom.com.au/intuos3/intuos3_930.html
(22:59:41) reetva: Ooh, that was a sad day for us all.
(22:59:41) PiratePoo: It'll greatly speed up your workflow, for sure ^_^
(22:59:59) mewse: Nice.

(23:00:12) mewse: Yeah.  I'm sort of tired of making textures with a mouse.  Or worse, a trackpad.
(23:00:12) reetva: My tablet is a BITCH.
(23:00:34) PiratePoo: Man, those Intuos3 tablets look so old now, in comparison to the new Intuos4 line :(
(23:00:41) reetva: The cursor likes to shake.
(23:00:44) mewse: They reallyreally do.
(23:00:44) PiratePoo: Not that I'm complaining. I love my Intuos :O
(23:01:26) reetva: :D
(23:01:48) mklee [nfreakct@cpe-024-211-165-053.nc.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(23:02:01) PiratePoo: Also, if you use Painter a lot, buy the Art Pen too. :D
(23:02:18) PiratePoo: If not, then nevermind
(23:02:46) mewse: Wacom smudge guard glove:  http://www.buywacom.com.au/images/detail/smudge_large.jpg
(23:02:55) mewse: I totally need one of these.  They're.. like.. awesome.
(23:03:09) PiratePoo: Mostly for the Cintiq's though
(23:03:20) reetva: How much are they?  Cannot click link right now.
(23:03:29) Dragonene: cool mewse
(23:03:41) PiratePoo: Kind of useless for a normal tablet :P
(23:03:48) Dragonene: I have a tablet PC
(23:03:51) mewse: The gloves?  $15.
(23:03:52) Dragonene: would be great for that.
(23:04:01) Dragonene: I love how they come in a range of colors
(23:04:02) Dragonene: :D

(23:04:16) Dragonene: PiratePoo: wait what
(23:04:19) Dragonene: intuos *4*?
(23:04:25) PiratePoo: You haven't seen it?
(23:04:34) mewse: Intuos4 6x9" available locally for $600AU.  Ow.
(23:04:37) PiratePoo: http://www.wacom.com/intuos/
(23:04:39) Dragonene: Dunno, maybe?
(23:04:44) Dragonene: I'm there already
(23:04:56) Dragonene: hm
(23:05:01) Dragonene: I think I've seen screens yeah
(23:05:05) reetva: Mewse, that is, like, ONE JABILLION USD.
(23:05:06) Dragonene: I have an intuos2 :D
(23:05:15) reetva: No, scratch that.
(23:05:18) PiratePoo: What do those look like? :D
(23:05:19) mewse: Intuos3 6x9" available locally is only $570 locally.
(23:05:23) reetva: ONE JAFILLION
(23:05:23) reetva: .
(23:05:27) mewse: also, locally.
(23:05:44) mewse: Did I mention locally?  Because locally.  Totally.

(23:06:01) Dragonene: what's 6x9"?
(23:06:04) Dragonene: What paper format?
(23:06:07) Dragonene: Mine is A5.
(23:06:11) reetva left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(23:06:13) Dragonene: My intuos2.
(23:06:21) PiratePoo: "The new Intuos4 Grip Pen features Wacom's new tip sensor technology and 2048 levels of pressure." So how many levels of pressure do we need? :P
(23:06:24) shinygerbil: i might go and sit in it and idle :O :O
(23:06:45) reetva [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.

(23:07:13) PiratePoo: It's storming
(23:07:14) lansing: mewse, I think I got the 9x12 for $570
(23:07:15) reetva: This is so frustrating.
(23:07:31) mewse: In the US, lansing?
(23:07:34) lansing: AUD
(23:07:38) ***lansing is Austraian
(23:07:39) mewse: Nice price.
(23:07:50) ***mewse is not Australian, but is in Australia.
(23:08:04) PiratePoo: woooow
(23:08:05) PiratePoo: It's like
(23:08:15) PiratePoo: a constant barrage of flashes
(23:08:17) reetva: Sometimes I forget that mewse is not Australian.
(23:08:20) PiratePoo: and just a low rumble
(23:08:24) PiratePoo: like it's war or something
(23:08:27) ***Parthon is australian
(23:08:40) mewse: Me too, reetva.  Then I say something and hear my accent and remember again.
(23:08:41) reetva: PiratePoo: MAN THE BATTLE STATIONS.
(23:08:56) lansing: http://www.scorptec.com.au/computer/13068-intuos3-9x12-metallic-grey
(23:08:59) reetva: Shoot that lightning!
(23:08:59) Dragonene: what sizes are that
(23:09:02) Dragonene: PAPER SIZES DAMMIT
(23:09:03) reetva: SHOOT IT DEAD.
(23:09:38) reetva: That will give you electrically charged bullets, you see.
(23:09:50) PiratePoo: It's really awe inspiring though
(23:10:01) desadoc [desadoc@189.71.41.92] entered the room.
(23:10:16) reetva: These bullets will then hit the enemy troops and overload their brains, causing them to go insane and shoot their best friends.
(23:10:34) lansing: Dragonene, http://www.wacom.com.au/intuos3/intuos3_930.html
(23:10:47) PiratePoo: Wouldn't it be cooler if their brains would just melt and pour out of all their orifices?
(23:10:57) Dragonene: Huh
(23:11:00) Dragonene: I *think* mine is A5
(23:11:05) Dragonene: I can't recall for sure now.
(23:11:13) Dragonene: Not smaller, certainly
(23:11:21) Dragonene: Might be A4 but I don't think so
(23:11:47) PiratePoo: http://www.weer.nl/nl/home/weer/neerslagradar/nederland.html :O
(23:12:48) mewse: A4 would be approx 8x11 inches
(23:12:58) mewse: A5 would be approx 6x8 inches.
(23:13:55) mewse: (numbers might be off by an inch, based on which way you round from millimetres to inches)
(23:14:13) PiratePoo: OHMIGOD THE WEATHER IS TRYING TO KILL ME
(23:14:16) PiratePoo: I'M GONNA DIIIEEEE
(23:14:33) Cthulhu32: weather here got insane yesterday
(23:14:40) Cthulhu32: we had HUGE hail and forked lightening right next to my house
(23:15:07) lansing: A4 and 8x11 are not approximate, they are two different paper sizes
(23:15:09) lansing: :/
(23:15:15) lansing: 8x11 is Letter, A4 is A4
(23:15:28) ***lansing shakes a fist
(23:16:33) lansing: 8x11 203.2x279.4, A4 210x297
(23:17:37) lansing: Before the adoption of ISO 216, many different paper formats were used internationally. These formats did not fit into a coherent system and were defined in terms of non-metric units.

(23:30:14) ***mewse silences
(23:30:47) mewse: What does Painter cost these days?
(23:30:50) gandhi__ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(23:31:01) PFawkes: That depends on who you hire, yeah?
(23:31:10) PFawkes: I mean, some painters are very cheap indeed
(23:31:28) mewse: Heh
(23:31:34) PiratePoo: I think like 200 dollars, mewse
(23:31:36) lansing: you get corel painter essentials with the intuos3
(23:31:38) PiratePoo: no
(23:31:43) PiratePoo: typo
(23:31:45) PFawkes: You might find it cheap somewhere though
(23:31:46) PiratePoo: 400 dollars
(23:31:50) PFawkes: like in a used software shop
(23:31:59) PiratePoo: But that'd be for the latest version
(23:32:06) RinkuHero: you can get a student version for less i think
(23:32:07) PiratePoo: So if you just want Painter X or something
(23:32:09) RinkuHero: if you're a student
(23:32:10) PiratePoo: probably less :O
(23:32:12) PiratePoo: Or that
(23:32:22) ***mewse is not a student.  :(
(23:32:32) PFawkes: Get a student to find it for you
(23:32:37) PFawkes: that way it'd be the latest version
(23:32:54) mewse: Sensible
(23:32:54) PFawkes: Is Paint Shop Pro worth buying?
(23:32:59) PiratePoo: No
(23:33:02) PiratePoo: Get Adobe instea
(23:33:02) PiratePoo: d
(23:33:05) PFawkes: even for like 10 bucks?
(23:33:09) PiratePoo: Hmm
(23:33:15) PiratePoo: Maybe, but stil, get Adobe instead :P
(23:33:19) PFawkes: since photoshop is expensive >.>
(23:33:22) RinkuHero: just use neopaint
(23:33:28) RinkuHero: it's the best paint program
(23:33:31) RinkuHero: but 256-colors only
(23:33:37) lansing: mewse: $95 http://cgi.ebay.com.au/CORELPAINTER-X-COREL-PAINTER-X-PC-MAC_W0QQitemZ320372970595QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_software?hash=item4a97b79463&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A1%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50
(23:33:38) PFawkes: :D
(23:33:41) PiratePoo: Well, not if you, ahum. "Buy it" *wink wink, nudge nudge*
(23:33:44) ***PFawkes uses linux anyway
(23:33:59) PFawkes: GIMP forever
(23:34:03) RinkuHero: gimp is also good
(23:34:05) lansing: mewse: looks like a bargain
(23:34:08) RinkuHero: as is pro motion
(23:34:21) PiratePoo: And besides, don't think they'd mind if you're not making stuff with it you're selling
(23:34:32) PFawkes: I'm just saying that is paint shop pro bad enough that it's not worth ten bucks?
(23:34:48) RinkuHero: i liked paint shop pro's earlier versions
(23:34:52) RinkuHero: before it was bought by adobe
(23:34:54) PiratePoo: I don't know... But paint shop pro stuff always has this "look" to it
(23:34:57) PFawkes: It'd be nice to have a properly supported program for once
(23:34:58) RinkuHero: after that it became too photoshoppy
(23:35:08) PFawkes: I expect this is an older version :D
(23:35:25) PFawkes: since it is at a used place
(23:36:08) PFawkes: ah well, will look into it]
(23:36:21) PiratePoo: Do you use it for commercial purposes?
(23:36:24) PFawkes: no.
(23:36:39) PFawkes: why? >.>
(23:36:47) PiratePoo: Then fuckin' warez it. Seriously. Buy it when you're actually making money with it.
(23:36:55) PFawkes: I really don't do that
(23:36:57) PFawkes: ever
(23:38:02) PiratePoo: And I'm saying that you should do it
(23:39:31) PiratePoo: I mean, there are very few cases where I condone piracy and that's one of them. :P
(23:39:49) PiratePoo: I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't learn those packages when I was younger
(23:40:04) paul|not: and where are you today
(23:40:12) PiratePoo: None of your business ^_^
(23:40:23) paul|not: also we have paul eres piratepoo pfwakes and paul|not
(23:40:26) PiratePoo: It's all for the sake of progression
(23:40:28) paul|not: awesome alliteration bros
(23:40:40) paul|not: *pfawkes
(23:41:19) PiratePoo: Then again, maybe you are old and have a bunch of disposable income now
(23:41:27) PFawkes: I know how to use photoshop
(23:41:32) Campster: I'm experimenting with Hammer.  When I get something playable, is anyone willing to be victim to playtesting?
(23:41:33) KK_laptop left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(23:41:33) PFawkes: But I don't pirate things
(23:41:51) PFawkes: because I just don't. I know lots of people do and I really do not care.
(23:42:03) KareemK left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(23:42:05) PFawkes: Cashiers criticize me for buying music :D
(23:42:21) PiratePoo: You buy it on CD, still?
(23:42:43) PFawkes: Sometimes
(23:43:09) PFawkes: sometimes I buy cards, of course
(23:43:28) PFawkes: I like having the CD but it's often more expensive to do so

(23:43:57) PiratePoo: Eh, I have about 5 CD's in total
(23:44:04) PiratePoo: the last one I bought was like 10 years ago
(23:44:10) PiratePoo: well, maybe 7
(23:44:16) PFawkes: Really.
(23:44:30) PFawkes: I love CDs
(23:44:35) KK_laptop [KK_laptop@84.36.18.129] entered the room.
(23:44:37) PiratePoo: It just feels like a hassle
(23:44:39) PFawkes: you never get the same quality with MP3s
(23:44:47) PiratePoo: If I want to listen to music, I want to be able to do it on the fly
(23:44:50) PiratePoo: and that's BS
(23:44:52) PFawkes: I love vinyl too
(23:45:28) PFawkes: You can't tell the difference between, say, 256kbps and a cd?
(23:45:51) PiratePoo: Can't say that I do
(23:45:59) paul|3 [grif392@71.5.23.94.ptr.us.xo.net] entered the room.
(23:46:17) PiratePoo: Besides, there's always FLAC
(23:46:34) PFawkes: Sure
(23:46:39) PFawkes: but as I've said, I purchase my music >.>
(23:47:09) PFawkes: Thus, buying a cd gives better quality, though generally it's not monetarily worth it considering the music I listen to
(23:47:33) PiratePoo: And you need the proper sound equipment to even notice it in the first place, I imagine
(23:48:30) PFawkes: But then you get into like 128kbps, which is what itunes used to be
(23:48:42) reetva: PiratePoo, are you one of those "Pirating is great and there is nothing wrong with it" people?
(23:49:35) PiratePoo: Are you one of those assuming people, reetva?
(23:49:53) reetva: No, I wasn'
(23:50:08) lansing: to assume is to make an ass out of u and me
(23:50:09) reetva: t saying you were.
(23:50:28) paul|3 left the room.
(23:50:30) PiratePoo: Good.
(23:50:46) ***lansing paints something
(23:50:52) PFawkes: I'm one of those assuming people
(23:51:07) reetva: <Campster> I'm experimenting with Hammer.  When I get something playable, is anyone willing to be victim to playtesting?
(23:51:09) PiratePoo: Well you know, fuck you if you think that
(23:51:13) reetva: What game, Campster?
(23:51:50) PFawkes: Hey, awesome
(23:52:21) PFawkes: the federal government has finally decided to admit that cigarette companies lie
(23:52:27) PFawkes: How nice.
(23:52:35) PiratePoo: OH REALLY.
(23:52:48) Campster: reetva: TF2
(23:52:52) PFawkes: But only about using "light" and "low-tar"
(23:52:52) PiratePoo: They don't say.
(23:53:09) reetva: Campster, I'll test.
(23:53:13) Campster: Yay
(23:53:19) PFawkes: hopefully it'll last
(23:53:28) Dragonene: PALEST FAWKS
(23:53:31) Dragonene: want to do writan in a bit?
(23:53:34) Dragonene: say, 20 minutes?
(23:54:24) PiratePoo: But I dunno, piracy in general is a complex issue... At least I don't think it's such a black and white issue. That's about it, really...

(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (2009-05-26 00:07:50) RinkuHero: one thing i noticed
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:08:03) RinkuHero: is that indie game sites don't cover games to the degree that game magazines used to
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:08:18) RinkuHero: like, often a game will just get a single screenshot and a paragraph or two of text
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:08:34) RinkuHero: whereas in nintendo power or egm, you'd get dozens of screenshots and a page or two of text
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:08:51) RinkuHero: of course, probably unavoiable
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:09:03) RinkuHero: but it's something that i notice
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:09:47) slugpaste: It seems that the recent trend is for indie games to have relatively little to show and talk about. For many, you can only show one or two screenshots.
(00:16:11) RinkuHero: (00:09:57) slugpaste: I do miss those hand-drawn Nintendo Power maps.
(00:16:42) Dragonene: It's a question about content
(00:16:56) Dragonene: Making a match 3 game takes less time than making a new Zelda game
(00:17:07) Dragonene: If you don't have a large team, that's just the way it has to be
(00:17:17) Super-Dot: Generally indie games tend to be smaller, yeah
(00:17:25) Dragonene: Link to the Past had tens of people working on it
(00:17:34) Dragonene: (I just watched credits yesterday, played through it again)
(00:17:35) RinkuHero: still
(00:17:39) RinkuHero: even those indie games which are large
(00:17:43) RinkuHero: like iji and aquaria
(00:17:47) RinkuHero: don't have hand-drawn maps and such
(00:17:51) RinkuHero: in their reviews
(00:18:00) Super-Dot: It's also that there are a lot more indie games
(00:18:06) RinkuHero: i preferred when reviewed aimed to help a player enjoy a game more
(00:18:11) RinkuHero: rather than evaluate a game
(00:18:14) Super-Dot: And fewer people paying people to review them
(00:18:15) RinkuHero: reviews*
(00:18:42) sifupeng: hand-drawn maps?
(00:18:43) Super-Dot: They used to do that?
(00:18:45) RinkuHero: yes
(00:18:46) Super-Dot: Crazy
(00:18:50) RinkuHero: in nintendo power etc.
(00:19:02) sifupeng: oh, you mean game guides
(00:19:08) RinkuHero: sort of
(00:19:15) RinkuHero: nintendo power combined reviews and guides
(00:19:17) sifupeng: mini-feature game guides
(00:19:20) RinkuHero: into just general coverage
(00:19:28) sifupeng: yeah, those are crazy
(00:19:43) gsoto left the room (quit: Quit: goodbye).
(00:20:14) Super-Dot: I've never used such a reviewguide
(00:20:25) sifupeng: it's more a feature thing
(00:20:37) sifupeng: the actual review is in a separate section
(00:20:44) sifupeng: with the numbers and such
(00:20:58) sifupeng: 5 stars out of 5!
(00:21:51) Super-Dot: I always got the impression that guides were for people either less or more manly than I
(00:22:01) Super-Dot: Less manly because they walk you through it
(00:22:13) Super-Dot: And more manly because you get to see all the cool stuff
(00:22:53) sifupeng: nintendo power's target demographic isn't exactly consistent of... men
(00:23:11) Super-Dot: I think indie games to be crafted such that such guides are unnecessary
(00:23:16) Super-Dot: With some exceptions
(00:23:29) Super-Dot: Cave Story and Dwarf Fortress have countless guides, for instance
(00:23:52) sifupeng: I want to make a game that people will make guides for :o
(00:24:33) Super-Dot: I'd prefer to make a game that doesn't need a guide
(00:25:09) sifupeng: what about all of the awesome SECRETS?
(00:25:15) michael_: ^
(00:25:15) sifupeng: oh so many secrets.
(00:25:21) Super-Dot: Hmm
(00:25:21) Androu1 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(00:25:35) Super-Dot: Secrets are nice for some people, but I'm not one of those people
(00:25:45) RinkuHero: those guides werne't intended to gguide you through the game
(00:25:47) RinkuHero: they weren't like faqs
(00:25:51) RinkuHero: they were more like tour guides
(00:25:57) RinkuHero: pointing out the nice things about a game
(00:25:58) Super-Dot: Ah, neat
(00:26:03) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-27-95.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(00:26:19) Super-Dot: I'd like to see an example of such a guide
(00:26:22) RinkuHero: the thing that came with earthbound is one example
(00:26:25) RinkuHero: let me find you a link
(00:26:41) RinkuHero: http://www.scribd.com/doc/8476/Earthbound-Nintendo-Players-Guide
(00:27:04) RinkuHero: use the scrollbar to scroll through it
(00:27:14) RinkuHero: i own a copy of that, it came with earthbound, and was great
(00:28:08) RinkuHero: just randomly skip around to parts of that guide to see how fun it is
(00:29:24) RinkuHero: they even created clay versions of each enemy for that
(00:29:36) RinkuHero: the pictures of the enemies used in that guide are of clay models
(00:29:45) Super-Dot: Woooow
(00:29:48) Super-Dot: That's awesome
(00:30:47) cft left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(00:32:26) Super-Dot: I get the impression that it wasn't made by journalists, though
(00:32:27) Calories [what@node15.201.100.208.1dial.com] entered the room.
(00:32:34) Super-Dot: It's more of a first-party thing
(00:34:09) RinkuHero: yes
(00:34:26) RinkuHero: probably was done by nintendo power writers
(00:34:33) RinkuHero: who were hired by nintendo
(00:34:41) RinkuHero: but still, it made the game more fun
(00:34:45) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(00:34:56) Super-Dot: Yeah
(00:34:57) RinkuHero: and sometimes things like that exist for people who aren't first parties
(00:35:02) RinkuHero: just not as extensive
(00:35:24) RinkuHero: a lot of fan sites are examples
(00:35:47) Super-Dot: What are examples of similar fan sites?
(00:36:11) RinkuHero: http://kongming.net/
(00:36:19) Calories left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(00:36:21) RinkuHero: good fan site of the romance of the three kingdoms games
(00:36:44) RinkuHero: it even has the original novel there (it's in public domain) to provide background for the games
(00:37:47) JARATE left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(00:38:19) Super-Dot: Awesome
(00:38:23) RinkuHero: http://kongming.net/doae/battles/
(00:38:28) RinkuHero: has different parts like that
(00:38:34) RinkuHero: that's a battle guide for destiny of an emperor
(00:38:42) Super-Dot: But still, I don't think bloggers are the people to make that kind of thing
(00:38:45) RinkuHero: also has little things like avatars from the games
(00:38:52) Super-Dot: It takes narrow-minded dedication
(00:39:06) RinkuHero: yes
(00:39:23) RinkuHero: but it doesn't have to be done by bloggers
(00:40:06) RinkuHero: http://kongming.net/doae/i/propaganda/comic_ad.jpg
(00:40:13) RinkuHero: the ad for the destiny of an emperor game
(00:40:15) RinkuHero: i remember seeing that ad
(00:40:21) RinkuHero: even ads were better back then D:

(00:45:45) Super-Dot: I could easily see such guidestuff being written about Spelunky
(00:46:23) Super-Dot: I'm wondering who would write it and who it would be written for
(00:47:01) Super-Dot: I guess I know who it would be written for
(00:48:53) lansing: how's this look? http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/3028/tres1.jpg
(00:49:24) Super-Dot: Terrific
(00:49:31) Super-Dot: Wintery
(00:49:41) Farbs|EightAndAHalf [chatzilla@210.18.209.85] entered the room.
(00:49:50) Super-Dot: Even though there seems to be grass
(00:50:06) lansing: i rushed the grass a little because there was so much of it i grew impatient
(00:50:12) Super-Dot: Righto
(00:50:22) lansing: but yeah, i wanted grass to extend backwards
(00:50:47) Super-Dot: I usually use flat colors for grass
(00:50:55) Super-Dot: With maybe some tufts interspersed
(00:52:12) Super-Dot: Too much of a pain to draw all the blades
(00:52:24) Super-Dot: I have a similar attitude about tree branches and leaves
(00:52:38) Super-Dot: That's probably why I don't draw much
(00:53:04) lansing: that's like the second thing I've drawn in 15 years
(00:53:06) ZaraFortress2 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(00:53:08) lansing: I should draw more
(00:53:14) lansing: to practice and stuff
(00:53:24) Super-Dot: So should I
(00:53:44) Super-Dot: I wish drawing on a computer weren't such a pain
(00:53:57) Super-Dot: Elsewise I would draw all the time
(00:55:38) lansing: yeah, i did that one with the tablet on my lap and my laptop about 2 ft away in gimp
(00:56:02) lansing: in bed, it felt too awkward to draw at a desk
