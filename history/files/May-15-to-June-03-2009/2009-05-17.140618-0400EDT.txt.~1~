(14:32:15) jw: then make towers next to the tower to delete them later
(14:32:17) HannesP: jorbert: well, it's not a page turner, but it's interesting
(14:32:17) jw: yeah
(14:32:28) jorbert: Oh, that's quite different to his novels then
(14:32:33) jorbert: I read those in insane speed
(14:32:40) HannesP: i've only read one... how do you call it in english? when it's about something fictional
(14:32:49) jorbert: Novel, science fiction?
(14:32:57) jorbert: Where are you from, HannesP?
(14:33:04) worstplay: why are related videos about swine flu?
(14:33:06) HannesP: okay, i guess novel is appropriate
(14:33:07) HannesP: sweden
(14:33:33) HannesP: anyway, i've only read one of his novels, "south of the border, west of the sun"
(14:33:38) HannesP: i liked it really really much
(14:34:10) jorbert: Let me check for the German title of that one

(14:36:29) Bezzy: oops sorry. double
(14:36:45) jorbert: For some of his books they decided to translate from English though, not from japanese. That sucks :D

(14:42:53) jorbert: Haha, that horror movie about being trapped in a cave?
(14:43:01) jorbert: I hope you watched the original, not the remake
(14:43:10) jorbert: They butchered the ending in the remake
(14:43:13) Bezzy: i'd poo my pants if i went exploring in minecraft, and weirdo evolved cave dwelling humans were in one of the caves
(14:43:27) Bezzy: the remake?
(14:43:32) Bezzy: i dunno if it was a remake
(14:43:36) jorbert: I think it is originally from France
(14:43:36) Bezzy: but none of them made it out
(14:43:44) Bezzy: one had a phantasy about making it out
(14:43:47) Bezzy: ah
(14:43:47) jorbert: Was there a certain twist at the end?
(14:43:53) jorbert: Then it was the original, I think
(14:44:01) jorbert: Quite a mean ending
(14:44:05) jorbert: Sorry everyone, it's now spoilered
(14:44:21) farticles: i went exploring a rather complex cave system in minecraft and turned a corner to find bouncing mobs had discovered them already

(16:07:31) Xander: Well that's true, it's better than owning two copies of 'History of Violence'

(16:12:13) Xander: Except that I made him look like a fire flower..
(16:12:22) Super-Dot: Meanwhile, http://vimeo.com/4649345

(16:12:24) C418: man, this is cool
(16:12:25) jorbert: When I asked about these subtleties, I was only told things that were BLOODY OBVIOUS when watching
(16:12:33) PFawkes: it's really pretty complex in some ways
(16:12:58) Xander: Yeah, it doesn't really seem like a very subtle movie
(16:12:59) Super-Dot: I remember using simple strategies and losing :)
(16:13:01) PFawkes: :D
(16:13:09) PFawkes: I shall destroy you with my mollusk archers!

(16:13:45) PFawkes: hah, I did that for a while too
(16:13:48) jorbert: And the delivery isn't even interesting
(16:13:50) Super-Dot: Maybe position them symmetrically for maximum aesthetic value
(16:13:53) PFawkes: then I used penguins because penguins are awesome
(16:14:00) jorbert: I'll not understand why people hyped this so much
(16:14:01) PFawkes: because they're penguins
(16:14:12) Super-Dot: Penguins! I remember penguins
(16:14:20) Xander: His son's development was the most boring. He's a nerd who gets bullied, and then the thing happens, and then he beats up his bully
(16:14:31) Xander: And that's it. That's what should be happening every day in schools across the world
(16:14:39) PFawkes: and bizarre fish that float and are made of water?
(16:14:43) PFawkes: those were odd
(16:15:17) Super-Dot: yeah
(16:15:23) PFawkes: hah, I remember playing the main campaign and thinking hey, this isn't too bad; then I tried the expert campaign and got destroyed immediately
(16:15:51) PFawkes: it's ridiculously unbalanced, which I guess is the point

(16:24:54) PFawkes: man, I want to buy this book
(16:25:09) Xander: That said I dreamt that simon cowell saved me by three giant fusing dragons because he ate them with a soup spoon like they were made out of pudding
(16:25:18) Z80_: Ooh, what book, PFawkes?

(21:11:12) Drakkar: when they first released it
(21:11:15) Ciahnensy: Grabbed the entire bundle when it went up at Direct2Drive for $50.
(21:11:19) BlademasterBobo: :O
(21:11:20) Drakkar: multiplayer was almost impossible to do
(21:11:26) Drakkar: because of how unstable it was
(21:11:37) Ciahnensy: We had some problems last night because he was hosting.
(21:11:48) Ciahnensy: But that's also because he pirated it and there were storms in his area.
(21:11:53) Drakkar: rofl
(21:12:13) Ciahnensy: I don't quite care for using Hamachi when I have a copy capable of direct connect and Gamespy servers.

(21:12:19) farticles: and DM them
(21:12:28) Ciahnensy: Yeah I saw a PW section on Gamespy.
(21:12:31) Drakkar: yep
(21:12:35) Ciahnensy: I better just stick to playing the main campaigns for now.
(21:12:43) Ciahnensy: It's been some time since I played a AD&D game.
(21:12:52) farticles: it's not ad&d anymore
(21:12:53) Ciahnensy: First thing I noticed is that AC numbers go up instead of down now.
(21:12:55) farticles: just d&d
(21:13:11) Ciahnensy: No more of this 5 down into negatives and the such.
(21:13:18) Ciahnensy: Not sure what else is changed yet.
(21:13:19) farticles: that's weird
(21:13:19) Blood_War: Me no liek 4e
(21:13:27) farticles: i liked 3e
(21:13:31) farticles: don't know 4
(21:13:36) Ciahnensy: I've never played the real game so I don't know. I just know how the old RPGs were.

(21:14:53) Fraeon left the room (L?hd?ss?).

(21:27:14) Jrafk: I beat Rez yesterday
(21:27:20) Jrafk: the last level was awesome
(21:27:20) Cow: ...that's easy.
(21:27:22) Campster: Because that would be the most awesome level ever.
(21:27:24) locc: where are you from?
(21:27:36) Cow: nav meshes are really annoying though
(21:27:54) locc: are you people from the US?
(21:27:58) Fraeon: Some guy made an analogy that a game with bad graphics is like having a cake that looks like dog shit
(21:28:07) Fraeon: It might taste good but not very appetizing

(21:35:34) Fraeon: Cow, well the real salmiakki is just a kind of salt
(21:35:42) BlademasterBobo: RinkuHero Immortal Defense is actually quite fun
(21:35:56) BlademasterBobo: and I do not actually like that genre at all

(21:36:48) Jrafk: I do not right now
(21:36:49) Jrafk: but I used to
(21:36:54) BlademasterBobo: it would probably do very well as a flash game
(21:36:56) Jrafk: naw, not flash
(21:36:59) BlademasterBobo: Dude
(21:37:02) Jrafk: I would prefer something lower lever
(21:37:07) Jrafk: level
(21:37:09) BlademasterBobo: the top game on most flash portals is usually a TD game
(21:37:12) Jrafk: so I can run it
(21:37:14) BlademasterBobo: and it's a good TD game
(21:37:20) Jrafk: oh, that's true!
(21:37:22) BlademasterBobo: great even

(21:50:13) Campster: I have no idea.
(21:50:20) Campster: But it probably happened!
(21:50:43) Campster: All it takes is one jerk stepping arriving in the 1950's or whatever.

(21:54:28) RinkuHero: where you select 11 of them along with an overlord and keep cliking over and over in one place
(21:54:37) RinkuHero: it then stacks them together, which makes them easier to micro
(21:54:41) Blood_War: Hmm, It never works. They always spread apart
(21:54:58) RinkuHero: you have to keep them moving once stacked
(21:55:03) RinkuHero: if they stand still they seperate again
(21:55:44) Blood_War: Gotta go. See you folks tmorrow

(22:30:48) BlademasterBobo: ;l
(22:30:57) Stargoat: anyway, always thought the idea of a contain was so you could get an economic edge over your opponent... if you don't expand, that kind of nullifies its effect
(22:31:13) BlademasterBobo: yeah
(22:31:20) BlademasterBobo: he didn't really do anything after he put the bunker down
(22:31:26) BlademasterBobo: he tried to build a factory near you

(22:32:36) Stargoat: oh well

(22:38:45) Stargoat: I guess

(22:38:53) Stargoat: I've never really used lift off tactically...
(22:38:54) Dragonmaw: they are the most mobile
(22:38:59) Dragonmaw: Lift off is a fantastic strategy
(22:39:04) Stargoat: except perhaps for cliff-o-vision
(22:39:10) Dragonmaw: Especially in case of rush
(22:39:17) Stargoat: or a lolbunker rush on an islands map?
(22:39:20) Dragonmaw: It's their biggest strength
(22:39:40) Dragonmaw: A few lift offs and dropships can relocate an entire Terran player across the map in no time flat
(22:39:40) Stargoat: I guess, but when you lift off, land somewhere else, that's 2-3 minutes of free everything for the other player
(22:39:57) Dragonmaw: Better than 2-3 minutes of getting fucked in the ass
(22:40:00) Stargoat: :p
(22:40:19) Stargoat: your doom will still come
(22:40:39) Dragonmaw: I need to install Starcraft
(22:40:42) Stargoat: better to not get in to that situation in the first place

(22:58:15) RinkuHero: also
(22:58:17) Otamihen: But I chose him for some reason.
(22:58:19) RinkuHero: his medic to marine ratio
(22:58:23) RinkuHero: was too high in favor of medics
(22:58:30) RinkuHero: usually it's 1 medic per 3 or 4 marines
(22:58:34) Stargoat: maybe he wanted healthy marines.

(22:59:49) BlademasterBobo: ?

(23:00:02) BlademasterBobo: didn't they add a buncH?
(23:00:03) Stargoat: they've been replaced by the medivac, a mix of medic and dropship
(23:00:23) Stargoat: mm
(23:00:36) Stargoat: yeah, I know, but medics are pretty intrinsic to terran infantry
(23:00:45) Stargoat: I mean, the game will probably be balanced anyway

(01:53:48) paul|not: so as I was saying today I was accosted by a man asking for a story
(01:53:54) paul|not: and here I was interrupted by my own laughter
(01:53:59) paul|not: What a jerk am I, right?
(01:54:01) Super-Dot: So it's really hard to go off the charts if it's logarithmic
(01:54:02) paul|not: mood: ashamed
(01:54:19) paul|not: Super-Dot: since doesn't infinity fit "on the chart"?
(01:54:24) Super-Dot: :O
(01:54:25) paul|not: though that's technically true regardless
(01:54:30) paul|not: straight lines do too
(01:54:34) paul|not: hmm what an odd saying
(01:54:49) paul|not: really the only things that don't go off the chart are absolutely flat levels of hilarity
(01:55:03) paul|not: any minor positive or negative deviation is going to seriously mess up the idiom
(01:55:14) EdgelordPyl: put your dick into it

(02:10:44) paul|not: ain't no travel like time travel

(02:10:54) Eight-Six is now known as Hachi-Roku

(02:12:42) IndieJoJo: I'm in a panic, and I want to check with the friendly TIGSource folks
(02:12:53) IndieJoJo: I seem to have lost a ton of data on an external drive
(02:13:05) paul|not: is it formatted or can you just not get onto it?
(02:13:07) EdgelordPyl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAD7ZJ6UPeg
(02:13:11) EdgelordPyl: i love this
(02:13:12) IndieJoJo: I was DJing for a company party, and copied some music from a work computer
(02:13:28) IndieJoJo: I gave my drive/laptop/etc to one of the event planners
(02:13:45) IndieJoJo: when I got there and plugged in the drive, 90% of the data was gone
(02:13:49) paul|not: whoa
(02:13:52) paul|not: alright
(02:13:58) paul|not: so you can get onto it fine and all?
(02:14:01) IndieJoJo: Yes
(02:14:12) IndieJoJo: However, a number of directories are missing from the Music directory
(02:14:16) IndieJoJo: All of the A's are gone
(02:14:21) EdgelordPyl: i've used ontrack to recover data in situations like this, but the first thing you should do provided you've got the space is make an image of the drive
(02:14:23) EdgelordPyl: bitwise
(02:14:30) IndieJoJo: I don't :(
(02:14:33) paul|not: http://lifehacker.com/142637/download-of-the-day-2-pc-inspector-file-recovery

(02:15:04) IndieJoJo: I'm wondering if someone dropped it, and didn't bother to tell me
(02:15:14) IndieJoJo: Or if it got jostled around too much in the plane a week or so ago
(02:15:21) paul|not: well
(02:15:29) paul|not: you could have had the read write head skip over the platter
(02:15:32) EdgelordPyl: dropping or jostling doesn't really remove files
(02:15:33) IndieJoJo: (It was a small plane, and we could only have one carry-on - they through my other bag in the bag
(02:15:44) paul|not: in which case you might be able to have a professional company take a look and get some more data
(02:15:58) IndieJoJo: well, I've been told by a friend NOT to write anything to it
(02:15:58) paul|not: if it's just something that's been deleted somehow that's the only way software's going to help
(02:15:59) IndieJoJo: period
(02:16:06) paul|not: that's good advice
(02:16:16) EdgelordPyl: IndieJoJo: no matter what you do, you need another disk to recover the data to.
(02:16:21) paul|not: until you're sure you could end up losing more
(02:16:29) IndieJoJo: hmmm
(02:16:35) IndieJoJo: Since this was a work-related function
(02:16:37) paul|not: I'd really recommend a professional tech support service that can handle this properly
(02:16:42) Jr: what os are you using?
(02:16:47) IndieJoJo: Yeah, but that costs an arm and a leg
(02:16:48) IndieJoJo: WinXP
(02:16:50) paul|not: is it a work related hard drive/ storage whatever?
(02:16:52) IndieJoJo: No
(02:16:56) Jr: because most will write little things to the files
(02:16:56) IndieJoJo: My own personal drive
(02:17:02) Jr: so I'd avoid browsing it even
(02:17:03) IndieJoJo: With plenty of pirated music, etc.
(02:17:10) paul|not: you DJed free?
(02:17:11) IndieJoJo: That's no big deal
(02:17:18) paul|not: and trusted who with the drive
(02:17:30) paul|not: like, a superior?
(02:17:36) Jr: OSX has little .DS_store files it drops everywhere
(02:17:47) IndieJoJo: But I also had...  well, porn and all that crap on there a while back.  I deleted ALL of that before going to work however
(02:18:00) Jr: and I think winXP does little thumbs.db and things like that
(02:18:03) IndieJoJo: IndieJoJo.... CONFESSIONS

(02:18:30) EdgelordPyl: to advice you further we're gonna need more details

(02:18:31) IndieJoJo: This would be my work IT
(02:18:37) EdgelordPyl: what kind of porn specifically
(02:18:40) EdgelordPyl: gay? interracial? fatties?
(02:18:43) IndieJoJo: Nothing bad
(02:19:05) paul|not: EdgelordPyl: interracial is mentioned in the same sentence as fatties? good lord what has the future come to

(02:20:10) paul|not: well
(02:20:23) paul|not: I'd honestly suggest talk to IT people and see if they can do anything about service
(02:20:27) Jr: HEY GUYS IT'S 2:20 AM
(02:20:30) paul|not: You have IT people at your workplace?
(02:20:35) Jr: I'm in the FUTURE
(02:20:39) IndieJoJo: Absolutely - it's a big company
(02:20:50) paul|not: yeah I'd say talk to one of them and explain the situation
(02:20:53) IndieJoJo: Not HUGE, but we have 400 employees
(02:20:55) paul|not: if they go for it, cool
(02:21:11) paul|not: if not then uh, explain to a superior in your own department/one of the event planner people
(02:21:23) paul|not: and then if that doesn't get you anywhere cop out yourself
(02:21:38) Dragonene: I got a bit distracted, phone call
(02:21:54) Dragonene: Jr: My < key occasionally stops working, and then it'll require a reboot to get it working again
(02:22:06) Dragonene: but since my default action is hibernation rather than turning the computer off...
(02:22:06) Jr: :<
(02:22:09) paul|not: Dragonene: wired keyboard? wireless?
(02:22:10) Jr: hehe
(02:22:14) paul|not: lol
(02:22:14) EdgelordPyl: the difficult bit about doing this on your own is that you might accidentally the whole drive
(02:22:16) Dragonene: paul|not: Nah, my laptop keyboard
(02:22:20) paul|not: huh
(02:22:23) paul|not: that's a bit weird

(02:22:38) IndieJoJo: I definitely don't want to accidentally the drive
(02:22:39) paul|not: like it stops working you can just reboot and it's right there?
(02:22:40) Jr: probably a short in the flux capacitor
(02:22:47) Dragonene: that's also why I've done stuff like asking people on IRC to "paste an OR sign" for me

(02:23:46) Jr: I'm gonna go dvorak sometime
(02:23:50) IndieJoJo: Paul, I'm not sure about the application
(02:23:59) Dragonene: I heard recently that dvorak doesn't actually let you type much faster
(02:24:01) Dragonene: or rather
(02:24:04) Dragonene: there is no good proof for that
(02:24:05) paul|not: IndieJoJo: you should be able to install it on your own computer and then check it
(02:24:09) IndieJoJo: First thing it asks me is if want to -uninstall- applications
(02:24:11) Dragonene: except for surveys done by dvorak
(02:24:20) paul|not: I dunno about it jojo, haven't actually used it

(02:24:45) IndieJoJo: hmmmmm
(02:24:56) Dragonene: paul|not: who said anything of "right of spcae"
(02:25:00) Dragonene: we have the same keys there.
(02:25:02) Dragonene: :P
(02:25:05) paul|not: lol
(02:25:07) paul|not: no laptop keyboard
(02:25:07) Dragonene: no
(02:25:11) paul|not: toshiba has WEIRD setups
(02:25:12) Dragonene: actually not on my laptop keyboard
(02:25:14) Dragonene: but yeah well
(02:25:15) EdgelordPyl: the qwerty-layout was made to avoid the hammers in mechanical typewriters hitting eachother and jamming
(02:25:28) Super-Dot: Dragonene: the thing I like about Dvorak is that I can actually touch-type on it
(02:25:29) Dragonene: EdgelordPyl: I know this
(02:25:35) Jr: well
(02:25:39) Dragonene: This doesn't necessarily mean you can't type fast on it
(02:25:42) lansing: qwerty has also worked out to be very effective for the majority of computer users
(02:25:45) Super-Dot: Because the keys are placed such that touch-typing is more comfortable
(02:25:48) Dragonene: They're unrelated until proven otherwise
(02:25:49) paul|not: http://www.notebookreview.com/assets/15742.jpg
(02:25:50) Jr: I don't like how much your hands have to reach for qwerty
(02:25:56) slv left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(02:25:57) Jr: dvorak has less movement
(02:26:00) paul|not: stewardess
(02:26:00) lansing: Jr, they reach the keyboard?
(02:26:01) Dragonene: Jr: You'll still reach about in dvorak
(02:26:04) Jr: more on the home row
(02:26:07) Super-Dot: Yeah, that's where Dvorak excels
(02:26:07) Jr: is what I mean
(02:26:08) Dragonene: since you need all keys sooner or later
(02:26:19) Dragonene: The point is
(02:26:24) paul|not: the theory behind dvorak is nice but frequency tables are just averages
(02:26:27) Dragonene: Dvorak isn't objectively better
(02:26:28) Jr: yeah
(02:26:28) EdgelordPyl: Dragonene: which is my point exactly. i'm very impressed by your knowledge, though! you must have many leatherbound books. does your apartment smell of rich mahogany?
(02:26:30) paul|not: problem is averages need highs and lows
(02:26:32) Dragonene: And there needs to beproof
(02:26:40) Dragonene: EdgelordPyl: ...what?
(02:26:49) Dragonene: Was that some arbitrary attack on me for no reason?
(02:26:53) Jr: EdgelordPyl: it positively REEKS of rich mahogany
(02:26:54) Super-Dot: People on the Internet have measured things
(02:27:02) Jr: Dragonene: naw
(02:27:06) Jr: it was a quote
(02:27:08) Jr: from a movie
(02:27:13) paul|not: stewardess is the longest word you can type on one qwerty hand, how about dvorak
(02:27:17) paul|not: this is the only objective standard
(02:27:20) Super-Dot: Dragonene: naw
(02:27:24) paul|not: and everyone loves stewardesses
(02:27:24) Super-Dot: it was a quote
(02:27:27) Super-Dot: from a cave story
(02:27:37) paul|not: actually stewardesses I guess is longest
(02:27:38) Dragonene: stewardesses is longer than stewardess
(02:27:40) Dragonene: :P
(02:27:43) paul|not: lol
(02:27:44) Dragonene: also
(02:27:51) Dragonene: I'm sure you could type longer words in swedish
(02:27:52) Jr: idea
(02:27:55) paul|not: aaaaaaaargh so TIIIIIIIIIRED
(02:27:56) ***EdgelordPyl hits Dragonene with a stick
(02:27:58) Jr: two keyboards
(02:27:59) paul|not: going to go SLEEEEEEEP
(02:28:00) IndieJoJo: You know, reading up on this
(02:28:04) Dragonene: because in sweden you can pretty much make up arbitrarily long words that will be valid
(02:28:05) Jr: one with dvorak right
(02:28:08) IndieJoJo: I think the FAT32 Table might simply be corrupted
(02:28:11) Jr: one with dvorak left
(02:28:12) Dragonene: since we put words together to form new words
(02:28:20) EdgelordPyl: self-fulfilling prophecy, that
(02:28:20) Jr: DOUBLE HAND TYPING GO
(02:28:20) Super-Dot: You can write a lot more words on the home row on Dvorak than you can on the home row on QWERTY
(02:28:36) Super-Dot: like, an order of magnitude more
(02:28:38) Jr: IndieJoJo: that does not sound good
(02:28:47) paul|not: Super-Dot: vowels and frequently used consonants? yeah sure but what can you type with your right hand
(02:28:48) paul|not: YEAH NOTHING
(02:28:50) Jr: well, your stuff is still there, right?
(02:29:09) Super-Dot: paul|not: right hand is for mousing 
(02:29:10) paul|not: also sleep
(02:29:11) IndieJoJo: Jr, what do you mean?
(02:29:16) Super-Dot: left hand is for typing
(02:29:16) paul|not: Super-Dot: suuure
(02:29:17) Jr: well
(02:29:18) Jr: hm
(02:29:20) IndieJoJo: A number of directories are still there
(02:29:21) paul|not: is that what you kids call it these days
(02:29:21) Jr: I don't know
(02:29:24) IndieJoJo: But many of them are blank
(02:29:27) Jr: I'm really tired
(02:29:40) Jr: uh, I think I meant that it's only the table that's borked
(02:29:42) slv [potatofarm@pool-71-174-186-50.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(02:29:44) Jr: so your data is there
(02:29:45) Super-Dot: though if you're typing with one hand, you should really use Left-Handed Dvorak or Right-Handed Dvorak
(02:29:46) EdgelordPyl: jump
(02:29:53) Jr: but the drive doesn't know how to grab it
(02:29:59) IndieJoJo: That's what I'm hoping
(02:30:07) Jr: not the right directions or whatever
(02:30:18) Jr: incorrect lookups or whatever the jargon is
(02:30:21) Dragonene: EdgelordPyl: what's with all the aggression
(02:30:41) Dragonene: I'm not saying dvorak is either better or worse, just that it may not be all that people expect
(02:31:01) EdgelordPyl: Dragonene: you were the one spreading unfounded rumours about me, i just had to found them. :)
(02:31:11) Dragonene: I haven't been spreading any rumors at all
(02:31:16) Dragonene: what the fudge are you talking about
(02:31:27) Dragonene: The man is clearly insane.
(02:31:30) Dragonene: And this is not a rumor.
(02:31:36) Super-Dot: oh dang, I missed that
(02:31:44) paul|not left the room.
(02:31:50) Super-Dot: Jr: good idea on the left and right hand Dvorak thing
(02:32:08) Super-Dot: I want to try that
(02:32:33) Dragonene: I give you permission to do so.
(02:32:43) Super-Dot: Though I doubt it'd work very well at all :P
(02:32:45) EdgelordPyl: man, that's a pot calling a kettle a swede
(02:33:00) Dragonene: I want a frogpad or whatever they're called
(02:33:07) Dragonene: http://www.frogpad.com/
(02:33:07) Super-Dot: frogpad?
(02:33:42) Super-Dot: That looks delightful
(02:36:08) Jr: http://www.waitingforhockney.com/
(02:36:16) Dragonene: haha
(02:36:17) Dragonene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSDMahnw0_g
(02:36:20) Jr: I saw that premiere
(02:36:25) Dragonene: "What would /you/ do with your free hand?"
(02:36:33) Dragonene: ...
(02:36:51) Jr: draw!
(02:36:54) Jr: use a mouse!
(02:37:00) Jr: drink a beverage!
(02:37:09) Jr: other food activities
(02:37:12) Jr: !
(02:37:21) Jr: also dicks
(02:37:24) Jr: it is late
(02:37:27) Jr: I must write
(02:37:34) Dragonene: Write what?
(02:37:35) Jr: I will be a zombie tomorrow
(02:37:40) Jr: my JARP
(02:37:55) Jr: Junior Anal-Rape Paper
(02:37:57) Jr: er
(02:38:01) Dragonene: J-ARR-PEEH-GEEH?
(02:38:05) Dragonene: ARRH*
(02:38:17) Jr: Junior Argumentative Research Paper
(02:38:20) Dragonene: saywhat
(02:38:21) Jr: it's a cool ten pages
(02:38:27) Dragonene: \o/
(02:38:29) Dragonene: I handed in 10 pages today.
(02:38:35) Jr: and it's due in a few hours
(02:38:39) Jr: well
(02:38:42) Dragonene: yay
(02:38:43) Jr: it's due wednesday
(02:38:54) Jr: but my teacher wants a finished draft for tomorrow
(02:39:00) Dragonene: wat
(02:39:01) IndieJoJo: What did you guys think of Dishwasher Samurai?
(02:39:03) Jr: to edit in class or something
(02:39:09) Dragonene: strange
(02:39:13) IndieJoJo: I played the demo on XBLA...  I thought it was  :-/
(02:39:15) Jr: IndieJoJo: go fix your hdd
(02:39:19) Jr: :p
(02:39:46) IndieJoJo: Hey, this is a chat channel for indie games, no?
(02:39:56) IndieJoJo: Sorry if I interrupted your chat about drawing penises
(02:39:58) Jr: pfft
(02:39:58) IndieJoJo: ;)
(02:40:01) Jr: barely
(02:40:09) Jr: take a look at the topic
(02:40:16) Dragonene: not necessarily indie games
(02:40:19) Dragonene: indie *gaming*
(02:40:22) Jr: I SEE NO INDIE GAMES
(02:40:26) Jr:  /GAMING
(02:40:51) Dragonene: Although
(02:40:54) Dragonene: For me personally
(02:41:05) Dragonene: I see it as a developer place more than a gamer place
(02:41:19) Dragonene: Obviously not everyone on tigsource is a developer
(02:41:26) Dragonene: but a fair number of people are... :)
(02:41:56) EdgelordPyl is now known as KnifeNovicePyl
(02:44:27) Dragonene: I want to play left 4 dead :(
(02:48:50) C418 [C418@p5B3D5853.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(02:49:59) Super-Dot: I think most TIGers are developers or people who like interacting with/lurking near developers
(02:50:23) Super-Dot: I haven't played L4D either
(02:50:33) Super-Dot: Not indie enough for me
(02:50:44) Super-Dot: B|
(02:50:52) Jr: yeah, tigs is very developer
(02:50:59) Jr: but becoming more player
(02:51:06) Jr: tigurk is still very very dev though
(02:52:13) Super-Dot: quite so
(02:52:54) Farbs|DevMode [chatzilla@210.18.209.85] entered the room.
(02:53:11) Farbs|DevMode: 'lo all
(02:53:16) Super-Dot: case in point!
(02:53:18) Super-Dot: hello
(02:54:42) Farbs|DevMode: I am jealous of Minecraft :(
(02:54:53) Super-Dot: me too
(02:55:01) Farbs|DevMode: Have been considering similar ideas as a 3D Polychromatic Funk Monkey, but never got around to trying it.
(02:55:12) Farbs|DevMode: It's fun so far, but the potential is amazing.
(02:55:16) Dragonene: okay
(02:55:18) Super-Dot: It reminded me of PFM, yeah
(02:55:30) Dragonene: I'm going to download drivers for the fourtyzillionth time to see if they will work on my laptop
(02:55:34) Farbs|DevMode: I think this is a better direction than a PFM.
(02:55:42) Super-Dot: I want saving and loading or maybe persistent worlds
(02:55:45) Dragonene: and if so, if I can play valve games
(02:55:56) Super-Dot: I like the idea of it remaining a building game
(02:55:57) Farbs|DevMode: TF2 is lift.
(02:55:58) Farbs|DevMode: life
(02:56:05) Dragonene: this is likely to mean a couple of nice bluescreens for me
(02:56:06) Dragonene: :)
(02:56:18) Super-Dot: Like a futurepast LEGO
(02:56:25) Farbs|DevMode: I think you're right - building is the core. I figure if you just add some interesting cellular automata rules you have a game.
(02:56:28) Dragonene: Farbs|DevMode: Talk to notch then! :D
(02:56:35) Dragonene: He said he wants to do collabs eventually
(02:56:49) Super-Dot: Cellular automata?
(02:57:09) Farbs|DevMode: Simple rules for growth of plants, movement of sand and water etc.
(02:57:12) IndieJoJo left the room.
(02:57:14) Super-Dot: ah, yeah
(02:57:18) Farbs|DevMode: I don't think I'd want to collab on something like that.
(02:57:25) Farbs|DevMode: It's better as a personal project.
(02:57:29) Dragonene: :P
(02:57:32) Dragonene: Perhaps
(02:57:34) Farbs|DevMode: But ta for the idea.
(02:57:36) Dragonene: Just sayin'
(02:57:37) Dragonene: :)
(02:57:51) Farbs|DevMode: Also I have to make some $$$ soon.
(02:58:08) Farbs|DevMode: Leaving my job is going to leave me in an interesting financial situation.
(02:59:10) Farbs|DevMode: I'd actually really like to see this simple change to minecraft - you have to move blocks around rather than simply create and demolish them.
(02:59:50) Farbs|DevMode: It'd make the game much harder, and it's hard to justify to players, but I think the sense of satisfaction you'd get from sourcing the materials and lugging everything around would be fantastic!
(03:00:00) SevenbitSundance is now known as MegabitMonday
(03:00:26) Super-Dot: PFM and Minecraft are different in that in PFM, you can create blocks anywhere, whereas in Minecraft, you build on top of existing stuff
(03:00:47) Super-Dot: I kinda like the idea of creating blocks anywhere in Minecraft though
(03:01:33) Dragonene: Farbs|DevMode: what sort of development are you going for
(03:01:37) Farbs|DevMode: I think the MC approach is probably as much about interface as anything else. It's easier to show where you want to build something if you point to the object you want to attach to.
(03:01:40) Dragonene: steam or flash portals?
(03:01:44) Dragonene: Those aren't the only options of course
(03:01:47) Super-Dot: Yeah
(03:01:49) Dragonene: I just meant the general direction
(03:02:20) Farbs|DevMode: Mostly flash portals first, with the hope of creating an IP I can take to another platform.
(03:02:24) Super-Dot: You'd have to only be able to create or destroy blocks right in front of you with the alternative philosophy
(03:02:26) Dragonene: Okay, cool
(03:02:39) Farbs|DevMode: (like Crayon Physics or Tower of Goo, if they were flash first)
(03:02:44) Farbs|DevMode: (which they weren't)
(03:02:50) Jr left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(03:02:51) Dragonene: (indeed)
(03:03:01) Dragonene: I'm... sort of in the progress of making a flash game.
(03:03:01) Succendo: FARBS HELLO ILU
(03:03:05) Succendo is now known as Dragonmaw
(03:03:07) Dragonene: That I'll try to put up for portals
(03:03:09) Farbs|DevMode: ILU2
(03:03:09) #tigirc: mode (+o Dragonmaw) by ChanServ
(03:03:11) Dragonene: Dragonmaw!
(03:03:17) Dragonene: Why haven't you wrapped up your contest
(03:03:20) Super-Dot: Are you going to create a million one-week prototypes?
(03:03:22) Dragonene: It's past-last-friday
(03:03:28) Farbs|DevMode: Dragonene - any preview alpha builds?
(03:03:36) Dragonene: Farbs|DevMode: Heh, not really.
(03:03:43) Dragonene: http://www.x2d.org/java/4k/pixeloids4k.html
(03:03:44) Dragonmaw: Dragonene: Laziness at this point
(03:03:52) Dragonmaw: Also I haven;t set up the lotto program yet lol
(03:03:55) Dragonene: It's a new version of pixeloids, that I made for the 4k contest
(03:03:59) Dragonene: Dragonmaw: Excel :D
(03:04:00) Farbs|DevMode: The plan is to prototype, yeah. It's hard not to get sucked in and keep working on something though.
(03:04:13) Bigger: afternoon tigs
(03:04:17) Dragonene: Farbs|DevMode: Right now, I've pretty much got a flash port of pixeloids working.
(03:04:24) Dragonene: I want to improve and elaborate on the idea though.
(03:04:40) Dragonene: I might also require a name change, because I'm not sure pixeloids makes so much sense
(03:04:45) Dragonene: But I, uh, rather like the name.
(03:05:10) Farbs|DevMode: Try not to use the word "goo" :P
(03:05:57) Dragonene: In the name, you mean?
(03:06:00) Dragonene: I won't.
(03:06:01) Dragonene: :)
(03:06:10) Farbs|DevMode: Yeah. It's getting confusing!
(03:06:18) Super-Dot: Goo is indie
(03:06:35) Dragonene: If you meant in the in-game description, well...
(03:06:44) Super-Dot: There should be a site that compiles indie games involving goo
(03:06:53) Dragonene: I used "mass", "liquid" and a couple of other words while developing it
(03:06:54) Farbs|DevMode: Nah that's okay. Just in the name.
(03:06:58) Super-Dot: I would totally subscribe to its RSS feed
(03:06:58) Dragonene: but everybody just kept calling it goo anyway
(03:07:04) Dragonene: so I figured I'd stick with that in-game
(03:07:36) Super-Dot: The game is a bit abstract right now
(03:07:43) Dragonene: I like pixeloids, because it has both pixels and oids in it. And it's sort of suitable in the sense that the goo is grid-driven and that each goo "unit" is sort of like a pixel
(03:07:45) Dragonene: thus, a pixeloid
(03:07:49) Super-Dot: Maybe a name would be easier to come up with if it were more literal
(03:07:52) Dragonene: but it's not a very intuitive name.
(03:08:02) Super-Dot: Like "move the cooling gel onto the overheating component"
(03:08:08) Dragonene: well
(03:08:19) Dragonene: that'd be... I don't know
(03:08:22) Dragonene: not something I'd want to do
(03:08:24) Super-Dot: And then call it "coolin' gellin'"
(03:08:29) Notch [Notch@static-213-115-28-4.sme.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(03:08:32) Dragonene: I hate when themes are just superimposed upon games like that
(03:08:38) Dragonene: Hey notch
(03:08:41) Dragonene: How's it going?
(03:08:41) Notch: hey hey
(03:08:47) Notch: not too great. =)
(03:08:51) Super-Dot: :O
(03:08:52) Notch: one of those days, I guess.
(03:08:56) Farbs|DevMode: <3 Minecraft. Am sad I didn't make it first.
(03:09:02) Super-Dot: It's summer here
(03:09:02) Dragonene: Notch: Aw :S
(03:09:05) Dragonene: I hate those days.
(03:09:09) Notch: monday, tired, and grumpy, haha
(03:09:12) Super-Dot: It's 12:09 AM and it's still hot
(03:09:15) Dragonene: It's a rather good day for me.
(03:09:22) Dragonene: I turned in my huge project paper thingy
(03:09:27) Dragonene: so I'm sort of free today
(03:09:31) Super-Dot: It's supposed to cool down by midnight :|
(03:09:33) Dragonene: some basic reading I should be doing but well
(03:09:33) Notch: Farbs|DevMode: Don't let that stop you! The more the merrier, and we could even exchange ideas
(03:09:48) Notch: nice Dragonene =D
(03:09:55) slv left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(03:09:55) Dragonene: Anyway
(03:10:00) Farbs|DevMode: I'll admit I'm tempted. Maybe. Will need to buy Unity first.
(03:10:02) slv [potatofarm@pool-71-174-186-50.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(03:10:21) Dragonene: I'm going to dry installing some drivers, perhaps some random fix zip files off the internet (i'm sure they're secretly keyloggers)...
(03:10:31) Dragonene: see if I can get this BSOD problem to go away
(03:10:37) Notch: argh, bsod
(03:10:42) Dragonene: which means I'll likely BSOD when testing, so I'll just be off for a bit
(03:10:57) Dragonene: Notch: my lappy bsods when I fire up any valve game from episode 1 onwards
(03:11:08) Dragonene: might also do it with HL2, but I *think* I've successfully run hl2 at some point
(03:11:11) Dragonene: not sure tho
(03:11:18) Dragonene: oh well.
(03:11:20) Dragonene: See you in a bit.
(03:11:25) Dragonene left the room.
(03:11:26) Super-Dot: bye
(03:11:31) Bigger: guys
(03:11:32) Bigger: GUYS
(03:11:35) Super-Dot: awtoolate
(03:11:43) Bigger: I just ate something brilliant
(03:11:44) Super-Dot: hello Bigger 
(03:11:48) Bigger: Mushrooms and Vegemite on toast
(03:12:00) ***Super-Dot tries to remember what Vegemite is
(03:12:11) Farbs|DevMode: Cooked mushrooms or raw?
(03:12:28) Bigger: raw just now, but it would probably taste better lightly fried
(03:12:40) Bigger: maybe some bitter cheese to go along with it
(03:12:50) Notch: the yum
(03:12:53) ***Super-Dot finds Vegemite on Wikipedia
(03:13:01) Bigger: Super-Dot http://www.eatoutzone.com/images/Vegemite.jpg
(03:13:01) Super-Dot: ooh, that does sound good
(03:13:23) Bigger: I used to hate vegemite, but then I decided to try it again and it is brilliant
(03:13:27) ***Super-Dot fetches food himself
(03:13:32) Notch: what IS it? :-O
(03:14:19) Farbs|DevMode: Salt, mostly :)
(03:14:46) Bigger: Tastes a bit like mushrooms
(03:15:08) Bigger: A bit like rust and metal as well
(03:15:34) Notch: some garlic on that, and you've got yourself a treat =D
(03:15:56) Notch: i need to buy new headphones. They keep breaking
(03:16:12) Notch: I'm considering getting ones with a metal frame
(03:18:59) Super-Dot: mmmm
(03:19:11) Super-Dot: chocolate made by human hands
(03:19:34) Notch: "out of" would've been soo much cooler
(03:20:12) Farbs|DevMode: I recommend the Sennheiser HD280s. They're nice.
(03:21:07) ***Super-Dot just ate a chunk of chocolate which cost $.30 a gram
(03:21:32) Super-Dot: that was yummy and expensive
(03:22:21) Bigger: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_omfUlk4meQ
(03:22:25) Bigger: what a terrible video
(03:23:00) plachenko left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:23:29) Super-Dot: it's a good thing you linked to it
(03:23:52) Super-Dot: otherwise we wouldn't have known how terrible it is
(03:24:56) Bigger: truth
(03:27:24) C418 left the room (quit: Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de).

(03:28:44) lansing: goes great guns in a garden salad
(03:29:12) Bigger: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq0uKL0RxDQ&feature=related I don't know if this is brilliant or not
(03:29:20) Dragonene [none@202.171.170.5] entered the room.
(03:30:02) Dragonene: so... that didn't work
(03:30:07) Dragonene: BSOD as usual
(03:30:10) Drakkar: so Notch
(03:30:27) Notch: yes Drakkar..
(03:30:30) Drakkar: indiegamer direct linked you. :P
(03:30:38) Otamihen: Drakkar is one of my greatest friends.
(03:30:42) Dragonene: I wanted to install new drivers
(03:30:54) Dragonene: but as always, it says my video card is not supported by the driver
(03:30:55) lansing: new drivers for?
(03:31:02) Dragonene: which is bullshit because it's on the list of supported cards
(03:31:08) Dragonene: but I guess acer has blocked that out somehow
(03:31:10) lansing: which card?
(03:31:11) Drakkar: I have always wanted people to consider me their greatest friends!
(03:31:12) Farbs|DevMode: So... do people like Good Game?
(03:31:29) lansing: Farbs|DevMode, i watch it reluctantly to stay in the mainstream "loop"
(03:31:41) haowan left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:31:53) Farbs|DevMode: Well, if things go right they could get a little indier soon :)
(03:32:02) Notch: Drakkar: The forums?
(03:32:02) lansing: you're going to star on the show?
(03:32:03) Dragonene: lansing: 6200 go turbocache
(03:32:14) Farbs|DevMode: Mebbe. Hopefully.
(03:32:18) lansing: heheh
(03:32:25) Drakkar: http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2009/05/browser_game_pick_minecraft_ma.html
(03:32:58) Notch: haha, wow
(03:33:11) Notch: =D =D
(03:33:21) ***Super-Dot infers that Good Game is a teleshow
(03:33:42) ***Super-Dot reevaluates his inference and assumes that it's a webshow
(03:33:43) Drakkar: minecraft got direct linked though which is a little public for a private alpha
(03:33:43) Drakkar: but
(03:33:45) Farbs|DevMode: It's on the Tee Vee!
(03:33:47) Drakkar: on the upside
(03:33:52) Drakkar: people are wetting themselves over it
(03:33:54) Drakkar: alot
(03:34:06) Farbs|DevMode: It is very cool.
(03:34:29) Farbs|DevMode: It's what the DF interface should be :D
(03:34:53) Notch: yeah, it's a bit more publicity than I was hoping for this soon, but since it seems to be relatively stable, I consider myself lucky
(03:34:53) Super-Dot: oh dang I think my computer is crashing
(03:35:03) Notch: if it had been crashier, this would've been pretty bad. ;)
(03:35:16) Drakkar: aye
(03:35:18) lansing: Dragonene, are you using the drivers from nvidia.com?
(03:35:21) Super-Dot: phew it's just Safari
(03:36:15) Dragonene: lansing: yeah
(03:36:17) Dragonene: I was.
(03:36:23) Dragonene: why?
(03:36:39) lansing: oh just curious
(03:37:24) haowan [alex@94-195-126-145.zone9.bethere.co.uk] entered the room.
(03:37:25) #tigirc: mode (+o haowan) by ChanServ
(03:37:33) Dragonene: oh dammit
(03:37:35) Bigger: hi haowan
(03:37:37) Dragonene: I'm looking for new drivers
(03:37:40) Dragonene: seems there aren't any
(03:37:52) Dragonene: See, apparently 6200 Turbocache is supported by nvidia's official drivers
(03:37:57) Dragonene: but this is 6200 Go Turbocache
(03:38:08) Dragonene: which... Uh, only seems to have one set of drivers
(03:38:11) Dragonene: last updated 2007 :S
(03:38:57) Farbs|DevMode: Notch - are you going to ride the publicity with frequent updates, or wait 'till you have a lot of changes to dump all at once?
(03:39:12) Notch: i'm not sure yet
(03:39:44) Notch: i could go "haha, I'm going to make you look att screenshots and youtube videos" for a year, or I could go "hey guys thanks for helping me test every single thing lol"
(03:40:13) Notch: I'm going to need some help testing the basic multiplayer at least
(03:40:19) Super-Dot: Just give us a save function and we'll tolerate anything
(03:41:03) Farbs|DevMode: I think the former would be good for getting a big publicity bump later on (esp if you go IGF), but the latter builds a community (as with DF, nethack etc). Depends on what you want out of it, and how you prefer to work I guess. Also whether you actually want to take it anywhere :)
(03:41:36) Notch: I'm thinking that I could possibly make some money with this thing if I pull off something than can hold a community
(03:42:07) Notch: like register minecraft.com (which is TAKEN, the bastages), implement competetive and cooperative building and map sharing
(03:42:18) Super-Dot: minecraft.net?
(03:42:20) Super-Dot: .org?
(03:42:34) Notch: those are free. Please don't register. ;D
(03:42:45) Notch: or whatever it's called.. purchase?
(03:42:52) ***Super-Dot holds them hostage for large sums of money
(03:42:56) Notch: OW KNOWS
(03:43:11) Notch: Then I'd rename the game! I still kinda like "Mine Over Matter"
(03:43:12) lansing: Notch, I know it's a browser game, but when I played it I compared it to the coop editing mode in sauerbraten, which is just building for buildings sake or for making maps to play in fps modes, what else is planned for gameplay?
(03:43:15) Drakkar: oh
(03:43:19) Drakkar: a bit of a thought
(03:43:44) Drakkar: if at all possible control over variables related to map generation would be cool
(03:44:08) Drakkar: like how they implemented a dangerous mode in infiniminer
(03:44:15) Super-Dot: If you want to build a community, a real cool thing would be the ability to link a URL to a map
(03:44:19) Notch: lansing: Gameplay will mostly be fantasy slow paced stuff. Breeding animals, killing bears, running from monsters, fishing for food, mining for treasure
(03:44:37) Notch: in creative mode, you JUST build and nothing else, but it's also super duper fast
(03:44:40) Super-Dot: Like minecraft.net/maps/[randomnumbersletters] would link to the map I just made
(03:44:45) Notch: oh yes. good idea!
(03:44:50) Dragonene: hey, I found some other drivers that might work
(03:44:58) Dragonene: It'll be interesting to see
(03:44:59) Notch: Drakkar: Very good idea! I imagine sliders
(03:45:03) Dragonene: meanwhile, I'm off to watch some TV
(03:45:03) Dragonene: ciao.
(03:45:09) Bigger: later Dragonene
(03:45:09) Drakkar: cool
(03:45:24) Farbs|DevMode: 'night all. I'm off home.
(03:45:27) Super-Dot: It'd be sweet to share maps by sharing a URL
(03:45:28) Farbs|DevMode left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(03:45:34) Super-Dot: bye far—
(03:45:38) Notch: I think I'll go for frequent releases and community building rather than a single big release
(03:45:48) Super-Dot: Today I am saying bye to people too late
(03:46:00) Notch: this reduces the risk of me doing a massive dick move and spending fifty weeks creating something people don't even want, hehe
(03:46:10) Drakkar: yep
(03:46:18) lansing: Notch, ah cool.  I know there are people who want to play something like Infiniminer on Ubuntu, but can't because it uses XNA, so they might like what you're doing
(03:46:24) Drakkar: maybe even integrate a feedback ability in the client itself
(03:47:01) Notch: btw, my plan of making the gui stuff really low res (320x240 because I likes it).. is it really a good idea, or is it just annoying?
(03:47:26) Notch: I'm starting to suspect it's one of those "kill your darlings" things where I should just not do it
(03:47:28) Super-Dot: Sounds like fun
(03:47:31) lansing: Super-Dot, sharing maps by URLs kinda sucks unless it's for private maps, you know what would be really cool for sharing maps? an interface like in mario64 where you jump into the picture of the map, kind of a lobby area
(03:47:32) Xion [WickedbitW@c-67-188-18-170.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
(03:47:56) Bigger: Hi Xion
(03:48:03) Xion: yo larger
(03:48:08) Notch: I've had a few request from people who want to make puzzle maps, lock them for editing, and share with others
(03:48:10) Super-Dot: Sharing built maps, I mean
(03:48:24) Super-Dot: Like to tell people "look at what I made [link]"
(03:48:40) Notch: yeah, and since it's a browser game, I can put a lot of infra structure on the web site
(03:48:53) Notch: [ Click here to share this level ]
(03:49:01) Notch: Forums -> Shared maps
(03:49:02) Super-Dot: Yeah
(03:49:09) Super-Dot: I like how Google Maps does it
(03:49:17) MegabitMonday left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(03:49:40) SMRobot [littleripp@121.216.214.22] entered the room.
(03:50:04) SMRobot: congrats on getting on indiegames notch!
(03:50:36) Notch: thanks. =D I got a bit scared first since it's still early, but I've decided to think it's pure awesome =D
(03:51:17) Super-Dot: It's always good to decide to think something's pure awesome
(03:51:26) SMRobot: yeah
(03:51:31) SMRobot: dinner now bye!
(03:51:34) Notch: yum
(03:51:37) Super-Dot: bye!
(03:51:53) Super-Dot: Like when Sparky and I discovered that we were making the same gamething
(03:52:14) Super-Dot: At first I was like "augh duplicated effort and he is stepping on my turf"
(03:52:24) Super-Dot: But then I was like "no that is me being a jerk"
(03:52:36) Super-Dot: And so I posted "haha that's awesome" instead
(03:52:51) Super-Dot: And he agreed, and everything was swell
(03:53:09) Super-Dot: And it indeed ended up being awesome
(03:53:29) lansing: you're sleeping with my girlfriend! haha that's awesome
(03:53:58) Super-Dot: it's a bit harder to decide that it's awesome in that case
(03:54:02) Drakkar: haha we both like bondage with my girlfriend lets have a threeway
(03:54:24) Super-Dot: it depends on the culture probably
(03:54:34) Super-Dot: But this is the Internet, where everything is happy and awesome
(03:54:48) dom: super duper
(03:55:01) Drakkar: god
(03:55:06) Jrsquee [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(03:55:09) Drakkar: someone said super duper to me the other day
(03:55:14) Drakkar: I cracked up so bad
(03:55:21) dom: the phrase makes me cringe
(03:55:22) Jrsquee: what is going on I don't even
(03:55:29) Jrsquee: why am I awake
(03:55:34) Drakkar: it's so ridiculous I can't help but be amused
(03:55:36) Super-Dot: we were discussing how super duper you were Jrsquee 
(03:55:42) Jrsquee: it is 4 am and I have to get up in 2.5 hours
(03:55:45) Super-Dot: *how super duper you are
(03:55:55) Jrsquee: W the F
(03:55:57) dom: it's nearly 9am here, but I still wish I were asleep
(03:55:58) Jrsquee: also, thank you
(03:55:58) Super-Dot: tense consistency is tricky business
(03:56:07) Jrsquee: I am super duper
(03:56:09) Jrsquee: but
(03:56:14) Jrsquee: I prefer the term gnarly
(03:56:17) dom: wunderbar
(03:56:22) Jrsquee: I am a Gnarly Dude
(03:56:33) Super-Dot: I like excellent
(03:56:37) Jrsquee: Totally Tubular, if I do say so myself
(03:56:44) dom: wikid
(03:56:49) Jrsquee: I say wikid
(03:56:50) Super-Dot: hecka shway
(03:56:54) Jrsquee: wicked
(03:56:55) dom: so do I, actually
(03:57:02) Super-Dot: sweet
(03:57:03) Jrsquee: in actual conversation
(03:57:06) Jrsquee: and sweet
(03:57:09) Jrsquee: and gnarly
(03:57:13) dom: I also say "damn, I wish I knew which language to learn to code in", but that's another story
(03:57:14) Super-Dot: duuuuuude
(03:57:22) Super-Dot: learn them all
(03:57:24) Jrsquee: and I wear cardigans
(03:57:27) Super-Dot: starting with the easiest one
(03:57:32) Jrsquee: and a beret
(03:57:37) dom: I sometimes acidentally combine "sorted" and "cool"
(03:57:43) Jrsquee: and sometimes a plaid sports jacket
(03:57:45) Drakkar: man
(03:57:56) Drakkar: this beta is raping my processor to update
(03:58:00) Super-Dot: I wear a baseball cap with a stuffed monkey safety-pinned to it
(03:58:02) Jrsquee: oh, and I say 'Dank'
(03:58:11) dom: is that like "thanks", Jrsquee?
(03:58:12) Super-Dot: so it looks like he's sitting on my head
(03:58:14) Super-Dot: all the time
(03:58:16) Jrsquee: dank?
(03:58:17) Jrsquee: no
(03:58:21) Notch: lol sorted. =D
(03:58:22) Jrsquee: dank is like awesome
(03:58:24) Notch: do people actually say that?
(03:58:31) dom: Notch: they do in the UK
(03:58:38) Notch: and you kinda have to say "so'ed", don't you?
(03:58:43) dom: yeah
(03:58:45) Jrsquee: Man, that is pretty dank
(03:58:54) Notch: Oh, it's the blo'y bri'ish!
(03:58:58) lansing: hm, 6pm, I should go for a jog before it gets too cold
(03:58:58) Notch: and so on and so forth
(03:59:01) dom: it's hardcore southern UK accen' inni'
(03:59:03) Jrsquee: dank, gnarly, awesome
(03:59:12) Super-Dot: but jogging in the cold is the best
(03:59:16) Jrsquee: all used interchangeably
(03:59:17) Super-Dot: because you don't get all hot
(03:59:17) Jrsquee: pretty much
(03:59:25) lansing: too cold and it hurts my lungs :/
(03:59:29) Super-Dot: ah
(03:59:31) Jrsquee: there are subtle differences YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
(03:59:56) Jrsquee: anyway that is enough for now
(03:59:57) Jrsquee: by
(03:59:59) Jrsquee: e
(04:00:01) Jrsquee left the room.
(04:00:03) Super-Dot: language is tough to map out sometimes
(04:00:07) Super-Dot: bye jrs—
(04:00:09) Super-Dot: NOT AGAIN
(04:00:26) Super-Dot: that's thrice today ;-;
(04:00:41) Super-Dot: oh wait it's tomorrow now
(04:00:56) Super-Dot: that's thrice this awakeness-session
(04:00:57) Drakkar: lmfao
(04:01:20) Notch: lol
(04:02:03) Super-Dot: time for nachos
(04:02:14) Notch: i had some yesterday. it was awesome
(04:03:48) Drakkar: I had a corn beef hash and egg burrito yesterday
(04:03:51) Drakkar: also quite awesome
(04:06:14) Jrsquee [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(04:06:19) SMRobot: back yay!
(04:06:21) ***Notch is getting hungry
(04:06:33) Jrsquee: I'm getting distracted by tigurk again
(04:06:37) Jrsquee: but I need to be awake
(04:06:39) Jrsquee: to write
(04:06:50) SMRobot: my friend is odd
(04:06:59) Jrsquee: so please be a bit more forgiving about me tonight
(04:07:15) SMRobot: I said the gravity in my game wasn't feeling right and he sent me some gradient curve mixed with calculus
(04:07:19) Jrsquee: almost everything I say is exhaustion-induced craziness
(04:07:28) SMRobot: I haven't done calculus yet
(04:07:32) SMRobot: he's a maths geek
(04:07:42) Jrsquee: also, I feel like a total dick as I write this paper
(04:07:46) SMRobot: lol
(04:08:56) Jrsquee: It is human nature to be selfish.  The very idea of self-preservation, the idea that one's own life is more important than anything else is the most basic of philosophic musings.  Selflessness is an artifact of the society we live in.  Without the social ties, moral obligations, and social taboos of our community, everyone would act solely to further themselv
(04:09:00) dom: I thought gravity was just a matter of acceleration.
(04:09:07) Jrsquee: 10m/s
(04:09:08) Jrsquee: about
(04:09:12) Jrsquee: 9.8 m/s
(04:09:16) Siiseli: mornign
(04:09:19) Notch: 9.8 m/s^2
(04:09:19) dom: 9.81 from what I remember, yeah
(04:09:20) Bigger: morning Siiseli
(04:09:22) Jrsquee: HEY SII
(04:09:24) Jrsquee: seli
(04:09:26) Jrsquee: guess what
(04:09:28) Bigger: 9.8ms^2
(04:09:30) Jrsquee: I'm still awake
(04:09:32) Jrsquee: I have not slept
(04:09:37) Jrsquee: it is 10 past 4
(04:09:49) Siiseli: :3
(04:09:56) Siiseli: yes?
(04:10:31) Jrsquee: I usually sleep at like 10
(04:10:32) Jrsquee: pm
(04:10:36) Jrsquee: no 4:30 am
(04:10:40) Jrsquee: not 4:30 am
(04:11:15) Notch: I live in a strange universe where I accelerate at 9.8ms^3
(04:11:21) Notch: m/s^3, I mean

(04:11:35) SMRobot: anyone here good with XNA?
(04:11:53) Notch: I've never used it, but I saw your tumblr about it. =)
(04:11:57) SMRobot: yay :)
(04:12:02) SMRobot: people read my stuff
(04:12:06) Bigger: isn't ms^3 metres per second per second per second?
(04:12:12) SMRobot: especially if they're following
(04:12:14) Bigger: a measure of jerk or whatever
(04:12:14) Notch: I suggest using java if you don't want to scare off linux people too much
(04:12:18) SMRobot: Bigger, yeah
(04:12:21) Notch: Bigger: Yeah. =D
(04:12:32) Evil-Ville: Notch are you going to add day/night cycle to minecraft
(04:12:39) SMRobot: notch, it's my first real game so I'm not to worried
(04:12:41) Notch: Evil-Ville: I don't know. Should I?
(04:12:43) dom: wouldn't C + OpenGL be less slow? (no idea, just musing here)
(04:12:45) Evil-Ville: Yes
(04:12:45) SMRobot: it'll likely suck
(04:12:46) Bigger: I guess I should get down to some of this homework
(04:12:50) Bigger is now known as Bigger|working
(04:12:59) Notch: dom: Absolutely. That's about as fast as you get. =D
(04:12:59) Evil-Ville: You should also add seasonal changes
(04:13:18) Notch: (I think Direct3D might actually be faster in some common cases)
(04:13:21) dom: Notch: I'd like to start learning to code; I'm guessing that's a good combination to start with on linux and/or windows
(04:13:42) dom: perhaps starting off with a requirement for my code to work cross-platform is asking a little too much of myself...
(04:13:49) SMRobot: a 2d single screen platformer shouldn't be too demanding
(04:13:53) Notch: Yes, c+opengl is an awesome way of writing real proper code that can be compiled for many targets. =)
(04:14:01) SMRobot: max of like 15 or so moving bodies on screen
(04:14:05) Movius [simba@ppp59-167-51-163.lns1.cbr1.internode.on.net] entered the room.

(04:14:15) Jrsquee: m/s^3
(04:14:18) Jrsquee: would be like
(04:14:20) SMRobot: Bigger, back to work
(04:14:27) Bigger|working: :(
(04:14:27) Notch: SMRobot: First game ever, or first completed game?
(04:14:29) lansing: Movius in the house
(04:14:31) Movius: evening
(04:14:33) Jrsquee: increasing acceleration at a constant rate
(04:14:36) Jrsquee: so like
(04:14:38) Bigger|working: I am waiting for this thing to download
(04:14:41) SMRobot: Notch, first not tetris or breakout game
(04:14:50) Bigger|working: so I can listen to noise while I work
(04:14:56) SMRobot: first game based on my own ideas
(04:14:58) Notch: awesome. =) Please blog about it =D
(04:14:58) Jrsquee: +10 m/s every second
(04:15:06) Bigger|working: Yes Jrsquee, jerk
(04:15:07) Jrsquee: the rate at which the speed changes also changes
(04:15:13) SMRobot: I've been blogging consistently so far
(04:15:20) Jrsquee: bigger what
(04:15:26) lansing: I only see one blog entry at smrobot.tumblr.com
(04:15:26) Bigger|working: it is called jerk
(04:15:30) lansing: is it a different blog?
(04:15:31) Notch: it's the term for a change in acceleration
(04:15:33) Jrsquee: oh!
(04:15:35) Bigger|working: the rate of change of acceleration
(04:15:38) Jrsquee: I didn't know that
(04:15:40) Notch: a change in jerk is called "snap", iirc
(04:15:43) Jrsquee: I thought you were insulting me
(04:15:50) Bigger|working: no no no I wouldn't do that :)
(04:15:54) Jrsquee: hehehe
(04:15:55) Notch: and there's a joke about m/s^5 being called crackle, and m/s^6 being called pop
(04:15:55) Jrsquee: like I said
(04:15:59) Jrsquee: I'm crazy tired
(04:16:53) dom: I guess I'll just write my code in vi, if no-one has any other suggestions ;-)
(04:16:53) lansing: dom, presumably you'd use the same dev environment you're already using, which one is that?
(04:16:59) dom: yeah, vi
(04:17:04) dom: (for writing bash shell scripts)
(04:17:18) lansing: yeah, I used vi for awhile in 1997 but eventually moved onto emacs
(04:17:20) Notch: dom: I'm a java dev, I don't know about c environments, that's why I didn't reply. =)
(04:17:22) dom: ocasionally I use a GUI editor
(04:17:23) nyarla [nyarla@203.219.92.203] entered the room.
(04:17:24) Notch: I use eclipse, and it's good
(04:17:35) dom: fair enough, Notch - I wasn't complaining, just musing again :)
(04:17:55) Notch: hehe, ok. I felt a bit rude. =D I don't really know how to not reply when I don't have one
(04:18:06) ***lansing was thinking about how to reply for a few minutes :P
(04:18:09) Movius: vi? lunacy
(04:18:12) dom: sorry, it's Monday morning here, so I'm probably a little grouchy
(04:18:48) lansing: Movius, so long as you're not programming in something as disorganised as C++, vi works
(04:18:49) Siiseli: Jrsquee, oh I've went to sleep at 2 am for the last year or so
(04:19:00) Movius: vi never works
(04:19:08) dom: it works for me ;-)
(04:19:16) SMRobot: lansing, it's at sm-robot.tumblr.com
(04:19:18) dom: but then again, I don't write apps with multiple parts
(04:20:08) lansing: I find that emacs is really good for multitasking
(04:20:46) dom: I've been reccomended blitzmax a couple times, but I don't know anything about it.
(04:21:30) nyarla: blitzmax is good i reckon. if you can get past the fact that it's BASIC, it's very powerful and flexible. :)
(04:22:56) SMRobot: I use MSVC# and MSVC++ :S
(04:23:13) lansing: nyarla, is the editor built and scripted with BASIC?
(04:23:31) lansing: if not, then I take issue with your calling it powerful and flexible
(04:23:46) nyarla: lansing: i think it's built with BASIC.. it's not very good though
(04:23:51) nyarla: huh, why
(04:24:00) nyarla: by editor you mean blitzmax's IDE?
(04:24:09) lansing: is it scriptable with BASIC, can you write scripts that devise new editing modes and stuff
(04:24:13) lansing: yes
(04:24:15) nyarla: haha, no :)
(04:24:16) dom: oh, I thought blitz was C with its own libraries
(04:24:21) nyarla: the built in IDE is crap though
(04:25:23) nyarla: i have no idea if it would be what you consider powerful.. to me, who has no idea what "devising new editing modes" means, it seems powerful though. :P
(04:25:25) lansing: yeah, then it's not very powerful or flexible compared to emacs, which a lot of is written in elisp and so it's very flexible and configurable, by virtue of being able to modify how it works with elisp or even automating things with elisp too
(04:25:36) Otamihen: It's a party up in this piece.
(04:25:44) ***Otamihen swings from the chandelier.
(04:26:30) lansing: nyarla, well, in emacs, there are functions and data types that revolve around the parts of the editors, for navigating and modifying buffers, for writing small user interfaces, for interfacing with the web or files....
(04:26:58) nyarla: lansing: ahh.. i wasn't comparing it to emacs.. blitz's IDE is barely even an IDE.. i was just replying to dom saying he doesn't know anything about blitz
(04:27:07) lansing: nyarla, eg, the hex editor that ships with emacs is written in elisp, which is what the editor is written in and ships an interpreter and compiler for
(04:27:12) nyarla: from what i've heard emacs is like...god
(04:27:22) nyarla: never tried it myself, too scared. :)
(04:27:49) lansing: nyarla, well, emacs has its short comings, but it has some good design aspects
(04:28:20) Movius: emacs is just bad
(04:28:30) lansing: Movius, how long have you used it for?
(04:28:33) nyarla: tbh Programmer's Notepad is enough of an IDE for me
(04:28:43) Movius: I used it back in the day at uni
(04:28:47) nyarla: though at the moment i am getting to grips with Xcode, and actually quite liking it for some reason
(04:28:50) Movius: before i realised there was nedit
(04:29:04) Bezzzy left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(04:29:44) lansing: Movius, I don't think you took the time to appreciate it :P
(04:30:02) Movius: you're right. I'm no conoisseur of text editor
(04:30:31) lansing: well, i drink red wine and discuss emacs with my emacs buddies in an emacs gentlemens club
(04:30:38) nyarla: hehe
(04:32:10) Super-Dot left the room (quit: Quit: Super-Dot).
(04:32:25) Dragonene: okay
(04:32:28) Dragonene: now to try driver #2
(04:34:04) Movius: sounds like a classy establishment
(04:34:19) Movius: neatly trimmed neckbeards all around
(04:34:49) Dragonene: hey sweet
(04:34:55) Dragonene: I found a driver that will install
(04:34:55) Dragonene: !
(04:35:11) Dragonene: meanwhile...
(04:35:36) Dragonene: can somebody find me a color palette on colourlovers.com or kuler.adobe.com

(04:48:54) SMRobot: hi!
(04:48:58) lemmer: you can train a monkey to drum, but can you teach it to play a kickin' rhythm?
(04:49:11) dom: Apes can drum to Genesis.
(04:49:48) lemmer: man
(04:49:49) lemmer: i believe it
(04:50:16) SMRobot: specifically phil collins
(04:50:24) dom: indeed, SMRobot 
(04:50:38) SMRobot: I feel like chocolate now
(04:50:44) dom: They could have done several other rather good drum solos with that advert.
(04:50:50) SMRobot: yes
(04:50:59) SMRobot: but genesis was awesome for it
(04:52:48) dom: oh totally, but there are others, that's all I'm saying
(04:52:53) SMRobot: genesis is awesome for a lot of things actually
(04:53:12) SMRobot: it's like "your dog died but I have invisible touch here!"
(04:53:17) SMRobot: and your like "w00t"
(04:54:05) Notch: kevglass! Hello!
(04:54:23) ***kevglass experiences tigirc
(04:54:37) ***dom finds some good examples of drum solos on youtube
(04:54:42) dom: now I'm not going to get any work done for ages ;-)
(04:55:25) kevglass: apparantly it's quite "creative" in here?
(04:55:55) SMRobot: that;s one word for it
(04:56:03) kevglass: whats another? 
(04:56:16) SMRobot: meh
(04:56:23) kevglass: :)
(04:56:40) kevglass: whats with tumblr btw, second person I've seen starting a blog up there
(04:56:59) kevglass: is it special or just good?
(04:57:10) dom: it's not twitter...? ;-)
(04:57:26) ***kevglass loves twitter :)
(04:57:35) Notch: i use it because it was the first blogging place that actually felt nice and easy to use
(04:57:52) SMRobot: ya
(04:57:53) SMRobot: that
(04:57:54) kevglass: it looks nice too
(04:58:02) SMRobot: it's dead simple blogging
(04:58:17) SMRobot: you type stuff and it shows up on your blog
(04:58:20) SMRobot: simple as that
(04:59:00) Notch: no comments, though.. :-\
(04:59:09) SMRobot: you can have comments
(04:59:10) kevglass: that might be a good thing in my experience :)
(04:59:19) SMRobot: you just need to finish you title or post with a ?
(04:59:36) SMRobot: and the option shows up in the sidebat
(04:59:36) kevglass: ah, thats neat
(04:59:39) SMRobot: sidebar*

(05:02:22) dom: I get spam on my wordpress blog

(05:02:49) SMRobot: ya
(05:02:49) ramdance: ok
(05:02:53) SMRobot: it's great
(05:02:57) ramdance: why do you need to tell us?
(05:03:09) SMRobot: on my old WP blog I got similar problems
(05:03:18) dom: there's a good anti-spam plugin for wordpress
(05:03:21) SMRobot: but then my host stopped paying domain name fees
(05:03:26) SMRobot: so now it's tumblr
(05:03:29) ramdance: there are other ways of stopping spam
(05:03:56) lansing: yes, don't connect your blog to the internet, zero spam

(05:04:16) Dragonene: well, what do you know. I bloody did it. Left 4 Dead started.
(05:04:23) Dragonene: It ran at about... -5 fps
(05:04:30) dom: Akismet works for me.
(05:04:53) lansing: Dragonene, l4d requires a lot of grunt for the post processing effects
(05:04:59) lansing: Dragonene, http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/792276/Hoover
(05:05:46) Dragonene: lansing: Yeah, my computer is below the min specs
(05:05:49) Dragonene: so I don't blame them
(05:05:52) ramdance left the room.
(05:05:57) Dragonene: I'm just happy it started though
(05:06:05) Dragonene: perhaps it means I can play HL2 @ low fps
(05:06:10) Dragonene: *perhaps* even episode 1 if I'm lucky
(05:06:25) Dragonene: also, lansing: thanks.

(05:07:35) lansing: Dragonene, it's said that l4d "renders the whole screen out in RGB to a texture and then redrawns it to the screen in SRGB"
(05:07:52) lansing: every frame
(05:08:20) Dragonene: Now, I wonder what I should do with that palette..
(05:08:28) lansing: Dragonene, the link was from Jr before he left
(05:08:31) Dragonene: hmm, I'll get to that later. I want to do some work on pixeloids now

(05:20:32) Dragonene: I have been disconnected!
(05:20:35) Dragonene: But why?
(05:23:19) Notch: dieing on the inside = bad
(05:24:47) Stargoat: isn't that just regular dieing?
(05:25:37) lemmer: lode runner, why do you insist on kicking my ass
(05:25:58) Evil-Ville: Is dieing even a word
(05:26:03) Notch: Stargoat: I guess so, yes!
(05:26:05) Stargoat: I haven't played that in many years.
(05:26:10) Notch: I'd say "dying". :D
(05:26:12) Stargoat: Evil-Ville: I wondered that myself
(05:26:28) Stargoat: but couldn't be bothered looking it up
(05:27:13) ***Stargoat is a very lazy carterpillar
(05:27:58) Stargoat: Dragonmaw: Let us discuss JA2.
(05:29:18) Drakkar: jagged alliance 2?
(05:29:20) Drakkar: :D?
(05:30:09) jeb: ey Stargoat
(05:30:15) Stargoat: yes!
(05:30:25) Stargoat: Drakkar: You a fan?
(05:30:32) Dragonene: okay, I'll be studyan some
(05:30:35) Drakkar: yep
(05:30:37) Drakkar: love the series
(05:30:39) Dragonene: later folks
(05:30:43) Stargoat: I've only played JA2
(05:30:43) Drakkar: there's gonna be a jagged alliance DS soon
(05:30:45) Stargoat: started it last week
(05:30:46) Drakkar: peace Dragonene
(05:30:52) Stargoat: it's been the only game I've played since then
(05:30:54) Stargoat: consuming my time
(05:30:56) Stargoat: it's pretty amazing
(05:30:57) Drakkar: its a damn good game
(05:31:00) Stargoat: especially with the 1.13 patch
(05:31:01) Nightro [Nightro@60-241-47-103.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(05:31:14) Drakkar: I always thought that if jagged alliance and fallout were combined
(05:31:20) Drakkar: I would never talk to a human being again
(05:31:22) Stargoat: haha
(05:31:34) Stargoat: it's kind of like... what Fallout Tactics should have been
(05:32:03) Stargoat: I mean, there are similarities... but the depth JA2 goes in to is quite amazing
(05:32:07) Stargoat: night missions are a lot of fun.
(05:32:24) Dragonene: ohh
(05:32:34) Stargoat: in fact, it seems to be the only viable way to attack some objectives perfectly
(05:32:34) Dragonene: is jagged alliance one of those games
(05:32:37) Dragonene: I thought it was an RTS
(05:32:41) Stargoat: nah, TBS
(05:32:47) Dragonene: Now you've gone and gotten me interested
(05:32:47) Stargoat: TBS/TBT

(05:33:18) Cludney [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(05:33:22) Stargoat: check it out. The game is something like $10 on gog
(05:33:27) Stargoat: which is a damn fine price.
(05:33:35) Stargoat: it's pretty hard though, so, you know, fair warning
(05:34:09) jorbert: Hi
(05:34:11) Stargoat: yo
(05:34:12) Dragonene: dunno
(05:34:20) Dragonene: no time to get drawn into games really

(05:34:23) Drakkar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(05:34:26) Stargoat: yeah...
(05:34:28) Dragonene: more likely that I'd play x-com again
(05:34:33) Stargoat: I really shouldn't be playing it as much as I am
(05:34:38) Dragonene: have you played commando?
(05:34:39) Stargoat: I still need to play x-com...
(05:34:42) Stargoat: um
(05:34:43) Dragonene: commandos*
(05:34:45) Stargoat: once, at a friend's place
(05:34:51) Dragonene: they're pretty good games
(05:34:52) Dragonene: also hard.
(05:34:56) Stargoat: similar style?
(05:35:04) Dragonene: they're real-time
(05:35:08) Dragonene: but yeah
(05:35:08) Stargoat: oh
(05:35:10) Dragonene: perhaps
(05:35:11) Stargoat: hmm
(05:35:17) Dragonene: it's like x-com with more sneaking and in realtime
(05:35:29) Dragonene: sort of slowish real time
(05:35:31) Stargoat: sneaking is a huge part of JA2.
(05:35:35) Dragonene: you know, you gauge their patrol routes and stuff
(05:35:52) Stargoat: hmm
(05:35:57) Stargoat: I should check it out
(05:36:05) Dragonene: yeah
(05:36:05) Stargoat: I also wanna check out Syndicate
(05:36:11) Dragonene: I haven't played commandos for a long while tho
(05:36:16) Dragonene: I bought two of the games I think
(05:36:20) Cludney left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(05:36:22) Dragonene: or perhaps only one
(05:36:24) Dragonene: can't recall :D
(05:36:25) Dragonene: I lost them
(05:36:33) Stargoat: :(
(05:36:37) Dragonene: some friend borrowed them and I don't think I ever got them back
(05:36:43) Drakkar [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(05:36:46) Dragonene: syndicate is bound to be awesome because it's bullfrog
(05:36:48) Dragonene: I haven't played it
(05:36:53) Dragonene: Stargoat: If you haven't played x-com though...
(05:36:57) Dragonene: Just get the first one
(05:36:59) Dragonene: The oldest
(05:37:02) Stargoat: I've heard some pretty great things about syndicate
(05:37:02) Dragonene: you'll be awestruck
(05:37:14) Dragonene: x-com is like... *the* game
(05:37:18) Stargoat: so many great games that need to be played.
(05:37:21) Dragonene: It's not even in my top list because it's so great
(05:37:28) Dragonene: It doesn't deserve a place with other games
(05:37:32) Notch: x-com is great, if you can slow it down. =D
(05:37:32) Stargoat: does x-com have a strategic element in addition to tactical stuff?
(05:37:35) Dragonene: It's in slot -5
(05:37:38) Dragonene: yeah
(05:37:38) Notch: yes, Stargoat
(05:37:42) Dragonene: it's global + tactics
(05:37:45) Stargoat: right
(05:37:48) Drakkar: Stargoat
(05:37:49) Stargoat: JA2 does that
(05:37:49) Dragonene: works amazingly well together
(05:37:57) Notch: it's very atmospheric as well
(05:38:00) Stargoat: yes, Drakkar?
(05:38:00) Drakkar: anything after <Stargoat> it's kind of like... what Fallout Tactics should have been < I missed
(05:38:05) Stargoat: oh
(05:38:06) Stargoat: hmm
(05:38:08) Dragonene: you should get the update windows version thingy of x-com tho
(05:38:16) Dragonene: that actually *runs* reasonably well
(05:38:19) Stargoat: quite a lot was said
(05:38:27) Drakkar: feel free to dcc chat me the log

(05:39:03) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-50-175.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(05:39:37) Dragonene: Stargoat: while commandos is something I recommend
(05:39:40) Dragonene: x-com is a must-play
(05:40:03) Dragonene: X-Com: UFO Defense / UFO: Enemy Unknown (depending on where you are)
(05:40:18) Dragonene: It's pretty much the only classic game that I still enjoy today
(05:40:28) Dragonene: Well, that and Link to the Past.
(05:40:45) Stargoat: yes...
(05:40:45) Dragonene: in fact
(05:40:47) Stargoat: I'll get around to it
(05:40:47) Dragonene: you'll install it.
(05:40:49) Dragonene: Right now.
(05:40:49) Stargoat: I wanna finish JA2 before I start anything else, though. It's kicking my ass, and I need to teach it to play nice.
(05:40:52) Stargoat: Under cover of darkness
(05:40:53) Dragonene: There's no better time
(05:40:54) Dragonene: No
(05:40:54) Stargoat: with my silenced Steyr AUG
(05:40:55) Dragonene: NOW
(05:40:56) Stargoat: hmm
(05:40:58) Dragonene: I'm TELLING YOU
(05:41:00) Stargoat: I have like, a --
(05:41:06) Stargoat: no space on compy :|
(05:41:11) Dragonene: it's like 10mb
(05:41:17) Dragonene: okay perhaps a bit more
(05:41:19) Dragonene: but ~ish...
(05:41:19) Stargoat: I have like, 100 kb space left
(05:41:41) Dragonene: bullshit :P
(05:41:45) Dragonene: Your computer wouldn't run
(05:41:52) Stargoat: bullshit
(05:42:01) Drakkar: alright
(05:42:04) Stargoat: you're so full of it, dragonene, I can't believe you.
(05:42:06) Drakkar: fallen earth makes me sad
(05:42:25) Stargoat: fallen earth?
(05:42:33) Drakkar: its a post apocalyptic mmo
(05:42:42) Stargoat: I hadn
(05:42:47) Stargoat: hadn't heard of it
(05:42:48) Drakkar: I'm totally breaking NDA by mentioning this but
(05:42:49) Stargoat: is it good?
(05:42:54) Drakkar: I'm unable to update
(05:42:54) Drakkar: :|
(05:43:04) Drakkar: it looks utterly amazing
(05:43:04) Dragonene: Stargoat: requirements from steam
(05:43:05) Stargoat: hmmmmmmmm
(05:43:06) Dragonene: "Processor: 80386 processor or better
(05:43:06) Dragonene: Memory: 4Mb RAM
(05:43:06) Dragonene: Sound Cards Supported: AdLib compatible cards, SoundBlaster compatible cards and the Roland LAPC-1."
(05:43:12) Drakkar: like fallout in mmo form
(05:43:13) Stargoat: oh wow, x-com is on steam?
(05:43:14) Dragonene: <3 Now that's what I call game requirements
(05:43:23) Drakkar: similar to fallout three visually though
(05:43:24) Drakkar: but
(05:43:29) Dragonene: Stargoat: yeah, 5 dollars
(05:43:29) Stargoat: yuck
(05:43:37) Dragonene: or 14 dollars for the entire x-com pack
(05:43:41) Stargoat: hmm
(05:43:43) Drakkar: it seems to be a tps mmo
(05:43:45) Stargoat: I wonder if gog has it

(05:44:07) Drakkar: it has vehicles
(05:44:17) Dragonene: although the full pack has interceptor in it
(05:44:22) Dragonene: which is supposed to be really bad
(05:44:28) Dragonene: also enforcer that I've never heard of
(05:44:36) Stargoat: hmm
(05:44:43) Dragonene: looks like a third person shooter of some sort
(05:45:02) Dragonene: the three you'll care about are x-com: ufo defense, x-com: terror from the deep and x-com: apocalypse
(05:45:10) slv left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(05:45:10) Dragonene: terror from the deep is said to be way, way too hard, I haven't played it tho

(05:46:14) Stargoat: but then I can't play Blackmail.
(05:46:31) Stargoat: anyway, I will check out x-com
(05:46:37) Stargoat: but first I wanna finish JA2 :3
(05:47:12) Dragonene: Fine
(05:47:16) Dragonene: :/
(05:47:25) Dragonene: When you've grown to love x-com
(05:47:26) Stargoat: plus
(05:47:27) Dragonene: let me know
(05:47:31) Dragonene: so we can play ufo: ai in coop
(05:47:35) Stargoat: exams are in 3 weeks or something
(05:47:46) Dragonene: this is not something I need be reminded of
(05:47:47) Stargoat: need -less- distractions
(05:47:50) Dragonene: in fact, I'd rather forget it
(05:48:00) ***Stargoat un-reminds dragonene
(05:48:21) Dragonene: okay
(05:48:25) Dragonene: I need to study
(05:48:27) Stargoat: Drakkar: Have you played JA2 with the 1.13 patch?
(05:48:28) Stargoat: later

(07:01:17) #tigirc: mode (+b *!*@92.82.104.55) by hao-1
(07:01:37) mewse: I'm grumbling at quadtree heightmap code.  Finally trying it.
(07:01:44) hao-1: from the article?
(07:02:11) mewse: Yeah.  Although the code from the article is kind of painful to look at.
(07:02:20) hao-1: you're telling me :D
(07:02:48) mewse: I think the author's brother must have been murdered by an enum, and he's never forgiven them.
(07:02:53) hao-1: took me a very long time to sort that stuff out.
(07:03:06) hao-1: well, it comes from a time when saving space was very importnat
(07:03:08) mewse: I'm writing from scratch, instead of trying to fix the provided code.
(07:03:11) hao-1: yeah.
(07:03:28) hao-1: Also, I'm not too sure about his pixel error code.
(07:03:49) hao-1: It seems to work vaguely well in practice, in his demo I mean, but the maths doesn't seem right to me.
(07:04:43) mewse: But right now I'm trying to figure out whether it's worth trying the "storing the heightmap data directly inside a sparse quad tree" thing he's advocating.
(07:05:10) SMRobot [littleripp@CPE-144-131-64-2.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.
(07:05:15) hao-1: nice idea if you have big flat areas.
(07:05:24) mewse: Yeah.
(07:05:36) mewse: And I'm likely to have them.  Oceans, for one.
(07:06:02) hao-1: no undersea detail? :)
(07:06:18) mewse: Not at first.  :)
(07:06:20) _SMRobot [littleripp@CPE-144-131-64-2.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.

(07:08:11) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:08:36) _SMRobot: does anyone know why my recent documents doesn't work anymore
(07:08:48) hao-1: one thing to be aware of is that if you have your sea level as part of the terrain data, your LOD will produce sloped sea at the beaches
(07:09:13) mewse: Mm, fair point.
(07:09:23) mewse: Okay, so I won't do that.
(07:09:43) _SMRobot: mewse, what kind of game are you working on?
(07:09:52) hao-1: but, no reason why it can't be pretty much flat underneath that level.
(07:11:10) mewse: Right now, I'm trying to make a game with a dynamic height-mapped terrain, covering 10,000 square kilometers of terrain.  Because I'm absolutely insane.
(07:12:11) _SMRobot: nice
(07:12:18) Notch: :-O
(07:12:19) _SMRobot: I'm making a single screen platformer

(07:13:09) Notch: how dense, mewse?
(07:13:46) Stargoat left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:13:50) mewse: Well, I have sort of arbitrary-size world right now, but the draw distance is only about 500m at any given moment.  I want to have a much longer draw distance, which means that I need a fancier LOD system than I have now.
(07:14:38) KareemK [kareem@84.36.231.200] entered the room.
(07:15:13) mewse: At top LOD, I'd like verts to be around 5m apart.  But when viewed from a great distance, I expect that they'll be much further apart than that.
(07:15:28) Notch: nice =)
(07:15:30) SimonTheDigger: X-MEN, WELCOME TO DIE
(07:15:31) _SMRobot: I'm just working out basic collision response and the character's physics
(07:15:46) Otamihen: I put a lot of quarters into that machine.
(07:15:51) Otamihen: That shit is awesome.
(07:15:55) Notch: for wurm online, I had ~500 meters close terrain where each texel was unique, then after that it switched to a retardedly simple lod model
(07:16:17) Notch: actually, it was the same one, but scaled to 200 times larger and dumbed down. :D
(07:16:43) mewse: I'm looking at an adaptive quadtree.. but it's complicated.
(07:16:56) Notch: oh neat
(07:17:22) Notch: dynamic terrain as well?
(07:17:27) mewse: Yep.
(07:17:32) Notch: awesome =)
(07:17:40) mewse: Player will change the terrain in realtime.  Or something approaching realtime.
(07:18:05) Notch: is it for fun or for a specific game?
(07:18:17) mewse: Haven't quite decided whether player will be able to directly deform it, or whether he'll queue up DF-style commands that his minions will actually perform.
(07:18:30) Notch: ooh
(07:18:31) mewse: Yeah, specific game.  New MMORPG Tycoon, assuming I can make it all work.
(07:18:43) Notch: awesome. Good luck. =)
(07:18:56) Notch: if you ever need a tester.. =D
(07:19:37) mewse: I've been kind of stunned by MineCraft, incidentally.  :)
(07:20:02) mewse: I'll keep you in mind for it, Notch!  Going to be a while before there's anything to test, though.  :)
(07:20:10) Notch: =D
(07:20:23) ***kevglass chuckles
(07:20:26) Notch: yeah, I can imagine. But I'd even test simple engine tests, haha =D

(07:20:57) kevglass: Notch, with your minecraft how are you rendering?
(07:21:06) Notch: display lists
(07:21:11) kevglass: cause here on my work PC (intel 9x graphics) I get like 16fps
(07:21:19) ArneLurk [chatzilla@h42n2fls34o984.telia.com] entered the room.
(07:21:20) mewse: I'm all curious about how you're doing minecraft, yeah.  Are you merging triangles together, or just brute forcing all those little boxes?
(07:21:28) kevglass: at home I get like 400 fps
(07:21:30) lansing: I think I got like 2000fps on my nvidia 9800
(07:21:31) kevglass: on a okish card
(07:21:53) lansing: 400 or so in the tough spots
(07:21:55) Notch: I'm still brute forcing them all. The reason for this is that I want to be able to have up to 256 differen textures, so I've got a single atlas texture for them all
(07:22:04) mewse: Awesome.
(07:22:13) Notch: wow lansing, that's twice what I get at home
(07:22:15) mewse: I still haven't figured out how I'm going to do textures on my huge terrain.
(07:22:33) kevglass: ah right, so they're no collapsing of blocks into bigger triangles
(07:22:37) kevglass: or anything like that
(07:22:38) Notch: the textures are just 16x16, so it's all a single 256x256 texture, heh
(07:22:38) mewse: I might cheat and go texture-less, like Love is doing.
(07:22:45) SlayerXL left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:22:52) Notch: kevglass: Yeah. But it'd speed up a LOT if I did that
(07:23:01) kevglass: aye
(07:23:12) kevglass: reasonably easy with the blocky terrain too I'd have thought
(07:23:14) Notch: i could mirror every other texture. ;)
(07:23:18) kevglass: lol
(07:23:28) Notch: then I'd cut vertex count in half for long strips
(07:23:39) kevglass: such a 4k coder.
(07:23:47) Notch: haha, yeah..
(07:24:03) Notch: I want the game to run well on my Eee. I currently get like 2-5 fps
(07:24:07) Notch: I want at least 15
(07:25:05) kevglass: netbooks = the new indie win?

(07:55:19) kevglass: ah, well thats good
(07:55:47) Dragonene: apparently they run on pulpcore these days
(07:55:50) Dragonene: or so suggests the forums
(07:55:53) kevglass: yeah, knew about that
(07:55:58) kevglass: but that was an age ago
(07:55:59) kevglass: :)
(07:56:13) Dragonene: I knew they switched from slick
(07:56:19) Dragonene: I didn't know they switched to pulpcore
(07:56:25) kevglass: disappointed to not see more pick up of pulpcore 
(07:56:25) Super-Dot left the room (quit: Quit: Super-Dot).
(07:56:30) kevglass: seems like a kick ass framework
(07:56:38) kevglass: and makes applets looks so smooth
(07:56:46) Drakkar: yes now!
(07:58:34) Drakkar: I was actually just posting in something stencyl related just now
(07:58:40) Dragonene: :)
(08:00:43) Drakkar: main reason the website and blogs are dead is because Jon is bizarrely tightlipped on the site
(08:01:02) kevglass: is the schedule still "when it's ready"?
(08:01:04) Drakkar: he actually joins irc occassionally and makes some progress related comment or talks code
(08:01:08) Drakkar: yeah pretty much
(08:01:12) Dragonene: not here surely
(08:01:17) Dragonene: I've never seen Jon :)
(08:01:18) Drakkar: nah
(08:01:22) Drakkar: stencyl has its own irc server
(08:01:24) Dragonene: right
(08:01:25) Drakkar: though its pretty empty
(08:01:41) kevglass: got a mail from him a while ago
(08:01:42) LtJax left the room (quit: Quit: std::runtime_error).
(08:01:50) Dragonene: what'd it say?
(08:01:52) kevglass: talking about opportunites where he worked, vmware isn't it?
(08:01:58) Drakkar: think so
(08:02:05) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(08:02:09) Drakkar: its partially why it seems to be going so slow
(08:02:24) Drakkar: I forget what but both he and the head of web development go to ivy league colleges
(08:02:34) Drakkar: and have some crazy ass jobs
(08:02:41) kevglass: well it's good they're still interested
(08:02:58) kevglass: always seemed to take it very seriously.
(08:03:06) Drakkar: definitely
(08:03:14) mewse [mewse@c122-107-189-4.eburwd5.vic.optusnet.com.au] entered the room.
(08:03:20) Drakkar: it's one of the reasons I enjoy being a part of it
(08:03:27) u5|xeon` [jake@adsl-99-132-249-166.dsl.chcgil.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(08:04:16) kevglass: fair enough
(08:04:24) Dragonene: it'd definitely have been interesting to see it using slick
(08:04:31) kevglass: it wasn't a good fit
(08:04:33) Dragonene: but I think moving to pulpcore might've been a good choice
(08:04:37) Dragonene: given applets
(08:04:39) xe0n left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:04:39) kevglass: they're primary focus is applets
(08:04:46) Dragonene: yeah
(08:04:50) Dragonene: that's what I meant. :)
(08:04:57) kevglass: their even.
(08:05:11) Dragonene: no, no, "they're even"
(08:05:12) kevglass: still think if they want to take it as a real business they should have targetted flash
(08:05:16) Dragonene: "their even" makes no sense :D
(08:05:18) Dragonene: (sorry!)
(08:05:27) kevglass: twit.
(08:05:31) Dragonene: heh.
(08:05:33) Drakkar: rofl
(08:05:50) Dragonene: myeah, I don't know, game makers for flash might not be all that big a market
(08:06:04) kevglass: if they targeted flex instead
(08:06:05) Dragonene: given it'd be competing with the flash tools from adobe
(08:06:06) Drakkar: tbh after everything I've seen between minecraft and stencyl, i'm starting to doubt that
(08:06:09) Dragonene: yeah, I guess
(08:06:10) kevglass: so you didn't have to buy flash tooling
(08:06:13) Dragonene: the point is
(08:06:21) kevglass: minecraft is lwjgl though right?
(08:06:22) Dragonene: maybe this can prove that java is useful, who knows?
(08:06:28) kevglass: naaa
(08:06:31) u5|xeon` left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:06:32) Dragonene: and if it does, it'll have a *huge* market pretty much alone
(08:06:36) Drakkar: think so
(08:06:37) Dragonene: it'd be very hard to do though.
(08:06:52) Drakkar: minecraft also performs crazy fast
(08:07:10) Drakkar: while flash usually immediately puts my processor at 100%
(08:07:13) Drakkar: regardless of what it is
(08:07:13) Dragonene: that's due LWJGL
(08:07:22) Dragonene: which also means you get like 2 accept buttons for the applet
(08:07:32) Dragonene: it's basically just the same thing as using unity in a browser or whatever
(08:07:37) Drakkar: ah
(08:07:37) Drakkar: neat
(08:07:39) kevglass: using pulpcore you'll find a similar issue when you start changing everything on the screen every frame
(08:07:41) Dragonene: well no
(08:07:45) Dragonene: but it's hardware accelerated
(08:07:45) Dragonene: opengl
(08:07:54) Drakkar: well thats a good thing
(08:07:55) Nightro left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(08:08:01) Dragonene: sort of
(08:08:07) Dragonene: but also not
(08:08:12) Drakkar: go on!
(08:08:17) Dragonene: that's what stencyl would've been like if it was run on slick
(08:08:22) Dragonene: since slick sits on top of lwjgl
(08:08:32) Drakkar: I see
(08:08:33) kevglass: too techy?
(08:08:33) Dragonene: but you get more "Do you accept this application?" buttons to click
(08:08:44) kevglass: no one seems to care about those buttons any more
(08:08:55) Dragonene: yeah well
(08:08:58) Drakkar: I actually only got one
(08:09:02) Dragonene: there's also the issue of having hardware support at all
(08:09:14) Dragonene: I don't imagine pulpcore would run too well on phones...
(08:09:19) Dragonene: but slick wouldn't run at all.
(08:09:25) Stargoat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs299lPuYZo <-- the only game worth playing, ever
(08:09:27) Dragonene: (unless they had opengl es and you ported it, that is)
(08:09:29) kevglass: pulp wouldn't run either
(08:09:37) Dragonene: Not that stencyl targets phones.
(08:09:38) kevglass: it required java2D 
(08:09:45) Dragonene: oh, fair enough
(08:09:54) Stargoat: in fact
(08:09:58) kevglass: not that Slick would port well
(08:09:58) Stargoat: I will go so far as to say
(08:10:02) Stargoat: that it's the only game ever made
(08:11:23) kevglass: too much floating point, android doesn't have FPU on g1/2
(08:11:30) kevglass: definitely too techy now
(08:11:36) ***Dragonene clears throat.
(08:11:42) Dragonene: Stargoat clearly hasn't heard of Blackmail.
(08:11:57) Stargoat: blackmail isn't a game
(08:11:58) Stargoat: it's a way of life
(08:12:09) Dragonene: Stargoat: Also
(08:12:14) Dragonene: you'll change your mind once you give x-com a try
(08:12:27) Stargoat: but x-com can't exist if mario 3 is the only game ever made.
(08:12:33) Drakkar: you know
(08:12:50) Drakkar: what's the x-com with the most features that isn't absurdly broken or something silly
(08:12:59) Drakkar: I've never gotten a chance to play x-com
(08:12:59) Dragonene: huh?
(08:13:04) Drakkar: and I really should
(08:13:07) Dragonene: x-com ufo defense (first one) is great
(08:13:19) Dragonene: I also recall x-com apocalypse being good, but haven't played it in a long while
(08:13:20) xe0n [jake@adsl-75-21-79-195.dsl.chcgil.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(08:13:31) Dragonene: x-com ufo defense is also known as UFO: Enemy Unknown (in europe)
(08:14:41) Snakey: X-Com is awesome, but I feel that the current remake (the one made with the Quake 2 engine) is still just as flawed in usability as the original one
(08:15:27) Dragonene: ufo: ai
(08:15:33) Dragonene: yeah, well, I like it nonetheless
(08:15:38) Dragonene: have you tried all the really new ones?
(08:15:41) Dragonene: the UFO series?
(08:15:48) Dragonene: I hear the later games in that series are pretty good.
(08:16:28) Dragonene: Stargoat: I have to admit tho, looking at that video reminds me that it's been far too long since I've played mario 3
(08:16:41) Stargoat: yeah well, you suck then.
(08:16:44) Stargoat: mario 3 is awesome.
(08:16:50) Stargoat: this is objective fact.
(08:17:26) Notch: (he's right)
(08:17:31) Snakey: XCom would be so much awesome if developers could get decent usability done
(08:17:46) Stargoat: speaking of X-Com. JA2!
(08:17:57) Stargoat: I haven't been this addicted to a game in a long time.
(08:18:07) Stargoat: there's something magical about its brutal difficulty
(08:18:31) lemmer: lemma
(08:18:47) Stargoat: a weird twist of *it is actually quite an unfair game* and *if you mess up it is your own fault*
(08:19:17) eobet [eobet@c-3f4270d5.032-205-6b6c6d1.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(08:19:17) Dragonene: It is a great game
(08:19:18) mewse left the room (quit: Quit: mewse).
(08:19:22) Dragonene: I've never said otherwise
(08:19:38) Dragonene: Snakey: Funny that
(08:19:42) Drakkar: Mario Alliance
(08:19:45) Dragonene: I've never seen usability as a big issue in x-com
(08:19:48) Drakkar: a mario rts would be great
(08:19:56) Drakkar: er tbs
(08:20:06) Dragonene: would it?
(08:20:07) Dragonene: :S
(08:20:10) Drakkar: totally
(08:20:12) Dragonene: I'm not convinced.
(08:20:13) Stargoat: hmm
(08:20:13) Stargoat: maybe...
(08:20:28) Stargoat: I always thought Pokemon was the Nintendo franchise to tbt-i-fy
(08:20:29) Drakkar: I can imagine mario dragoon jumping an enemy hardcore style
(08:20:34) kevglass: mario tower defence?
(08:20:34) Dragonene: Yoshi would be too strong
(08:20:37) kevglass: mario match 3?
(08:20:58) kevglass: mario social sim? :)
(08:21:02) Dragonene: wasn't dr mario pretty much match 3
(08:21:07) kevglass: no!
(08:21:14) Stargoat: it feels like pokemon is missing a lot of tactical depth because you can only have one pokemon out at a time.
(08:21:16) kevglass: I just downloaded it for more DSi actually
(08:21:19) nyarla: mario vs donkey kong is sort of but not really but sort of rts, except platformer style
(08:21:28) Snakey: Dragonene: Compared to newer tactical games accessibility is still hard
(08:21:39) Dragonene: Snakey: Perhaps
(08:21:46) Dragonene: I still find x-com very playable tho
(08:21:48) Dragonene: even to this day
(08:21:49) Rock [Mibbit@5ED41DFD.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(08:21:53) Dragonene: which is remarkable
(08:22:06) kevglass: what you want is a nice rpg
(08:22:10) Dragonene: very few other games that old are still playable for me
(08:22:14) Drakkar: I still find ultima very playable
(08:22:19) Dragonene: zelda: a link to the past is one of the few I can think of
(08:22:20) Drule_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:22:26) Stargoat: brb
(08:22:27) Thi3f [thi3f@62-20-191-11-no30.tbcn.telia.com] entered the room.
(08:22:33) Drakkar: also a lovely shareware game called god of thunder
(08:22:35) Snakey: Dragonene: For sure, but you've played the game for a bit
(08:22:37) Dragonene: I guess also some of the other SNES rpgs - chrono trigger, ff6, seiken densetsu
(08:22:43) Snakey: imagine new people coming into the game
(08:22:53) Dragonene: Snakey: Well yes, but I showed it to a new friend a while ago
(08:22:53) Snakey: it's like playing Civ 1 after you've played something like Civ 4
(08:22:57) Dragonene: like 2 years or something
(08:23:01) Dragonene: and he was pretty hooked
(08:23:07) Snakey: I just get frustrated a lot.
(08:23:08) Rock is now known as Rock_D
(08:23:12) Drakkar: civ 2 was better!
(08:23:22) Snakey: Usually when a friend of mine tries it, he/she has no idea what to do
(08:23:25) fartron: alpha centauri was better
(08:23:33) Drakkar: except for game balance
(08:23:34) Drakkar: but
(08:23:36) Drakkar: thats ok
(08:23:39) Drakkar: it was still a great game
(08:23:44) FinDude [chatzilla@a91-153-165-32.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(08:23:49) Dragonene: my civ2 and alpha centauri disks *both* broke
(08:23:51) Dragonene: :'(
(08:23:55) Drakkar: wow
(08:24:00) Drakkar: I would be so angry
(08:24:01) Dragonene: they're the only 2 disks that have ever broken for me
(08:24:03) Dragonene: no, there's one more
(08:24:16) Dragonene: the last one was a demo cd from some swedish computer game magazine
(08:24:21) Drakkar: alpha centauri is one of three things I always keep tons of backups of
(08:24:24) Drakkar: hard and soft
(08:24:27) Dragonene: that had this awesome demo of a fish simulator
(08:24:31) Dragonene: you'd just swim around as a fish
(08:24:34) Drakkar: the other two are UO and planescape: torment
(08:24:35) Dragonene: it was a great game
(08:24:37) Dragonene: I've never found it since
(08:24:41) fartron: http://vimeo.com/4505537
(08:24:44) Drakkar: o_O
(08:24:46) Drakkar: that sounds cool
(08:24:55) Dragonene: It was
(08:25:03) Dragonene: You could play one of those fishes that blow themselves up
(08:25:07) Dragonene: and try to scare others away
(08:25:24) Dragonene: or you could play a small fish and go around chewing away at seaweed and corals
(08:25:27) lemmer: sounds like the Fish Simulator i used to play on the apple //e
(08:25:29) Dragonene: or larger fish eating other fish
(08:25:43) lemmer: although i guess any fish simulator would pretty much sound the same
(08:26:04) Dragonene: yeah well
(08:26:05) Drakkar: it was 2d?
(08:26:08) Dragonene: yeah
(08:26:10) Drakkar: hmmm
(08:26:12) Dragonene: I remember it being awesome
(08:26:13) Stargoat: back
(08:26:14) Dragonene: but who can tell
(08:26:16) Drakkar: this brings up a fun idea
(08:26:17) Dragonene: it might not be if I played it now
(08:28:25) Drule_ [Drule@c-4f66b803-74736162.cust.telenor.se] entered the room.
(08:28:46) Dragonene: that you won't talk abou
(08:28:47) Dragonene: about
(08:28:48) Dragonene: apparently
(08:29:14) nyarla: i never played Sim Ant, though i always wanted to... an ant sim could be cool. like these mining games, but with ants. \._./
(08:29:38) KareemK: yo
(08:29:55) fartron: sim ant was great but the actual winning conditions were too easy
(08:29:57) Stargoat: yo KK
(08:30:00) nyarla: yo
(08:30:03) Stargoat: what's up?
(08:30:05) Notch: hehe, sim ant was ok. =D
(08:30:08) fartron: if you tweaked your breeding right you could take over the house quickly
(08:30:13) Notch: stupid lawnmower
(08:30:14) Dragonene: theme park
(08:30:18) KareemK: playan guitae
(08:30:18) Dragonene: now that's a good tycoon game
(08:30:20) KareemK: playan guitar
(08:30:22) Dragonene: <3
(08:30:29) Dragonene: hi there kareem.
(08:31:00) KareemK: yo ene
(08:31:02) Drakkar: oh
(08:31:03) Drakkar: sorry
(08:31:12) Drakkar: 3d fish simulator
(08:31:12) Drakkar: :D
(08:31:16) Dragonene: that
(08:31:25) Dragonene: sounds like a 2d fish simulator
(08:31:32) Dragonene: only harder to make content for
(08:31:33) Dragonene: :D
(08:31:35) Drakkar: nah
(08:31:43) Dragonene: have you played that diving game they released for the wii?
(08:31:47) Drakkar: not necessarily at least
(08:31:48) Dragonene: something ocean I think
(08:31:50) Drakkar: nope
(08:31:51) nyarla: i was a terrible and stupid kid. when i was around 10 i went to a games shop for the first time ever, while on holiday. (there were none where i lived). i could've bought Sim Ant or Home Alone. guess which one i got. :(
(08:31:52) Dragonene: I haven't actually played it
(08:31:56) Dragonene: I'm wondering what it's like
(08:31:56) Drakkar: I was interested in it though
(08:32:02) Drakkar: as it looks pretty cool
(08:32:09) Dragonene: yeah
(08:32:10) Drakkar: for all the same reasons a 3d fish sim would be
(08:32:16) Dragonene: I can't motivate myself to buy a game like that
(08:32:18) nyarla: i've heard lots of good things about Endless Ocean
(08:32:18) Drakkar: HOLY SHIT WATER FISH EXPLORING
(08:32:24) Dragonene: because apparently it doesn't really have any goal
(08:32:29) Dragonene: endless ocean, right
(08:32:30) nyarla: good things along the lines of..not really a game, but a great chillout toy
(08:32:35) Dragonene: yeah
(08:32:41) Dragonene: I can't bring myself to buy a chillout toy.
(08:32:47) Dragonene: but I'd like to try it nonetheless
(08:33:29) C418: http://www.mdr.de/sachsen/chemnitz/6369866.html

(08:34:19) C418: er. wrong channel
(08:34:24) C418: but interesting for the german people
(08:34:25) C418: thats my town
(08:34:39) Drule_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:34:53) KareemK: guten tag
(08:34:54) C418: they've found a bomb from ww2 in a river
(08:35:03) KareemK: ich bin deutsch
(08:35:04) C418: and now our town gets half evacuated
(08:35:07) Bigger|working is now known as Bigger
(08:35:15) Bigger: damnit damnit damnit
(08:35:24) Drakkar: rofl
(08:35:25) Drakkar: wow
(08:35:25) C418: 250kg bomb
(08:35:28) C418: impressive
(08:35:35) Drakkar: that must be so weird
(08:35:41) C418: well, it's kind of nice
(08:35:44) C418: no school today
(08:35:44) C418: :D
(08:35:45) Drakkar: was it like
(08:35:50) Drakkar: obviously there
(08:35:50) Bigger: I sat here for maybe 20 minutes recording something improv and it turns out that only 5 minutes was recorded, and of that, only the first minute or so is actually anything, the rest is just static
(08:35:52) Drakkar: or dug in
(08:36:16) KareemK: ninjam day
(08:36:22) Drakkar: as I can't say I trust my german enough to read a news article (despite being born there)
(08:36:23) C418: it was obviously there
(08:36:26) Dragonene: C418: oO
(08:36:26) C418: in the river
(08:36:28) Drakkar: that's kind of funny
(08:36:49) Drakkar: makes you wonder how many kids would consider throwing rocks at it...:P
(08:36:55) Dragonene: Bigger: Aw :S
(08:37:15) Bigger: ugh I am going to get some ice-cream
(08:37:18) Dragonene: hm
(08:37:22) Dragonene: I want to get some icecream too
(08:37:26) Dragonene: maybe I will, in a bit,
(08:37:26) C418: well, a hobby fisherman found it
(08:37:53) Dragonene: huh
(08:37:56) Dragonene: german is hard :P
(08:38:05) C418: now they drain the river and try to get that bomb out
(08:38:14) C418: the link wasn't supposed to be here :D
(08:38:15) Drakkar: rofl
(08:38:31) Drakkar: I can speak german
(08:38:37) KareemK: why did they evacuate the town
(08:38:43) Drakkar: but my memory of german in a written fashion is shakey at best anymore
(08:38:45) Drakkar: -e
(08:38:46) KareemK: did they think it was an abomb
(08:39:10) KareemK: its funny how many people in western countries know german
(08:39:14) C418: well, they evacuate about 1000 meters from the bomb
(08:39:23) KareemK: its a very peculiar language to know around here
(08:39:27) Dragonene: Nach dem Fund einer Fliegerbombe im Fluss Chemnitz an der Fu?g?ngerbr?cke Br?ckenstra?e/ Schlo?stra?e bereitet die Stadt in 1.000 Metern Umkreis die Evakuierung vor. <-- Something they found a flight bomb in Something Chemnitz and the pedestrian pier pier street / something street something the city in a 1000 meter perimeter had to be evacuated...
(08:39:30) Dragonene: Ack, I can't do it!
(08:39:36) KareemK: or was at least
(08:39:41) C418: it's an aircraft bomb as far as I know
(08:39:54) KareemK: now they have abitur schools and a german university
(08:39:55) Dragonene: yes, it clearly says so
(08:39:57) Dragonene: fliegerbombe
(08:40:05) Dragonene: See how awesome my german is
(08:40:11) C418: pretty decent
(08:40:12) Drule_ [Drule@c-4f66b803-74736162.cust.telenor.se] entered the room.
(08:40:16) Dragonene: Well
(08:40:22) Dragonene: Given that I've never studied german anyway
(08:40:24) Dragonene: :P
(08:40:28) C418: it's enough for yout to find out what is writen there
(08:40:34) Dragonene: I'm just going by similarity to swedish words
(08:40:40) Dragonene: I wouldn't understand a word of swedish language
(08:40:41) Dragonene: uh
(08:40:48) Dragonene: I wouldn't understand a word of spoken language*
(08:40:54) Dragonene: I *would* understand swedish :D
(08:41:11) C418: the t of written sticks on you
(08:41:15) C418: yes.
(08:41:18) Dragonene: is "Fu?g?ngerbr?cke" "pedestrian pier" or something such?
(08:41:21) C418: yeah
(08:41:24) Dragonene: I'm so awesome
(08:41:32) Drakkar: they're similar languages
(08:41:36) KareemK: fuss
(08:41:40) C418: foot
(08:41:40) Drakkar: dutch is too
(08:41:41) KareemK: = foot
(08:41:43) Dragonene: "Fotg?ngarbrygga" would be the swedish equivalent
(08:41:46) Dragonene: but you'd never actually say that
(08:41:48) Dragonene: it makes no sense
(08:41:51) Dragonene: I just constructed that word.
(08:42:04) Drakkar: its how german rolls
(08:42:04) Dragonene: You'd just say "brygga"
(08:42:13) Drakkar: want to know what a speaker is in german?
(08:42:22) Dragonene: go
(08:42:25) Drakkar: it translates to loud thing :D
(08:42:35) Drakkar: lautzeug I think though I can't guarantee my spelling or grammar
(08:42:37) Dragonene: KareemK: g?nger = walker
(08:42:44) Dragonene: roughly.
(08:42:46) Dragonene: Is my guess :D
(08:42:57) Drakkar: airplanes are just flying things
(08:43:01) Drakkar: vacuums are dustsuckers
(08:43:03) C418: speaker? lautsprecher
(08:43:07) Drakkar: ah there we go
(08:43:07) Dragonene: oh you meant that sort of speaker
(08:43:12) Drakkar: yeah
(08:43:14) Dragonene: well
(08:43:15) C418: back translated would be loud-talker
(08:43:16) KareemK: i remember a verb like that existing in french
(08:43:16) Dragonene: it's the same as in english
(08:43:20) Drakkar: yeaaaaaaah
(08:43:25) KareemK: cant remember what it meant
(08:43:29) Dragonene: because speaker is just short for loud speaker
(08:43:30) Dragonene: isn't it?
(08:43:37) C418: yeah
(08:43:41) Drakkar: more or less yeah
(08:43:42) C418: suppose?
(08:43:44) KareemK: my fav german words
(08:43:49) KareemK: Handy
(08:43:49) KareemK: and Beamer
(08:43:51) Drakkar: that's because german and english share roots as well
(08:43:51) Dragonene: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loud_speaker
(08:43:52) Drakkar: :P
(08:44:03) Dragonene: Yeah, english is a mixture of germanic and latin languages
(08:44:04) Drakkar: its fun to see how languages fit together
(08:44:05) C418: yeah, it's hard for us germans to say mobile phone
(08:44:09) C418: we always just say handy
(08:44:14) Dragonene: mobiltelefon!
(08:44:16) Dragonene: or just "mobil"
(08:44:18) Dragonene: in swedish.
(08:44:26) Dragonene: be back in a bit
(08:44:29) KareemK: we say mobile in arabic
(08:44:30) ***Dragonene goes to fetch laundry
(08:44:34) KareemK: or ma7mool
(08:44:39) KareemK: in egypt
(08:44:45) fartron: cell phone is a brilliant piece of marketing
(08:44:54) fartron: it sounds like self phone or self own
(08:44:57) KareemK: in more frenchie arab places they call it "cellulaire"
(08:45:11) C418: cellulaire is nice
(08:45:11) C418: :D
(08:45:26) Drakkar: cullalaire makes me think of a tiny voltaire that you talk into
(08:45:28) KareemK: not sure of spelling
(08:45:29) Drakkar: which makes me giggle
(08:46:16) C418: is jsticker checking out berlin currently? or did you already?
(08:46:51) KareemK: no handys are allowed in german fascist botschaft
(08:47:10) C418: because they're fascist
(08:47:10) KareemK: the security guy made me turn it off
(08:49:28) Dragonene: back
(08:49:29) Dragonene: btw
(08:49:36) Dragonene: the swedish word for speaker is "h?gtalare"
(08:49:45) Dragonene: which means "high-speaker"
(08:49:49) C418: talare?
(08:49:55) Dragonene: yeah, talare = speaker
(08:49:59) KareemK: nobody cares about your shitty language
(08:50:00) Dragonene: same word as talk
(08:50:03) Dragonene: "talker" I guess
(08:50:05) KareemK: its "germanic"
(08:50:12) KareemK: which means shittier than german
(08:50:17) KareemK: unless its english
(08:50:20) C418: ah, I always thought swedish is a weird mix of german english and something different
(08:50:34) Dragonene: we don't have one distinct word for loud, so we say "h?gljudd", which means "high-sounding" or something such
(08:50:46) Notch: C418: What was the link to your music again?
(08:50:50) Dragonene: and the latter part is cut off when used in speaker
(08:50:53) KareemK: actually i doubt many languages can be worse than german
(08:50:55) C418: it's c418.org
(08:50:58) Dragonene: C418: Nah, swedish is just a germanic language
(08:51:01) C418: just click on the music button up there
(08:51:04) KareemK: from the rediculous pronouncations
(08:51:07) Dragonene: KareemK: What's with the assault
(08:51:10) C418: oh well, that explains it
(08:51:17) KareemK: to the "Sie" pronoun
(08:51:23) C418: germanic has pretty much every european language a some point
(08:51:41) KareemK: Dragonene: i have a hate-hate relationship with german
(08:51:43) Dragonene: huh
(08:51:49) KareemK: i love you swedish folks
(08:51:57) Dragonene: KareemK: So why are you going to germany? :D
(08:52:01) Dragonene: You are, aren't you=
(08:52:02) Dragonene: ?
(08:52:09) KareemK: yea
(08:52:14) KareemK: i meant the language
(08:52:15) C418: eurotig, dragonene
(08:52:19) KareemK: not the people
(08:52:23) KareemK: hopefully i wont have to speak it
(08:52:33) C418: we germans will try to help you
(08:52:35) Cait|Asleep is now known as Cait
(08:52:38) C418: but berlin is pretty international
(08:52:56) C418: often english besides german
(08:53:00) Stargoat: this damn banana isn't loaded.
(08:53:03) jsticker: Berlin tomorrow, C418
(08:53:25) Rock_D [Mibbit@5ED41DFD.cable.ziggo.nl] entered the room.
(08:53:27) Dragonene: C418: I gave that song a listen
(08:53:28) fartron: germans speak english but they're also racist
(08:53:35) Dragonene: you're right, the latter part is a better fit than the first part.
(08:53:51) Dragonene: Racists speak english, but they're also german?
(08:53:59) KareemK: 2010.. africatig in kairo
(08:54:00) Dragonene: Uh, what?
(08:54:00) ArneLurk: any franceman here?
(08:54:00) fartron: sometimes
(08:54:04) KareemK: although its not very african
(08:54:19) C418: germany isn't racist. half germany is not german
(08:54:21) fartron: i would love to go to cairo
(08:54:33) fartron: then why is there a turkish underclass
(08:54:35) ArneLurk: There' a term in french for someone who is arrogant/brutally honest, heard of it?
(08:54:35) Dragonene: C418: I never said that
(08:54:44) Dragonene: oh wait
(08:54:47) Dragonene: fartron did
(08:54:48) Dragonene: never mind
(08:54:49) Dragonene: me
(08:54:49) KareemK: actually anyone of you guys pop to cairo at anytime
(08:55:03) KareemK: we'll party
(08:55:04) Dragonene: ArneLurk: "Rak" :D
(08:55:08) KareemK: city never sleeps
(08:55:14) KareemK: by euro standards anyways
(08:55:21) KareemK: and i dont mean people party at night
(08:56:00) KareemK: i mean you can go get all kinds of food at 1 am
(08:56:05) KareemK: they also party of course
(08:56:38) KareemK: most stores open to midnight
(08:57:01) KareemK: in summer heavy traffic wears off at 2am or so
(08:57:12) KareemK: so its kinda shitty. but very lively
(08:57:29) fartron: i want to smoke hash and hang out at a hookah bar
(08:57:49) KareemK: you can do that at any time of day really
(08:57:53) KareemK: abundance of both
(08:57:57) fartron: excellent
(08:58:23) fartron: there is a hookah bar near my house but i am intimidated since all the dudes there seem to know each other
(08:58:28) fartron: also no hash
(08:59:06) KareemK: heh hookah bar is funny words
(08:59:07) fartron: there are a couple of more accessible hookah bars in town, but this one seems more the genuine thing
(08:59:11) KareemK: we call them "ahwa"
(08:59:19) KareemK: which means coffee
(08:59:26) fartron: so it's just like a cafe
(08:59:29) KareemK: yea
(09:00:01) fartron: i guess hookah cafe doesn't sound as good
(09:00:13) KareemK: turkish-style coffee and tea are main beverages
(09:00:51) fartron: i love turkish coffee
(09:00:58) KareemK: yea
(09:01:04) KareemK: italian shit seems sissy
(09:01:11) KareemK: the starbucks italian variety anyways
(09:01:20) KareemK: also... nescafe
(09:01:41) KareemK: both are undrinkable for me
(09:01:54) fartron: i had good coffee in italy and in spain
(09:02:07) Rock_D: starbucks's iced coffee things are pretty good
(09:02:10) fartron: they all do the espresso roast thing
(09:02:20) KareemK: yea i generally like ice stuff

(09:14:13) Stargoat: consisted*
(09:14:31) KareemK: i actually play off a save like 5 mins before they attack me
(09:14:46) KareemK: maybe more
(09:14:54) Stargoat: perhaps the mistake you made was before that
(09:14:56) KareemK: but i cant seem to be able to defend it right

(09:15:13) KareemK: wanna give the save a try?
(09:15:20) KareemK: SC puzzle :P
(09:15:25) Stargoat: build 3-4 bunkers around the front of your base
(09:15:34) Stargoat: with 6-8 or more tanks behind there
(09:15:55) Stargoat: a couple of missile turrets
(09:16:02) Stargoat: and a squadron of wraiths
(09:16:16) Stargoat: that should be enough to tackle most shit the enemy will throw at you
(09:16:42) KareemK: i have most of that stuff
(09:16:45) Stargoat: hmm
(09:16:46) KareemK: except the wraith
(09:16:52) KareemK: i have a battlecruiser
(09:16:52) Stargoat: is air an issue?
(09:17:13) Stargoat: are you getting locked down or something?
(09:17:14) KareemK: they attack in two waves
(09:17:28) KareemK: one has like.. 4 goliaths + 4 tanks
(09:17:40) KareemK: this wipes out most of my land shit

(10:20:18) fartronomicon: and they were dope
(10:20:46) nihilocrat: there seem to be a fair amount of videos out
(10:21:05) nihilocrat: is there a public download, or is Notch just nice and let a lot of people beta test?
(10:21:21) fartronomicon: it's web based
(10:21:26) Notch: and the alpha test hit indiegamer, heh
(10:21:37) Notch: so I've gone open, and I've decided to think it's a good thing, hehe
(10:22:27) KareemK: notch seems to have made the ultimate indie game with minecraft
(10:22:33) KareemK: and i havent even played it yet
(10:22:39) lemmer left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:22:45) Stargoat: that video was awesome, fartron
(10:22:52) Stargoat: too bad you lost all that work :|
(10:22:54) nihilocrat: oh cool, runs in browser
(10:23:25) SlayerXL [Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(10:23:29) fartronomicon: i had a lot more to do
(10:23:31) lemmer [lemmer@ip68-228-223-17.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(10:23:41) fartronomicon: so i'll just do it over when i can save
(10:23:42) SlayerXL: HENSHIN A GO-GO, BABY!
(10:23:53) SlayerXL: :|
(10:24:01) SlayerXL: stupid disconnect
(10:24:15) SlayerXL: Notch, are you condering a standalone version?
(10:24:30) jeb left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:24:55) Fraeon left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:24:59) Notch: yes, SlayerXL.
(10:25:08) Dragonene: slayerxl = stargoat btw
(10:25:12) SlayerXL: yeah
(10:25:27) Notch: I'm starting with the most difficult version, though. =)
(10:25:35) SlayerXL: my internets have been playing up today. "This'll show em", they thought "I've worked it all out"
(10:25:57) Stargoat left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:26:01) SlayerXL is now known as Stargoat
(10:26:40) Stargoat: will the gameplay extend past the general sandboxy thing you have going? general objectives?
(10:26:42) paul|not left the room.
(10:27:24) Notch: wow, atmosphir looks pretty fun too
(10:27:50) Notch: Stargoat: Yes, I'm mostly looking forward to cooperative survival mode
(10:27:54) Dragonene: http://x2d.org/categories/daily-sketches/ there we go
(10:28:03) Stargoat: survival... survival against what?
(10:28:09) Notch: monsters, the environment. =)
(10:28:30) Notch: think dwarf fortress light, in 3d, where you control just one person, in multiplayer
(10:28:39) Stargoat: hmm
(10:29:19) Notch: I'll keep creative mode as one game mode. You can coop in there as well
(10:29:24) nihilocrat: LOVE without the hype
(10:29:26) nihilocrat: do ho ho
(10:29:35) Stargoat: don't put too much shit in, now :). I think part os minecraft's charm is in its simplicity. That being said, I'm of the believe that simple goals in sandbox games are a good idea, even if just as a reference point.
(10:29:36) Siiseli: durrhurrhurr
(10:29:42) Notch: I can't find LOVE online... got an url?
(10:29:42) Stargoat: part of*
(10:29:55) Siiseli: Notch, it's not done yet
(10:29:56) jeb [khaile@193.108.42.5] entered the room.
(10:29:59) Stargoat: http://www.quelsolaar.com/
(10:30:03) Siiseli: apparwently
(10:30:06) Stargoat: that's LOVE's page
(10:30:13) nihilocrat: wow, that's really nice pixel work
(10:30:17) Notch: Stargoat: When I played infiniminer, I wanted an actual game based on those mechanics. So I'm definitely going to try putting too much shit in. =)
(10:30:39) Stargoat: :|
(10:30:41) Dragonene: nihilocrat: notch's, love (love has no pixels dammit) or mine?
(10:30:43) Dragonene: :P
(10:30:50) nihilocrat: yours
(10:30:54) Dragonene: why thanks. :)
(10:31:02) Dragonene: I don't really agree... but I'm learning! :)
(10:31:15) Notch: Stargoat: But I'm not taking out creative mode. =)
(10:31:24) Stargoat: hmm...
(10:31:33) Notch: worst case, survival mode ends up my version of the DF roguelike. ;)
(10:31:33) Sos` [Sos@err64.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl] entered the room.
(10:31:44) Stargoat: well, I'm sure it'll turn out awesome either way.
(10:32:14) Notch: i want to give it a shot. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But I do appreciate the feedback.
(10:32:29) Sos left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:32:42) Notch: i'm not going to let it turn into the grindfest of most mmorpgs
(10:32:57) Notch: a single survival game should be a fairly quick paced deal
(10:33:04) Stargoat: hmm
(10:33:18) Stargoat: have you considered persistant-world gameplay?
(10:33:29) Notch: yes, you will be able to save your map and come back to it later
(10:34:43) Stargoat: do you, by chance have a design document of some sort for it?
(10:34:53) Notch: in my head, yes.
(10:34:54) ***kevglass waits for the napkin to be scanned.
(10:34:57) Stargoat: ah.
(10:35:08) Notch: there's a list of ideas in a txt file
(10:35:38) Notch: i won't say I don't believe in design docs, but they're useless. ;)
(10:35:44) Stargoat: kevglass: The napkin is to the game developer like the sword is to the knight
(10:35:58) ***kevglass grins
(10:36:10) kevglass: I'm a fan of the text file checked into svn
(10:36:12) Notch: love looks amazing
(10:36:22) kevglass: mark complete with a dash
(10:36:24) Stargoat: LOVE looks incredibly complex.
(10:36:26) Notch: haha, yes. =D
(10:36:45) Stargoat: I'm quite excited about it, but there's a lot of hype behind it.
(10:36:49) Stargoat: which is never good.
(10:36:58) fartronomicon: the guy also is full of himself
(10:37:00) fartronomicon: which isn't good
(10:37:05) Stargoat: no, that's awesome.
(10:37:18) Stargoat: farton needs to re-adjust his awesome-o-metre
(10:37:21) Stargoat: oh man
(10:37:28) Stargoat: my typing is crap tonight
(10:37:29) Stargoat: :|
(10:37:36) Stargoat: fartron*
(10:37:43) dom: I have a give-a-damn-o-meter, does that help?
(10:37:45) jeb left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:37:49) Stargoat: yes.
(10:38:02) ***kevglass taps the gague, does it ever move?
(10:38:09) kevglass: gauge.
(10:38:21) dom: it's normally rock bottom
(10:38:34) kevglass: sounds heavy.
(10:38:44) dom: it takes a lot to make it move, see
(10:39:00) kevglass: what you want is an exciting game to play
(10:39:04) kevglass: to make you care
(10:39:12) Stargoat: how does Starcraft II register on the give-a-damn-o-metre?
(10:39:13) kevglass: maybe where you could modify the terrain or something?>
(10:39:25) dom: yes, especially as playing Mario or GTA on my DS just makes me want to hit things with an axe
(10:40:01) Stargoat: ...what was that in response to?
(10:40:18) nihilocrat: the first gameplay videos of Starcraft 2 were really underwhelming for me
(10:40:31) nihilocrat: it seemed like an expansion with some major engine differences but that's it
(10:40:44) dom: sorry, I thought kevglass was asking me; I apologise
(10:40:49) nihilocrat: like, there's some protoss unit that can go from high to low terrain and vice versa, but it's a walker
(10:41:01) Stargoat: hmm
(10:41:06) nihilocrat: the rest just seems like more of the same
(10:41:07) nihilocrat: just new units
(10:41:16) Stargoat: well, it's hard to deny that
(10:41:20) kevglass: I was asking you dom
(10:41:24) Dragonene: poll: should i change the post
(10:41:29) Dragonene: to have 2x scaled images instead?
(10:41:42) dom: oh right, gotcha
(10:41:59) Stargoat: but I think it's hard to find fault with that... Starcraft is a great game, with a few major flaws. It seems they're ironing (most) of them out. I don't think many people would want StarCom Commander II.
(10:42:07) nihilocrat: I think it's pretty good as-is but, you know, whatever you want
(10:42:17) Dragonene: somebody else suggested 2x
(10:42:28) dom: I shoudl try Starcraft
(10:42:31) dom: *should
(10:42:36) nihilocrat: yeah, it just feels lame if you play a game and it feels almost just like a game from 10 years ago
(10:42:40) nihilocrat: however
(10:42:49) nihilocrat: I'm sure they're adding all sorts of interface improvements
(10:42:49) Stargoat: I dunno. Nostalgia is a pretty powerful thing.
(10:42:50) nihilocrat: and such
(10:42:59) Notch: i love the graphics in love, but the gameplay looks kinda.. dull
(10:43:07) Stargoat: plus, the map editor is particularly exciting for me.
(10:43:08) dom: I really wanted to play C&C when they released the free version, but I couldn't get it to work.
(10:43:31) fartronomicon: yeah, love does look dull which is why the dude being so full of himself isn't awesome
(10:44:07) michael [michael@71-20-146-50.war.clearwire-wmx.net] entered the room.
(10:44:23) Stargoat: I think love would benefit from some other combat-esq mechanic that isn't shmupping
(10:44:47) Stargoat: shooting things in a game with that sort of atmoshphere doesn't seem right...
(10:44:56) kevglass: you want to hug them to death?
(10:45:07) fartronomicon: i want to outsmart them
(10:45:13) Stargoat: hmm
(10:45:24) Stargoat: <fartronomicon> i want to outsmart them <-- yes, this.
(10:45:48) Dragonene: huh
(10:45:57) Dragonene: I just made the images clickable
(10:46:00) Dragonene: "click for 2x scale"
(10:46:03) Dragonene: is that acceptable?
(10:46:11) fartronomicon: what are you talking about
(10:46:19) Siiseli: 17:45 < Stargoat> <fartronomicon> i want to outsmart them <-- yes, this. <- correctamundo
(10:46:43) Stargoat: what would you put in the place of shooting, fartron?
(10:47:05) Siiseli: traps
(10:47:07) fartronomicon: you can leave in shooting if the outcome of the battles is more influenced by grand strategy or at least intricate tactisc
(10:47:14) fartronomicon: than it is by twitching
(10:47:24) Siiseli: I'd like smashing things with a sword in minecraft
(10:47:36) Lakmir [Lakmir@c-71-192-107-195.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:47:37) Stargoat: hmm.
(10:48:01) nihilocrat: though in MMOs most combat is decided by skullduggery
(10:48:04) Notch: I want bows and arrows =D
(10:48:14) nihilocrat: bringing more people to the fight, and keeping some of them hidden
(10:48:15) Dragonene: no
(10:48:16) Dragonene: blowdarts
(10:48:16) Stargoat: I guess it's too early to say where the balance lies.
(10:48:19) Dragonene: We need blowdarts!
(10:48:20) Notch: real, physics based arrows
(10:48:25) Notch: aim far above your target
(10:48:30) Dragonene: No. Real, physics-based blowdarts!
(10:48:33) Dragonene: They're way superior
(10:48:39) Notch: heh. =D
(10:48:41) Notch: maybe-pile!
(10:48:43) nihilocrat: real, physics-based trebuchet
(10:48:45) Notch: and now I go home
(10:48:46) Stargoat: real, physics-based Blackmail
(10:48:47) Notch: ooh yes
(10:48:48) nihilocrat: you fling people at them
(10:48:49) Dragonene: ciao notch
(10:48:50) Dragonene: haha
(10:48:51) Dragonene: blackmail
(10:48:53) Dragonene: <3
(10:48:53) Notch: =D
(10:48:54) nihilocrat: or, okay, just plain old rocks
(10:48:57) Notch left the room (quit: Quit: *thud*).
(10:48:57) Stargoat: later, notch
(10:49:03) Siiseli: real, physics based physics
(10:49:10) fartronomicon: in love i would think the contents and arrangement of your town/city should influence your side
(10:49:11) Dragonene: real, physics-based reality
(10:49:13) nihilocrat: real, physics based physicists
(10:49:24) fartronomicon: maybe objective based conditions so that the combat isn't the main focus
(10:49:27) fartronomicon: but a means to an end
(10:49:27) Dragonene: real, physics based physicians
(10:49:28) lemmer: http://www00.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How%20many%20roads%20must%20a%20man%20walk%20down%20before%20you%20can%20call%20him%20a%20man
(10:49:33) lemmer: apologies if everyone has seen this
(10:49:37) lemmer: apologies.
(10:49:52) fartronomicon: i think i know what the answer will be
(10:50:00) Stargoat: I think intelligence-based gameplay would fit nicely in LOVE
(10:50:03) fartronomicon: because wolfram is a nerd
(10:50:05) Stargoat: understand the enemy city
(10:50:06) Stargoat: how it works
(10:50:09) Stargoat: then crush it
(10:50:11) Stargoat: like an ant
(10:50:24) Siiseli: haha lemmer :D
(10:50:24) kevglass: a physical ant?
(10:50:32) nihilocrat: this is neat : http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/05/login_2009_keynote_gaming_in_t.html
(10:50:34) fartronomicon: yeah, traps would be good
(10:50:36) Stargoat: a real, physics based, physical ant.
(10:50:38) nihilocrat: the part about videogames is a ways down
(10:50:42) fartronomicon: if you know the enemy city you can bypass them
(10:50:56) nihilocrat: theoretically that's what LOVE is trying to do
(10:51:05) nihilocrat: with its complicated infrastructure stuff
(10:51:16) fartronomicon: but it doesn't seem to influence anything
(10:51:18) fartronomicon: from what i've seen
(10:52:16) Stargoat: hmm
(10:52:32) Stargoat: I think it's an issue of balance
(10:52:52) fartronomicon: i think it's an issue of feng shui
(10:53:01) Stargoat: all of this great machinery, cool, awesome... but if it's easier for a player to win with twitch reflexes, it has failed.
(10:53:54) Stargoat: maybe.
(10:53:56) Stargoat: I dunno!
(10:53:58) Stargoat: too early to say.
(10:54:34) Jrsquee [Mibbit@70-90-110-37-ma-ne.hfc.comcastbusiness.net] entered the room.
(10:55:46) nihilocrat: I'd argue, yeah
(10:56:01) Stargoat: I think a good example of open-ended-dullness is in FarCry. Sure, the player can attack an objective in any way they want, but the outcome is always the same... so there's no real incentive to be inventive with their tactics.
(10:56:02) nihilocrat: otherwise it all feels pointless
(10:56:06) nihilocrat: kind of like in Gate 88 ...
(10:56:16) nihilocrat: the ultimate winning strategy was missile turret spam
(10:56:19) Stargoat: heh
(10:56:28) Stargoat: I liked Gate88 until people cheesed it
(10:56:36) nihilocrat: you just fly by the weakest spot and dump like 50 missile turrets
(10:56:37) lemmer: antipope
(10:56:49) Stargoat: it was fun flinging bombs into the enemy base from afar with mass driver turrets.
(10:57:14) nihilocrat: yeah the game became a very twitch-oriented game when you realized it was mainly about churning out turrets and such as fast as possible instead of resource / building management
(10:57:18) Dragonene: oh hey
(10:57:19) Dragonene: Stargoat: 
(10:57:21) Dragonene: I have this great idea
(10:57:22) nihilocrat: I think that's why I don't like the end-games of most RTSes
(10:57:24) Stargoat: oh?
(10:57:29) Dragonene: ...you could go play X-Com!
(10:57:31) Dragonene: \o/
(10:57:33) Stargoat: :|!
(10:57:34) nihilocrat: haha
(10:57:35) Stargoat: I will
(10:57:41) Stargoat: when I'm done with JA2
(10:57:43) Stargoat: and study shit
(10:57:49) Dragonene: because that'll happen
(10:57:52) Dragonene: anytime soon :P
(10:57:54) KnifeNovicePyl left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:58:01) Dragonene: speaking of studying
(10:58:09) Stargoat: JA2 is hard. But I am determined to defeat it. With a knife. On a night mission.
(10:58:12) Dragonene: I need to get up in like 7 hours and I still have stuff to do
(10:58:20) Dragonene: so uh
(10:58:23) Stargoat: later.
(10:58:25) Stargoat: ?
(10:58:25) ***Dragonene goes back to studies
(10:58:32) Dragonene: yeah, ciao.
(10:59:26) fartronomicon: adiablo
(11:00:18) nihilocrat: if I move to Montreal I have to learn some french... I think it's one of the ugliest European languages in existence
(11:00:29) MisterX [MisterX@p5DDE6A67.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(11:00:30) Dragonene: I'm reading this article written about kevin rudd about the financial crisis
(11:00:33) nihilocrat: I think I'm just really annoyed that you only pronounce half of a word as it's written
(11:00:47) Stargoat: what's it say, Dragonene?
(11:00:50) fartronomicon: it's really one of the more beautiful languages to hear
(11:01:00) fartronomicon: partially because they obsessively control it
(11:01:35) fartronomicon: they keep it from evolving because they love it so much
(11:01:41) Stargoat: heh
(11:02:34) Dragonene: Stargoat: basically that neo-liberalism is bad and social democracy good
(11:02:44) Dragonene: ...unexpectedly
(11:02:56) Dragonene: He does make a pretty convincing argument though.
(11:03:02) Dragonene: It's just very long.
(11:03:03) Siiseli: I in fact like how french sounds
(11:03:12) Stargoat: linky?
(11:03:15) nihilocrat: hmm quebecois sounds like a sort of angry baby-talk french
(11:03:16) nihilocrat: MARDE
(11:03:20) nihilocrat: viaaaarge
(11:03:20) Lunaway is now known as Lunar
(11:03:36) fartronomicon: don't go to montreal nihil
(11:03:40) fartronomicon: or you will be mocked as a canadian
(11:03:40) nihilocrat: yesss
(11:03:46) nihilocrat: big whoop
(11:03:52) nihilocrat: I will just speak in a southern accent
(11:03:56) nihilocrat: perhaps they will be confused
(11:03:58) nihilocrat: or just make even more fun of me
(11:04:07) fartronomicon: you should lay it on thick
(11:04:09) Stargoat: speak in a NZ accent.
(11:04:24) nihilocrat: HEY YALL GOT ANY GRITS HEAR?
(11:04:27) nihilocrat: MERCY BOOCUPS
(11:04:33) Snakey: Aren't you from Australia Stargoat?
(11:04:37) Stargoat: yes.
(11:04:41) Dragonene: http://www.themonthly.com.au/node/1421
(11:04:49) Stargoat: what of it?
(11:04:53) Snakey: So ... don't you speak like an Aussie then?
(11:04:59) Dragonene: It's... long tho
(11:05:02) Stargoat: I guess?
(11:05:08) fartronomicon: do you know the flight of the conchords where the guy is racist to them because he thinks they're australian
(11:05:11) Stargoat: Dragonene, do I speak like an "aussie"?
(11:05:18) Snakey: So why would you say you would speak like an New Zealander then?
(11:05:19) fartronomicon: and they demonstrate the difference between nz and au accents
(11:05:21) Dragonene: ...I guess?
(11:05:23) Dragonene: :D
(11:05:30) Stargoat: I don't. I was suggesting nihil does.
(11:05:36) Stargoat: or, should.
(11:05:41) Snakey: I can tell the difference between Au and Nz
(11:05:51) Dragonene: It's not very easy to tell the difference between english dialects/accents for me
(11:05:58) Dragonene: Since I'm not a native speaker
(11:06:02) Stargoat: oh
(11:06:06) Stargoat: fair enough
(11:06:08) Dragonene: I can, but I'm not great at it
(11:06:12) nihilocrat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AYLx3Kr7UE&feature=related
(11:06:14) nihilocrat: haha
(11:06:18) Dragonene: I also hear all of them now and then, you know
(11:06:19) shinygerbil: how about a nice South African accent?
(11:06:24) Dragonene: which means they're sort of mixed up
(11:06:29) nihilocrat: I can't understand a word but it does sound like a kind of messed up french
(11:06:30) Dragonene: I live with americans here for example
(11:06:36) Dragonene: but everybody outside the village speaks aussie
(11:06:39) Stargoat: south african... i'd recognise it, but I don't think I can immitate it.
(11:06:45) shinygerbil: heh
(11:07:05) fartronomicon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_rXxi0zhM
(11:07:13) nihilocrat: yeah it sounds kind of like French Ebonics
(11:07:29) nihilocrat: even though I bet there's actually "French Ebonics" of some kind
(11:07:37) nihilocrat: there's a sort of "black folks" accent in German
(11:07:44) nihilocrat: it's very strange to me

(11:08:17) fartronomicon: i really enjoy french hip hop
(11:08:28) Stargoat: haha
(11:08:43) Stargoat: I really enjoy Mr. Oizo, but I don't know why.
(11:10:49) shinygerbil: good times with GGPO. Street Fighter 3 is awesome
(11:11:02) fartronomicon: did anyone see banlieue 13 
(11:11:20) fartronomicon: the david belle movie
(11:11:24) shinygerbil: i saw bits of it through the projectionist's window :P
(11:11:38) fartronomicon: it's pretty good
(11:11:51) shinygerbil: yeah, looked ok
(11:12:18) fartronomicon: good music too
(11:12:50) jsticker: shinygerbil, cut penisses into the movies
(11:13:05) shinygerbil: :o
(11:13:07) shinygerbil: how?
(11:13:09) shinygerbil: o_O
(11:13:10) fartronomicon: like tyler durden
(11:13:17) shinygerbil: oh, splice
(11:13:31) shinygerbil: i though you meant, like, cut a penis-shaped hole out of a frame of film
(11:13:40) jsticker: Good thinking, though
(11:13:42) Stargoat: you should do that too
(11:13:50) shinygerbil: one frame is very noticeable despite what that film says
(11:13:51) kevglass left the room (quit: Quit: My damn controlling terminal disappeared!).
(11:14:14) shinygerbil: in fact, i keep meaning to watch that film again, now I can relate to it :P
(11:14:15) jsticker: Yeah, I think so too
(11:14:24) Stargoat: I need to see it again...
(11:14:28) fartronomicon: do you have those antipiracy numbers in the frames gerbil
(11:14:34) fartronomicon: because i see those all the time
(11:14:38) fartronomicon: and they're one framme
(11:14:45) shinygerbil: yeah I think we do
(11:15:01) shinygerbil: we got pirated once and they traced it back to us :D
(11:15:07) jsticker: :O
(11:15:10) shinygerbil: our cinema that is
(11:15:13) fartronomicon: i hate that shit because sometimes it's in a good scene and it totally pulls me out of the movie
(11:15:14) shinygerbil: some customer
(11:15:28) jsticker: I don't go to the cinema very often
(11:15:38) shinygerbil: one thing fight club does get right, is the cigarette burns on each reel
(11:15:44) jsticker: Last time was in november, and before that I hadn't gone for 3 or 5 years
(11:15:44) shinygerbil: they're also very noticeable
(11:15:53) jsticker: Yeah
(11:16:21) shinygerbil: film only goes at 24fps anyway
(11:18:11) nihilocrat: "
(11:18:12) nihilocrat:     Eventually you'll learn the accent - basically, speak out your nose. "Oui" becomes "Waeh", "toujours" becomes "taujoaures"... it's fun."
(11:18:18) nihilocrat: waaeh
(11:18:25) nihilocrat: I heard that in a movie once
(11:18:34) fartronomicon: don't go there
(11:18:36) nihilocrat: I watched Full Metal Jacket in French a few times once because I was bored
(11:19:13) fartronomicon: i watched crocodile dundee in german in berlin
(11:19:14) Stargoat: WEH
(11:19:20) fartronomicon: and i had no trouble following it
(11:19:48) jsticker: That's not a knife

(11:21:10) jsticker: Yeah
(11:21:16) jsticker: It's pretty bad, apart from the egg scenes
(11:21:28) nihilocrat: haha, so 80s
(11:21:37) nihilocrat: I just think the accent is funny
(11:21:44) jsticker: Ask C418 about it
(11:21:52) nihilocrat: I always feel weird because stuff in German is inherently funnier than stuff in English
(11:22:01) nihilocrat: like, if it's just a little funny
(11:22:04) nihilocrat: it's really funny to me
(11:22:10) nihilocrat: probably because I managed to understand it :P
(11:22:17) jsticker: :D
(11:22:29) nihilocrat: GEINE OIER
(11:22:34) jsticker: S?chsisch has a lot of nice expressions
(11:22:38) jsticker: And it's very soft, yeah
(11:22:42) jsticker: A bit like French
(11:22:46) C418: yeah, germans love it so much, they hate it
(11:22:49) jsticker: It's being mocked a lot, though

(11:23:28) fartronomicon: what is being mocked?
(11:23:38) nihilocrat: a regional german dialect
(11:23:46) nihilocrat: hmm
(11:23:53) nihilocrat: sort of like how we make fun of Minnesota accents
(11:24:00) fartronomicon: those are german accents too
(11:24:09) fartronomicon: they go "ja? oh ja!"
(11:24:22) nihilocrat: if y'all didn't already know, I argue Americans make more fun of Minnesota accents than southern ones
(11:24:30) Farbs|AudioMining [chatzilla@123.200.216.48] entered the room.
(11:24:32) nihilocrat: actually I think it's Norwegian / Swedish
(11:24:35) fartronomicon: fewer people have heard minesotan accents
(11:24:38) nihilocrat: lutefisk, etc.
(11:24:46) fartronomicon: so which gets made fun of more is debatable
(11:24:53) nihilocrat: also Norwegian and to a lesser extent Swedish sound very sing-songy / martian

(11:29:03) nihilocrat: haha
(11:29:05) fartronomicon: is it a music video
(11:29:10) C418: it is
(11:29:13) nihilocrat: wait is that some norwegian black metal band

(11:29:14) Movius: Darkthrone - Call of the Wintermoon

(11:51:59) michael: mmmm
(11:52:00) Hima: lol
(11:52:24) michael: but srysly
(11:52:32) michael: did you have a question about gm?
(11:52:44) Hima: I was wondering how does Game Maker manage its game objects. Could someone please help me with that?
(11:53:24) Dragonene: No, but may I interest you in a set of porcelain unicorn figurines with pants?
(11:53:26) Dragonene: :D
(11:53:33) Dragonene: I must bind that phrase to a hotkey.

(11:54:16) Hima: Oh right
(11:54:22) michael: im not sure about that
(11:54:38) michael: im also not sure what you mean by 'manage'
(11:54:52) Hima: I mean, it auto correct the draw order
(11:54:58) Hima: when you change the depth value during the game
(11:55:23) Hima: So I was wondering what kind of data structure it use to keep all the game objects
(11:55:35) michael: oh, ya know idea
(11:56:54) Hima: I once made a game that the depth of the object change according to the object y coordinate.
(11:57:50) Hima: but I don't know if sorting the array every frame would decrease the performance
(11:58:06) Hima: since in GM, changing depth doesn't seems to affect the performance at all
(11:58:53) michael: thats an interesting question
(11:59:02) michael: i guess i would just test it out and see
(11:59:11) michael: and then report back when youve found out
(11:59:22) michael: alright now
(11:59:23) Dragonene: Hima: you wouldn't need to sort it every frame
(11:59:25) michael: chop chop
(11:59:27) Dragonene: just every time it changes

(12:11:43) hao-1: of the UE3 version ;)
(12:11:55) Farbs|AudioMining: I can help with that.
(12:12:08) Movius: I meant 10 UE3 developer licenses of course
(12:12:15) Farbs|AudioMining: It's gonna be so weird _not_ using UE3.
(12:12:28) Siiseli: ue3?
(12:12:31) Farbs|AudioMining: It's like 30% of my brain is dedicated to something that will become worthless to me.

(12:12:33) Movius: 5 for Weisser Punkt 3d

(12:12:55) Movius: yeah that got left behind in Adeliade
(12:12:55) Snakey: UE1 and UE2 was fun, but UE3 was more frustrating for me

(12:13:35) Farbs|AudioMining: (Wp2 was not composed of bags)
(12:13:37) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: Programming for it was annoying.
(12:13:44) hao-1: perhaps it just needs the right conditions
(12:13:47) Snakey: It was a whole lot more crashy
(12:14:05) Snakey: It's still a good engine
(12:14:13) Farbs|AudioMining: Huh. We haven't found that. Different builds maybe.
(12:14:17) Farbs|AudioMining: (crashy)

(12:15:29) Movius: the hard part about Weisser Punkt is writing the commentaries

(12:18:09) Farbs|AudioMining: Yeah totally. We should probably also have a beer at some stage.

(12:18:41) Farbs|AudioMining: Plz do not mention to internets.
(12:18:45) Snakey: Why?
(12:18:50) Snakey: I used UE3 heaps
(12:18:54) Farbs|AudioMining: Nah, was using it at my workplace.
(12:19:02) Snakey: Right, ok
(12:19:07) Movius: beer is the opiate of the lower classes. I will sit awkwardly while you drink though
(12:19:08) Xander [chatzilla@5ad7f8f2.bb.sky.com] entered the room.
(12:19:12) Movius: and then steal your wallet
(12:19:22) Farbs|AudioMining: You will be disappointed.
(12:19:26) jsticker: Hi Xander
(12:19:27) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(12:19:34) BMcC: Wooowww, I hate my connection
(12:19:35) Movius: full of the indie spirit?
(12:19:41) #tigirc: mode (+o BMcC) by ChanServ
(12:19:48) Xander: That's 'Xanderrrrrrrrrrrrr' to you
(12:19:52) jsticker: :]
(12:19:53) Farbs|AudioMining: Hey BMcC!
(12:19:59) jsticker: You never replied, Xander
(12:20:00) shinygerbil: hey hey everyone
(12:20:01) BMcC: Yo yo, Farbs
(12:20:02) shinygerbil: and jorbert
(12:20:13) Xander: haha, we were playing Metal Gear Online at the time
(12:20:13) BMcC: Also Mr. Gerbil!
(12:20:22) shinygerbil: hey Brondon
(12:20:34) BMcC: Hao: Are you doing sexy tree stuff for Dyson?
(12:20:35) Xander: Which is actually quite fun
(12:20:47) jsticker: I played it a lot last year
(12:20:54) BMcC: Forever Brondon :O
(12:21:02) BMcC: forovor
(12:21:07) shinygerbil: hehe
(12:21:16) notch: tiny face?
(12:22:09) notch: i should team up with a web site developer for minecraft
(12:22:37) nyarlu [nyarla@203-219-54-145.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(12:22:42) Xander: Yeah, it can get kind of annoying but it has such an interesting style to it. Also Man-Catapaults
(12:22:50) BMcC: Manapults!
(12:22:58) hao-1: Brondon: not at the moment
(12:23:02) hao-1: the trees will not get much sexier
(12:23:24) BMcC: Hehe, to clarify: I meant quadtree, not Dyson Tree :P
(12:23:40) BMcC: Trees upon trees!
(12:23:50) fartronomicon: are you sick of dyson yet
(12:24:35) nyarla left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:24:44) fartronomicon: and ready for a new project
(12:26:38) hao-1: definitely ready, but not sick
(12:26:50) fartronomicon: that's good
(12:26:53) hao-1: BMcC: no that's just mucking about in lunch hours
(12:27:14) hao-1: i still get surprised by dyson's visuals and i made the thing
(12:27:28) fartronomicon: that sounds like a good feelings
(12:27:32) Snakey: hao-1: Thats always a good thing
(12:27:34) hao-1: yeah, is nice
(12:28:13) hao-1: but i did add a quadtree to dyson recently for the rendering and entity collisions
(12:28:30) hao-1: it's slower than the grid of buckets was
(12:28:32) fartronomicon: had you done them before?
(12:28:36) BMcC: Heh, weird
(12:28:40) hao-1: i'd used them for a terrain thing
(12:29:07) hao-1: well, the buckets had some problems too - my system put an entity in a single bucket
(12:29:16) hao-1: so large things like asteroids weren't really accounted for
(12:29:27) fartronomicon: i don't know how buckets work
(12:29:51) hao-1: well, it's just a regular grid, and in each cell is a list of entities present in that cell
(12:30:02) fartronomicon: so like a fixed-size quadtree?
(12:30:08) hao-1: yeah, pretty much.
(12:30:10) fartronomicon: without the tree i guess
(12:30:14) hao-1: with no hierarchy
(12:30:42) fartronomicon: easier to implement then i guess?
(12:30:47) Snakey: is a dynamic quad tree useful for something like Dyson?
(12:31:03) Snakey: I would have imagined that the cost for regenerating the tree would be quite expensive
(12:31:37) hao-1: Yeah. The main problem with the quad tree is that entites keep track of their own node, and with a large amount of entities, checking to see if they've changed node is significantly slower than just checking to see if their X,Y in a grid has changed
(12:31:56) hao-1: Snakey: yeah, it's useful because my entities are vastly different in size
(12:32:07) hao-1: so the asteroids for example all get stored quite high up the tree
(12:32:22) qubodup [qubodup@brln-4db95cca.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(12:32:24) hao-1: and the seedlings mostly get stored way down in the bottom
(12:32:36) hao-1: er, i imagine the tree as being small at the top.
(12:32:39) Snakey: Mmm right, I was wondering about the cost of regenerating the tree
(12:33:01) hao-1: I just generate the entire tree and keep it in memory. All the nodes are present at all times
(12:33:04) hao-1: hehe
(12:33:15) fartronomicon: it's the roots not the branches then
(12:33:26) hao-1: sure, roots. whatever! :D
(12:33:27) Farbs|AudioMining: There's too much love in this room for me not to share a demo.
(12:33:42) fartronomicon: love is the flip side of hate
(12:34:19) Farbs|AudioMining: Anybody want to try this out? Currently pre-alpha: http://www.farbs.org/CFTest.html
(12:34:25) BMcC: opium is the opiate of the masses
(12:34:35) hao-1: but yeah, I'm not really quad-treeing in earnest - just mucking around
(12:34:38) Farbs|AudioMining: WASD and space fly the ship, mouse drag attaches and detaches bits of ship
(12:35:06) Siiseli: I'll will
(12:35:31) notch: Farbs|AudioMining: Love the speech sound =d
(12:35:37) BMcC: PURE HEART 0
(12:35:39) BMcC: Yes
(12:35:46) Farbs|AudioMining: Oh, and it's in flash. Hit "B" if your framerate is awful.
(12:35:47) Farbs|AudioMining: Destroy the core of an enemy to get access to its bits.
(12:36:02) hide [hide@lns-bzn-53-82-65-2-110.adsl.proxad.net] entered the room.
(12:36:03) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: I'm guessing BioShock 2...
(12:36:10) fartronomicon: zooming with the mousewheel is also causing the page to scroll farbs
(12:36:11) Snakey: or BioShock...
(12:36:20) fartronomicon: if you're going to use the mouse lock it in i guess
(12:36:27) hao-1: oh 
(12:36:30) Farbs|AudioMining: Snakey - Um... err... kinda no in both cases.
(12:36:31) hao-1: this is NICE
(12:36:31) BMcC: B is for Bloom
(12:36:33) Xander: I sploded..
(12:36:41) Bezzy: oh hey farbs. loved your resignation thing :)
(12:36:47) Farbs|AudioMining: Mouse lock... why?
(12:36:52) Farbs|AudioMining: Hey thanks Bezz!
(12:36:58) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: :) worth a shot. I remember your website as that i where I saw your resignation game.. :D
(12:36:59) Siiseli: how the fuck do I attach stuff
(12:37:00) BMcC: Yeah, that was greatness :)
(12:37:17) Siiseli: yeah it got linked in like every ch I'm in
(12:37:19) fartronomicon: because of what i said
(12:37:25) fartronomicon: mousewheel is scrolling the page
(12:37:28) Farbs|AudioMining: You have to destroy the core of an enemy ship (try the grey ones) then drag a piece onto yourself.
(12:37:30) jw [chatzilla@gd-c-7611.adsl.wanadoo.nl] entered the room.
(12:37:35) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: Thats kind of cool 
(12:37:39) Snakey: The controls are hard thou
(12:37:40) notch: farbs: I like it. It's veery hard to control, though
(12:37:44) Farbs|AudioMining: Ah shit. I thought the page was small enough to not scroll.
(12:37:52) notch: attaching bits was a bit nonintuitive. =)
(12:38:04) notch: a huge ship flew by and looked great. Nice bloom
(12:38:10) Farbs|AudioMining: Yeah, I only just switched it to drag and the feedback isn't set up for that yet.
(12:38:32) BMcC: Aah, this is fun
(12:38:44) notch: I THE DIED!
(12:39:07) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: on the topic of UE3, I was mostly programming with it in terms of Unrealscript and C++, and I found it possible to crash UE3 in Unrealscript a lot of the times
(12:39:13) Movius: awesome fun farbs
(12:39:16) fartronomicon: also when i right click it does weird things
(12:39:19) fartronomicon: and i can't get rid of the menu
(12:39:22) Movius: unbalanced space ships are great
(12:39:23) Farbs|AudioMining: Attaching bits and building your ship is a big part of the game.
(12:39:23) Farbs|AudioMining: Oh, and unit levels go by resistor colour codes. I need to find a better way to express that.
(12:39:26) Snakey: as well leak memory. it was really frustrating for me a lot of the time.
(12:39:45) BMcC: I want to be able to move the gun's position
(12:39:52) BMcC: and build a ship with a long nose
(12:40:06) hao-1: I THE DIED
(12:40:11) Farbs|AudioMining: BMcC - kill a ship with a gun (try the red ones first) then stick its gun on yourself wherever you like.
(12:40:14) fartronomicon: i can't get this piece to attach also
(12:40:14) BMcC: Also, yeah, a bit difficult to aim -- maybe a quicker decelleration on the ship's rotation?
(12:40:57) fartronomicon: this right click menu is going to kill me
(12:40:57) notch:  I'd kill for mouse aim actually, farbs. Automatic ship thrusters
(12:41:08) notch: it feels a bit like I'm fighting the controls, but that might be part of the fun
(12:41:14) fartronomicon: or crash firefox
(12:41:37) Bezzy: hey farbs. i like this!
(12:41:39) Snakey: Hmmm, i would kind of wonder if it would be better to have automatic mouse aiming
(12:41:44) mklee left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:41:46) Xander: Gaah, it's tough to kill a ship with guns
(12:41:50) Bezzy: like spore, but with more natural flow
(12:41:55) hao-1: holy shit this is awesome farbs
(12:42:04) tantan [tantan@c-98-213-201-216.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(12:42:09) Xander: Yeah, it's pretty sweet
(12:42:18) notch: agreed. =)
(12:42:19) Bezzy: touch more rotational friction, perhaps? I know it becomes part of the game
(12:42:24) Bezzy: but
(12:42:26) Bezzy: um.
(12:42:33) Bezzy: maybe i just have to get used to it?
(12:42:36) hao-1: damn what
(12:42:38) notch: I'd like a small map in the lower right of the screen (or anywhere), where you build your ship or see a zoomed in closeup with more detail
(12:42:44) hao-1: fuck you green guy!
(12:42:46) notch: it's a bit tricky to build when you're turning it around
(12:42:56) hao-1: yeah a pause/build mode would be good
(12:42:57) notch: gathering pieces is fun
(12:42:57) BMcC: Aha
(12:43:02) BMcC: Building the ship is so fun
(12:43:08) BMcC: Popping the pieces off and rearranging them
(12:43:30) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: The explosions is really, really nice.
(12:43:33) BMcC: I love that it knows to use which thruster for what
(12:43:42) Siiseli: fuck I died
(12:43:43) Siiseli: it was fun
(12:43:50) Farbs|AudioMining left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(12:43:52) jw: sup tigs
(12:43:57) BMcC: Yo J-dub
(12:44:08) Kjell: Is that Vaporware competition posted on the forums a "official" TIGSource competition? Or just some random dude calling out ...
(12:44:08) hide left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(12:44:11) jw: notch did you like my vids :)
(12:44:11) Snakey: GHow do I build the ship?
(12:44:12) LordMetroid [lordmetroi@90-224-93-243-no108.tbcn.telia.com] entered the room.
(12:44:18) michael left the room (quit: Quit: michael).
(12:44:22) notch: i liked putting more thrusters on one side. ;)
(12:44:28) notch: jw: Yeah, very nice =)
(12:44:34) mklee [nfreakct@cpe-024-211-165-053.nc.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(12:44:43) Snakey: Ahh .. you got to be near the piece
(12:44:50) hide [hide@lns-bzn-53-82-65-2-110.adsl.proxad.net] entered the room.
(12:44:58) fartronomicon: farbs something weird happens whenever i right click
(12:45:28) Bezzy: farbs - can i also suggest some kind of laser sight/crosshair? maybe that could be an attachable
(12:45:38) tantan: what are we playing yo
(12:45:40) Bezzy: possibly upping the rotational friction will help with aim, too.
(12:45:42) tantan: oh hi farbs
(12:46:08) Bezzy: since your first shots are so restricted, it'd be nice to have some more percievable consequence when you shoot
(12:46:31) Snakey: I some how lost the ability to shoot
(12:46:41) Farbs|AudioMining [chatzilla@123.200.216.48] entered the room.
(12:46:47) hao-1: ahh gotta go
(12:46:51) hao-1: this is great farbs
(12:46:53) Farbs|AudioMining: Damn shitty internet. Did I miss anything?
(12:46:53) hao-1: i love you
(12:46:56) Farbs|AudioMining: <3
(12:46:56) BMcC: See ya, Alex
(12:46:57) Bezzy: you might have stuck a peice infront of your gun
(12:46:59) shinygerbil: farbs this is great
(12:47:02) Farbs|AudioMining: bye Alex.
(12:47:07) BMcC: You missed that CF is awesome
(12:47:08) hao-1: yeah range on lasers visual would be good
(12:47:11) Bezzy: someone log-flood farbs :)
(12:47:25) Farbs|AudioMining: Hrm... interesting idea.
(12:47:27) Bezzy: okay i will!
(12:47:30) Farbs|AudioMining: (range feedback)
(12:47:31) BMcC: Haha
(12:47:47) hao-1: one more go
(12:47:55) Farbs|AudioMining: Heh.
(12:48:10) hao-1: i'd like to use the arrow keys
(12:48:10) Siiseli: oh yhou can zoom
(12:48:27) hao-1: and do the construction with the mouse separately
(12:48:32) BMcC: Needs BATTLE sounds, the text sounds make my dizzy on their own
(12:48:45) hao-1: left hand wsad for this movement is not familiar
(12:48:48) LtJax left the room (quit: Quit: std::runtime_error).
(12:49:26) Farbs|AudioMining: Arrow keys... got it.
(12:49:34) Farbs|AudioMining: (am scribbling furiously)
(12:50:00) Farbs|AudioMining: Audio is seriously lacking, you are correct.
(12:50:26) Farbs|AudioMining: Also the voice doesn't actually say much useful yet. I think I'll just get it to speak out messages from other ships.
(12:50:45) Movius: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7p_C9OlN40 the polite applause and thank you at the end of this video never fail to make me laugh
(12:50:47) hao-1: rotational acceleration seems rater high
(12:52:01) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: That's a really fun game.
(12:52:13) Movius: the control gets better with more thrusters
(12:52:17) jsticker: hehe, Movius
(12:52:19) Snakey: The construction part is very fun. I like it
(12:52:21) BMcC: Yeah, it does
(12:52:33) notch: hahaha Movius =D
(12:52:35) BMcC: I've got a honking ship now... must find more guns
(12:53:06) Snakey: Screenshot BMcC!
(12:53:13) C418: did you notice? coldplay released a new album
(12:53:14) Farbs|AudioMining: Thanks guys!
(12:53:16) C418: for free
(12:53:26) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: What gave you this idea?
(12:53:35) Farbs|AudioMining: Future feature: Export your ship to a hyperlink so your friends can fly it.
(12:53:46) Snakey: Ahh thats neat
(12:54:22) Snakey: So when bits get hit, you lose them?
(12:54:39) C418: http://lrlrl.coldplay.com/leftright.html
(12:54:39) Farbs|AudioMining: Yep.
(12:54:44) Snakey: I went from a big ship to almost nothing
(12:54:44) C418: well, it's more of a mixtape I guess
(12:54:46) C418: but free is free
(12:55:08) Farbs|AudioMining: Yeah you have to watch out for the big lasers. Also higher level stuff doesn't damage so easily.
(12:55:18) Siiseli: I died again, fuck
(12:55:18) Siiseli: I suck
(12:55:23) hao-1: ahhh
(12:55:26) hao-1: that was a good one
(12:55:28) Siiseli: I can't manage o get guns
(12:55:29) Snakey: Ahh ok, thats kind of cool
(12:55:29) hao-1: got to the blue enemies
(12:55:32) shinygerbil: hey! I never thought of adding thrusters facing sideways. makes things much easier
(12:55:36) Snakey: It some what also reminds me of Fl0?
(12:55:43) Snakey: FL0w sorry
(12:55:58) hao-1: yeah side thrusters is a must
(12:56:08) Snakey: mmm 5 am
(12:56:09) hao-1: farbs this is great but the construction is annoying in interface
(12:56:12) Snakey: I really should sleep
(12:56:13) hao-1: slightly
(12:56:17) Farbs|AudioMining: Yeah, it steals a little from fl0w, tumiki fighters, and warning forever. Also battleships forever I guess.
(12:56:27) hao-1: ok i really gotta go. wow wow
(12:56:29) hao-1: awesome
(12:56:31) Snakey: see ya
(12:56:31) hao-1: bye
(12:56:32) Farbs|AudioMining: 'night!
(12:56:34) jw: bye  1
(12:56:36) hao-1 left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(12:56:54) Farbs|AudioMining: There's much work left to do on this, especially the interface.
(12:57:08) Farbs|AudioMining: Like I said, it's pre alpha. Just sharing for the fun of it.
(12:57:11) Movius: I sleep now
(12:57:15) Movius: good work farbs
(12:57:21) Farbs|AudioMining: 'night movs
(12:57:25) Snakey: It's really great for an alpha and the initial idea is cool
(12:57:35) Farbs|AudioMining: Cheers :)
(12:57:38) Movius left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(12:57:46) Farbs|AudioMining: I have grand plans for a whole series of this.
(12:57:52) BMcC: sUPER FUN!
(12:57:54) BMcC: Whoa
(12:57:56) BMcC: Super fun, though
(12:58:10) BMcC: I'm having more and more fun playing it
(12:58:16) Farbs|AudioMining: Captain Forever - first title.
(12:58:18) Farbs|AudioMining: Captain Successor - sequel, with more stuff.
(12:58:20) Farbs|AudioMining: Captain Together - MMO.
(12:58:38) Snakey: Crazy 
(12:59:06) Snakey: mmm man I should sleep soon
(12:59:08) Farbs|AudioMining: It's a long term plan. Also I hate writing MP code.
(12:59:31) Xander: gaaaah.. that would be madness. Blowing each other up and then stealing their parts to create bigger ships.. so on and so forth
(12:59:44) BMcC: Captain Together, hahaha
(12:59:49) Xander: Then you'd have multiple smaller ships having to band together to take on a big ship and sharing the parts
(13:00:09) Xander: I think there's a lot to be excited about there. Also, those names are brilliant
(13:00:10) Farbs|AudioMining: Yep.
(13:00:15) jw: shit
(13:01:07) Succendo [dragonmaw@c-98-247-110-202.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] entered the room.
(13:01:41) jw: shit shit shit
(13:01:59) Farbs|AudioMining: I like the idea of some players paying huge $$$ for good parts, and other players sneaking around stealing 'em.
(13:02:19) Snakey: Farbs|AudioMining: As in real money?
(13:02:20) fartronomicon: farms i keep right clicking by mistake and it is causing problems
(13:02:26) fartronomicon: the flash menu comes up but i can't click on it
(13:02:37) fartronomicon: and i have to do tricky things with alt tab and such to get away
(13:02:43) Farbs|AudioMining: Snakey - yep.
(13:02:56) Snakey: Hmmm, isn't that sort of treading a fine line though?
(13:02:57) Farbs|AudioMining: fartronomicon - which browser are you using?
(13:03:01) fartronomicon: firefox
(13:03:17) Snakey: it's like when people complained about Battlefield Heros
(13:03:31) BMcC: OH SON OF A--
(13:03:40) Farbs|AudioMining: Hrm. I'll look into the right click thing (scribbles some more)
(13:03:41) BMcC: I was checking the mIRC window for a second
(13:03:46) Dragonmaw left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(13:03:46) BMcC: The game doesn't PAUSE though!
(13:03:57) BMcC: I am heartbroken
(13:04:00) Hima_ [chatzilla@ppp-58-9-103-13.revip2.asianet.co.th] entered the room.

(13:05:08) Farbs|AudioMining: <---
(13:05:20) Farbs|AudioMining: Am looking for good sounds already.
(13:05:27) Snakey: Farbs: I think 8-bit sounds would work really well for this game
(13:05:39) Farbs|AudioMining: Heh - I was considering the opposite!
(13:05:49) Snakey: Oh ok, but
(13:05:50) Snakey: http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html
(13:05:57) Snakey: you could try this for now
(13:05:58) Farbs|AudioMining: Really close, realistic sounds. Kinda like in Defcon where you hear the woman sobbing.
(13:06:02) Snakey: and see?
(13:06:33) fartronomicon: i'm not usually one to stereotype but the only people who walk into the office here and don't close the door behind them are indians
(13:06:43) fartronomicon: and we have a bunch of indian engineers who come in a lot
(13:07:40) fartronomicon: also what patel thinks it's okay not to write their first name on a form
(13:07:49) fartronomicon: our system has like a thousand of them
(13:07:51) Farbs|AudioMining: Sounds are high on my priority list. They will happen soon, I promise.

(13:09:50) Farbs|AudioMining: Nah, I just have to spend a few nights trawling sound archives. I know how I want the game to sound already :)
(13:09:55) nihilocrat: maybe there are so many people there's no point in closing the door behind them, but that sounds like weak logic
(13:09:59) Snakey: ok, good luck

(13:36:32) Bezzy: especially when you've got so many other back of the box features to get in the game.
(13:37:17) Bezzy: people forget about controls and useability. and when they go to address it, the system is so hardwired that you can't make it how you want it, or some other botb feature precludes the changes you want to make. ahrgh!

(15:19:12) Jr: HOW R U
(15:19:19) qubodup: dfttdftt
(15:19:28) Kobel: I wanna play DeathSpank
(15:19:34) Kobel: It needs to start existing... NOW.
(15:19:34) michael: squee :D
(15:19:42) michael: poof
(15:19:48) Jr: Michael :D
(15:19:57) Jr: Gobbledegook
(15:20:25) michael: someone left toast in the toaster for 3 days
(15:20:34) michael: and im a hippy so i cant throw things away
(15:20:34) Jr: Make bread pudding
(15:20:41) Jr: if it's not really gross
(15:20:45) jkd: croutons
(15:20:50) Jr: that might make great bread pudding
(15:20:53) michael: this sandwich is very... perseverant in my mouth
(15:20:55) Jr: BREAD PUDDING
(15:21:08) Jr: I made a real great sandwich the other day
(15:21:08) jkd: what's the recipe for bread pudding?
(15:21:12) jkd: never heard of it
(15:21:13) Jr: Uh, I don't know
(15:21:15) Jr: oh
(15:21:17) michael: bread milk eggs sugar
(15:21:20) jkd: bread + pudding?
(15:21:21) Jr: it's like a custard with bread
(15:21:21) michael: ???
(15:21:22) michael: profit
(15:21:44) jkd: is that british or something?
(15:21:45) Jr: it's bread soaked in an egg custard 
(15:21:47) Jr: naw
(15:21:48) michael: well depends on it you want a sweet or savory bp
(15:21:54) Jr: not british, really
(15:22:04) Jr: It
(15:22:11) Jr: it's a classic comfort food though
(15:22:23) jkd: Bread pudding is a dessert popular in British cuisine
(15:22:27) jkd: from wikipedia :)
(15:22:37) jkd: the internet rules http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_pudding
(15:22:39) Jr: Huh
(15:22:46) Kobel: "19. You're given $10 million and told to go make Diablo 4 or Anachronox 2. Which would you go with and what would you do with it? Would there be any more or less pressure working with someone else's I.P.?
(15:22:46) Kobel: I have a feeling Blizzard's Diablo 3 cut-scene budget is well over $10 million. Working on someone else's IP is a lot of work if you want to be true to their creation. The thing I love about designing games is creating worlds and characters, so working on someone else's IP always removes one of the "fun components" for me."
(15:22:58) Kobel: What a very ODD example for the interviewer to mention
(15:23:00) Kobel: Anachronox 2
(15:23:08) Jr: Maybe it's just because I've got British heritage
(15:23:20) Jr: naw, my friends make it too
(15:23:50) michael: 10 million for cut scenes in a video game?
(15:23:58) michael: fuck me
(15:24:00) jkd: blizzard is rich biatch
(15:24:05) Jr: Oh!
(15:24:07) michael: giving to africa or something
(15:24:08) jkd: digital gold chains
(15:24:11) Jr: That was an incomplete citation
(15:24:12) Jr: Bread pudding is a dessert popular in British cuisine, Puerto Rican cuisine, Mexican cuisine, Argentina, Louisiana Creole and that of the Southern United States, as well as Belgian and French cuisine.
(15:24:12) michael: we dont need cutscenes
(15:24:13) Kobel: Well he's just guessing anyway
(15:24:17) jkd: yeah jr heheh
(15:24:18) jkd: i cheated
(15:24:19) Jr: it's not just british
(15:24:31) Jr: Southern US, that makes complete sense now
(15:24:34) jkd: quote mangling, good skill :)
(15:24:34) Kobel: But I just copied that because I thought it's super weird that someone would suggest a big budget sequel to Anachronox
(15:24:43) Jr: because I was introduced to it by my friend
(15:24:53) Jr: who's parents were from the south
(15:25:01) Kobel: Is there all of a sudden more interest in Anachronox than I knew about?
(15:25:10) jkd: wtf even /is/ anachronox?
(15:25:12) michael: not from me
(15:25:15) jkd: that's a blizzard title?
(15:25:24) Kobel: No it was made by Ion Storm
(15:25:33) michael: blizzards got a new ip coming out right?
(15:25:41) Kobel: It was a really nifty game, sort of a JRPG/Adventure hybrid
(15:25:47) Kobel: With lots of comedy
(15:25:53) michael: ecocraft
(15:25:55) ***michael pukes
(15:25:55) Kobel: Did VERY poorly
(15:27:00) PiratePoo: Anachronox was pretty wonderful
(15:27:11) PiratePoo: I never managed to finish it though, because of a bug
(15:27:16) Kobel: Aw
(15:27:22) Lunar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:27:23) michael: thats what i said about your mom
(15:27:36) Kobel: What really sucks is if you google old screenshots you get to see the crazy shit they had to cut out because of time
(15:27:38) Lunar [iridescent@82.152.207.59] entered the room.
(15:27:57) Kobel: It was a retardedly overambitious game though
(15:28:07) Kobel: And after Daikatana...
(15:28:53) PiratePoo: The demo of Anachronox, where you had to take pictures of evidence and stuff, sold me on the game
(15:28:53) Siiseli left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:29:04) PiratePoo: Didn't buy it until much later though
(15:29:11) PiratePoo: Because I'm cheap like that
(15:29:16) nihilocrat: I think an Elite-style game in this style would be neat : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mgyYTW2w19c/SXRxsIYhInI/AAAAAAAAGWM/-hZzayTNQh0/s1600-h/Flyby___coloured_by_Amarynceus.jpg
(15:29:18) nihilocrat: steampunk elite
(15:29:45) Kobel: I borrowed it from a friend then bought it for $5 a few years later
(15:30:35) nihilocrat: I read a review of Anachronox, it said it was pretty good, I never got around to playing
(15:31:06) Kobel: It's better as an adventure game than an RPG
(15:31:07) PiratePoo: Reminds me of Last Exile
(15:31:39) lemre: well, i sure am late to the party on this dan deacon guy
(15:32:16) farticles [Mibbit@c-68-36-56-133.hsd1.nj.comcast.net] entered the room.

(15:33:03) notch: hello fart
(15:33:06) notch: icles
(15:33:26) farticles: so i'm on my friend's mac, and i tried to show him minecraft and everything is pink
(15:33:33) farticles: and while it's open it shows on every tab
(15:33:37) notch: pink? whao
(15:33:40) notch: screenshot plox!
(15:33:59) farticles: what's the key for shots in os x?
(15:34:10) jkd: apple+shift+3
(15:34:11) farticles: it's like a function key
(15:34:39) jkd: command+shift+3 is capture area
(15:34:45) jkd: command+shift+4 is capture full screen
(15:34:49) jkd: it writes a png to your desktop
(15:35:27) basro__ [basro@186.136.46.12] entered the room.

(15:36:46) notch: woow
(15:36:55) notch: looks like it's really failing to load the textures or something
(15:37:04) basro_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:37:11) farticles: they're there, just sans color data
(15:37:22) nihilocrat: fascinating
(15:37:24) notch: yeah, looks like it's got the channels mixed up or something
(15:37:29) nihilocrat: makes the most sense
(15:37:32) notch: I suspect it at least reading alpha as red
(15:37:40) nihilocrat: esp. if you are not using 16bit + color
(15:37:48) notch: plant a bush (press 6)
(15:38:04) notch: does it have transparancy?
(15:38:23) Jr: bloop
(15:38:29) farticles: it does
(15:38:52) notch: ok, so it's not what I thought it was
(15:39:00) notch: what java version does he have?
(15:39:06) Kobel: So pink!
(15:39:09) farticles: not sure
(15:39:12) farticles: how do i check
(15:39:30) Jr: farticles: you have a gay laptop
(15:39:32) notch: if you can get a console prompt, type "java -version"
(15:39:40) farticles: this isn't a laptop
(15:39:44) farticles: it's an imac or something
(15:39:45) Jr: computer
(15:39:49) Jr: whatever
(15:40:31) Jr: Why do we have almost no ops on this channel
(15:40:41) ArneLurk: I still think minecraft needs quake textures
(15:40:55) C418: I don't
(15:40:56) ArneLurk: but perhaps that's because I'm used to WorldCraft
(15:40:56) farticles: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_16-133, mixed mode, sharing)
(15:41:01) ArneLurk: the editor for Q1 bsps
(15:41:13) notch: hmm, ok. You've tried restarting the game, I assume? ;)
(15:41:20) farticles: i tried restarting the computer
(15:41:44) notch: hm
(15:42:21) farticles: this is a powerpc imac, with i assume on-board video
(15:42:35) farticles: i don't know how these things work

(15:45:20) Blood_War: I'd like to order a lare hawaiin pizza
(15:45:25) Blood_War: *large
(15:45:40) jkd: awwwww now i'm hungry
(15:45:48) nihilocrat: pineapples :/
(15:45:54) jkd: rule?
(15:45:56) jkd: yep, rule.
(15:45:57) nihilocrat: see, I'm not hungry, because of the pineapples
(15:45:59) nihilocrat: :P
(15:46:11) jkd: i like sweet pizza sometimes
(15:46:13) jkd: it's sweet
(15:46:36) Jr: bloop
(15:46:36) Blood_War: Yo, is Rinku, Skaldic, Stargoat, or any other people in the SC compo here?
(15:47:41) jkd: seems not, what's the sc compo?
(15:47:53) jkd: sc is starcraft i assume?
(15:48:06) Blood_War: Strcraft Competition
(15:48:18) jkd: who's running it?
(15:49:10) Blood_War: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=5825.0

(15:51:46) Blood_War: So anyone else here?
(15:51:50) C418:  no
(15:52:04) jkd: get em on msn if you can

(16:01:47) BMcC: Anyone here a master of FMOD?
(16:03:14) jkd: not i
(16:03:17) jkd: i use sdl_mixer
(16:03:30) ***kevglass uses jorbis/jogg.
(16:04:15) BMcC: Le sigh!
(16:04:17) Cow: GUYS
(16:04:18) Cow: I just realised how similar Pepsiman is to Mirror's Edge
(16:04:27) BMcC: I mean, it MUST be possible to sync sounds to a tempo
(16:04:30) Cow: it's like the same game
(16:04:35) BMcC: BUT I can't seem to find a straight answer?
(16:05:11) BMcC: FMOD runs asynchronously, which is pretty great for the sound not hiccuping or whatever
(16:05:21) BMcC: but testing for the point in the song and stuff... ugh
(16:05:25) BMcC: it's all locked to framerate
(16:05:29) FinDude left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(16:05:39) jkd: no callback?
(16:05:50) BMcC: I -think- the returned position/time/whatever may be adjusted to wrok
(16:05:53) BMcC: work*
(16:05:54) BMcC: I dunno!
(16:05:55) BMcC: Haha
(16:06:03) gandhi__ [gandhi@pool-71-178-240-50.washdc.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(16:06:06) jstickeur: Whassup guys
(16:06:08) jkd: can you get the buffer length?
(16:06:11) BMcC: Yo yo JS
(16:06:18) BMcC: Yeah
(16:06:21) jkd: bonjour
(16:06:44) Xander: heys!
(16:06:48) jkd: sync is like the main draw of using a mod player instead of mp3 no?
(16:06:48) BMcC: I mean, my idea is that: I divide the length by the tempo or whatever to find the next beat
(16:06:50) C418: jsticker
(16:06:53) jstickeur: C418
(16:06:54) C418: http://www.speichergurke.de/
(16:07:07) jstickeur: Explain
(16:07:12) BMcC: I guess so, jkd, yeah
(16:07:23) BMcC: I'm doing real hi-fi music for this, though
(16:07:26) C418: just look through the site
(16:07:31) BMcC: But I have some stuff I wanna sync, blah
(16:07:42) jkd: i thought you could put special 'notes' in a channel and have fmod call you when they're hit?
(16:07:43) BMcC: Where's Jon Mak when you need him?  :)
(16:07:44) nyarlu left the room (quit: Quit: Computer has gone to sleep).
(16:08:23) Bezzy left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(16:08:24) BMcC: I guess I could?  Or maybe stream a sample on loop that's the length of a bar, returning whenever it starts?
(16:08:27) jkd: what specifically do you want? do you want to know which frame a beat happens on?
(16:08:35) gandhi_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(16:08:36) BMcC: But then there's the problem of the logic being done at the framerate
(16:08:47) BMcC: I want to be able to play a sample on beat
(16:08:49) jkd: why is that a problem? what's the framerate?
(16:09:11) BMcC: 60 FPS, but... it's a problem if there's slowdown
(16:09:25) BMcC: and even at full speed, there would be this uneven swing
(16:09:26) tantan: how intensive of a game is it?
(16:09:30) jkd: i don't see why
(16:09:32) BMcC: Fairly :P
(16:09:45) tantan: cocktease
(16:09:48) Siiseli: http://www.inbflat.net/
(16:09:54) jkd: here's the algorithm.. store the time of the previous update.. and check if the time between that and the current time contains the beat
(16:10:11) jkd: that will be off by at most one frame
(16:10:12) tantan: those look like words to me
(16:10:19) BMcC: Hahaha
(16:10:29) BMcC: That's true, but with music... one frame can make a big difference
(16:10:30) SDHawk\SLEEP is now known as SDHawk
(16:10:47) BMcC: And if there's slowdown, that'll get real iffy
(16:10:48) tantan: musik is black magicks
(16:11:00) jkd: does fmod support a delay before playing a sound?
(16:11:15) tantan: you cannot control it with mere algorithms
(16:11:20) jkd: if so, as soon as you know you want to play a sample on beat, play it with the delay equal to the time to the next beat
(16:11:24) BMcC: I think it does... that was my thought, yeah -- find the time til the next beat, play with a delay
(16:11:25) tantan: you must tame it
(16:11:30) BMcC: Yeah
(16:11:31) jkd: yeah try that
(16:11:32) MegabitMonday: hi BMcC 
(16:11:38) BMcC: Hey man :)
(16:11:42) jkd: you might want logic saying if you're just a tiny bit late, play it now
(16:11:52) BMcC: Ah, good call
(16:11:56) qubodup left the room.
(16:12:00) BMcC: Or get the delay way before
(16:12:10) jkd: yeah what triggers the sample?
(16:12:13) tantan: logic is a pretty reasonable guy
(16:12:34) MegabitMonday: yeah but he can get kind of crazy sometimes
(16:12:47) jkd: i want to try a music sync game sometime. is it fun so far bmcc?
(16:12:47) BMcC: Okay, so I'm making this game with a lot of audio stuff to test this engine
(16:12:55) BMcC: I dunno yet, haha
(16:13:11) BMcC: I'll tell you in about a week, haha
(16:13:15) MegabitMonday: BMcC is making a rhythm game?
(16:13:16) jkd: :)
(16:13:25) jkd: at least you're not having to stream from a disc like on ps2 or whatever
(16:13:38) BMcC: Sort of!  Not so much a rhythm game, but I want it to play around with audio a lot, yeah
(16:13:55) BMcC: It's actually a re-imagining of one of (if not the) first games I ever finished
(16:13:57) jkd: got a musician?
(16:14:07) BMcC: Yes, ME
(16:14:07) BMcC: Haha
(16:14:10) jkd: awesome :)
(16:14:13) jkd: any stuff online?
(16:14:16) C418: bmcc is a good musician
(16:14:20) BMcC: b-mcc.com has some stuff
(16:14:27) tantan: with brondon's phat beats, this game will be kickin'
(16:14:33) BMcC: wooord
(16:14:35) tantan: word up, yo
(16:14:38) tantan: aww
(16:14:41) tantan: you beat me to it
(16:14:43) BMcC: Heh :P
(16:14:56) BMcC: I have a neat idea for the audio in this game... it's gonna be a relatively compact game
(16:15:05) DeM0nFiRe [kvirc@71-87-212-46.dhcp.oxfr.ma.charter.com] entered the room.
(16:15:07) DeM0nFiRe: Hey all
(16:15:09) BMcC: but I want it to generate a cool soundscape
(16:15:11) jkd: nice, aquaria reminds me of Tortoise
(16:15:11) BMcC: It's hard to describe
(16:15:15) BMcC: I'm bad at describing things
(16:15:20) jkd: and monkey island
(16:15:26) BMcC: Ah, the forest remix?
(16:15:31) jkd: yes
(16:15:33) Kobel: Hello world.
(16:15:33) BMcC: I love Monkey Island <3
(16:15:37) DeM0nFiRe: Anybody here have any experience with NVidia PhysX
(16:15:50) jkd: here's a few of my newest tunes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwYsndmXX2s
(16:15:51) C418: not the slightest bit
(16:15:52) BMcC: Not I
(16:16:09) Kobel: What's funny about that BMcC is that you can read that as "I love Monkey Island less than 3" and it completely makes sens
(16:16:10) Kobel: e
(16:16:11) BMcC: Niiiice JKD
(16:16:22) Kobel: Though personally I love Monkey Island <4
(16:16:22) BMcC: I do love 3 very much
(16:16:26) Kobel: Or  <=3

(16:16:46) tantan: that looks like a pointy penis
(16:16:49) DeM0nFiRe: Kobel, oh man, no math jokes!
(16:16:51) BMcC: This is cool, you'll like this game :)
(16:17:04) DeM0nFiRe: I played one of the Monkey Island games recently, it was pretty cool
(16:17:04) Kobel: What game?
(16:17:07) C418: here's a few of my newest tunes: http://c418.c4.ohost.de/host/imagess/rgh1242677825l.jpg
(16:17:08) Kobel: Which one?
(16:17:13) BMcC: Game I will make soonly
(16:17:25) Kobel: Oh... okay...
(16:17:35) jkd: hehe what software is that?
(16:17:39) C418: serioulsy tho, that song seems to be a stable mix of acid and... house I suppose, jkd
(16:17:41) Kobel: Let me guess:
(16:17:44) Kobel: Ableton?
(16:17:46) C418: it's well done
(16:17:51) C418: false
(16:17:52) C418: live
(16:17:55) jkd: thanks man
(16:18:00) jkd: yeah it's acid
(16:18:12) Kobel: Wart
(16:18:24) jkd: one of the most fun things to do is to randomly generate acid lines and then tweak the best ones by hand
(16:18:29) C418: well, today my album at least is... practically done

(16:19:58) C418: well, linux did it before
(16:20:14) Blood_War: Oh oh oh
(16:20:32) Kobel: This is the first time I've had to use a machine I had so few write privileges to and it's fucking pissing me off
(16:20:33) Blood_War: Imade a rock paper scissors varition today
(16:20:45) Blood_War: Shotgun Nuke Zombie

(16:21:10) tantan: rps is for scrubs
(16:21:10) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, what the heck beats a nuke?
(16:21:13) Cow: zombie cockroaches, you mean?
(16:21:17) tantan: real men play risk
(16:21:18) DeM0nFiRe: How does a zombie beat a nuke?
(16:21:23) Blood_War: Zombie not affected by radiation
(16:21:27) DeM0nFiRe: That is BS
(16:21:27) tantan: and use fisticuffs instead of dice rollss
(16:21:30) Siiseli: jkd, check private message
(16:21:30) DeM0nFiRe: Of course it isd
(16:21:33) Kobel: Are they affected by EXPLOSIONS?
(16:21:37) DeM0nFiRe: Flesh is flesh

(16:21:42) DeM0nFiRe: And heat
(16:21:44) Kobel: And since when are SHOTGUNS affected by radiation?
(16:21:48) DeM0nFiRe: Haha
(16:21:59) DeM0nFiRe: Back to the drawing board Blood_War!
(16:22:01) Blood_War: Asuming were  mile or so from th nuke
(16:22:08) tantan: i will restate myself: real men play risk and use fisticuffs instead of dice rolls
(16:22:16) tantan: instead of rock paper scissors
(16:22:18) DeM0nFiRe: The initial blast radius of modern nuclear wepaons is about 1.2 miles
(16:22:20) tantan: and its variants
(16:22:22) Blood_War: Shuotgunner dies from radiation
(16:22:42) Kobel: Real men are snorting rock and roll, having sex with cocaine, and listening to hookers
(16:22:46) tantan: oh, so now you're adding the -er, huh?
(16:22:48) Blood_War: Screw you all >.<
(16:22:55) DeM0nFiRe: Hahaha
(16:23:31) Kobel: I have a RPS variation

(16:23:53) Kobel: Exactly

(16:23:59) DeM0nFiRe: I don;t know the rest
(16:24:04) DeM0nFiRe: Oh
(16:24:09) Kobel: Well the bulldozer just runs over the coffee cup
(16:24:16) DeM0nFiRe: Hahaha
(16:24:18) Kobel: And the coffee disintegrates the sugar
(16:24:23) DeM0nFiRe: Oh man
(16:24:25) Blood_War: Hmm
(16:24:30) Blood_War: Fuck yes
(16:24:40) DeM0nFiRe: Here;s a question for you
(16:24:44) DeM0nFiRe: How do you hand-puppet sugar
(16:25:10) Kobel: It could be a sugar cube and you could make a square
(16:25:11) nihilocrat: pinch
(16:25:20) nihilocrat: pinch and rub
(16:25:25) Kobel: You hand puppet bulldozer by tackling your opponent
(16:25:31) Kobel: Nihilocrat maybe later call me
(16:25:35) nihilocrat: haha
(16:25:35) Blood_War: I never got how paper beats rock
(16:25:49) nihilocrat: rock suffocates easily
(16:25:50) nihilocrat: apparently
(16:25:54) Siiseli: it uh.. rolls around it
(16:25:55) Blood_War: Hmmm
(16:25:57) DeM0nFiRe: Because rock doesn't have enough brains to blow it;s way out of a paper bag
(16:25:57) Siiseli: .. or something
(16:26:40) Blood_War: I get rock crushing scissors and scissors cutting paper, but I mean, cmon...
(16:26:40) Kobel: Man this reminds me of Arrested Development
(16:26:48) Kobel: When they fight with the giant rock and scissors
(16:26:53) DeM0nFiRe: Wait, scissors beats paper?
(16:26:58) DeM0nFiRe: Damnit, why did no one tell me?
(16:27:02) Blood_War: ...
(16:27:12) DeM0nFiRe: I though paper clogged the joints of the scissors
(16:27:21) Super-Dot [Super-Dot@adsl-76-231-47-165.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(16:27:32) DeM0nFiRe: I thought paper always won, that's why I always choose it :(
(16:27:40) Siiseli: .. :D
(16:27:40) Kobel: They should have those bubble packages in RPS
(16:27:50) Kobel: Those things fucking murder scissors
(16:27:54) DeM0nFiRe: Hahaha
(16:27:56) Blood_War: Yes
(16:28:04) Siiseli: :D
(16:28:06) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah "Rock Paper Bubble Wrap shoot!
(16:28:09) Kobel: I don't think rocks can do shit to them either
(16:28:09) DeM0nFiRe: "
(16:28:13) Kobel: I guess they'd be imba
(16:28:31) Kobel: Paper could make a colorful insert into the packaging
(16:28:33) Kobel: That's basically it
(16:28:43) DeM0nFiRe: Actually
(16:28:51) DeM0nFiRe: Paper could give the safety instruction for deflating it
(16:29:01) Kobel: Yeah, but the paper would be inside
(16:29:05) Kobel: That's how it works
(16:29:07) Kobel: :(
(16:29:42) Blood_War: Hmm
(16:29:43) Kobel: Bubble packages defeat all
(16:29:57) Kobel: Those things will tear open your hands too
(16:30:00) Kobel: Worst invention ever
(16:30:03) DeM0nFiRe: Haha
(16:30:13) DeM0nFiRe: Well, you could bring out dynamite, nukes, fire etc. etc.
(16:30:20) DeM0nFiRe: And render bubble wrap pretty uselss
(16:30:23) DeM0nFiRe: useless*
(16:30:25) eobet left the room (quit: Quit: eobet).
(16:30:31) Kobel: Yeah but then you break your mp3 player!
(16:30:38) DeM0nFiRe: AHahah
(16:30:47) DeM0nFiRe: So then bubble wrap wins because it has hostages?
(16:30:52) DeM0nFiRe: That might break the rules
(16:31:08) DeM0nFiRe: Damnit, it's Rock Paper Scissors, there are no rules D:
(16:31:10) Kobel: Indestructable with conventional weaponry and anything more powerful causes collateral damage
(16:31:29) Blood_War: Best. Conversation. Ever.

(16:32:29) Kobel: Fucking cockroaches
(16:32:33) DeM0nFiRe: I don't thik they eat plastic :o
(16:32:46) Blood_War: So they can suvive nuke, and eat bubblewrap...
(16:32:51) Jr: oh boy
(16:32:53) Jr: from Fb
(16:32:54) Jr: Emily Sarkissian  just saw an enterprising gentleman selling men's briefs out of the trunk of his car in front of a mc donald's. and he had customers.
(16:33:00) Jr: hah
(16:33:04) Kobel: Cockroaches can't survive nukes any better than we can
(16:33:21) Kobel: I mean yeah they can take the rads
(16:33:25) Kobel: But they're symbiotic
(16:33:28) Kobel: Fucked without us

(16:33:55) nihilocrat: good sir, may I interest you in some undergarments?
(16:33:58) Blood_War: "Being omnivorous, they eat human food as well as waste, and some even eat plastic insulation and wood."
(16:34:00) nihilocrat: breeches or pantaloons?
(16:34:35) Blood_War: wut
(16:34:48) jstickeur: Hello jackson
(16:35:26) nihilocrat: the cockroach is kind of nature's grey goo
(16:35:39) DeM0nFiRe: So, some people have joined: Any of you have experience with NVidia PhysX SDK?
(16:35:59) nihilocrat: its amazing ability to balance itself is demonstrated by the fact our entire civilization isn't overrun with them
(16:36:24) Kobel: Pfft, cockroaches are overrated
(16:36:37) Kobel: They're just riding our coattails
(16:36:45) nihilocrat: hmm
(16:36:57) nihilocrat: cockroaches in long tail coats
(16:37:01) nihilocrat: with tophaps
(16:37:05) nihilocrat: *tophats
(16:38:50) DeM0nFiRe: Cockroaches with like maggots as pets
(16:39:05) Kobel: You don't want to keep maggots as pets
(16:39:10) Kobel: Someday they fly away
(16:39:31) Sos [Sos@err64.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl] entered the room.
(16:39:56) DeM0nFiRe: No, fool, someday you and your pet can fly and dominate everyone else
(16:40:06) DeM0nFiRe: If you treat your maggot right, it won't leave you
(16:41:04) Kobel: I think discipline is important though
(16:41:13) Kobel: I'd be all like "Drop and give me 20, maggot!"
(16:41:59) DeM0nFiRe: Hahaha
(16:42:11) Blood_War: Wow, I'm looking through my log for TIGIRC and I'll tell ya, there's some great conversations
(16:42:14) DeM0nFiRe: [16:31:44] <Blood_War> Best. Conversation. Ever.
(16:42:44) nihilocrat: at which point, the maggot will say something like
(16:43:00) nihilocrat: "it's kind of odd calling me 'maggot' you know, because I'm a maggot, so it's not perjorative at all"
(16:43:13) nihilocrat: then you will say
(16:43:22) nihilocrat: "AAA FUCK A TALKING MAGGOT FUCK THE END IS NIGH!!!"
(16:43:40) Blood_War: demonfire: none as great as rock paper bubblewrap though
(16:43:45) DeM0nFiRe: Why would you say that? This is from teh point of view of a cockroach
(16:44:09) DeM0nFiRe: Hey who wants to help me brainstorm something
(16:44:26) Kobel: I do probably but I'm going to get a burrito soon
(16:44:29) DeM0nFiRe: I need someone to brainstorm with me on a way to map 3D maps in a 2D map editor
(16:44:36) Kobel: I do like brainstorming though
(16:44:49) Kobel: What makes it a 2d map editor?
(16:45:00) Kobel: Like... only top down?
(16:45:04) Blood_War: [14:44] <Fraeon> Green, and yellow cunt
(16:45:15) Fraeon: wat
(16:45:20) Fraeon: I didn't say that
(16:45:24) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah Kobel
(16:45:26) nihilocrat: you could do isometric projection
(16:45:27) nihilocrat: or cavalier

(17:06:11) RinkuHero: i have no experience with that, sorry
(17:06:23) RinkuHero: the best i can think of is
(17:06:27) RinkuHero: use isometric view in 2d

(17:06:37) Blood_War: notch I hate you. Minecraft it too ddicting XD
(17:06:43) Cow: can't you just do layers with the surrounding layers at a lower alpha?

(17:45:00) shinygerbil: right, i'm gonna go and wash up some things
(17:45:07) corpus: nice
(17:45:08) shinygerbil: possibly in a sexually deviant manner
(17:45:12) corpus: nicer
(17:45:12) shinygerbil: somehow
(17:45:23) Jr: there are 2 sets of 4 1.5 hour classes
(17:45:24) corpus: do it wearing nothing but an apron and rubber gloves
(17:45:27) Jr: each day

(17:46:18) corpus: and like... what year are you in of the current block of schoolin'
(17:46:25) Jr: At the end of each semester, we have a week of final exams
(17:46:27) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:46:29) Jr: that are 3 hours each
(17:46:33) corpus: I see
(17:46:50) Jr: so midterms after first semester
(17:46:58) corpus: what happens with the exams?
(17:47:01) corpus: do they go to the government
(17:47:05) corpus: or are they internal
(17:47:09) Jr: no, they do not
(17:47:11) corpus: like, just to see how you're doing
(17:47:20) Jr: they are internal
(17:47:33) Jr: they count for 20% of your grade for the semester
(17:47:53) Burritobel: Hm, not bad
(17:48:03) Burritobel: Chips were very good this time, burrito a little oversalted
(17:48:04) Burritobel: Oh well
(17:48:07) Burritobel is now known as Kobel
(17:48:23) corpus: and what are the grades for, Jr?
(17:48:33) Jr: GPA for colleges
(17:48:51) corpus: do you go to college when you're 18/19
(17:48:51) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(17:48:55) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:49:02) Jr: if you get good grades, you get better chances for a better college
(17:49:06) Jr: uh
(17:49:07) Jr: yeah
(17:49:08) corpus: right
(17:49:11) Jr: 18/19
(17:49:19) corpus: but you get grades every semester, so twice a year?
(17:49:24) Jr: yeah
(17:49:26) corpus: do they average them at the end or something
(17:49:32) Jr: yep
(17:49:33) corpus: the end of high school
(17:49:35) corpus: right
(17:49:46) corpus: intriguing.
(17:49:49) Stargoat: am I to take it that if you mess up once(?) in the american system, you're boned in terms of college? That's how it seems, people obsessing over this stuff.
(17:49:50) Jr: GPA is grade point average
(17:49:59) Jr: stargoat, not really!
(17:50:13) Stargoat: who where does all the anxiety in everyone come from?
(17:50:14) Jr: grades are very important, but not too bad
(17:50:17) corpus: in england it's just your latest exams that really matter
(17:50:24) corpus: in terms of university
(17:50:25) Stargoat: same with our system, corpus

(17:51:00) Stargoat: ah
(17:51:11) Kobel: Now would be a good time I think to listen to Ghosts I-IV
(17:51:11) Jr: Junior and senior year are what the colleges really look at
(17:51:23) Jr: really junior
(17:52:02) Jr: getting into college is based on a few things: your SAT/ACT scores, your GPA, and all the other stuff

(17:52:14) nihilocrat: wow, quite a difference in managerspeak and programmerspeak
(17:52:24) Jr: other stuff like things that make you a well-rounded student
(17:52:27) nihilocrat: in programmerspeak, Subversion is a "[centralized] source control system"
(17:52:39) Jr: Oh, I forgot!
(17:52:39) nihilocrat: in managerspeak, it's "the world's leading software configuration management solution"
(17:52:46) Jr: GPA comes in two flavours
(17:52:47) Andy_W: haha
(17:53:11) Jr: There is unweighted GPA and weighted GPA
(17:53:27) nihilocrat: yes, it does
(17:53:40) nihilocrat: can you get a 6.0 in AP classes in your state?
(17:53:41) Jr: for GPA, each and every grade you get is given a score:  0 for F, 4 for A+
(17:53:51) Jr: that is for basic classes
(17:53:58) nihilocrat: in NC it's 4.0 for basic, 5.0 for honors, 6.0 for AP
(17:54:01) DeM0nFiRe: Jr
(17:54:03) Jr: for higher-level classes, 
(17:54:10) DeM0nFiRe: My weighted score for AP Physics was 20.00
(17:54:10) Jr: you get a multiplier
(17:54:18) Jr: uh
(17:54:21) Jr: what
(17:54:25) DeM0nFiRe: It was an A+ on an AP class, which makes it 10/10
(17:54:27) Blood_War: Im back
(17:54:29) DeM0nFiRe: Plus it was a doub;le class
(17:54:33) DeM0nFiRe: which made it 20/20
(17:54:43) Andy_W: that sounds like a different system
(17:54:52) Kobel: Haha you can score 6.0 in NC? That's crazy
(17:55:06) nihilocrat: yeah I graduated with like a 4.something I think
(17:55:10) nihilocrat: weighted
(17:55:23) nihilocrat: which was actually kind of bad compared to top-tier
(17:55:28) nihilocrat: I think I was #43 out of like 500
(17:55:29) Jr: DeM0nFiRe: that's a different system
(17:55:38) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, I know
(17:55:45) Stargoat: my cat is making that sound again
(17:55:57) Andy_W: heh
(17:55:58) DeM0nFiRe: Every weighted GPA system is decided by school
(17:56:13) Andy_W: my school's gpa system goes up to 4.3
(17:56:16) DeM0nFiRe: In my school, it is out of 5
(17:56:22) DeM0nFiRe: For a normal class
(17:56:26) Kobel: I never went to high school anyway
(17:56:35) nihilocrat: congratulations
(17:56:36) DeM0nFiRe: it is a 2x for AP and then 2x for double length
(17:56:46) corpus: interesting, jr
(17:56:54) nihilocrat: hopefully you weren't subjected to something else as soul-sucking
(17:58:59) Jr: Hm, I can't get the numbers right now, but it's F=0, D=1, C=2, B=3, A=4
(17:59:16) Jr: and then a multiplier for each grade if you are taking Regular, Honors, or AP
(17:59:38) Jr: I think it's like x1.2 for Honors
(18:00:00) Jr: and 1.4 for AP
(18:00:55) Jr: and colleges need a minimum GPA usually
(18:01:23) Jr: like Northeastern will not generally take a student with a GPA below 3.6
(18:01:48) RinkuHero: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXToN1yTTo8

(18:02:27) Blood_War: Stupid Michigan Education
(18:02:27) Stargoat: oh, hello Rinku
(18:02:30) nihilocrat: I would treat GPA as a person's ability to put up with bullshit they probably don't care about
(18:02:30) RinkuHero: hi
(18:02:37) nihilocrat: and to some extent, discipline
(18:02:46) nihilocrat: not really what they know, how smart they are, etc.
(18:02:53) Andy_W: yeah
(18:02:56) Jr: yep
(18:03:01) Jr: I've kinda given up on school
(18:03:06) Andy_W: >:|
(18:03:10) RinkuHero: my gpa was very good in high school but low in college
(18:03:10) Jr: because junior year is HARD
(18:03:15) Jr: and no one told me
(18:03:17) Andy_W: meh
(18:03:19) RinkuHero: something like 4.2 in high school, 2.0 in college
(18:03:29) Kobel: I tend to score 3.5 overall
(18:03:34) Jr: so I've been moving away from school things to personal things
(18:03:38) Kobel: I'm not sure how actually
(18:03:44) Kobel: I fuck off in a lot of classes
(18:03:44) nihilocrat: just remember that, when you find something really cool to do, there's no excuse for not becoming unheathily obsessed with learning how to be as good as possible in it
(18:03:51) Jr: Like beefing up my photo portfolio and stuff
(18:04:16) nihilocrat: gotta go, bye everyone
(18:04:17) Andy_W: i'm one of those bastards who can sleep through their classes and still get a 3.8-3.9 gpa
(18:04:19) Andy_W: bye
(18:04:24) Jr: and goofing off in Stats class doing experiments on everything
(18:04:29) nihilocrat: I did that before I stopped caring entirely

(18:06:52) Kobel: Naw no one successful ever worked hard at school

(18:06:56) Stargoat: HENSHIN A GO-GO, BABY!
(18:07:00) Stargoat: stupid internet.
(18:07:05) corpus: yeah
(18:07:13) corpus: I've been like that the past year or so, Jr
(18:07:16) Stargoat: what was said in my absense? Something critically important, I bet.
(18:07:17) corpus: also, Kobel, bullshit
(18:07:17) notch: water video "soon". =D
(18:07:37) Jr: There are more important things to do than write papers about the events leading up to the cold war

(18:07:49) Jr: I still do them

(18:08:00) Stargoat: later
(18:08:03) corpus: well, Jr, the way I see it
(18:08:03) Jr: Bye corpus
(18:08:25) Kobel: No it's true success in life is inversely correlated with grades
(18:08:28) Kobel: I read it
(18:08:35) Kobel: Just now, after I wrote it down.
(18:08:45) Jr: einstein was a poor student
(18:09:00) Jr: so was edison
(18:09:02) Kobel: AND THEN HE BLEW UP THE WORLD
(18:09:02) corpus: so were lots of fuckups
(18:09:06) Blood_War: He coulnt count
(18:09:11) Jr: edison was a terrible student and 'inventor'
(18:09:13) corpus: it's pointless trying to find a correlation
(18:09:15) Jr: what a dick
(18:09:20) ***Stargoat doesn't want to be tied down with the shackles of academia.
(18:09:24) corpus: different things are different for ifferent people
(18:09:28) Kobel: Corpus I've read that going to school causes brain damage
(18:09:28) Jr: But yeah, I get it
(18:09:34) RinkuHero: i don't think there's a negative correlation, but i don't think there's a positive one either
(18:09:37) Kobel: How do you respond?
(18:09:46) Stargoat: corpus: No, everything is the same for everyon.
(18:09:53) Stargoat: +e.
(18:10:04) Jr: You just can't lose sight of what really matters, right?
(18:10:10) Jr: that's what it's about
(18:10:16) BMcC left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(18:10:24) Stargoat: yeah, good luck defining "what really matters". It's pretty subjective.
(18:10:25) corpus: but yeah, for me, if I get my grades this summer and get into my uni, the people I'll meet there and the qualifications I'll come out with after 3 years will allow me to spend the rest of my life doing things I want to do with far greater ease
(18:10:32) Kobel: Joking aside, if I were you I wouldn't totally fuck off in school
(18:10:38) Kobel: But I wouldn't care too much either
(18:10:46) Kobel: It's not really all that important, comparitively
(18:10:54) Jr: I'm not blasting school
(18:10:54) corpus: whereas some of my peers, who haven't worked so much, will get stuck in jobs they don't like and have to work much harder for the rest of their lives
(18:10:55) Jr: rather
(18:11:01) Jr: I'm more like treading
(18:11:02) corpus: some of the same peers will also do well, though, i hope
(18:11:11) corpus: I really hope I don't end up on the stuck in jobs camp
(18:11:15) corpus: time will tell, eh wot
(18:11:24) corpus: in*
(18:11:30) Kobel: School tells a lot less than skill and attitude
(18:11:33) DeM0nFiRe: I was close to failing english ealier
(18:11:36) Kobel: When it comes to where people end up
(18:11:36) DeM0nFiRe: That would have sucked
(18:11:52) corpus: not necessarily, Kobel
(18:11:58) Jr: I got off to a rocky start this year
(18:11:58) corpus: it varies wildly from person to person
(18:12:00) DeM0nFiRe: Cos I have like 7 maths, 4 sciences, 5 sociel siences
(18:12:00) ***Stargoat lives for the day where human success is guaged not by the job you hold, but the contribution you make.
(18:12:05) Jr: and I've been having a hard time getting back up
(18:12:06) DeM0nFiRe: And I would have had to redo a year
(18:12:10) Jr: on top of everything
(18:12:12) corpus: everyone has something they're good at, really
(18:12:23) corpus: but the school system largely focuses on english, maths, science
(18:12:25) corpus: at least here
(18:12:30) Jr: same here
(18:12:32) corpus: which just isn't appropriate for a lot of people
(18:12:37) Jr: :/
(18:12:38) Kobel: Yes corpus very good luck is a factor :P
(18:12:39) DeM0nFiRe: corpus except me I am good at everything :)

(18:13:15) DeM0nFiRe: I don;t have soemthing I am good at, I have everything!
(18:13:17) corpus: but yeah, the government at the minute has this thing about getting as many people as possible into university
(18:13:19) DeM0nFiRe: (I am totally kidding)
(18:13:20) Jr: the problem is with the execution
(18:13:28) DeM0nFiRe: Is it just me
(18:13:35) corpus: so you're getting lots of people just going to university for the sake of university
(18:13:38) DeM0nFiRe: Or should computer science be more heavily emphasized?
(18:13:39) corpus: because it's the Thing you Do
(18:13:47) corpus: rather than because it's actually a good idea for them
(18:13:47) RinkuHero: that just lowers the standards of college
(18:13:48) Kobel: Computer science is great
(18:13:54) corpus: like, they do Media Studies or something
(18:13:54) RinkuHero: until it's like an extension of high school
(18:14:06) Kobel: corpus, they should work more on instilling a love of learning
(18:14:06) Stargoat: what's good for the goose is good for the gander, corpus. Now get back in line.
(18:14:06) Jr: oh god I hate that
(18:14:08) corpus: and also, the price of university is going up as a result
(18:14:08) DeM0nFiRe: Like, programming, specifically game programming, is the fastest growing industry

(18:14:14) Jr: that is why I am taking a gap year
(18:14:18) corpus: but there's also more financial support available, I guess
(18:14:19) Kobel: Then schooling would naturally emerge from that
(18:14:24) RinkuHero: i don't think programming is the fastest growing
(18:14:29) RinkuHero: i heard it was health-related jobs
(18:14:33) Jr: I don't want to go straight to MORE SCHOOL after hs
(18:14:36) RinkuHero: at least in the US
(18:14:38) DeM0nFiRe: Nah, the video game industry is
(18:14:39) Andy_W: also culinary arts
(18:14:45) RinkuHero: where did you hear that?
(18:14:53) Jr: corpus
(18:14:54) Jr: sleep
(18:14:55) DeM0nFiRe: Like US DoE or something like that
(18:15:02) Jr: rest your weary mind
(18:15:02) corpus: Stargoat: I don't have a problem - my skillset lies largely in academic and artistic fields, which are served by this school system
(18:15:12) DeM0nFiRe: 'cos entertainment has always been big
(18:15:13) corpus: but a lot of people aren't served very well by it
(18:15:22) DeM0nFiRe: But now you can pay $40 for 100 hours in a video game
(18:15:34) DeM0nFiRe: or $10 for 1 1/2 hour at the theatre
(18:15:45) Jr: I love learning, I'm a scholar at heart
(18:15:50) DeM0nFiRe: Video Games are the cheapest form of entertainment
(18:15:57) Stargoat: I could either buy X-Com or eat.
(18:15:59) Jr: but institutionalized schooling is just that
(18:15:59) corpus: yeah
(18:16:06) Jr: it's very clinical
(18:16:08) corpus: I think the schooling system could do with a lot of improvement
(18:16:19) Jr: and you have to really work with the system
(18:16:24) DeM0nFiRe: The school system needs modernization
(18:16:26) corpus: at this stage, I'm half motivated by the desire to learn and improve myself

(18:17:16) DeM0nFiRe: I work harder now so I can work less later XD
(18:17:24) corpus: but once I'm out, it'll be much more about personal interest
(18:17:27) Jr: I don't mind working hard
(18:17:31) Stargoat: something that needs to be done, in my opinion, as a government-schooled-kid, is abolish private schooling. It creates an un-natural rift. Why should one kid have a (supposedly)  better education, just because their parents can afford it?

(18:17:57) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, Jr, I agree, but I would like to decide what I want to focus on rather than having some throw away job to keep paying bills
(18:18:00) LordMetroid: Coding on my own projects doesn't even feel like work, I do it all day and all night long without getting tired, actually it is fun!

(18:19:31) corpus: I have some impeaching panties, Stargoat
(18:19:32) DeM0nFiRe: private school education is not as great as you'd thin

(18:20:01) DeM0nFiRe: The highest SAT and AP scores in my area come from my school, which is the moist inner city urban public school around
(18:20:03) LordMetroid: Why would you want to get into the AAA game industry, it is the lowest paid CS work with the shitties work conditions
(18:20:12) RinkuHero: the winners of spelling bees are usually homeschooled
(18:20:15) DeM0nFiRe: most not moist 0_0
(18:20:16) RinkuHero: homeschooled kids dominate that
(18:20:32) corpus: in england, the highest scores in the area are almost unfailingly coming from the private schools
(18:20:35) Jr: I was homeschooled
(18:20:37) Jr: for years
(18:20:42) Jr: until highschool
(18:20:44) DeM0nFiRe: A public school is easier, which gives the top kids more time for self study
(18:20:47) Jr: so I'm a bit cynical now
(18:20:49) corpus: really, Jr?
(18:20:50) RinkuHero: my cousins are also homeschooled
(18:20:53) Jr: truth
(18:20:56) RinkuHero: because they're religious crazies
(18:21:00) corpus: personally, I wouldn't want to be homeschooled
(18:21:04) RinkuHero: (jehovah's witnesses)
(18:21:06) Rock_D: notch: ah you're rolling your own, I thought I'd save myself some effort by using the slick util library, but it turns out it has a bug or something. It's not that complicated if I look at its code.
(18:21:06) LordMetroid: public school has the shitties work conditions though
(18:21:10) corpus: you gain a lot from the social interaction of school
(18:21:21) Jr: oh, it's not like there is no social interaction
(18:21:26) corpus: in terms of learning how to deal people, learning people skills
(18:21:27) Stargoat: corpus: doesn't england call private schools "public" schools? I seem to recall something silly like that. With that in mind, do you mean government or non-government schools?
(18:21:28) LordMetroid: Yeah like how it feels like being bullied
(18:21:30) Xander: My friend was homeschooled for years 8-11.. and she had some serious trouble once we got to college
(18:21:40) corpus: sure, there isn't none, but nowhere near as much as you'd get in a school with 300+ kids
(18:21:41) Jr: I was meeting with other homeschoolers and stuff
(18:21:49) DeM0nFiRe: Well, my cousin is homeschooled and she is legit a social retard. She has a lisp, she can't get along with others, it;s pretty bad
(18:21:54) corpus: LordMetroid: well, some people are bullies
(18:22:03) DeM0nFiRe: Haha, corpus, my school has over 1400 kids in it XD
(18:22:11) RinkuHero: mine had 5000
(18:22:11) Jr: mine has like
(18:22:14) corpus: if you're the type of person that gets bullied, it isn't going to benefit you to find out 7 years later in your life what it's like
(18:22:14) RinkuHero: my high school anyway
(18:22:15) LordMetroid: And it is stupid to gang up people who have no interest in each other just because
(18:22:19) Jr: 700 or something?
(18:22:23) Xander: Likewise, mine did at least. (1400.. not 5000.. that's insane)
(18:22:24) corpus: my high school has
(18:22:27) corpus: 700-odd, yeah
(18:22:28) corpus: I think
(18:22:37) Jr: corpus, yeah
(18:22:37) corpus: wait, it'll be 900-odd including the sixth form
(18:22:40) Jr: I see that
(18:22:41) DeM0nFiRe: You know what is sad?
(18:22:44) corpus: my primary school had 300-odd though
(18:22:53) DeM0nFiRe: We have one of teh biggest schools in teh area, but we have the smallest track team :(
(18:22:55) corpus: which is pretty huge for a primary school, at least in this city
(18:22:55) Jr: I don't think people should homeschool through high school
(18:23:00) Jr: that's hard to do
(18:23:02) RinkuHero: thta sounds small to me
(18:23:08) RinkuHero: my primary school had at least 1000

(18:24:19) corpus: most of the kids i've met who've been homeschooled have had trouble coping "normally" with the things life throws at them
(18:24:23) DeM0nFiRe: Which is actually only like 2 or 3 people
(18:24:24) RinkuHero: i think they're different socially
(18:24:24) LordMetroid: No, you do not miss out on the social side if you are being homeschooled
(18:24:24) DeM0nFiRe: but still XD
(18:24:29) RinkuHero: but i don't necessarily see that as a problem
(18:24:39) RinkuHero: one could say that it's the people who went to public school that have the problem
(18:24:42) Xander: I think it's nice in theory.. but there's a lot I don't want to expose my children to that I know they need to be exposed to
(18:24:44) RinkuHero: it's all in what you see as normal
(18:24:49) DeM0nFiRe: Rinku, turning out manipulative and unable to speak properly is never a good thing
(18:24:52) LordMetroid: Normal school is the worst form of indoctrination there fricking is
(18:25:03) LordMetroid: It was designed to make mindless zombies for fucks sake
(18:25:08) Stargoat: I remember a kid who got bullied, then spent the rest of his school life at homeschool. I don't know if that's how things work.
(18:25:16) corpus: you could, RinkuHero, but societies are built around a vague set of definitions of what is normal
(18:25:18) DeM0nFiRe: LordMetroid: it may have been desigtned for that\
(18:25:21) RinkuHero: yes
(18:25:23) DeM0nFiRe: But that is not what it does at all
(18:25:26) corpus: they tend to be nebulous, but they are there
(18:25:28) RinkuHero: but public school is relatively new
(18:25:33) LordMetroid: Now it just makes mindless TV zombies
(18:25:33) Thi3f left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(18:25:37) RinkuHero: so i've a hard time believing that everyone 1800 and prior wasn't socialized
(18:25:40) RinkuHero: or had major social problems
(18:25:45) RinkuHero: just cause they didn't have school back then
(18:25:56) corpus: sure, so the homeschoolers weren't as isolated
(18:26:01) LordMetroid: People can learn perfectly by themselves
(18:26:03) DeM0nFiRe: Rinku, from 1800 prior there was a great deal less socializing at all
(18:26:09) DeM0nFiRe: ALl time was spent on farms
(18:26:09) LordMetroid: If they get pitched into real life
(18:26:23) LordMetroid: Rather than that artificial nomans shithole they call school these days
(18:26:29) Stargoat: this is true, LordMetroid. Most of the material we are "taught" at unit is available in the public domain. There's no real need to attend lectures.
(18:26:37) corpus: but yeah, RinkuHero, because everyone at the time was being homeschooled or something else
(18:26:38) Stargoat: uni*
(18:26:47) corpus: whatever, but, crucially, not being herded to the local public schools
(18:26:55) RinkuHero: there was also
(18:26:57) corpus: they weren't isolated from the majority
(18:26:59) DeM0nFiRe: LordMetroid, school itself does not breed zombies, or conformists I assume you are talking about
(18:27:00) RinkuHero: socialization thrugh church and such
(18:27:01) RinkuHero: through*
(18:27:03) corpus: yeah
(18:27:03) DeM0nFiRe: Society does that
(18:27:09) LordMetroid: Where you do not produce anything useful and you lose motivation, independence, and inovation

(18:27:28) RinkuHero: often 20 people living in a single home
(18:27:36) RinkuHero: so you could get pretty good socialization just from that
(18:27:37) DeM0nFiRe: LordMetroid, if you let school take away your motivation, yo unever had motivation
(18:27:44) Jrsquee [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(18:27:55) LordMetroid: Yes it does, bells and group pressure, short classes of 1 hour where you can not focus on anything until you are done is all it takes.
(18:28:02) corpus: the thing is, LordMetroid, most people don't want to be renegades
(18:28:04) DeM0nFiRe: And not producing useful things is your own choice
(18:28:13) corpus: they want to fit in and be comfortable and generally liked

(19:36:04) Andy_W: repeating effect
(19:36:08) RinkuHero: without medics marines are useless for instance

(19:36:17) Andy_W is now known as Andy_aWay
(19:36:17) Kobel: Okay that's what I thought
(19:36:20) RinkuHero: no valkaries, corsairs, or defilers
(19:36:27) RinkuHero: so nothing really to counter mass air
(19:36:33) RinkuHero: er, not defiler
(19:36:35) RinkuHero: devourerer
(19:36:41) Kobel: Yeah I remember muta rushes were big
(19:36:48) RinkuHero: there are also no lurkers and no dark templar
(19:36:53) RinkuHero: making detection kind of useless
(19:37:15) Kobel: Well... it's nice to be able to see wraiths
(19:37:19) RinkuHero: yes
(19:37:27) RinkuHero: and observers
(19:37:40) RinkuHero: but you don't need detection as early
(19:37:42) Kobel: But I guess turrets can handle that mostly
(19:37:46) RinkuHero: since there's no fear of lurker or dark templar rushes

(19:39:41) Kobel: Two possibilities for things I can do next in my project. I can build prototypes in Flash, or I can try to port my Flash game engine to my C++ framework
(19:39:57) KareemK: wtf is mare nostrum
(19:40:04) Cow: make prototypes
(19:40:06) Cow: nude tetris

(19:40:19) Cow: match the penis blocks with the corresponding vaginablocks
(19:40:28) Kobel: Yeah... hm. I can at least lay foundations for prototypes
(19:40:30) KareemK: oh its a red orchestra mod
(19:40:40) Kobel: Get the basic jump and run working before I get into the tricky stuff
(19:40:40) KareemK: red orchestra sucks balls though

(19:56:33) Solifuge: ACtually yeah, Brood War did a lot to balance the factions, and made Air Combat slightly more tactical
(19:56:59) Solifuge: each race got a dedicated Air vs. Air, often with Support abilities

(20:09:37) Kobel: You could become a raper!
(20:09:43) Andy_W: there you go, exactly what i had in mind when i said sing the awful
(20:09:44) Kobel: All you need is a gat
(20:09:57) Andy_W: and the word "surprise"
(20:10:08) Z80: Hahahah, Kobel.
(20:11:29) Kobel: Probably not a good idea though, they're charging EVERYONE as an adult nowadays
(20:11:40) Kobel: I think they're maybe a little unclear on the concept but okay
(20:11:54) Drakkar [Drakkar@ip98-167-159-87.ph.ph.cox.net] entered the room.
(20:12:23) Andy_W: we had an assembly about "sexting" the other day

(20:12:39) Kobel: Ahhhhhh?
(20:12:43) Andy_W: we learned a lot
(20:12:56) Kobel: Was it sexy?
(20:12:59) Andy_W: it's apparently much like texting, except more fun for everyone
(20:13:10) Kobel: Hard to be less fun
(20:13:18) Andy_W: quite.
(20:14:05) Andy_W: but yeah they had a federal agent come in and tell us he was gonna charge us all with creation of child pronography
(20:14:49) Kobel: But within the rigidly erected contraints of texting, I can see how it might be nice to supercede stiff formality.
(20:15:19) Andy_W: sexting includes pictures, though.
(20:15:37) Kobel: Haha wait what
(20:15:39) Blood_War left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(20:15:53) Kobel: He'd charge you with creation of child pornography?
(20:15:54) Andy_W: yep its basically just sending nudes over the phone
(20:15:57) Andy_W: yep
(20:15:58) RinkuHero: there are girls who were charged with possession of child pornography for taking pictures of themselves and sending them to their boyfriend
(20:16:01) RinkuHero: yes
(20:16:03) Kobel: That is the craziest shit
(20:16:07) Kobel: I know, I've heard of that
(20:16:13) Kobel: It's STILL the craziest shit
(20:16:22) Siiseli: RinkuHero, :DD
(20:16:22) Andy_W: its big news lately because a girl killed herself after shit got spread around

(20:16:56) ***Siiseli sexts Drakkar 
(20:16:58) Kobel: Wait that was insensitive
(20:16:59) Andy_W: however we all said that was the fault of the idiot boyfriend who spread it around, and not that of the sexting in general
(20:17:00) Drakkar: thats kind of the thing
(20:17:01) Siiseli: Kobel, yes yes they are
(20:17:01) Kobel: Forget I said that.
(20:17:04) Drakkar: all kids are retarded
(20:17:09) Drakkar: don't disagree
(20:17:14) Andy_W: everyone is retarded

(20:19:17) Drakkar: I know the answer to the atari 2600 one so
(20:19:18) Andy_W: even though it will break your heart very slightly, you should play it anyway
(20:19:21) Drakkar: is the tig fathom cool?

(20:20:19) Kobel: I'm curious to see Flixel's source
(20:20:24) Kobel: I may have to steal some ideas
(20:20:43) Andy_W: i gotta learn flash so i can use flixel excessively when it is released
(20:21:13) Kobel: I'd rather use my sexcellent engine but I'd like to troll Flixel for ideas to add to it
