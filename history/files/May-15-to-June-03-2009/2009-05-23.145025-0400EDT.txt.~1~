(14:50:28) KareemK: They've installed video cameras in urinals at Houston's Hobby Airport. At least they weren't sneaky about it — they posted a notice saying 'Automatic infrared flush sensors also provide video monitoring for security purposes.'
(14:50:33) KareemK: hahaha
(14:51:21) JohannesG: haha
(14:52:47) KareemK: i wanna have my share of airport fun this year
(14:53:04) JohannesG left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving.).
(14:53:11) KareemK: like last year in turkey i had to turn on the laptop before boarding the plane for the security officers
(14:53:32) Z80: My life's a wreck, I fought on the poop deck, lost my ship, now I gotta eject from this ship that's been paying me, hating me, never ever fading... Me? I got nothin' to lose, I could die on the streets and still be droppin' rappin' feats.
(14:53:41) KareemK: because a laptop that reaches bios without exploding is indeed not a security concern
(14:53:48) KareemK: while one that doesnt is...
(14:54:36) fartron: "this looks like a bomb. push the button while you stand in this crowded place to prove to me it isn't"
(14:55:52) KareemK: haha yea exactly

(15:36:47) Z80_: I'll play this Karaoke game.

(15:41:11) Ciahnensy: I'd throw gold bars at anyone to make more Uberleben.
(15:43:19) Xander: haha
(15:43:32) Xander: Karaoke game?
(15:44:01) Z80_: Yes, but it was not being cooperative.
(15:46:50) Xander: how unsatisfactory
(15:48:46) Xander: wow, I just discovered a new bodily reaction I can only describe as a 'Priderection'

(15:50:41) Androu1: Explain this Priderection, Xander
(15:51:31) Xander: Just reading the post-mortem of Anthony Burch's 'Runner', and he mentioned it was really goddamn cool seeing it on TIGSource
(15:51:55) Xander: Which caused my underpants to sever with furious hot blooded manliness
(15:51:59) postlogic: Haha, awesome. I'm showing my girlfriend IRC through mibbit (she moved in with me today!) and apparently you can auto-translate.
(15:52:05) postlogic: So she is now talkign in finnish.
(15:52:26) Xander: woahs? auto-translate. That's pretty awesome
(15:52:36) Kasran: Indeed.
(15:52:44) postlogic: Quite.
(15:52:45) Kasran: Mibbit has an auto-translate feature
(15:52:55) postlogic: My advanced terminal irc client (irssi) has no such thing
(15:53:00) postlogic: I must create a perl script for this.
(15:53:40) plachenko left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(15:54:39) Gaeel: postlogic, make it use google translate?
(15:54:56) Gaeel: I think I'll attempt a script that does that on Xchat
(15:55:24) postlogic: Hm, tempting.
(16:00:44) Fraeon: This has got to be the funniest SF4 video so far: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eck_jO_QwBU&feature=related
(16:01:17) Xander: Did anyone not play 'The Runner' when it was featured on the front page (Gun running from girls, GIANT SPEECH BUBBLES etc)? It apparently didn't get featured anywhere else bar us, and I'm trying to figure out why that is
(16:02:43) postlogic: Gaeel: Personally i'm a fan of services with an API, though.
(16:02:48) postlogic: Google probably has one.
(16:06:06) RinkuHero: what's 'the runner'
(16:06:09) RinkuHero: i don't remember it
(16:07:00) anosou: So, everyone everywhere, what are you working on atm?
(16:07:16) ***Kasran is listening to music
(16:07:25) anosou: That's not work D:
(16:07:37) Kasran: More specifically, http://www.bitkins.com/releases/btkn004
(16:07:44) Kasran: I am also working on an IRC bot.
(16:07:48) anosou: mmm irc bots
(16:07:53) Kasran: Or I would be, if I had ideas for features.
(16:07:59) anosou: I've had some good times with an FF rip-off hack'n'slash bot
(16:08:04) Kasran: Heh
(16:08:17) anosou: Damn, I had forgotten all about netlabels :O
(16:08:52) Xander: RinkuHero; http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/04/20/runner-wip - It was this.
(16:09:42) Xander: Reading the post-mortem at the moment where the creator is talking about how he feels he somehow made the most derivative artgame
(16:10:03) ***anosou gets interested
(16:10:56) Xander: So, it either might not have cross-pollinated to other blogs because of the compeition angle (He's an editor of Destructoid), or that people just didn't like it, or that it just wasn't very interesting
(16:12:06) anosou: "Destructoid? Not indie enough" - extreme-indie-gamer.wut
(16:12:14) Kasran: xD
(16:12:15) anosou: OH right, IRC doesn't do italic ._.
(16:14:17) Arne: wow, quote a quadruple fart
(16:14:40) Arne: Quite
(16:14:56) Arne: the PrrrOOMRTROOMP kind
(16:15:11) Arne: tmi?
(16:15:22) Xander: hahah
(16:15:24) Kasran: xD
(16:16:00) Arne: I think it's the nuts
(16:16:03) Arne: raisins do it too
(16:16:54) Xander: I just feel so bad for some weird reason. Like I know the website isn't indie, but this guy makes a 'Wrath of Transparentor' reference as an example of something done better than his own game, which strike me was pretty indie
(16:17:13) anosou: I agree.
(16:17:29) anosou: The indie scene is strange :/
(16:17:43) Kasran: xD
(16:18:15) Xander: I'm not sure what kind of solution I'm trying to find here. I just know that I feel bad for him and I sort of want to try and help out even though I have no power in that regard. I've no idea what I want to try and do.. but I think TIG has a kind of support role
(16:18:39) anosou: Just make sure to write a post where you say the game is awesome.
(16:18:40) RinkuHero: oh, i think i remember seeing that game
(16:18:55) Arne: what's the html for abbreviations again?
(16:18:56) RinkuHero: the runner i mean
(16:18:58) Xander: Heh, well I wouldn't just out and out say 'its awesome!' regardless
(16:19:04) Arne: like RPS = Rock paper scissors
(16:19:10) RinkuHero: i think the #1 suggestion would be to improve the graphics
(16:19:14) Arne: abbrev?
(16:19:15) RinkuHero: that screenshot just doesn't look appealing
(16:19:17) anosou: hyper text mark-up language or something :#
(16:19:28) RinkuHero: the screenshot has the largest effect on whether people try a game
(16:19:50) anosou: Xander: I wasn't all that serious but well.. I mean, just cover it and talk about it. No need to be over-positive or negative
(16:19:59) Xander: That's true
(16:20:04) anosou: all publicity is good publicity
(16:20:13) Kasran: Not true
(16:20:18) RinkuHero: like, those buildings could have windows
(16:20:21) anosou: Yes true.
(16:20:21) Arne: <abbr title=""></abbr>
(16:20:21) RinkuHero: glowing windows
(16:20:30) RinkuHero: and the road could have a texture
(16:20:32) Kasran: Oh wait, I dunno what I'm talking about. *runs away*
(16:20:40) RinkuHero: instead of just being filled grey
(16:21:00) anosou: Kasran: haha don't, it's very debatable. Bad publicity isn't necessarily good publicity (although I think so)
(16:21:08) Kasran: :P
(16:21:12) anosou: As long as people talk about your game, something good will come from that
(16:21:20) Kasran: Haha true
(16:21:43) michael [michael@71-20-146-50.war.clearwire-wmx.net] entered the room.
(16:22:06) C418: a wild michael appears
(16:22:17) Kasran: What do you do?
(16:22:20) Kasran: >attack
(16:22:26) ***michael falls asleep
(16:22:32) Kasran: :P
(16:22:45) jsticker: Hi
(16:22:46) RinkuHero: i think i probably looked atht he screenshot and thought
(16:22:50) anosou: Microsoft should launch Community Games worldwide already
(16:22:54) RinkuHero: 'this looks like a boring track and field style racing game'
(16:22:56) C418: making ambient sounds is dull work
(16:22:58) C418: I hate it
(16:23:01) RinkuHero: perhaps that's just a poor choice of screenshot
(16:23:14) Arne: I'm not man to watch Grave of the Fireflies without breaking down
(16:23:14) anosou: I wanna go through that steaming pile of crap that is the Community Game's catalogue and find the gems
(16:23:14) C418: specral repair this, specral repair that, denoise...
(16:23:24) Arne: so I haven't watch it and pretend that I'm still a man
(16:23:41) Xander: haha
(16:24:09) Xander: Trino was pretty good, one of the fairly recently released ones I think
(16:24:34) anosou: Yeah, saw some screenshots that looked promising
(16:25:27) jsticker: What is up guys
(16:25:39) jsticker: TF2 with all TIGers is good fun
(16:25:51) Xander: Oh awesome
(16:26:06) jsticker: Sup Xander
(16:26:08) Xander: I'll have to join in that one day
(16:26:18) jsticker: You do
(16:26:25) jsticker: It was really good
(16:26:40) jsticker: The item system is still fucked up
(16:26:55) jsticker: But at least good playing mates can bring some fun
(16:27:09) Xander: I'm currently facing unsolicited guilt about Anthony Burch's post-mortem of his game. I think I'll just put up a post on the front page and do the whole dickish-personal-opinion thing in the 'read more'
(16:27:27) jsticker: Hm?
(16:27:48) Xander: It's wrong of me to use TIG like my own personal blog but I think so long as it's in the support role of another indie dev it could be excused...
(16:28:18) Xander: Well I hadn't realised that Burch's 'The Runner' was only featured by us. That was it. Not even Indiegames covered it
(16:29:08) Xander: I've covered things I haven't even liked before so I wasn't sure why no one mentioned it existed
(16:29:44) jsticker: Don't feel guilt about that
(16:29:46) Xander: I know it's not strictly a game, its part of this interactiveart thing, whatever the developer wants to label for themselves I've decided
(16:30:09) jsticker: As long as you don't use it as your <i>personality superiority</i> blog
(16:30:23) plachenko [hot@c-98-216-4-48.hsd1.nh.comcast.net] entered the room.
(16:30:26) Kasran: Hello
(16:30:30) jsticker: Hello
(16:30:37) Xander: "GET THE FUCK OFF MY TIG!" etc?
(16:31:08) Xander: That might be somewhat.. egotistical. It's funny that I don't think I've ever even had a conversation with Derek before. I have such a weird role in this site...
(16:31:20) jsticker: More like "Hey guys, this is what I enjoy: TIGIRC, game x and game y. So here's the deal about game y, which I like. etc"
(16:32:00) jsticker: You've not done that so far
(16:32:02) jsticker: Just saying
(16:32:07) jsticker: Don't feel guilty
(16:32:25) jsticker: TIGS is a lot better place if there's constant frontpage updates
(16:32:47) smn is now known as smn`offline
(16:33:05) Xander: Yeah, we do have a bit of a fail structure where that's concerned. Sometimes it's happened where there hasn't been an update for 4 days

(16:35:14) jsticker: Stupid Chinese movies without english subtitles
(16:35:19) Xander: http://www.derekyu.com/images/art/zangief.jpg
(16:35:29) The_Doctor: What a terrible day
(16:35:30) jsticker: Why would I want to watch a chinese movie with chinese subtitles :I
(16:36:16) jsticker: ossum, Xander
(16:36:34) jsticker: good frame too
(16:36:52) Fraeon: What a terrible night to have a curse
(16:37:04) Xander: Trouble Doctor?
(16:37:17) Fraeon: jsticker, what Chinese movie are you watching, anyway?
(16:37:23) The_Doctor: One hour of sleep, work, flat tire, no shower.
(16:37:25) Xander: Yeah, I was curious what Derek'd been up to lately so  went investigating
(16:37:26) jsticker: Chan Mat, Fraeon
(16:37:26) Fraeon: If it's not wuxia, why are you watching it?
(16:37:27) The_Doctor: In a nutshell
(16:37:40) jsticker: I watch it because it seems interesting
(16:38:38) Xander: ouch
(16:45:02) michael: apparently, my universities financial aid department  can only write emails in ALL CAPS
(16:45:07) michael: > _ <
(16:45:13) Z80_: Anyone here tried Damnation?
(16:45:30) Z80_: It looks like it could be fun.
(16:45:42) Xander: oh bless
(16:46:08) Xander: Rock Paper Shotgun and Eurogamer both seem to describe it as a spectacular failure in so many ways
(16:46:38) Xander: Which is weird because from the preview things a while back it looked pretty solid.
(16:46:54) Xander is now known as Xandillbebacklater
(16:46:55) Z80_: Aaw, okay.
(16:46:58) Z80_: Is there a demo?
(16:47:30) jsticker: Hmm, Dog Day Afternoon
(16:47:37) jsticker: Should watch that too
(16:47:41) jsticker: Z80_, I'm currenly downloading it
(16:47:48) jsticker: Should finish tomorrow, maybe monday
(16:48:01) jsticker: I'll let you know how badly it sucks...
(16:48:21) Z80_: Ah, cool.

(16:52:34) C418: FUCK
(16:52:43) jsticker: restart steam
(16:52:47) jsticker: That fixes it for me
(16:52:48) RinkuHero: that's never happened to me
(16:52:51) C418: I do that now
(16:52:52) RinkuHero: and i use steam a lot
(16:53:10) shinygerbil: it often happens when there's a new big update out
(16:53:12) Z80: It happened to me when the Spyper update was--
(16:53:13) Z80: Yeah.
(16:53:19) jsticker: shinygerbil!
(16:53:20) RinkuHero: ah
(16:53:22) C418: and what is the password of hideous' server?
(16:53:25) shinygerbil: jsticker !
(16:53:26) jsticker: pineapple
(16:53:32) C418: that makes things easier
(16:53:39) jsticker: It was jolly good fun, shinygerbil
(16:53:45) C418: steam is too busy.
(16:53:47) jsticker: Did you get any other item then?
(16:53:48) shinygerbil: it was, jsticker 
(16:53:56) shinygerbil: i got fucking THREE BACKBURNERS
(16:54:00) Z80: Yeah the password changed.
(16:54:00) jsticker: :D
(16:54:06) C418: my game is updated 100%
(16:54:11) C418: AND IT DOESN'T START.
(16:54:18) jsticker: I only got the Cloat And Dagger Clock
(16:54:20) jsticker: In 7 hours
(16:54:34) shinygerbil: C418: every time you start up a steam game it authenticates with servers
(16:54:36) C418: my steam ticket has expired. I have to reenter my steam password
(16:54:41) shinygerbil: so if the servers are busy
(16:54:51) shinygerbil: you might not be able to start the game
(16:55:01) C418: shitty steam is shitty
(16:55:04) shinygerbil: yes
(16:55:06) shinygerbil: occasionally
(16:55:13) shinygerbil: mostly, though, it's good
(16:55:16) Z80: Steam is mostly great.

(17:17:17) shinygerbil: pyro is just the most fun class, for me
(17:17:43) BlademasterBobo: I think spy is more fun

(18:48:49) PFawkes: I have a ps2 dualshock controller with adapter >.>
(18:48:54) squiggly_p: White Butterfly
(18:48:59) squiggly_p: and ANYONE beaten it?
(18:49:01) PFawkes: I don't need a logitech gamepad
(18:49:08) PFawkes: er., I think I did
(18:49:10) PFawkes: I forget
(18:49:16) Xander: Though it doesn't let you use both sticks.. it's a single stick shooter SYNSO... which is weird
(18:49:26) C418: this is a before and after of a field recording
(18:49:27) C418: http://c418.c4.ohost.de/host/imagess/rgh1243118959j.png
(18:49:29) PFawkes: odd
(18:49:40) C418: look at how much junk I had to remove from very expensive equipment
(18:49:41) squiggly_p: i want to unlock that other ship so badly, but I can only get past two or three bosses
(18:49:43) jsticker: http://new.mylifeisaverage.com/ hahaah
(18:49:48) PFawkes: Raiden Fighter Aces!
(18:49:49) C418: I'll be lucky if I still can use this
(18:49:51) PFawkes: Must OWN
(18:49:52) Xander: oh fuck, that's white butterfly
(18:49:55) Xander: goddamn that game
(18:50:03) PFawkes: :(
(18:50:06) PFawkes: It's only 20 bucks too

(18:50:58) Z80_: "Today, I left my train pass at home. I ride the bus so it was okay. MLIA"
(18:51:05) PFawkes: Hey, actually
(18:51:15) PFawkes: did anyone ever, I mean EVER, play Exception Conflict?
(18:51:17) Z80_: "Today, I found out my younger sister is pregnant. Good thing she's 26 and married. MLIA"
(18:51:21) PFawkes: because I want to play it with people
(18:51:31) BlademasterBobo: "Today, I called my teacher "Mum". I was not embarrassed, because I am home-schooled. MLIA. "
(18:51:37) Parthon: MLIA?
(18:51:41) BlademasterBobo: My Life is Average
(18:51:43) Xander: hahahaha
(18:51:44) PFawkes: my life is average
(18:51:44) jsticker: :D
(18:51:45) Parthon: aah
(18:51:46) Xander: That's awesome
(18:51:59) squiggly_p: meh
(18:52:03) PFawkes: it's ok
(18:52:06) Parthon: like "I was late for work again today so I didn't go. But it's okay because I was fired months ago."
(18:52:17) PFawkes: That's more not average
(18:52:23) PFawkes: than average
(18:52:24) Xander: Exception is the one with tonnes of cube right?
(18:52:27) Parthon: heh .. it's average to me
(18:52:30) PFawkes: yes
(18:52:39) PFawkes: exception conflict is a multiplayer thing
(18:52:40) Xander: Yeah, I didn't quite have much luck with that
(18:52:45) Xander: oooooh?
(18:52:49) PFawkes: yep
(18:52:54) PFawkes: multiplayer with lots of cubes
(18:52:59) squiggly_p: how can that dude work at a bank and yet be homeschooled?  I call shenanigans!!!
(18:53:03) BlademasterBobo: "Today, I drank Kool-Aid. A giant pitcher of juice did not break into my home. MLIA. "
(18:53:23) Parthon: I'm disqualified from posting on MLIA :P
(18:53:34) squiggly_p: I used to like "The most boring blog on the internet"
(18:53:34) PFawkes: http://i-saint.skr.jp/exception_conflict/#infomation
(18:53:40) C418: isn't twitter mlia?
(18:53:51) PFawkes: we should get some games going
(18:54:01) Xander: holy hellsauce
(18:54:07) C418: I tried tf2. it never starts
(18:54:08) C418: NEVER
(18:54:11) Xander: I think I will be posting about that this week
(18:54:25) PFawkes: Cool
(18:54:40) PFawkes: there's a team fortress mode
(18:54:50) Xander: haha, C418 attacks using SCATHING SOCIAL COMMENTARY. It's super effective.
(18:55:02) BlademasterBobo: lol
(18:55:20) squiggly_p: game is pretty
(18:55:26) PFawkes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jz8M96nvVU&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi-saint.skr.jp%2Fexception_conflict%2F&feature=player_embedded
(18:56:16) Xander: damn that really does look good. I think I'll play it properly and put it up on the bank holiday
(18:56:23) Xander: I'm so indie I don't recognise national vacations
(18:56:26) PFawkes: But I have never gotten to play online, as with most games
(18:56:37) PFawkes: you know?
(18:56:43) squiggly_p: not a fan of the blurring effect
(18:56:51) PFawkes: you can turn it off
(18:56:56) Xander: Sorry, what did you say? I was too busy sitting waiting in any XBLA game multiplayer lobby
(18:57:20) PFawkes: does XBLA have a game in which you storm an enemy base by flinging 1000 cubes at the opponent... in SPACE?
(18:57:23) PFawkes: I think not :D
(18:57:32) Xander: Multiplayer on XBLA is useless if you don't know someone else who owns every game you own
(18:57:36) PFawkes: also, note that most XBLA lobbies are also barren and empty
(18:57:38) PFawkes: yeah
(18:57:49) PFawkes: like, RType Dimensions... I think I'm the only one who bought it :D
(18:58:25) Xander: haha, I have a copy. But I completely suck at memorisation. Infact I'm really pining for my xbox at the moment
(18:58:46) PFawkes: Ikaruga online would be fun too
(18:58:46) squiggly_p: how many players at once?
(18:58:47) Xander: I left it in Bristol because I was already lugging around three bags and I figured I didn't really need it
(18:58:54) PFawkes: squiggly, in what game?
(18:58:57) Xander: Which I didn't.. until I realised I couldn't play it.. gaaah
(18:58:58) squiggly_p: some of the screens look likt ehre are three or four players
(18:59:00) squiggly_p: exception

(19:02:21) PFawkes: Dr. Manhatten!
(19:02:30) Zaratustra: do not let dr. manhattan touch your genitals.
(19:02:33) Zaratustra: he is not a real doctor.
(19:02:47) PFawkes: he is a doctor in the fourth dimension!
(19:03:06) Z80_: Don't touch my baaaaaalls, don't touch my baaaaaawls.
(19:03:10) Z80_: OH GOD.
(19:03:18) Z80_: Zaratustra, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
(19:03:26) PFawkes: but yeah, let's get a game going, ya/
(19:04:22) Draknek left the room (Ex-Chat).
(19:04:50) squiggly_p: yeah I just downloaded it
(19:04:54) squiggly_p: gotta set it up
(19:05:14) Xander: christ I leave for 2 minutes and this fills up with omnipresent genitals
(19:05:30) PFawkes: hm, I need to redownload it
(19:05:39) PFawkes: won't be too long though
(19:05:55) squiggly_p: PENIS!
(19:06:00) Xander: oh what the fuck? they're advertising FFXIII in LA
(19:06:03) PFawkes: :D
(19:06:12) PFawkes: Don't listen to Ondore's lies!
(19:06:29) Xander: Why advertise a game now that wont be out till next year?
(19:06:50) PFawkes: To get preorders?
(19:07:06) PFawkes: And square always advertises long in advance these days
(19:07:14) PFawkes: FFXII had TV ads like a year in advance
(19:07:20) Xander: http://member.square-enix.com/na/blog/2009/05/snowing-in-la.php#more - MASSIVE ADVERT IS MASSIVE
(19:07:37) Xander: haha, I remember reading an early preview of FFXII in secondary school
(19:07:43) PFawkes: see?
(19:07:46) Xander: and I didn't play it till I was going to university
(19:07:51) PFawkes: and then it was terrible
(19:08:00) Xander: ...yeah...
(19:08:16) Xander: I still liked parts of it, just not the parts I come to Final Fantasy for
(19:08:26) PFawkes: hype = 1/enjoyment
(19:08:42) Xander: There are other RPGs out there which I constantly visit to sate the thirsts Final Fantasies dont quench
(19:08:48) PFawkes: two minutes left :(
(19:09:30) Xander: I don't mind a FF battle system being simple because I could just play Shadow Hearts/Grandia/Atelier Iris/SMT to enjoy that
(19:10:06) PFawkes: I loved JRPGs for a long time
(19:10:10) PFawkes: and got burned out on 'em
(19:10:17) PFawkes: I still like srpgs though
(19:10:42) PFawkes: I think FFXII was actually the last JRPG I ever played
(19:10:43) Xander: I'm really worried that'll happen to me one day
(19:11:05) tantan: dear lord
(19:11:14) PFawkes: Oh hey, download done

(19:11:29) tantan: collabotale
(19:11:30) PFawkes: exception conflict
(19:11:31) tantan: ?
(19:11:41) PFawkes: I'm trying to get a game of Exception Conflict going
(19:11:45) tantan: what is that
(19:11:50) PFawkes: remember exception/
(19:11:53) tantan: no
(19:11:58) PFawkes: the shmup with all the cubes and cube throwing?
(19:12:07) tantan: oh yeah
(19:12:14) tantan: always wanted to try conflict
(19:12:18) PFawkes: this is a multiplayer version, yeah
(19:12:22) tantan: stuck on my netbook though
(19:12:26) PFawkes: I was thinking maybe the Team Fortress mode
(19:12:35) tantan: also i have dinner
(19:12:37) PFawkes: ah
(19:12:51) Xander: does the team fortress mode have random weapon drops?
(19:12:52) squiggly_p: I'm gonna eat real quick and then play :P
(19:12:56) PFawkes: :D
(19:12:57) tantan is now known as tantan{AFK}
(19:13:00) PFawkes: It's not got any weapons
(19:13:22) PFawkes: you can shoot and use your builtup catapult thing
(19:14:59) Xander: Fuckaroo banzai.. that's not one to try to play with a keyboard
(19:15:23) PFawkes: ?
(19:15:27) PFawkes: what?
(19:15:40) Kasran: ...
(19:15:43) Kasran: o.o
(19:16:10) PFawkes: what does that mean>?
(19:16:31) Xander: Meaning I tried to play exception with a keyboard and it was tricky at best
(19:16:31) C418:  don't question the xander
(19:16:45) PFawkes: it works ok
(19:16:51) PFawkes: especially if everyone is doing it :D
(19:16:55) Xander: and Fuckaroo Banzai because it was an exclamation, and Buckaroo Banzai is an awesome film
(19:17:00) C418: the steam servers don't care about you. now shoo
(19:17:15) Xander: which stars ROBOCOP
(19:17:18) PFawkes: :D
(19:17:27) PFawkes: robocop is the best
(19:17:33) PFawkes: the first one was filmed in Texas
(19:17:42) PFawkes: you can go see all the props
(19:17:47) RaidouKuzunoha: Yes, C418. Steam servers are being homo right now.
(19:17:49) Parthon left the room.
(19:17:51) Xander: Probably one of the best film endings there's been
(19:18:56) Xander: RaidouKuzunoha? The Capital's Devil Summoner?!
(19:19:31) gsoto left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(19:19:44) C418: I have five ambient loops. one is not so good. it took two hours to make those
(19:19:45) RaidouKuzunoha: The Capital's Devil Summoner who can't get his fix of TF2
(19:19:48) C418: god I hate this
(19:20:26) C418: most minecraft gamers won't appreciate it anyway. maybe even make it silent so it's like it now is
(19:20:39) Xander: oh shit.. the city is doomed
(19:20:50) PFawkes: well anyway, do we want to play this?
(19:22:19) Xander: guh, I want to get my joypad working, though it's kind of hard in japanese. To Joy2key!
(19:22:21) tantan{AFK}: i have my sound off except for youtube videos
(19:22:49) PFawkes: nice
(19:23:01) PFawkes: why
(19:23:09) PFawkes: ?
(19:23:25) C418: because he hates people like me doing all the teasy work
(19:23:53) Xander: heh
(19:24:05) PFawkes: alas
(19:24:49) PFawkes: man, it looks like exception is written in visual c, which is too bad
(19:25:00) PFawkes: if it was just c, I bet I could have compiled it for linux
(19:25:10) PFawkes: it's all opengl and sdl anyway >.>
(19:25:22) RaidouKuzunoha: Compile what for Linux?
(19:25:44) PFawkes: Exception Conflict >.>
(19:25:54) PFawkes: the game I have been talkin'
(19:26:10) RaidouKuzunoha: Gee, I just woke up from taking a nap :P

(19:28:24) PFawkes: nice
(19:28:43) tantan{AFK} is now known as tantan
(19:29:12) Xander: Problem
(19:29:15) tantan: @palefox: that's not entirely true, i have  it on for most games

(19:45:17) squiggly_p: I've tried a few of the settings, but i can't tell what they are :P
(19:45:19) PFawkes: yes
(19:45:22) squiggly_p: exception conflict
(19:45:27) PFawkes: the toggle under the windows resolution
(19:45:30) PFawkes: is fullscreen on/off
(19:45:59) Z80_: PFawkes the ever-useful knowledge dude.
(19:46:08) PFawkes: you can't do it in-game that I know of, for some reason
(19:46:31) Z80_: I play all games that I can in windowed mode.
(19:46:34) Z80_: Is this normal?
(19:46:37) PFawkes: sure
(19:46:43) squiggly_p: yeah, it looks like to have to restart for any of the settings to take hold
(19:46:44) PFawkes: unless it makes your card go wonky
(19:46:49) Z80_: Or do I have some dysfunction?
(19:46:52) PFawkes: nah

(20:16:11) Jr: because you can't swim or hardly move
(20:17:47) Viridian: Anyone here know of a good image manipulation program for the Mac?  Something along the lines of Paint.Net on the PC?
(20:17:57) tantan: photoshop
(20:17:58) Viridian: That is also free?  VERY important.
(20:17:59) tantan: gimp

(20:20:31) fartron [kish@68.45.219.229] entered the room.
(20:20:44) nyarla: Viridian: the two free ones i've been using are Pixen and Seashore. they aren't very good though. :/
(20:23:20) nyarla: Pixen is pretty much just for pixel art, and it'd be ok but it keeps crashing. Seashore is some simplified version of gimp, but with a photoshop-like UI and built natively for OSX
(20:24:10) anosou: Seashore makes me sad because I don't understand it
(20:24:16) anosou: You could just run Gimp nyarla?
(20:24:32) Cait|Gone is now known as Cait
(20:24:37) nyarla: yeah, i just haven't bothered downloading it yet
(20:25:05) nyarla: and i don't really want to run X11 stuff, though there's probably no reason why not to
(20:25:21) anosou: I see where you're coming from tho.
(20:25:34) nyarla: I don't not understand Seashore, it just doesn't have many features. It's fine for what it is though.. :)
(20:26:07) anosou: I don't understand any image editing app so :3
(20:26:15) anosou: but it seems a bit feature-less, indeed
(20:26:18) nyarla: hehe
(20:26:49) PFawkes [chatzilla@24-155-231-191.dyn.grandenetworks.net] entered the room.
(20:26:57) PFawkes: aloha
(20:27:06) nyarla: there's this other thing, Gimpshop, which i haven't tried.. it's meant to be full gimp but with a photoshop-like UI
(20:27:12) squiggly_p: wb fawkes
(20:27:13) PFawkes: gimpshop is not so good
(20:27:15) nyarla: i think that requires a full gimp installation to run though
(20:27:16) nyarla: ah
(20:27:18) nyarla: doh
(20:27:21) PFawkes: it's not really like photoshop
(20:27:29) squiggly_p: it just adds a parent window
(20:27:31) PFawkes: yes
(20:27:33) PFawkes: that IS useful
(20:27:36) PFawkes: but it's also outdated
(20:27:45) PFawkes: by quite a while
(20:27:51) PFawkes: I think it's still built on 2.2
(20:28:09) squiggly_p: mur
(20:28:16) squiggly_p: I use Paint Tool Sai
(20:28:24) PFawkes: ..."mur"? What does "mur" refer to, in any case?
(20:28:26) squiggly_p: it's not free, but it's inexpensive
(20:28:39) PFawkes: I still use my helpful GIMP program, though it's not so great.
(20:28:45) squiggly_p: it's something i say outloud and I type it often for no reason
(20:28:49) PFawkes: I also have limited access to photoshop in a computer lab
(20:29:21) PFawkes: So that's very useful
(20:29:41) nyarla: Sai looks good.. but the original question was Viridian asking for free image editing software for the mac which wasn't gimp. :)
(20:29:50) PFawkes: Hmm...
(20:29:53) squiggly_p: the only thing Sai doesn't have that I miss is a few of the more advanced filters like curves and stuff like that
(20:29:55) nyarla: luckily i myself rarely need to make graphics
(20:30:15) squiggly_p: i haven't a mac
(20:30:41) squiggly_p: is there a mac port for "pixel"?
(20:31:31) squiggly_p: oh, that's now a pay app as well
(20:31:32) nyarla: ooh, looks like there is
(20:31:34) PFawkes: seashore?
(20:31:35) squiggly_p: blarg
(20:31:49) PFawkes: You can try seashore I suppose
(20:32:22) nyarla: also i just found the pixel painting mac program which is meant to be really good which i had forgotten the name of.. Pixelmator. it isn't free either though.
(20:32:42) PFawkes: http://seashore.sourceforge.net/
(20:32:56) squiggly_p: nothing is free anymore :(
(20:33:03) nyarla: Seashore is what i've been using :) it's alright, just very minimal
(20:33:06) PFawkes: hm
(20:33:10) PFawkes: and you don't want GIMP?
(20:33:49) nyarla: actually Viridian, the person who asked the question and didn't want gimp...hasn't spoken since i mentioned Pixen and Seashore 
(20:33:54) ***nyarla looks at Viridian
(20:34:20) Viridian: I'm currently trying out seashore.
(20:34:23) nyarla: :)
(20:34:33) Viridian: Sorry, someone else IM'd me about it before you mentioned it.
(20:34:39) nyarla: hehe no worries
(20:34:57) PFawkes: gimpshop IS ok
(20:35:05) nyarla: i think i might buy this Pixelmator some time soon
(20:35:08) Viridian: Seashore almost looks good...I just don't like the fact that there isn't a special color for "transparent".
(20:35:30) squiggly_p: meh
(20:36:02) squiggly_p: I've always used just transparent pngs
(20:36:14) PFawkes: I like GIMP but its lack of filters is an issue
(20:36:21) squiggly_p: eww
(20:36:22) PFawkes: I mostly only use them to hide edits though ..>
(20:36:41) squiggly_p: i don't use filters at all
(20:36:54) PFawkes: that just makes them look amateurish instead of clearly photoshopped :D
(20:36:55) squiggly_p: but then, I don't do much photo editing either :p
(20:37:08) PFawkes: I mostly use photoshop and GIMP for art things, mate
(20:37:16) squiggly_p: I paint / draw
(20:37:23) squiggly_p: that's about it
(20:37:29) PFawkes: painting is great
(20:37:51) squiggly_p: Sai is somewhere between Gimp and Corel Painter
(20:37:55) PFawkes: http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2728/2small.jpg but like, this is a photoshop thing
(20:38:14) Kasran: I have to go.

(20:38:48) squiggly_p: it's too cheesy
(20:38:54) PFawkes: :D
(20:39:05) PFawkes: that was for a class
(20:39:09) PFawkes: I had to use filters on it
(20:39:12) squiggly_p: heh
(20:39:28) PFawkes: it looks pretty good all the same >.>
(20:39:32) squiggly_p: a class assignment that forced you to use filters?
(20:39:36) PFawkes: took forever to get the colors right
(20:39:40) squiggly_p: it looks like a photo with filters
(20:39:43) RaidouKuzunoha: Nice filtering, Mr. Fox
(20:39:49) PFawkes: hah
(20:39:51) PFawkes: it is
(20:39:53) squiggly_p: i mean...  it's a nice photo :P
(20:40:03) PFawkes: it was yeah
(20:40:16) PFawkes: except I had to edit it a lot to make it look good
(20:40:29) PFawkes: and then I remembered I had to use filterd
(20:40:32) PFawkes: hah
(20:40:46) squiggly_p: what kind of class was this?
(20:40:55) PFawkes: digital art class
(20:40:55) squiggly_p: and if you sa a design class I'll scream :P
(20:41:02) squiggly_p: that's about as bad
(20:41:05) PFawkes: :)
(20:41:07) PFawkes: yes.
(20:41:18) PFawkes: filters are not neccesarily bad, though
(20:41:23) squiggly_p: see, I was hoping for something like "web design"

(20:41:46) PFawkes: you know?
(20:41:53) PFawkes: because it had to be really large
(20:41:59) PFawkes: and also for >.> printing
(20:42:01) squiggly_p: for print?
(20:42:19) PFawkes: and when you have a poor digital camera and you enlarge it a lot, it looks really bad
(20:42:22) PFawkes: >.>
(20:42:31) squiggly_p: yeah
(20:42:34) PFawkes: like, the shadow is faked because I kind of had to
(20:42:44) squiggly_p: I can see if you did that and then used it as a base for painting it might look really nice
(20:43:17) PFawkes: I think it's the texture that hurts it the most, really
(20:43:22) PFawkes: texturing*
(20:43:43) PFawkes: because you can TELL it's tiled
(20:43:52) PFawkes: especially on the full-size one
(20:44:05) PFawkes: you know what I mean?
(20:44:07) squiggly_p: yeah

(20:50:48) BlademasterBobo: I'm here most of the time
(20:50:50) Siiseli: okay fuck you BlademasterBobo for being such a dick.
(20:50:50) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(20:50:56) BlademasterBobo: Siiseli just quit it
(20:50:58) Jr: Siiseli: he CAN'T
(20:50:59) BlademasterBobo: QUIT IT
(20:51:13) BlademasterBobo: you poop
(20:51:17) Siiseli: Jr, yeah yeah I didn't do anything to him and he starts being a dick like I had done something
(20:51:18) Jr: permanent ops can only be given by the channel founder
(20:51:20) Siiseli: it annoys me
(20:51:25) Siiseli: yeah yeah but you know what I mean
(20:51:27) #tigirc: mode (+o Jr) by BlademasterBobo
(20:51:30) BlademasterBobo: but then
(20:51:32) BlademasterBobo: if jr leaves
(20:51:35) BlademasterBobo: jr no longer is op
(20:51:38) Jr left the room.
(20:51:43) Jr [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(20:51:48) Jr: like that
(20:51:51) Siiseli: and that is what I mean by fancypants system
(20:51:52) PFawkes: no comments :(
(20:51:57) BlademasterBobo: on what
(20:51:58) Jr: naw, that's usual
(20:51:59) Siiseli: in ircnet if you want permaops
(20:52:07) Tasoth: dysfunctional family hour?
(20:52:08) Siiseli: you need to have a bot that handles it for you
(20:52:12) PFawkes: on picture
(20:52:15) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-27-95.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(20:52:23) Siiseli: and when I said that you automatically went to offensive mode
(20:52:26) Siiseli: which is not very nice
(20:52:27) squiggly_p: that's a bot with op that will give op to specific people when they come in
(20:52:28) Siiseli: so don't do that
(20:52:33) squiggly_p: same system, just automated
(20:52:36) RaidouKuzunoha left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(20:52:37) BlademasterBobo: I'm always in offensive mode
(20:52:43) Siiseli: don't be.
(20:52:48) BlademasterBobo: FUCK YOU
(20:52:55) PFawkes: :D
(20:52:56) BlademasterBobo: he said, illustrating a point
(20:52:59) PFawkes: huzzah
(20:52:59) Z80: Hey give me ops I can deal with it well.
(20:53:00) lansing: Siiseli, did you do the reddit clone? it's been 11 hours
(20:53:05) Z80: (Seriously don't.)
(20:53:08) BlademasterBobo: I can't give ops
(20:53:09) BlademasterBobo: ;l
(20:53:13) lansing: begging for ops is lame anyway
(20:53:16) Z80: Well, temp ops.
(20:53:18) Z80: :P
(20:53:18) BlademasterBobo: well
(20:53:18) Siiseli: lansing, no, I did not. 
(20:53:20) BlademasterBobo: nobody is
(20:53:23) Siiseli: I made a blog system though
(20:53:24) lansing: Siiseli, :D
(20:53:26) Siiseli: now adding comments
(20:53:27) Z80: I wasn't being serious, anyway.
(20:53:35) BlademasterBobo: who would even be a good op
(20:53:44) BlademasterBobo: I'm kind of iffy on even me being an op
(20:53:54) Siiseli: xander said he'd want to and I think he wouldn't be that bad an op
(20:53:56) PFawkes: well ok then
(20:53:56) Tasoth: reetva wasn't kidding
(20:53:56) squiggly_p: I'd be a great op if I knew any of the commands and gave a shit
(20:54:00) BlademasterBobo: Xander would be good
(20:54:06) Siiseli: yeah
(20:54:07) PFawkes: Hello :D
(20:54:10) Z80: If I had ops, I wouldn't know what to do.
(20:54:14) Z80: I would freak out.
(20:54:15) BlademasterBobo: you don't do anything
(20:54:16) BlademasterBobo: :U
(20:54:16) Tasoth: I know that technique. The half joke but could be serious the moment someone wants to take it as so
(20:54:17) Siiseli: I'm willing too but I don't mind if you don't op me either.
(20:54:30) Siiseli: I think I'm suitable mostly becouse I don't abuse them and am way too much online
(20:54:30) BlademasterBobo: I don't think I could take that
(20:54:33) BlademasterBobo: siiseli
(20:54:39) BlademasterBobo: >_______>
(20:54:40) Siiseli: and no BlademasterBobo I would not kick you when I get mad
(20:54:45) Siiseli: :D
(20:54:46) PFawkes: Jr
(20:54:49) Tasoth: he'd mute you
(20:54:54) Siiseli: I wouldn't do that either :O
(20:54:58) BlademasterBobo: O:
(20:54:59) Siiseli: becouse that my dear is abusing ops
(20:55:05) PFawkes: can you look at this and comment upon it http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/7943/working2small.jpg
(20:55:05) BlademasterBobo: you can't mute on person
(20:55:07) Siiseli: something a certain pandy does *cough cough*
(20:55:10) BlademasterBobo: or I would've done it
(20:55:13) BlademasterBobo: by now
(20:55:17) BlademasterBobo: to certain people
(20:55:21) Siiseli: :|
(20:55:47) BlademasterBobo: +m only does the entire channel
(20:56:04) Z80: BlademasterBobo would have muted me.
(20:56:05) Z80: :D
(20:56:18) PFawkes: I refuse to be silenced
(20:56:22) BlademasterBobo: no
(20:56:26) ***PFawkes begins to sing Rule Brittania
(20:56:27) ***Z80 eats PFawkes.
(20:56:29) BlademasterBobo: I was thinking more like jollifish
(20:56:35) BlademasterBobo: enough about ops
(20:56:36) Z80: Ah, okay.
(20:56:37) Siiseli: why jollifish?
(20:56:41) ***PFawkes sings Rule Brittania inside Z80
(20:56:52) Jr: pfox
(20:56:52) Siiseli: cos' I don't remember this specific person doing anything
(20:56:53) BlademasterBobo: because, much like you, she irritates the fuck out of me without really even trying to
(20:56:54) Jr: also
(20:56:55) Z80: PFawkes, you're in my stomach.
(20:56:56) Z80: Now.
(20:56:57) Jr: Siiseli: Siiseli you need to have a bot that handles it for you
(20:57:00) PFawkes: and singing
(20:57:04) Jr: espernet uses chanserv
(20:57:05) Jr: to do that
(20:57:09) Z80: And dissolving.
(20:57:13) Jr: chanserv will auto-op you
(20:57:13) Siiseli: BlademasterBobo, has anyone ever told you you're a real asshole?
(20:57:16) BlademasterBobo: yes
(20:57:23) Siiseli: Jr, I noticed
(20:57:26) Siiseli: BlademasterBobo, good.
(20:57:29) Jr: but only the founder or someone with founder op status can do that
(20:57:30) Z80: Siiseli, you have.
(20:57:34) Siiseli: Z80, with reason
(20:57:43) PFawkes: Jr, why did you say my name?
(20:57:49) Jr: you said mine
(20:57:57) Z80: Oh, God, why did I say that?
(20:58:01) PFawkes: I wanted you to look at that thingh
(20:58:03) Jr: [20:54] <PFawkes> Jr
(20:58:07) Z80: Siiseli and Bobo you WILL NOT BICKER.
(20:58:20) Jr: oh
(20:58:27) Jr: Why is the imac black?
(20:58:33) PFawkes: ?
(20:58:38) BlademasterBobo: looks neat pfaweks
(20:58:48) Jr: that was the first thing I noticed
(20:58:50) PFawkes: it's in black and white?
(20:58:53) Jr: huh, the tree!
(20:59:03) Jr: no no, the imac is black
(20:59:10) Jr: like, it should be white
(20:59:17) PFawkes: it really does look like that, though
(20:59:19) PFawkes: it's silver and black
(20:59:19) Jr: I didn't know there were black I macs
(20:59:21) Jr: er
(20:59:21) BlademasterBobo: but then it wouldn't contrast with the wall
(20:59:23) Jr: iMacs
(20:59:34) BlademasterBobo: if it was white
(20:59:36) Jr: that is pretty neat, pfox
(20:59:40) PFawkes: Thanks
(20:59:44) Siiseli: Z80, you know I really don't want to but he seems to not be able to.. not be an asshole towards me.
(20:59:56) Siiseli: but enough about that, really.
(20:59:58) Jr: actually, it's pretty darn clever
(21:00:00) Jr: I like that
(21:00:02) Z80: Siiseli, can you ignore him?
(21:00:03) Jr: heh
(21:00:05) Z80: THE ANSWER: YES.
(21:00:09) Siiseli: Z80, I would like not having to
(21:00:09) BlademasterBobo: hahah
(21:00:21) Jr: I ignored bobo once
(21:00:24) PFawkes: It was pretty hard to do, I know that :)
(21:00:39) BlademasterBobo: I wasn't even trying to be mean to Jr as I recall, although I forget what it was I did exactly
(21:00:54) Z80_ [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.

(21:00:59) Jr: I don't remember either
(21:01:02) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(21:01:09) Jr: which is good
(21:01:16) Jr: it was something petty and silly
(21:01:37) Jr: In time, this too shall pass
(21:01:39) Jr: that's my motto
(21:01:45) Jr: also carpe diem
(21:02:00) Tasoth: how about 'not in the face!'?
(21:02:09) Jr: that's what she says
(21:02:14) PFawkes: Hmm....
(21:02:28) Z80_: "Remember the Simpsons family motto: Not in the face."
(21:02:29) Tasoth: we did that to someone in class recently
(21:02:29) PFawkes: look, isn't this rpgmaker basic artwork? http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm260/Dark_Gaia_Studios/Screen5-1.png
(21:02:39) PFawkes: Or am I imagining it
(21:03:33) Tasoth: she made the statement 'you're really screwing me hard here' quite loudly in the middle of class. One of my compatriots retorted, after a brief pause. 'That's. What. She said'. We all had a hardly laugh as the prof looked at us stumped
(21:04:29) Fraeon: PFawkes, it looks like basic artwork
(21:04:34) squiggly_p: I dunno...  a lot of those types of RPG's sorta blend together for me
(21:04:53) squiggly_p: the only ones that stand out are Mana, Chronotrigger and the various FF games
(21:04:58) PFawkes: It's just odd that there are all these posts about how great the artwork is
(21:04:59) Fraeon: With RPGMaker they blend because they use the same assets half the time
(21:05:00) squiggly_p: as having interesting art
(21:05:03) PFawkes: I dont
(21:05:12) Fraeon: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
(21:05:24) PFawkes: mind them liking the game, but it's not like the graphics can be praised if you appropriate them
(21:05:31) Fraeon: PFawkes, your game is a Final Fantasy fan sequel isn't it?
(21:05:34) PFawkes: ?
(21:05:36) PFawkes: It's not my game
(21:05:40) PFawkes: It
(21:05:45) Siiseli: it's.. gaia?
(21:05:45) Siiseli: :D
(21:05:51) Fraeon: Final Fantasy VII: Cloud's Revenge
(21:05:53) PFawkes: has been posted in the Indie Games forum
(21:05:59) PFawkes: It's not my game, dude
(21:06:11) Fraeon: <Fraeon> With RPGMaker they blend because they use the same assets half the time
(21:06:14) Fraeon: <PFawkes> I dont
(21:06:27) PFawkes: no, see
(21:06:31) PFawkes: I hit return by accident
(21:06:45) PFawkes: PFawkes> I dont PFawkes> mind them liking the game, but it's not like the graphics can be praised if you appropriate them
(21:06:46) PFawkes: seed
(21:06:47) squiggly_p: "i don't mind them blah blah"
(21:07:11) Siiseli: oh man my brain is totally empty
(21:07:17) squiggly_p: I thihnk a lot of people really are clueless about game graphics
(21:07:21) Siiseli: I mean I just stare at my code
(21:07:25) Siiseli: thinking of what to add
(21:07:32) squiggly_p: look how many people think gears of war 2 has awesome graphics
(21:07:35) PFawkes: I just would assume people would recognize that
(21:07:35) Fraeon: Adding dinosaurs
(21:07:39) Fraeon: That shoot penises
(21:07:44) Fraeon: That shoot rockets out of the tip
(21:07:46) PFawkes: which shoot guns
(21:07:53) PFawkes: which shoot the aforementioned dinosaurs
(21:08:01) PFawkes: and it plays like tetris
(21:08:13) PFawkes: (everything is grey and brown)
(21:08:16) squiggly_p: which enemies can pick up and shoot penis rocket guns
(21:08:39) Fraeon: I don't know
(21:08:45) PFawkes: everything is on FIRE
(21:08:45) Fraeon: GoW2 actually has color in it at times
(21:08:55) squiggly_p: blood?
(21:09:04) PFawkes: everything is catching, yes, everything is catching on fire, everything is catching on fi-i-ire
(21:09:06) squiggly_p: they have like...  orange eye lights or something
(21:09:11) Tasoth: Freud would have a field day
(21:09:17) PFawkes: have you heard this song?
