(07:54:30) RinkuHero: identify lesift
(07:54:45) Super-Dot: I keep track of a few sites through RSS
(07:54:50) RinkuHero: oops
(07:54:55) RinkuHero: guess i need to change my password now :D
(07:54:59) Super-Dot: But the rest, I visit if I think of them
(07:55:04) RinkuHero: thought i was typing in nickserv window (in pidgin)
(07:55:19) Super-Dot: Heh, I thought you misspelled "identity theft"
(07:55:23) RinkuHero: ha
(07:55:28) Dock: :) 
(07:55:35) Super-Dot: Which is pretty much what happened :P
(07:55:36) Dock: *starts a new music track* 
(07:56:17) Super-Dot: oh you did type "identify"
(07:56:44) Super-Dot: Either I've stayed up five hours past my bedtime or I'm really tired
(07:56:48) Super-Dot: oh wait both
(07:57:20) PiratePoo left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).

(07:57:47) Super-Dot: Good night, delicious tigurk
(07:57:51) RinkuHero: password changed
(07:57:53) Sos [Sos@esq183.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl] entered the room.
(07:57:53) Dock: gnite!
(07:57:55) RinkuHero: :D
(07:58:00) RinkuHero: i never changed a password in irc before
(07:58:01) Lunar left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(07:58:03) RinkuHero: so had to google how
(07:58:05) Dock: rinku, do you do musics?
(07:58:12) RinkuHero: i used to make music, a long time ago
(07:58:19) RinkuHero: but now long dao and my father write music for my games
(07:58:42) slv: i do musics! musics are the shit
(07:58:43) Dock: handy
(07:58:46) C418: I actively make egoistic music
(07:58:50) Dock: my musics are shit! 
(07:58:52) SMRobot: I can't compose for crap
(07:58:53) C418: meaning only for me
(07:59:00) SMRobot: I've been meaning to learn the keyboard
(07:59:39) Dock: my last track, which was my first completed track: http://deadpanda.com/lj/mayagain.mp3
(07:59:44) Dock: it's a bit all over the place tbh
(07:59:50) Dock: but I'm trying something new today
(08:00:22) Sos: hi
(08:00:24) RinkuHero: hi
(08:00:41) SMRobot: hey
(08:00:56) RinkuHero: that song reminds me of videogame music
(08:01:02) RinkuHero: like the music from jumping flash
(08:01:03) C418: I would like to show you my newest song, but I'm egoistic
(08:01:13) lansing: reddit is fucked
(08:01:21) lansing: it's been offline for like 6 hours
(08:01:28) C418: sounds like japanese racing game menu music
(08:01:33) Super-Dot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:01:34) RinkuHero: yes
(08:01:51) nyarla: Dock: bouncy song!
(08:02:08) Dock: yeah, I was going for a very game sounding piece :) 
(08:02:18) SMRobot: wait, safari uses your windows theme
(08:02:20) C418: there is a synthesizer in the background
(08:02:20) SMRobot: :(
(08:02:29) C418: a silent one that has melodies that don't fit
(08:02:31) C418: I like that one
(08:02:46) Dock: i hate that synth
(08:02:48) Dock: it's off key
(08:02:54) RinkuHero: last time i wrote music was 2000
(08:02:55) C418: why, thats why I like it
(08:02:56) Dock: it would be the only thing I could fix
(08:02:59) RinkuHero: in noteworthy composer
(08:03:03) C418: with music 2000?
(08:03:09) RinkuHero: haven't heard of that
(08:03:15) SMRobot: is there a wayu to use mac styling in safari?
(08:03:19) C418: it's called mtv music creater abroad
(08:03:23) RinkuHero: ah
(08:03:23) C418: or something like that
(08:04:04) SMRobot: is there a wayu to use mac styling in safari?
(08:04:28) C418: I wouldn't like that
(08:04:43) SMRobot: why not?
(08:05:07) C418: I dislike the itunes theme, so I guess that would be the same if safari would look like that
(08:07:19) Dock: itunes is less weird on mac of course
(08:07:28) Dock: but it sticks out like a sore thumb on windows
(08:07:35) SMRobot: back to chrome
(08:08:35) SMRobot: what's xcode like>
(08:09:07) SMRobot: I used it a few years back but I don't really remember much about it
(08:10:55) SMRobot: it can't be worse than visual C++
(08:11:03) Drakkar: notch
(08:11:13) notch: Drakkar
(08:11:33) Drakkar: I am going to molest you vigorously over your last tumblr post
(08:11:57) nyarla: lots of people i know say they hate Xcode but I quite like it, though I've only been using it for a few days..maybe it's cos i've never used visual studio
(08:12:19) RinkuHero: anything is fun for the first few days though
(08:12:25) Drakkar: heh
(08:12:26) Drakkar: tbh
(08:12:29) notch: why's that? =D
(08:12:30) Drakkar: its a matter of opinion
(08:12:31) Drakkar: regardless
(08:12:33) Drakkar: well
(08:12:39) RinkuHero: because newness makes things interesting
(08:12:40) nyarla: but i mean, i changed some keyboard shortcuts around and stuff and now it's really fast to use and i barely need to touch the mouse. :)
(08:12:42) Drakkar: except for the really shitty things
(08:12:46) Drakkar: it looked amazing notch
(08:12:47) RinkuHero: even washing the dishes is fun the first few times
(08:12:50) notch: yay
(08:12:57) nyarla: washing the dishes is always fun
(08:13:08) nyarla: it's like a whole nother world down in that sink!
(08:13:10) Drakkar: I am very stoked
(08:13:34) Bigger: Hello RinkuHero
(08:14:01) RinkuHero: hi
(08:14:17) Cait|Asleep is now known as Cait

(08:17:07) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:17:39) Dock: gah I have to go and help tidy the house
(08:17:56) Dock: I need to force my GF to stop playing Little King Story and tidy up :)
(08:21:25) Kasran [Kasran@cpe-173-170-229-146.tampabay.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(08:23:25) notch: oh crap, I can't capture the mouse in applet mode
(08:23:35) notch: .. which kind of makes sense.
(08:25:04) Dock: oh, in browser ?
(08:25:20) Dock: unity uses some sort of trick to steal mouse focus 
(08:25:36) Dock: but it's a bit nasty to take away someone's cursor unless they're prepared for it
(08:26:17) lansing: mouselook doesn't work all that well without grabbing the cursor :)
(08:26:48) notch: yeah.. I can make picking tiles work with the mouse cursor, though
(08:26:56) notch: I wonder if it's possible to get used to repeated click/dragging. ;)
(08:28:08) Dock: D: 
(08:28:17) Dock: RSI beckons that way! 
(08:29:18) notch: make the viewport glide towards the mouse when it's not near the center? heh
(08:29:33) notch: scrap mouselook for the applet?
(08:29:39) Dock: like a wii cursor? :D 
(08:29:44) Dock: haha
(08:30:06) Dock: problem with your game is that its so 3D that you need mouselook
(08:30:12) Dock: doom control won't slide really
(08:30:27) Dock: and descent was a nightmare on keys :)
(08:30:45) thewreck_Away [epsi@c-0d7171d5.017-16-6c756e10.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(08:31:07) Kasran: Heello
(08:31:09) notch: mm
(08:31:10) Kasran: *Hello
(08:31:28) notch: I want to behave well with the internets.. Mouse grabbing is a big no-no imo
(08:31:52) mewse: Mouse grabbing is okay under particular circumstances.
(08:32:08) Dock: music help plz
(08:32:16) mewse: You can do the MMORPG thing, and only grab the mouse while the right mouse button is down, for example.
(08:32:24) Dock: if I have a loop in C key and need to make it A key
(08:32:35) Dock: can I just slide it down four notes?
(08:33:11) notch: mewse: There's a permission problem as well. If I want to grab the cursor, I have to sign my applet with my own certificate, and that means the user has to both agree to trust LWJGL and to trust my stuff
(08:33:22) mewse: Ew.
(08:33:41) notch: yeah. I'm trying to keep my stuff unsigned. =)
(08:33:59) Dock: maybe scrap the applet
(08:34:08) Dock: but offer it as a 'viewer' for models?
(08:34:12) ***mewse just codes in C++.  Simpler.  :)
(08:34:14) Dock: with rotating camera
(08:34:30) Dock: mewse, how do you go about making a browser based game then? ;) 
(08:34:50) lansing: he has to write a browser plugin and then the game too :P
(08:34:59) notch: hehe
(08:35:06) mewse: Dock, I do that by sheer force of personality.  :)
(08:35:31) notch: I'm going to keep the applet distro as far as possible. I think it really helps the casual player to be able to play it immediately, plus it offers cool web site integration potentials
(08:36:36) Dock: yeah I agree with that 
(08:36:42) Fraeon left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:36:48) Dock: mouselook + browser is a bit of a pain tho
(08:37:02) Dock: but it's worth it to have things like hyperlinks 
(08:37:07) notch: verily.. hmm
(08:37:23) notch: I think I'll go grab some food and ponder this. The good news is that the applet WORKS
(08:37:44) notch: and also that the total size of my game excluding the game library stuff is 29.3 kb. ;)
(08:37:50) notch: low res textures for the win
(08:38:21) Dock: are you willing to allow people to make custom graphics for their buildings and stuff?
(08:38:49) notch: hmm, maybe. I have no political reason not to, only technical.
(08:39:12) notch: but a couple of custom blocks per team in a two or three team game is absolutely doable
(08:39:25) notch: except that it could be a bit cheat prone..
(08:39:27) SMRobot [littleripp@121.217.204.114] entered the room.
(08:39:32) Dock: team game? 
(08:39:42) notch: red vs blue, ctf on custom built levels. ;D
(08:39:45) Dock: suddenly I have flashbacks to Love 
(08:39:49) Dock: gah
(08:39:58) Dock: :) well you kids have fun playing it without me
(08:40:07) notch: haha, it will have singleplayer
(08:40:11) notch: and probably sheep as well
(08:40:50) notch: for singleplayer/create mode, custom graphics is a MUCH smaller problem!
(08:40:58) SMRobot: fixed
(08:40:59) Dock: is a shame that all online things are just CTF or team deathmatch
(08:41:10) notch: I could just save the custom textures in the level data
(08:41:12) Dock: I was so disappointed when Love turned out to be Quake 3
(08:41:19) notch: haha
(08:41:21) SMRobot: i had 2.4GHz and 5GHz enabled at the same time
(08:41:28) SMRobot: on my wireless
(08:41:41) Dock: cool :) 
(08:41:48) Dock: yeah, that's an option, I've never seen it screw up before tho
(08:41:56) caspa [caspa@91-113-90-233.adsl.highway.telekom.at] entered the room.
(08:42:06) notch: the main focus in this game is on playing around with an interactive world. There will be more and less gamey game modes
(08:42:16) notch: pure create mode is faaaaast, but has no goal
(08:42:40) notch: survival mode, perhaps, would be a singleplayer/coop game where you try to survive for as long as possible, farming for food and cutting down trees for wood
(08:43:01) notch: fort mode lets you build a fort in create (or survival?) mode, then face off against an opponent fort
(08:43:19) notch: of course, all of these things are in some vague kind of pipeline
(08:43:23) notch: a leaky one
(08:43:30) SMRobot_ [littleripp@121.217.204.114] entered the room.
(08:44:14) notch: but now, food.
(08:44:17) Dock: I hear the sounds of cups of tea made
(08:44:27) Dock: I wonder whether I get one
(08:44:33) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:44:34) Fraeon [kzer-za@e212-246-65-153.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(08:44:40) Dock: *waits*
(08:44:43) Dock: no tea for me D: 
(08:45:14) Drakkar: notch, will you be providing methods for user extendability, like uh
(08:45:16) Drakkar: lua scripting
(08:45:17) Drakkar: or something
(08:46:01) notch: what would it be used for?
(08:46:13) Dock: if people wanted to make interactive objects
(08:46:18) notch: ooh, ahh
(08:46:20) Dock: elevators, etc
(08:46:25) Drakkar: yeah
(08:46:35) Drakkar: or new types of liquids
(08:46:36) Drakkar: etc
(08:46:38) notch: that would be awesome
(08:46:40) SMRobot [littleripp@121.217.204.114] entered the room.
(08:46:50) Drakkar: indeed
(08:46:51) Dock: I would recommend you keep it simple tbh
(08:46:51) notch: I haven't thought about it yet, but I will
(08:47:24) notch: Dock: Yes, absolutely. That's the plan. But I haven't started implementing the interactive tiles yet, so as long as I keep this in mind, I can make sure not to end up in a corner
(08:47:34) Dock: yeah
(08:47:47) Drakkar: aye
(08:48:04) Dock: gah, why can't I do music today o_o
(08:48:08) SMRobot_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:48:11) SMRobot_ [littleripp@121.217.204.114] entered the room.
(08:48:20) Drakkar: so now there are l4d 'authoring tools'
(08:48:25) Dock: gah
(08:48:35) Dock: it's left 4 dead again
(08:48:37) Drakkar: kind of a sad thing
(08:48:47) Drakkar: and lmao
(08:49:42) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(08:52:20) C418: what are these authoring tools?
(08:52:26) C418: and I want a dead rising map
(08:52:35) C418: or dead rising multiplayer
(08:53:55) Dock: zombies are teh awesome, etc
(08:54:08) Dock: irrespective of anything else if it has zombies we must flock to it

(08:55:21) C418: I really hope dead rising lives up to it's predecessor
(08:55:28) C418: ...dead rising 2 I mean
(08:55:35) _SMRobot: how do I delete a tumblr blog?
(08:55:49) Dock: trying to hack notch's blog? ;) 
(08:55:59) _SMRobot: no
(08:56:12) _SMRobot: I have an old one from seveal years back that needs to be shot
(08:56:27) Dock: you can't delete anything from the internet
(08:56:41) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(08:56:47) Dock: like your footprints on this planet, your damage is eternal
(08:57:21) Dock is now known as DockBBIAB
(08:57:21) _SMRobot: found it
(08:59:20) _SMRobot: argh
(08:59:29) _SMRobot: smrobot.tumblr.com is still there
(08:59:38) _SMRobot: it just deleted my account :(
(09:00:05) C418: try waiting a day or so

(09:03:19) jstickeur: Hi guys
(09:03:40) _SMRobot: hi
(09:03:48) jstickeur: How's things?
(09:03:49) _SMRobot is now known as SMRobot
(09:03:54) SMRobot: good
(09:03:59) jstickeur: Cool
(09:04:01) jsticker left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(09:04:08) jstickeur: My router apparently is near death
(09:04:14) jstickeur: No protocol except for IRC work
(09:04:32) C418: typical for routers
(09:04:40) jstickeur: First time I have this problem
(09:04:41) C418: near death experiences
(09:05:00) jstickeur: I do wonder what's wrong
(09:05:30) C418: it's mostly the ac adaptor dying first
(09:05:54) C418: they can hold for two years maybe, but then something ought to break
(09:06:00) C418: being on 24/7
(09:06:29) jstickeur: I just plugged it off and then put the power cable back in, to restart the router
(09:06:41) jstickeur: :(
(09:07:14) C418: that could make the adaptor break even more if it's near destruction
(09:07:18) jstickeur: C418, could you tell me the IP of some website?
(09:07:42) jstickeur: Any website will do
(09:07:43) C418: uuuh, shure, which?
(09:07:50) jstickeur: Let's use google
(09:08:19) C418: firstly I have to find out how to get the ip, idiotic as I am
(09:08:25) C418: whois... doesn't help! fine
(09:08:28) lemre: ask Wolfram Alpha
(09:08:31) jstickeur: :D
(09:08:44) C418: 72.14.221.104
(09:08:46) C418: google.de
(09:09:03) jstickeur: Thanks. So it's not a problem with the DNS
(09:09:13) SMRobot: http://sm-robot.tumblr.com/
(09:09:14) SMRobot: yay
(09:09:23) jstickeur: I can't even ping that ip
(09:09:28) jstickeur: What the hell is wrong
(09:09:45) C418: as long as irc works, everything is perfectly fine
(09:09:54) jstickeur: No, this seriously sucks
(09:09:56) C418: haha lol I'm sorry
(09:10:00) C418: ahem.
(09:10:08) jstickeur: I don't know what the problem would be so I can't start to fix it
(09:10:14) C418: well, do you have a router modem setup?
(09:10:18) jstickeur: Yeah
(09:10:27) SMRobot: anyone here willing to make an animated player sprite for me
(09:10:32) C418: try plugging in the modem directly
(09:10:33) SMRobot: fairly low res
(09:10:41) SMRobot: about 12x6 max
(09:11:06) jstickeur: I'll try a soft reboot first, then direct modem D:
(09:11:16) SMRobot: anyone?
(09:11:26) C418: all these telekom routers are made for being online 24/7
(09:11:46) C418: they don't like hard resets
(09:11:48) SMRobot: yay
(09:11:52) SMRobot: notch foolows me
(09:12:26) SMRobot: and I follow back out of common courtosey
(09:12:37) C418: it's actually pretty weird that only irc works
(09:12:40) C418: it's just a port
(09:13:06) jsticker [nnscript@p4FD5B6B5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] entered the room.
(09:13:19) jsticker: Now it works again :I
(09:13:26) jsticker: I just unplugged and re-plugged the modem
(09:13:40) jsticker: I doubt mankind will ever fully understand machinees
(09:13:44) jsticker: *machines
(09:14:19) SMRobot: Notch, what do you program in?
(09:14:22) C418: jsticker, you like 2raumwohnung?
(09:14:24) jstickeur left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(09:14:30) jsticker: Not much
(09:14:33) C418: :(
(09:14:35) jsticker: Also, www down again
(09:14:38) KingAl: The first emergent strong AI is in jsticker's modem, and it's a jerk.
(09:14:47) C418: I'll... uh... what and things
(09:14:52) jsticker: Yeah, really seems like it, KingAl
(09:14:55) jsticker: We better get armed

(10:06:08) notch: yes please
(10:07:39) fartron: indie developers are idiots if they think they will be able to implement the same pay system that is falling apart in the long established industries of music film and even literature
(10:08:11) fartron: information products aren't commodities anymore
(10:08:18) fartron: you can't go back
(10:08:23) notch: donations are a tad naive, though. The customer has no incentive to pay
(10:08:37) notch: nay, I'm all for going back to good sized shareware versions
(10:08:51) notch: but I agree with what you said, fartron.
(10:09:19) fartron: the problem with all these "95% piracy" reports is that they are trying to imply they lost money
(10:09:36) Movius: "HURRR CHAENG UR BIZNIZ MODAL" is trite bullshit. in terms of intelligence it is below even trying to guilt people into donations
(10:09:47) fartron: ha
(10:10:04) fartron: and here i thought we were agreeing on something finaly
(10:10:45) notch: if you tell people you want them to pay, and only give them the full version when they pay, people ARE going to pirate it still, but it's probably going to increase the number of paying honest customers.

(11:11:55) nyarla: fartron: you could probably get a record crackle/tape hiss sound effect from somewhere and mix it in with your sound maybe. or yeah, a filter plugin
(11:11:56) fartron: is there such a thing
(11:12:03) dock: audacity probably has such a thing
(11:12:09) C418: there is such a thing in ableton live
(11:12:09) dock: garageband certainly does
(11:12:11) fartron: i don't just want a background hiss, i want the voice itself to sound tapey
(11:12:26) dock: yeah that's all doable
(11:12:30) C418: well, there are definitely vst for that
(11:12:50) C418: I just don't know them because the vinyl distortion of live good enough is
(11:12:53) Dragonene: dock: care to find me a palette?
(11:12:59) dock: okay :)
(11:13:12) fartron: is ableton a daw
(11:13:13) worstplay: oh
(11:13:40) fartron: i got used to logic pro on my friend's macbook but i am on pc currently
(11:13:44) worstplay: maybe that vst that simulates vinyl sound can be used
(11:13:56) Dragonene: meanwhile
(11:13:59) Dragonene: give me a task, somebody
(11:14:01) worstplay: what was the name?
(11:14:02) Dragonene: what do I draw
(11:14:04) dock: I had this in favourites: http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/13284/jump_in_jack
(11:14:07) Dragonene: with the palette dock finds for me?
(11:14:08) C418: ableton is a company, live is a daw
(11:14:12) Dragonene: don't look at the palette
(11:14:18) Dragonene: give me something to draw first
(11:14:20) Dragonene: without looking at it
(11:14:21) nyarla: fartron: http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=49005
(11:14:24) Dragonene: somebody :)
(11:14:44) dock: nyarla, I can hear the sea! :D 
(11:14:48) Dragonene: C418: what do I draw.
(11:14:52) fartron: i might use that for something else nyarla, but it won't change the voice itself
(11:14:56) dock: yeah, the freesound thing is awesome
(11:15:13) dock: fartron, get audacity! 
(11:15:16) dock: it's free
(11:15:18) buick: ascii sillyness! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL5SH2HmSBY
(11:15:20) C418: jelly baby fish
(11:15:25) fartron: well i was planning on pirating whatever i use
(11:15:27) Dragonene: oookay
(11:15:31) Dragonene: jelly baby fish
(11:15:32) dock: are you on pc or mac?
(11:15:35) Dragonene: or baby jellyfish?

(11:15:56) Dragonene: C418: Jelly Baby-fish or Baby Jellyfish?!
(11:16:05) C418: jelly baby-fish of course
(11:16:27) Movius: thats some fine ascii buick
(11:16:41) BotageL [legatob@75.102.128.163] entered the room.
(11:17:00) dock: it's not ascii, it's ansi! 
(11:17:04) dock: :D
(11:17:21) nyarla: buick: awesome!
(11:17:23) fartron: does ableton live have a dongle or something?
(11:17:36) dock: fartron, how personal
(11:17:40) fartron: because most dongle cracks i've found don't work on x64
(11:17:47) dock: xp64?
(11:17:51) fartron: yeah
(11:18:01) dock: buick, did you make this?
(11:18:07) buick: yeah
(11:18:13) buick: the music is kohina radio though
(11:18:24) fartron: is it like dwarf fortress
(11:18:30) fartron: because i think i see gold
(11:18:58) Dragonene: C418: I shall make it so!
(11:19:28) buick: fartron: ore, gold & diamonds
(11:19:31) dock: I like it, it's like a virtual colonoscopy
(11:20:15) nyarla: now there's a game idea
(11:20:35) dock: imagine the normal maps! 
(11:21:29) C418: my newest song asks you what indie is and questions the whole community in an intriguing way
(11:22:23) jsticker: :D
(11:22:25) jsticker: Link
(11:23:05) C418: sorry, album included only
(11:23:08) C418: fucking itunes!
(11:23:23) fartron: do you have live 8 or 7 c4
(11:23:38) C418: 8 suite
(11:24:37) dock: I keep playing with synthy sounds
(11:24:43) dock: I don't know whether it's a good idea 
(11:24:48) dock: it feels cowardly :)
(11:25:28) Kas_away is now known as Kasran
(11:27:28) fartron: why cowardly?
(11:27:41) dock: because it isn't full chiptune
(11:27:52) dock: (because garageband has no chiptune options really)
(11:27:54) C418: nobody cares
(11:28:06) C418: but you
(11:28:07) C418: :P
(11:28:20) dock: yeah, I'm the most important person 
(11:28:24) fartron: if i had a mac i would reason & logic pro every day
(11:28:24) dock: :P 
(11:28:35) dock: ah, I'm not ready for logic pro
(11:28:35) C418: if I had a mac, I would live anyway
(11:28:49) C418: because on my dvd theres a mac version too
(11:28:52) C418: so yes!
(11:28:55) Bigger: if i had a mac I would reason everyday
(11:29:06) Bigger: as it is I just fl studio everyday because i am too lazy to reason
(11:29:12) fartron: i am reasoning
(11:30:43) Bigger: I sort of wish I felt the same about my music as I did a year or so ago
(11:30:52) Bigger: back then I could finish songs in a sitting and not think too much about it
(11:30:57) Bigger: now I just hate everything
(11:31:52) fartron: that's when i start looking for shrooms
(11:31:59) fartron: to break me out of the hate cycle

(11:41:27) dock: c418, but you're grumpy about your music all the time. grump grump grump! :D 
(11:41:35) C418: well, I have a good reason
(11:41:43) C418: making albums makes you grumpy halfway through
(11:41:53) dock: I need to get some prospective music for tumbledrop
(11:42:02) dock: and jazzy synth is not going to help me
(11:44:05) dock: maybe it will 
(11:44:09) ***dock changes the instruments
(11:44:43) C418: well, and I call it a wrap
(11:44:54) dock: making fajitas?
(11:45:11) C418: tasty

(12:07:06) notch: minecraft alpha is available. I need someone on windows, someone on mac and someone on linux!
(12:07:14) notch: singleplayer only still
(12:07:19) dock: I'm on a mac
(12:07:28) Siiseli: goddamnit I'd help but I can't on my dads computer
(12:07:52) fartron: i'm on windows!
(12:08:19) Jrsquee: notch, I'm linux
(12:08:29) notch: awesome. urls pm'd.
(12:08:43) notch: let me know if it works, and if it does, how well it works
(12:08:46) dock: the mouse movement is terrible
(12:08:48) Jrsquee: whoop, gotta get java
(12:08:53) notch: as in bad?
(12:08:59) dock: yeah
(12:09:04) notch: what's wrong with it?
(12:09:16) dock: it barely moves, as though it is stuck, and then jerks
(12:09:31) fartron: i don't have that problem but i need to invert the y axis
(12:09:39) fartron: or i will constantly walk into things
(12:09:56) notch: haha, I'll add a button to swap y axis, and I'll try to smack the mouse look code around a bit.
(12:09:59) dock: I'm capable of adapting :) 
(12:10:08) dock: I don't care which way it is
(12:10:50) fartron: so there's stone, dirt, stone, brick?
(12:11:03) notch: and a test plant on key 6
(12:11:20) notch: stone, dirt, stacked rocks and planks!
(12:11:26) notch: it's supposed to look like wood, haha
(12:11:55) dock: yeah the mouselook is pretty much unusable on mac
(12:12:03) dock: let me try another browser
(12:12:16) notch: I'm investigating now. Does it at least capture the mouse pointer?
(12:12:30) notch: so you can't drag it outside the applet area unless you release it with escape, I mean
(12:12:37) dock: it does
(12:13:46) Jrsquee: notch, I need to install java first
(12:13:49) Jrsquee: so BRBRBRBRBRB
(12:13:54) notch: yeah, take your time. =)
(12:14:09) notch: It's interesting to hear the whole experience for someone without java
(12:14:19) jw: man
(12:14:22) jsticker: Oh Jackson, you set my heart athunder
(12:14:31) jw: why are all defense games so similar
(12:14:37) jsticker: Defense games?
(12:14:38) jw: its not very hard to put some depth in them
(12:14:40) jw: like
(12:14:46) jw: tower defense
(12:14:49) jsticker: Ah, alright
(12:14:52) jw: its either TD
(12:14:54) jw: or
(12:14:58) jw: be in a base and shoot shit and buy shit
(12:15:00) fartron: you seem to be able to make a block while looking straight down
(12:15:06) jsticker: Well, there's one good exception to this, jw
(12:15:07) fartron: which should be a collision problem
(12:15:16) dock: safari is better 
(12:15:17) jsticker: It came out way before TD became such a popular genre
(12:15:23) jsticker: The game's Stronghold!
(12:15:24) dock: but still rough
(12:15:38) notch: true fartron.. I've been ignoring that, I just realized, hehe
(12:15:53) jsticker: Hi dock, fartron, notch
(12:16:30) ArneDesigner: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzwr9kRLH0
(12:16:34) notch: dock, fartron: There's a new version up. Reload the page
(12:16:40) notch: 'Y' swaps the y axis on the mouse
(12:16:48) notch: and the mouse look code is changed
(12:16:54) buick: how notch !
(12:17:10) notch: f5?
(12:17:12) buick: er
(12:17:15) buick: howdy notch !
(12:17:22) notch: ahh, haha =D
(12:17:25) notch: I thought you were dock
(12:17:27) jw: stronghold?
(12:17:30) jw: the crusade one
(12:17:32) notch: misread your name for massive confusion
(12:17:39) jw: that was not really like
(12:17:41) notch: hi buick. =)
(12:17:42) jw: defend something
(12:17:43) jw: more like
(12:17:45) jw: win
(12:17:53) dock: one think I would prefer with this game, notch
(12:17:56) buick: notch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL5SH2HmSBY
(12:18:08) dock: is the ability to climb a one block ledge by pushing into it
(12:18:22) jsticker: jw, well, I think it is very similar to today's TD games
(12:18:24) notch: I'm going to add stair tiles (or possibly diagonal) =)
(12:18:28) Jrsquee left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).
(12:18:32) notch: did the mouse look get better?
(12:18:41) fartron: i reloaded and now there are no textures
(12:18:43) fartron: everything is white
(12:18:47) notch: whoa
(12:18:51) dock: half height tiles might be good 
(12:18:57) jsticker: You have to defend your castle, the enemy will come from exactly one point, you build a castle in order to deal with it and put traps and archers there
(12:19:05) jw: yeah but
(12:19:06) dock: mouse look is better... but still slightly unpleasant 
(12:19:08) jw: the enemy doesnt like
(12:19:13) jw: attack a certain thing
(12:19:21) jw: they attack the entire castle
(12:19:22) dock: might be better or worse on a different machine, but this is pretty decent spec
(12:19:23) Dragonene: I'm not doing well here
(12:19:24) jw: and its more of an rts
(12:19:25) Dragonene: :P
(12:19:26) jw: but yeah
(12:19:28) Dragonene: oh well
(12:19:28) jw: youre right
(12:19:30) jsticker: jw, TD is RTS
(12:19:38) notch: dock: What fps is it reporting? Unpleasant how? Jerky?
(12:19:38) jw: naaah
(12:19:42) dock: 343
(12:19:43) jw: a tower defense game
(12:19:45) jsticker: I know Stronghold isn't exactly a TD game
(12:19:47) jw: I woudlnt call an rts
(12:19:51) jsticker: Right, sorry
(12:19:55) dock: on safari
(12:19:57) jsticker: It's more like.. round strategy
(12:19:58) fartron: textures aren't loading for me
(12:19:59) notch: fartron: I bet it's the singleton texture loader.. Gimme a sec, don't close the browser. =D
(12:20:03) jw: rts has equal forces fighting eachother I'd say
(12:20:04) fartron: i refreshed and shift+refreshed
(12:20:05) dock: 287 on firefox
(12:20:12) dock: running them both atm
(12:20:17) jsticker: I can't translate rundenstrategie right now :|
(12:20:27) jsticker: Anyway, I'd still say Stronghold is very similar to TD
(12:20:36) dock: ah, is 800+ now that I closed firefox one
(12:20:53) jw: stronghold also had attacking parts right?
(12:20:54) jsticker: If you see the TD genre in such rigid restrictions and such an accurate definition, it will be hard to add depth to it
(12:20:59) jsticker: Yeah, but those sucked :D
(12:21:05) jw: haha ok
(12:21:07) jw: hmmm
(12:21:10) Kasran is now known as O
(12:21:12) jw: I guess you guys are right : )
(12:21:13) jsticker: If you loosen your definition of TD a bit, you have more space for depth improvements
(12:21:20) O is now known as Kasran
(12:21:28) jsticker: And if you loosen it enough you can get something like Stronghold
(12:21:32) fartron: despite the texture thing, i already like the interface a lot more than infiniminer
(12:21:34) notch: dock: could you describe how the mouselook is?
(12:21:44) jsticker: Some genres are so stuck in their conventions there's no real hope for them
(12:21:52) jsticker: I do agree this happened to the TD genre
(12:22:05) jsticker: I haven't played RinkuHero's game yet though, I heard it does good things
(12:22:09) dock: like it is dropping frames
(12:22:28) jw: gotta go
(12:22:30) jw: bye guys
(12:22:31) jsticker: Bye jw
(12:22:34) jsticker: :*
(12:22:42) jw left the room (quit: Quit: <3).
(12:22:53) notch: oh, that does sound very annoying
(12:23:00) fartron: also notch, Y isn't inverting
(12:23:05) dock: seems like it is running at <10fps rotation smoothness  when I rotate
(12:23:33) notch: oh, perhaps I forgot to recompile properly or something..
(12:23:49) fartron: it might be a cache thing on my end.. could explain the textures too
(12:23:53) fartron: but i shift+F5'd it
(12:25:56) notch: dock, fartron: New version, reload the page.
(12:26:10) notch: and thank you for helping me. =)

(12:31:15) fartron: ok, close and reopen of firefox brought back textures and got invert working
(12:31:21) Jrsquee: alright
(12:31:23) Jrsquee: running
(12:31:24) fartron: but now sensitivity is way low
(12:31:30) Jrsquee: I'm getting like 8 fps
(12:31:42) jsticker: Jrsquee, is one week of Spain fine with you?
(12:31:42) Jrsquee: and sensitivity for mouselook is almost nothing
(12:31:46) Jrsquee: like, real slow
(12:31:48) jsticker: 5-7 days
(12:31:49) fartron: it's doing what dock said i think
(12:31:53) Jrsquee: jsticker: that's perfect
(12:31:55) Bigger: jsticker; it's a reup with an awesome tune
(12:31:55) Jrsquee: but

(12:32:13) Jrsquee: I figured out daily costs
(12:32:16) jsticker: Yeah, good luck with that :s

(12:32:50) Jrsquee: with the nv drivers
(12:32:54) jsticker: Is it hard to get a job in post-economy-crisis USA?
(12:32:56) Jrsquee: so no opengl
(12:32:56) thewreck [thewreck@c-0d7171d5.017-16-6c756e10.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se] entered the room.
(12:33:00) Jrsquee: it's sofware
(12:33:11) notch: 8 fps in software? Impressive
(12:33:23) notch: does it work? Can you play?
(12:33:24) Jrsquee: jsticker: I got laid off my job because of the economy
(12:33:27) jsticker: :(
(12:33:30) fartron: it was hard to get a job pre-crisis
(12:33:31) Jrsquee: uh, I can't really look around
(12:33:33) fartron: it's only gotten worse
(12:33:43) Jrsquee: but I can jump and move around
(12:33:47) Jrsquee: it isn't too bad
(12:33:47) thewreck left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(12:33:50) jsticker: It's tough in Dshermany too right now
(12:33:53) fartron: almost everyone i know who has graduated in the last few years is working some shit job they hate
(12:34:01) notch: ok, thank you. I need to fix this mouse look thing, I think. ;)
(12:34:19) Jrsquee: yes
(12:34:20) Jrsquee: you do
(12:34:36) Jrsquee: Hm
(12:34:48) Jrsquee: A gelato place is opening up downtown
(12:34:48) fartron: our society has a problem with finding things for smart people to do
(12:34:51) Jrsquee: I'll apply
(12:34:56) Jrsquee: hopefully get a job
(12:35:06) RinkuHero: what is gelato
(12:35:15) fartron: italian ice cream
(12:35:20) fartron: very rich
(12:35:25) Bigger: Ice cream but delicious
(12:35:51) Jrsquee: it's a low-fat (around 8%), very very dense ice cream
(12:36:38) fartron: i like the idea of being able to step up one block by walking into it
(12:36:41) fartron: notch
(12:36:48) fartron: i think your blocks might be slightly smaller than the infiniminer ones
(12:36:53) fartron: and it looks like you could step up them
(12:37:13) notch: step up?
(12:37:21) fartron: like how quake engines do
(12:37:22) notch: ahh, I get it, read what you said now. ;)
(12:37:32) notch: I'm going to add half-height tiles for stairs
(12:37:41) fartron: i worry that'll just get complicated
(12:37:42) notch: possibly slopes as well
(12:37:45) notch: I know! =D
(12:37:49) fartron: ha
(12:37:56) fartron: ok
(12:38:17) notch: this mouse look thing is weeeeeeird
(12:39:38) fartron: is the map random?
(12:39:56) notch: yeah. It's not a very good randomizer..
(12:40:15) fartron: also i think your particles are awesome
(12:40:25) notch: yay
(12:40:30) notch: =D
(12:40:55) Jrsquee: I added a ton of people
(12:41:01) Jrsquee: and my fps shot down to 4
(12:41:20) notch: what if you walk away from them?
(12:41:25) Jrsquee: uh
(12:41:29) Jrsquee: I'll try
(12:41:36) notch: I'm thinking it might be the fillrate
(12:41:36) Jrsquee: I can only go straight and strafe, really
(12:41:49) notch: haha, yeah.. it seems to get worse the lower the fps is, strangely
(12:42:03) notch: yep, confirmed.
(12:42:33) Jrsquee: oh, if I go away from them
(12:42:39) Jrsquee: it's like 6-8
(12:42:54) notch: it's the fillrate then. =)
(12:43:44) Jrsquee: oh sweet, I built stuff
(12:43:46) Jrsquee: that's fun
(12:44:31) Jrsquee: and bigger
(12:44:40) Jrsquee: what is with the japanese people dance
(12:45:13) Jrsquee: it's like
(12:45:17) Jrsquee: a seziure
(12:45:23) Jrsquee: maybe I just don't appreciate the art
(12:46:54) tantan [tantan@c-98-213-201-216.hsd1.il.comcast.net] entered the room.
(12:47:43) fartron: i thought you were an anarchist jr
(12:48:08) fartron: why can't you appreciate a good crazy street dance
(12:48:58) notch: dock, fartron, Jrsquee: I've uploaded a new version that fixed the mouse lag for me. You might have to restart your browser to avoid applet cache issues. Could you see if it works now? =)
(12:49:34) fartron: put in a build count or something so i can tell if it loaded the new one
(12:49:56) notch: good idea. I'll add from the next version and up. =)
(12:50:33) Dragonene: okay
(12:50:38) fartron: oops... i accidently the whole browser
(12:50:38) Dragonene: time to reveal my masterpiece!
(12:51:17) Dragonene: http://www.x2d.org/misc/jellybaby2.png
(12:51:21) Dragonene: dock: go!
(12:51:28) notch: it crashed?
(12:51:39) C418: oooh
(12:51:56) fartron: yeah, i tried closing the tab and reloading it
(12:52:05) fartron: but that didn't close java
(12:52:08) fartron: and it crashed
(12:52:09) notch: whoa
(12:52:27) notch: that's not a great user experience
(12:52:42) notch: I uploaded a new version with a (huge annoying) version label
(12:52:49) Dragonene: C418: They're... not very jelly baby-fish-like perhaps
(12:52:56) fartron: i think it's more java's fault than yours
(12:53:04) C418: well, nobody knows what they are anyway
(12:53:07) Dragonene: :P
(12:53:20) notch: it doesn't usually do that, fartron.. I think it might be lwjgl
(12:53:25) fartron: does your generator make caves?
(12:53:27) fartron: i haven't found any
(12:53:34) Dragonene: I think the purple of the fish is a bit too close to the background color
(12:53:36) notch: no, not yet. It will. =D
(12:53:37) Dragonene: but hey whatever :P
(12:53:53) notch: did the mouselook get better?
(12:58:44) Dragonene: notch: what do you think? :)
(12:58:55) notch: I thought it looked lovely. =)
(12:59:07) dock: whoops I was away
(12:59:29) fartron left the room (quit: Read error: Operation timed out).
(12:59:29) dock: looks cool :D
(12:59:31) Dragonene: The purple of the fish is a bit low-contrast compared to the background, and the effect of the bubbles on the line isn't quite pronounced enough, the bubbles look flat
(12:59:38) Dragonene: but I can't be bothered to fix that.
(12:59:41) Dragonene: Anything else?
(12:59:43) notch: I think fartron crashed :-O
(13:00:23) Dragonene: dock: Note: Not a single dithered pixel!

(13:01:30) fartron: aha!
(13:01:33) fartron: the good wireless is back!
(13:01:42) fartron: thank you anonymous neighbor!
(13:01:44) notch: phew, I thought I crashed you
(13:02:02) fartron: no i have been using a weak signal and it crapped out so i tried the good one again
(13:02:12) notch: \o/
(13:02:51) fartron: yes, this is great since i can play online again
(13:02:59) Dragonene: dock: Not that much is happening at all, but am I sort of moving in the right direction...?
(13:03:39) dock: dragonene: http://www.deadpanda.com/lj/fishy.png
(13:03:40) Dragonmaw left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(13:03:49) dock: I think you could still be more bold with colours and contrast
(13:04:11) dock: this isn't a great variation but I think there are under exploited colours going on :) 
(13:04:21) dock: I think this is great though
(13:04:29) dock: you're making great progres 
(13:04:36) fartron: yes i also think that is great Dragonene
(13:04:49) dock: notch,no better
(13:05:07) notch: does it say "0.0.2a" in the top left corner of the applet?
(13:05:16) dock: it was all white
(13:05:39) dock: this is much worse actually
(13:05:44) notch: it's probably caching the old version..
(13:05:45) dock: now the forwards movement is bad too
(13:05:56) dock: the last version I played had textures
(13:05:57) fartron: notch is there a way you can force the cache to clear
(13:05:58) dock: this does not
(13:05:59) fartron: or something
(13:06:15) fartron: dock i had the same thing, and it was java, i closed the browser and it worked the next time
(13:06:31) dock: oh that's okay, it closed for me (!!!)
(13:06:33) Dragonene: dom: Yeah, you're probably right
(13:06:35) fartron: if i try to load a new version without closing the browser now, java crashes
(13:06:35) dock: it crashed safari
(13:06:42) Dragonene: I definitely think the fish are too dark
(13:06:46) Dragonene: I just didn't know what to do about it
(13:06:49) notch: grr
(13:06:56) notch: I guess applet support just isn't good enough
(13:07:01) Dragonene: the bright pink looks a bit weird against the purple background
(13:07:16) dom: me? oh, was that a tab-complete error?
(13:07:54) fartron: hey dom
(13:08:00) fartron: you don't say much
(13:08:05) notch: dock: If you have the courage to run it again, i'd love to know if you get version 0.0.2 and what the mouse look is on in there..
(13:08:09) dom: hiya
(13:08:17) dom: no, sorry, I've been busy this week
(13:08:21) ***dom waves
(13:08:22) dock: okay trying again
(13:08:24) dock: on safari
(13:08:31) fartron: i have 0.0.2a now
(13:08:32) notch: thank you. and sorry about the crash. :-O
(13:08:36) dock: aha 
(13:08:36) fartron: i restarted firefox
(13:08:38) notch: fartron: Mouse look ok?
(13:08:41) dock: yes this is 0.0.2a
(13:08:53) fartron: i think it's caching some of the code too

(13:08:57) fartron: that's why it crashed for me i think
(13:09:04) dock: seems nicer
(13:09:13) notch: playable?
(13:09:14) fartron: mouse look is good again
(13:09:16) dock: yeah
(13:09:21) fartron: i'm getting 1380fps
(13:09:25) notch: ok, good, I'll stop touching it now
(13:09:29) dock: might be worth smoothing mouselook though
(13:09:29) C418: possibility low
(13:09:37) notch: thank you guys, you've been really helpful. =)
(13:09:50) fartron: wait what about the caves
(13:09:53) buick: 1380fps is much fps
(13:10:05) fartron: yeah, it almost seems impossibly high
(13:10:13) fartron: my monitor is certainly not updating that many times
(13:10:22) notch: it increases a counter each rendered frame
(13:10:24) Will [Will@92.17.146.202] entered the room.
(13:10:35) notch: then every 1000 ms, it stores that value as "fps" and resets it to 0
(13:10:39) PFawkes [chatzilla@66-90-137-36.dyn.grandenetworks.net] entered the room.
(13:10:47) fartron: yeah, it's engine framerate
(13:10:48) PFawkes: huzzah!
(13:11:24) notch: ok, I deem this "relatively stable" now, so if anyone else wants to help test:
(13:11:25) notch: http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/
(13:11:34) dock: notch - feature request!
(13:11:54) fartron: JUMP PADS
(13:11:55) notch: =D
(13:12:03) Siiseli: JUMP PAAADS
(13:12:08) dock: can I have something to 'pick' the material I'm pointing at? 
(13:12:08) notch: no jump pads!
(13:12:10) fartron: also caves
(13:12:12) fartron: to explore into
(13:12:19) Siiseli: cavitys!
(13:12:21) Siiseli: .. :O
(13:12:32) notch: caves, yes! =D picking material, yes!
(13:12:33) fartron: siisilly!
(13:12:39) dock: if I'm expanding an area of material I want to be able to grab it. 
(13:12:40) fartron: why no jumps?
(13:12:52) notch: because this isn't infiniminer. =)
(13:13:07) fartron: :(
(13:13:14) notch: infiniminer's infiniminer!
(13:13:21) fartron: but they're the best way to get around
(13:13:26) Jrsquee: works a lot better
(13:13:31) Jrsquee: still like 8pfs
(13:13:33) Kasran: [13:13] <notch> because this isn't infiniminer. =)
(13:13:34) notch: they're the silliest way of getting around!
(13:13:36) Kasran: THIS IS SPARTA
(13:13:37) Jrsquee: but mouselook is working
(13:13:50) notch: Jrsquee: Yess! On all three target platforms at once =D
(13:13:58) ***notch is lucky

(13:14:25) notch: time to add some random caves
(13:14:27) fartron: the other thing, and i haven't yet figured out how you would implement this, but some way to build on a side that i cannot see of the block i am looking at
(13:14:38) fartron: so i can build bridges very quickly
(13:14:44) fartron: without maneuvering to see them from below or the side
(13:14:49) notch: ooh, ah. yes. You speak the truth
(13:14:56) notch: hm..
(13:15:00) Jrsquee: okay, gotta go 
(13:15:01) Jrsquee: bye
(13:15:01) fartron: you already do this better than infiniminer though
(13:15:11) Jrsquee left the room (quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client).

(13:21:34) Dragonene: notch I mean
(13:21:40) Dragonene: that's almost infinitely sweet, with one exception
(13:21:46) dock: actually notch it was CMD
(13:21:47) Dragonene: I can't look around
(13:21:52) dock: I was using it to take a screenshot
(13:21:55) Dragonene: because it's ridiculously unsensitive
(13:22:00) notch: oh no..
(13:22:00) Dragonene: increase mousesens a lot, thanks :P
(13:22:02) dock: if I tab out again it fixes
(13:22:07) notch: wait, is it smooth but slow?
(13:22:12) notch: or jerky and slow?
(13:22:30) haowan: lol
(13:22:39) haowan: these mobs are the official funniest thing
(13:22:45) notch: dock: Yeah, I never receive the key up event since it loses keyboard focus. I'll make it release all keys on focus loss. =)
(13:23:11) dock: maybe it should stop jumping unless told otherwise? :D 
(13:23:30) notch: it should do the same with walking
(13:23:42) notch: so if you walk forwards and tab out, it should keep walking forever. Which is a bug.

(13:28:34) haowan: oh wait, there was than b games entry...
(13:28:39) Dragonene: notch: it's damned sweet, but it's unplayable because of the low sens, and it crashed the browser on exit

(13:29:50) Dragonene: uh
(13:29:53) Dragonene: jerky and slow

(13:32:42) pekuja: this map is pretty big
(13:32:44) Dragonene: i'm going to go to bed
(13:32:47) Dragonene: 'night folks
(13:32:54) dock: gnite dragonene
(13:32:58) Dragonene: thanks again dock :P
(13:33:03) dock: :) 
(13:33:28) dock: one idea with the lighting might be to have a drop-off relative to other faces
(13:33:41) fartron: how so
(13:33:44) dock: so a 1 tile lip overhang would only cause a one tile shadow 
(13:33:56) notch: if I want the point lights, I'm going to have to rewrite the lighting
(13:34:05) dock: I don't think you need point lights
(13:34:07) Movius: good work
(13:34:14) dock: just a bit more logic with the current lighting system
(13:34:16) fartron: yeah i would keep the lighting simple
(13:34:19) notch: I want torches in caves!
(13:34:22) fartron: ha
(13:34:25) ***PFawkes yawns
(13:34:27) Dragonene: No
(13:34:28) notch: they'd light up a 3x3 tile are. :D
(13:34:28) PFawkes: torches?
(13:34:32) dock: light on a tile to tile basis 
(13:34:34) PFawkes: hooray
(13:34:38) notch: yes, dock. =)
(13:34:40) Dragonene: notch: Think further
(13:34:42) PFawkes: you could maybe do 5x5?
(13:34:45) Dragonene: you want fireflys
(13:34:48) PFawkes: but with the outer ones darker
(13:34:49) pekuja: notch: I'm getting very high FPS but it still seems to twitch a bit
(13:34:49) PFawkes: you know
(13:34:55) Dragonene: fireflies*
(13:34:56) dock: but I think a lip on a house ought not shade the entire wall
(13:35:00) Dragonene: fireflies for lighting = awesome.
(13:35:09) notch: pekuja: The mouselook? Is it smooth when just walking?
(13:35:10) fartron: yeah, i'm with dock
(13:35:17) haowan: http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-05/15/content_7783268.htm
(13:35:24) pekuja: notch: yeah I think it might be just the mouselook
(13:35:49) pekuja: oh, it doesn't let me go any higher
(13:35:57) pekuja: I also made a spiral staircase
(13:36:02) Dragonene: i'm most certainly *not* getting high fps
(13:36:02) notch: ok pekuja. The mouselook is a bit of a hack atm because it failed to capture the mouse in a proper way for me in an applet
(13:36:06) Dragonene: but it should be acceptable
(13:36:09) notch: what fps, Dragonene?
(13:36:13) PFawkes: I'd look at your game
(13:36:18) Dragonene: varies between 50 and somewhere over 100
(13:36:19) PFawkes: but am downloading something
(13:36:21) dock: gtg curry is here! :D 
(13:36:28) PFawkes: curry :D
(13:36:30) Dragonene: I wouldn't call it high, but it should be fine for running any game
(13:36:31) Dragonene: :)
(13:36:32) PFawkes: kind?
(13:36:53) PFawkes: you need me to give you the fps of a stupidly poorly built system :D
(13:36:54) Dragonene: notch: can't you just setMouseGrabbed(true)?
(13:36:59) dock: ceylon! :D
(13:37:02) Dragonene: or does that not work in applets?
(13:37:04) notch: no, that doesn't actually GRAB the mouse for me in applet mode.
(13:37:08) Dragonene: weird
(13:37:09) notch: so I have to setLocation
(13:37:10) Dragonene: so you're using Robot?
(13:37:12) PFawkes: hm
(13:37:15) notch: no, Mouse.setLocation
(13:37:17) Dragonene: oh
(13:37:18) Dragonene: okay.
(13:37:21) fartron: pfawks you should look at it anyway
(13:37:40) PFawkes: I will
(13:37:48) PFawkes: am currently getting NWN patches though

(13:40:22) PFawkes: notch
(13:40:28) PFawkes: this game is just a blank white screen
(13:40:33) PFawkes: I don't know why
(13:41:08) notch: do you have java installed? did it show a download progress bar thingie?
(13:41:14) PFawkes: yes
(13:41:40) notch: hm.. what operating system? oh, and does the java console say anything?
(13:41:50) PFawkes: vista

(13:42:07) Kasran: Make it so that ou can snipe the annoying dudes
(13:42:08) PFawkes: it's having some wonky opengl errors
(13:42:13) PFawkes: so it's likely my card or something
(13:42:34) PFawkes: alas
(13:42:35) notch: what errors?
(13:42:41) PFawkes: lots of them
(13:42:50) PFawkes: you using pixel shaders?
(13:42:57) PFawkes: or hardware TnL? :D
(13:43:16) PFawkes: because by "card" I mean useless piece of integrated chipset
(13:43:22) notch: no pixel shaders, nothing custom for TnL.. that's driver level, isn't it?
(13:43:25) PFawkes: well, yes
(13:43:33) PFawkes: but if you had that, it wouldn't work here, see?
(13:43:46) notch: hm, it ran for jrsquee with software opengl drivers. ;D
(13:43:49) PFawkes: so it might error out

(13:53:30) RinkuHero: the forum thread?

(13:55:02) pekuja: notch: in a way this reminds me of the game "Love"
(13:55:22) fartron: not infiniminer?
(13:55:26) pekuja: notch: it's probably nothing like this, but in that game I understand you get to build whole cities and stuff
(13:55:50) pekuja: notch: it's not out yet
(13:55:54) pekuja: fartron: I haven't played that
(13:56:00) pekuja: well not that I've played Love either
(13:56:12) fartron: infiniminer is similar
(13:56:13) pekuja: aw, crap
(13:56:20) pekuja: I just realized I shouldn't had closed that window
(13:56:27) pekuja: now I guess I lost my tower and my tunnel
(13:56:33) notch: i should check out love. =)
(13:56:40) fartron: yeah, a save option would be nice notch
(13:56:46) pekuja: of course
(13:57:11) notch: The stand alone version saves automatically. Applets don't have permission to save files, but it does try!
(13:57:20) notch: (and spits out an exception)
(13:57:23) pekuja: haha
(13:58:01) fartron: couldn't it output to an xml that i could copy and paste
(13:58:03) fartron: or something
(13:59:08) Bigger left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(13:59:57) notch: but then you'd have no reason to come back for the final version. ;)
(14:00:11) fartron: fair enough

(14:00:46) jw: rinku

(14:02:59) RinkuHero: less than 700
(14:03:04) RinkuHero: that's counting all portals + my site
(14:03:17) RinkuHero: and that's since may 2007
(14:03:25) jw: ok
(14:03:38) jw: it is nice how it kept selling
(14:03:52) jw: interesting too that you did this all open :)
(14:05:16) notch: fartron: I uploaded 0.0.3 with caves. Does it load the new version properly if you just reload the page now?
(14:05:55) fartron: i had just closed the tab because i dug a cave and was getting claustrophobic
(14:06:06) notch: ah, ok. =)
(14:06:06) Zaratustra: what is this?
(14:06:09) Zaratustra: bootleg infiniminer?
(14:06:21) notch: a new game inspired by infiniminer. =)
(14:06:32) Zaratustra: infiniminer treluxe

(14:07:03) RinkuHero: haven't checked his blog to see if he reviewed the game yet o rnot

(14:21:56) plachenko: this is pretty neat
(14:21:59) plachenko: yeah
(14:22:09) plachenko: it's no where near as done as he thinks it is :(
(14:22:21) plachenko: step 1) lower volume of initial song
(14:22:25) fartron: ha
(14:22:30) plachenko: not by having the user do it themselves
(14:22:37) fartron: step 2) add gameplay
(14:22:47) plachenko: hah, yeah that too
(14:24:16) plachenko: so wait, IS this multiplayer?
(14:24:21) plachenko: or am I sandboxing by myself?
(14:24:58) fartron: sandbox atm
(14:25:03) fartron: multiplayer to come

(14:27:22) Zaratustra: I suppose you should add a persistent world first
(14:27:50) notch: it saves the map automatically in stand alone mode.
(14:28:08) notch: there's much work to be done. =)

(14:55:44) Bezzy: this minecraft thing is great. am i playing with other people on this?
(14:55:48) fartron: no
(14:55:49) fartron: not yet
(14:55:51) Bezzy: i am making a bridge!
(14:56:23) Z80_: And I made Tetris.  See above.
(14:56:26) fartron: z80's thing is why a game like this needs to be extensively modable, because you could put so many different kinds of gameplay in
(14:56:48) Z80_: Indeed.
(14:56:50) Z80_: :o
(14:58:00) Zaratustra: It needs SCREEEEEPTING
(14:58:33) Bezzy: i built a staircase up around a mesa, and looked out at the view, and it was like "wwwwooow!"
(14:58:46) Zaratustra: LET'S PLAY SOME TETRIS MOTHERFUCKER
(14:59:01) Bezzy: fartron, did you make this?
(14:59:05) Bezzy: who is make this?
(14:59:06) fartron: oh no
(14:59:07) fartron: notch did
(14:59:16) fartron: i am just his first fanboy
(14:59:38) Z80_: And I am his xth fanboy.
(14:59:52) Z80_: (Not tenth.)
(15:02:12) Bezzy: oh damn this puts a smile on my face
(15:02:18) Bezzy: i found a but of a dig site
(15:02:24) Bezzy: i go down and start digging in a straight line
(15:02:42) Bezzy: i'm just about to give up, and then i dig one more time, and open up an underground pocket!
(15:02:46) Bezzy: this is so cool!
(15:02:59) fartron: it is a vast improvement on infiniminer i think
(15:03:04) fartron: already
(15:03:06) Z80_: That it is.
(15:05:21) jw left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).

(15:09:27) KareemK [kareem@84.36.18.135] entered the room.
(15:09:38) Bezzy: man i'd play this if there wasn't even any game or aim
(15:09:53) Bezzy: just as long as you could build stuff with other people, maybe chat
(15:10:05) fartron: that's what infiniminer is like
(15:10:09) Bezzy: it'd be a beautiful pixel art world to explore
(15:10:10) Bezzy: ah
(15:10:13) Bezzy: i should try this
(15:10:23) fartron: there is a half-assed goal in infiniminer to find gold
(15:10:27) fartron: but it has nothing to do with the building
(15:10:33) fartron: so it's kind of lame
(15:11:46) buick: hello
(15:12:04) Bezzy: ah
(15:12:32) plachenko: whenever the multiplayer version comes out, notch
(15:12:37) plachenko: I would love to participate
(15:12:50) Bezzy: these block building/destroying games remind me of a game called abyss.
(15:12:52) fartron: i love that grass grows
(15:13:29) Bezzy: it was an indie game from about 2001
(15:13:43) Bezzy: can't find it online since everything is called "abyss"
(15:13:53) Bezzy: or was it spelt funny? I can't remember
(15:13:56) KareemK: is eurovision on now?
(15:14:20) Bezzy: anyhow, it had all this block removal/creation, but also had sort of... walk on walls style movement
(15:14:20) C418: I have no idea
(15:14:33) C418: modern pop music, hooray
(15:14:43) ***C418 continues making not modern pop music
(15:14:43) jsticker: Yes, KareemK
(15:14:50) jsticker: Lithuania currently
(15:14:54) jsticker: Or however it's spelled
(15:14:55) fartron: walk on walls style?
(15:14:57) Bezzy: i can't run infiniminer
(15:14:58) Bezzy: yeah
(15:15:06) C418: more extrawelt style
(15:15:08) Bezzy: you just walked into a wall and that became your floor
(15:15:08) KareemK: cool
(15:15:08) notch: new version out, you can't build in a space you're occupying, and I fixed a small graphical glitch with preview tiles
(15:15:11) KareemK: bbl
(15:15:36) Bezzy: and it did the method where it only rolls your camera during transitions, so that your aim isn't disrupted.
(15:15:41) fartron: i'm not sure how i feel about the new control notch... did you make it toggle so that you could put in the faded block where you are going to build?
(15:16:06) fartron: because i was thinking that it might work if you showed the faded block when you held the mousebutton and then built it when you released
(15:16:10) fartron: and you could keep the old control
(15:16:22) notch: oohh
(15:16:45) notch: I could get rid of the passive highlight all in all
(15:16:54) notch: it could do the same for remove (rmb)
(15:17:06) fartron: that too
(15:17:16) notch: but it'd force me to keep this clicky system
(15:17:25) fartron: bezzy, i remember reading your blog about the math for doing that, because i tried doing it in unrealscript at the time
(15:17:30) fartron: but i got lost in learning the math
(15:17:30) notch: I have some kind of vague plan of allowing miners to just keep the button pressed and walk around
(15:17:51) Bezzy: i didn't know about quaternions back then
(15:17:59) Bezzy: i could probably almost do it if i did it today
(15:18:13) notch: but now, girlfriend time. bbl =)
(15:18:24) fartron: priorities notch!
(15:18:34) C418: my album grew about 15 minutes this weekeend
(15:18:39) notch: yes, 5 minutes girlfriend, 100 hours code!
(15:18:42) notch: (wait..)
(15:18:57) notch: (no, that doesn't sound right)
(15:18:58) fartron: give yourself 30 minutes
(15:19:01) notch: toodles!
(15:19:05) fartron: later

(15:19:26) C418: yes, I'm quite happy with my result. people won't be
(15:19:33) C418: but I'm egoistic, never forget that

(15:21:16) C418: so people
(15:21:19) C418: I still need an album name
(15:21:22) C418: I don't have one
(15:21:37) fartron: is it a smooth jazz album
(15:21:39) fartron: or is it easy listening
(15:21:43) C418: ...
(15:21:45) C418: I have no idea
(15:21:51) C418: it is... everything

(15:53:26) fartron: dock, i had been dicking around and building and also spawning mobs, and then i explored some and found a natural entrance to the caves and went down and the mobs were there already
(15:53:27) fartron: it was great
(15:53:35) fartron: and it's a really nice cave system

(15:55:50) dock: c418, I may rename my track to headouch
(15:55:57) dock: or headdouche
(15:56:21) C418: aaah, you already have the musician effect

(15:57:46) C418: being a musician for me often is depressive
(15:57:53) dock: I do think I'm awesome
(15:58:00) dock: not so much at music, but at love making
(15:58:05) jsticker: So you think you're awesome
(15:58:41) Ina: Heya
(15:59:01) dock: I am awesome

(16:00:17) jw: my $3 game
(16:00:26) jsticker: Your attempt at viral marketing is a bit too obvious though
(16:00:27) jw: thats just a prototype/early build tho
(16:00:29) jw: in the vid
(16:00:39) dock: is this a tower defense?
(16:00:49) jsticker: Dual analog stick controls?
(16:01:05) dock: ah, twin stick shooter meets TD?
(16:01:07) C418: there is a mouse you can't see
(16:01:12) dock: ah
(16:01:21) jsticker: Seems interesting
(16:01:22) dock: so effectively a twin stick shooter
(16:01:23) jsticker: Do finish
(16:01:26) C418: I really think I need a new processor
(16:01:28) jw: not really TD
(16:01:29) C418: my processor is very decent
(16:01:34) jw: it playes a bit like engineer in tf2
(16:01:37) jw: -e
(16:01:40) jsticker: Make it dual stick
(16:01:52) C418: but if I'm able to make songs that use 80% of this processor... it really means I have to stock up

(16:03:57) fartron: notch has been busy
(16:04:01) C418: it's actually very weird. about two years ago when I had an average processor to that time, I rarely got to the point to get at my processors peaks
(16:04:28) C418: but when I got to the peak limits, meaning usually 90% processor power, I thought it would be time to get some more power
(16:04:30) BlademasterBobo: wow
(16:04:32) BlademasterBobo: what is this?
(16:04:35) C418: and now the same game starts again
(16:04:41) fartron: notch's infiniminer + DF project
(16:05:06) C418: higher processor, same software and still I reach the processor peaks
(16:05:45) ArneDesigner: I wonder why the Contra guys wear armour when they die on one shot
(16:05:48) fartron: how do they measure cpu usage in multicore systems?
(16:05:58) ArneDesigner: well, actually they're barechested in hte early games
(16:06:01) C418: they usually split the channels between all the corse
(16:06:04) C418: cores...
(16:06:11) C418: well, if you have, say a song with 4 channels
(16:06:15) C418: and a 4 core processor

(16:22:37) dock: because it went from something I wanted to play to something that I won't ever bother trying

(16:24:45) C418: did you see what I saw?
(16:25:10) dock: maybe you have a higher tolerance for boring looking fps 
(16:25:25) C418: boring looking?
(16:25:37) dock: yep
(16:25:38) fartron: lets settle this with videos
(16:25:40) fartron: that you can link me to
(16:25:46) C418: when I find it

(16:29:54) dock: he has too much of a thing for quake 3 style stuff, which is fine but not for me
(16:30:06) fartron: what is quake 3 style stuff
(16:30:07) BlademasterBobo: The building stuff looks neat though

(16:31:21) dock: I saw a thing with two teams of people shooting shit at each other
(16:31:33) C418: I still don't know if we're talking about the same game actually
(16:31:36) dock: with static torsos
(16:31:41) dock: yeah we are

(16:32:42) C418: is it?
(16:32:48) DeM0nFiRe: I mean, it doesn't look like something Iw ould like to play, but you got to appreciate the innovation
(16:32:50) C418: again, I see constant development
(16:32:53) dock: well we'll see what happens with Love 
(16:33:08) C418: duke nukem never had constant development
(16:33:11) dock: hopefully I'll be wrong 
(16:33:14) BlademasterBobo: I see me trying it and then getting really frustrated when people destroy my buildings
(16:33:35) C418: they can't
(16:33:45) BlademasterBobo: no?
(16:33:45) C418: except they have a token there I suppose
(16:33:49) C418: at your place
(16:33:52) BlademasterBobo: isn't that the point?
(16:34:00) jw: ?
(16:34:03) C418: the point is to win the battle against the world
(16:34:12) C418: not against other players, as far as I know
(16:34:21) BlademasterBobo: huh
(16:34:28) dock: well we'll see what happens with deathmatch option
(16:34:31) BlademasterBobo: I don't buy that
(16:34:32) BlademasterBobo: but ok

(16:41:51) BlademasterBobo: neither of you are going to change your minds
(16:41:53) dock: because I dare to have lost interest in it 
(16:42:02) C418: because I have no clue

(16:42:12) BlademasterBobo: about it
(16:42:24) dock: to take my mind of eurovision

(16:49:50) Z80: "Language."
(16:50:15) Super-Dot: pronunciation system
(16:50:49) Z80: Indeed.
(16:51:02) dock: garbled english
(16:51:44) dock: some of it is nonsense tho :)
(16:51:49) Z80: K.K. doesn't sing in garbled english.
(16:51:50) dock: I love it
(16:51:57) dock: no he doesn't

(16:53:23) Super-Dot: K.K. Rider is my favorite song in Brawl
(16:53:36) dock: K K Ska is my favourite KK song 
(16:53:36) Super-Dot: I made several stages just as excuses to listen to it
(16:55:15) Z80: I don't get why people like Go K.K. Rider so much.
(16:55:16) Z80: :(

(16:56:36) Super-Dot: Z80: the Brawl version or the AC version?
(16:56:56) Z80: Both, but the AC version is worse.
(16:56:56) Super-Dot: I just listened to the AC version and it's underwhelming compared to the Brawl version
(16:57:14) Super-Dot: Mostly because it's KK singing
(16:57:25) Super-Dot: *I like it mostly because it's KK
(16:57:27) Super-Dot: singing
(16:57:31) C418: I kind of want to record some scenes of minecraft for a song of mine
(16:57:52) Super-Dot: Wait, Minecraft is playable now?

(16:59:42) Super-Dot: Hmm, white screen
(16:59:52) Super-Dot: Does the white screen go away after a while?
(17:00:17) plachenko: did the game load?
(17:00:25) plachenko: because if it did, you should be seeing textures n' shit
(17:00:30) Super-Dot: it went through the LWJGL loader
(17:00:37) Super-Dot: and then gave me a white screen
(17:00:42) plachenko: then you should be seeing the game :(
(17:00:57) plachenko: refresh, maybe?
(17:01:16) Super-Dot: Refreshing didn't work
(17:01:20) Super-Dot: I'll try it in Firefox

(17:06:53) C418: er. yes
(17:06:54) C418: hm

(17:09:04) C418: it sort of looks like a ds game
(17:09:06) Super-Dot: Dock, what kinda Mac do you have?
(17:09:36) dock: right now I'm on a windows laptop

(17:14:48) Z80: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfLhnkme2mE&feature=related | Fuck those bitches who started clapping.  :(
(17:15:22) Super-Dot: PSDs work best with Photoshop, but you're right
(17:16:20) pekuja: can PhotoShop read XCF's?
(17:16:39) Siiseli: mm I've got tea coming

(17:20:26) C418: I DO
(17:20:27) Z80: Yeah, I learned that after.
(17:20:34) fartron: The Maggot is one off the top of my head, by the Melvins
(17:20:49) dock: I shall call him "amstrad CPC "

(17:30:40) Lunar is now known as Lunaway
(17:30:42) fartron: dystopia
(17:30:54) DeM0nFiRe: Half Life 2 is the most exciting and progressive
(17:31:00) DeM0nFiRe: Of the three
(17:31:02) dock: play that then
(17:31:04) C418: hl2 in hard
(17:31:05) Zaratustra: is it.
(17:31:06) fartron: how is hl2 progressive
(17:31:07) DeM0nFiRe: Yeah, but
(17:31:07) C418: I mean on
(17:31:09) dock: I love the tunnels in hl2

(17:31:11) DeM0nFiRe: I already beat it
(17:31:12) fartron: but it is not progressive

(17:31:13) Siiseli: hl2 on smod
(17:31:16) Siiseli: and on hard
(17:31:23) Siiseli: with iron sight
(17:31:25) DeM0nFiRe: fartron, it is more so than either of teh other 2
(17:31:34) fartron: how so? it's straight up quake 1 gameplay
(17:31:47) Siiseli: hl2 was all waiting to be in the next area
(17:31:48) DeM0nFiRe: No it isn't?
(17:31:52) dock: I also like how black men and white men can stand next to each other and have the same voice. It's quite a vision of racial harmony. 
(17:32:07) DeM0nFiRe: HL2 is puzzle based largely
(17:32:18) DeM0nFiRe: Even most of the firefights have puzzles
(17:32:24) dock: puzzles me :) 
(17:32:24) DeM0nFiRe: I mean, you could just run and gun through them
(17:32:27) DeM0nFiRe: BUt that's lame
(17:32:42) dock: yeah, I thought it was lame
(17:32:49) DeM0nFiRe: Most big firefights in HL2 have something you're supposed to do besides just shooting
(17:32:50) dock: :) 
(17:33:19) C418: dock hates everything in first person
(17:33:25) plachenko: pfft I just realized: Saxton hale = Hot Anal Sex

(17:36:19) Z80: But, Siiseli, if I'm just using it for two small pictures that aren't even being posted on a website or the TIGF, I don't think it especially matters.
(17:36:22) Z80: You know?
(17:36:33) BRBobo: Z80 just ignore him
(17:36:34) BRBobo: it works
(17:36:49) Z80: Why?  It's not like I'm upset.
(17:36:58) Z80: And if he starts becoming angry, I'll ignore him,.
(17:37:27) Siiseli: Z80, yeah you're right
(17:37:37) Siiseli: oh and I'm in no way angry
(17:37:38) Siiseli: or upset

(17:43:29) dock: rape?
(17:44:02) dock: we are failing at eurovision
(17:44:28) Z80: Fartron, he says "woah" in probably every movie he has ever been in.
(17:44:37) fartron: not like he says it in the matrix
(17:44:49) fartron: where it's a whole scene centered around his whoa
(17:44:56) Z80: Haha, fair enough.
(17:45:09) Thi3f: So save the internet and make a video, fartron :<
(17:45:22) fartron: i would have to download the matrix
(17:45:26) fartron: and a video editing software
(17:45:33) Thi3f: Whatever it takes!
(17:45:33) fartron: when all i wanted was a funny link to put in irc
(17:45:46) Z80: Fartron, does this work: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ5iFQv1KaE
(17:46:08) fartron: it's close
(17:46:11) fartron: but i just wanted the whoa
(17:46:19) Z80: Yeah, fair enough.
(17:46:21) fartron: also it's 10 seconds
(17:46:57) C418: 5 seconds movies never were 5 seconds
(17:46:58) fartron: what i love about keeanu is that he has amazingly been given role after role that fit his inability to act perfectly
(17:46:58) Z80: Indeed.
(17:47:08) C418: doug broke his own rule even in his first 5 seconds movie
(17:49:01) fartron: i'm surprised there isn't a whoah compilation for him the way there is the nonono one for whatsisface

(23:16:14) shinygerbil: shame :|
(23:16:23) shinygerbil: beastman means random mutation on level up
(23:16:48) shinygerbil: and following a chaos god means they sometimes decide to do fun things on level up
(23:16:56) shinygerbil: such as, giving you an extra pair of arms
(23:16:58) pd_tsc [hunter@71.232.50.3] entered the room.
(23:17:05) shinygerbil: or surrounding you with impossibly tough monsters

(23:32:50) PFawkes: because we should SO play that
(23:32:54) paul|2: lol

(23:33:36) _SMRobot [littleripp@121.217.146.12] entered the room.
(23:33:38) PFawkes: and no people on any servers anymore :(
(23:33:57) PFawkes: I think it is due for a reawakening

(23:34:39) Cow: anyone want to play some L4D survival?
(23:34:49) Z80_: No.
(23:34:49) Z80_: :(
(23:34:56) PFawkes: I am sad that wulframII is dead
(23:34:56) Cow: I've only played a few levels
(23:34:58) paul|2: can't
(23:34:59) Z80_: (Deep down, yes.)
(23:34:59) PFawkes: it was fun
(23:35:11) Cow: 4 golds and 1 silver, so 5 levels I guess
(23:35:30) _SMRobot: argh stuck on cave story :(
(23:35:33) Cow: 4 Mark Johns and 1 silver
(23:35:57) PFawkes: oh well
(23:35:57) Dragonene [none@202.171.170.5] entered the room.
(23:36:18) PFawkes: NWN time
(23:36:59) Dragonene: HELLO time
(23:37:15) BlademasterBobo: Cow
(23:37:17) BlademasterBobo: :O
(23:37:22) Cow: o_O
(23:37:28) BlademasterBobo: O_o
(23:37:33) Z80_: PFawkes, it is very fun.
(23:37:34) Z80_: :D
(23:37:59) Dragonene: Look, it's my good friend CowmasterFawkes80
(23:38:13) Cow: apparently I got 20,488 points as a Smoker
(23:38:22) BlademasterBobo: apparently you are smokin'
(23:38:23) paul|2 is now known as cowmasterfawkes80|not
(23:38:28) ***BlademasterBobo is sorry
(23:39:03) Drakkar: wassup guys
(23:39:18) Cow: I'll just play by myself then
(23:39:20) Dragonene: Heya Drakkar
(23:39:24) Drakkar: infiniminer went open source
(23:39:25) Z80_: We should play TF2.
(23:39:26) Drakkar: RAD HUH?
(23:39:26) Z80_: >:O
(23:39:29) Cow: maybe go for Red Mist
(23:39:32) tantan: someone link me to this wolfram game
(23:39:32) Drakkar: man
(23:39:34) Drakkar: I was saddened
(23:39:37) tantan: it sounds familiar
(23:39:37) _SMRobot: waht
(23:39:37) Drakkar: right when I got TF2
(23:39:39) _SMRobot: Infiniminer
(23:39:40) Dragonene: www.wolframalpha.com
(23:39:41) Z80_: It's not a game, tantan.
(23:39:41) Dragonene: ?
(23:39:41) Drakkar: everyone got L4D
(23:39:41) Z80_: :P
(23:39:44) _SMRobot: linkies please
(23:39:49) Drakkar: sec
(23:39:50) Z80_: Drakkar, shall we play Tf2?
(23:39:58) tantan: what was palefox talking about
(23:39:59) Z80_: *TF2?
(23:40:05) Dragonene: I'd play either TF2 or L4D...
(23:40:13) tantan: oh wulfram
(23:40:13) Dragonene: If my computer didn't bluescreen when starting them :(
(23:40:16) Dragonene: I hate this laptop
(23:40:32) Drakkar: http://github.com/krispykrem/Infiniminer/issues
(23:40:36) Drakkar: I need to reinstall steam
(23:40:37) Z80_: Dragonene: :(
(23:40:46) Drakkar: I'd be totally willing but uh
(23:40:52) _SMRobot: I don't think I could run L4D
(23:40:54) Drakkar: that involves like a day's worth of downloading haha
(23:41:00) _SMRobot: I can run TF2 on mid-low
(23:41:06) Drakkar: I'll probably reinstall this week though
(23:41:13) Cow: L4D has really low sys reqs
(23:41:22) Cow: rly lw sysreqs
(23:41:51) Dragonene: Cow: that doesn't stop it from bluescreening me
(23:41:57) tantan: shit no
(23:42:00) snakesqzns: decide my fate: 1) watch Mushi-Shi episode #1, or 2) play SF2HD
(23:42:05) Dragonene: Left 4 BSOD
(23:42:06) Drakkar: but yeah
(23:42:08) Drakkar: I'm pretty happy
(23:42:11) tantan: why did i just say yes to biking
(23:42:16) Drakkar: infiniminer will teach me quite a bit
(23:42:19) tantan: aaah why am i too nice sometimes
(23:42:31) _SMRobot: would it run on 1.66GHz Core Duo with 512mb ram and 256mb 7400 GO graphics card
(23:42:32) Cow: I want to make a level for L4D
(23:42:34) Cow: that would be fun
(23:42:37) Z80_: I do too.
(23:42:41) BlademasterBobo: or really annoying
(23:42:42) Dragonene: Me too
(23:42:45) Dragonene: let's make a collablevel
(23:42:47) Cow: or really fun
(23:42:47) BlademasterBobo is now known as BRBobo
(23:42:50) Dragonene: I'm sure the SDK will run for me! :D
(23:43:05) Cow: Independent 4 Lief
(23:43:17) Dragonene: Left 4 Indie?
(23:43:20) Z80_: Dragonene, how do you test?
(23:43:21) Z80_: :(
(23:43:21) Cow: no
(23:43:25) Cow: mine is more clever
(23:43:29) Dragonene: Z80_: I don't!
(23:43:31) Drakkar: .
(23:43:35) Drakkar: cave 4 dead?
(23:43:37) Z80_: Well okay then.
(23:43:38) Z80_ is now known as Z80
(23:43:48) Dragonene: Left 4 Alpha Turbo HD Remix?
(23:43:53) Dragonene: (It's a street fighter map!)
(23:43:54) ***Z80 writes a song.
(23:43:55) Drakkar: left 4 dead ripoff?
(23:44:10) Z80: Based off of thisL <Drakkar> cave 4 dead?
(23:44:11) ***Dragonene writes long
(23:44:12) Dragonene: long
(23:44:14) Dragonene: there, I did it
(23:44:20) Drakkar: lmao
(23:44:22) Z80: You did it twice.
(23:44:23) Z80: :(
(23:46:00) snakesqzns: left 4 donuts
(23:46:13) Dragonene: where do I find the L4D sdk?
(23:46:19) _SMRobot: left 4 rent
(23:46:24) _SMRobot: tools tab
(23:46:52) Dragonene: do I need the source SDK base as well?
(23:46:59) _SMRobot: not sure
(23:47:05) Dragonene: okay.
(23:47:12) Dragonene: I'll find out I guess
(23:48:01) cowmasterfawkes80|not: l4d devkit coming soon right
(23:48:17) Dragonene: no
(23:48:18) Dragonene: tis out
(23:48:31) Dragonene: beta version
(23:48:53) _SMRobot: anyone here use tumblr?
(23:48:58) Dragonene: notch does.
(23:49:29) _SMRobot: I know
(23:49:34) _SMRobot: he's following me
(23:49:42) Dragonene: Oh :)
(23:49:44) pekuja: -win 19
(23:49:45) _SMRobot: he convinced me to use it
(23:49:47) pekuja: oops
(23:49:59) Dragonene: Agreed pekuja
(23:52:15) Dragonene: I like how the L4D authoring tools think they started at 87% downloaded
(23:52:24) _SMRobot: they did
(23:52:25) Dragonene: Steam is clearly mislead
(23:52:27) _SMRobot: L4D content
(23:52:32) Dragonene: oh
(23:52:36) _SMRobot: already installed as is source engine
(23:52:37) Dragonene: I see
(23:52:47) _SMRobot: It doesn't redownload files
(23:52:55) Dragonene: No well
(23:53:00) Z80: I recorded a song in which I sing.
(23:53:03) Dragonene: I thought it assumed you had L4D installed
(23:53:06) Z80: This was a terrible idea.
(23:53:09) Dragonene: But I guess it wouldn't have to
(23:54:00) _SMRobot: Z80 I want to hear it
(23:54:35) Z80: Keep in mind that this is a joke: https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/526129/Harmonica/12%20Bar%20%2B%20Vocals/Cave%20Story%27s%20Dead.mp3
(23:55:22) Z80: This is too long.
(23:56:01) _SMRobot: tinyurl
(23:56:03) Z80: _SMRobot is speechless.
(23:56:06) Z80: Meh.
(23:57:21) Z80: _SMRobot is speechless once more.
(23:57:45) _SMRobot: lol
(23:57:55) _SMRobot: is a'ight
(23:58:00) Z80: Hahahahahaha.
(23:58:14) Z80: I thought that it was terrible.
(23:58:21) _SMRobot: it's a great gaaaaaame
(23:58:30) Z80: Hahahahaha.
(23:58:37) Dragonene: *ack*
(23:58:43) Dragonene: I can't think straight
(23:58:47) Dragonene: who's good at tree traversal?
(23:58:54) Dragonene: lansing: wake up!
(23:59:19) Z80: This is how I wrote the lyrics for that line: 
(23:59:19) Z80: It's a great gaaaaaame!
(23:59:20) Z80: :D
(23:59:40) _SMRobot: lol
(00:00:04) _SMRobot: installing Visual C#
(00:00:10) _SMRobot: time to make me a game
(00:00:24) _SMRobot: I know C++ so it should be pretty simple
(00:00:30) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(00:00:34) Drakkar: its closer to java
(00:00:35) Drakkar: actually
(00:00:37) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.

(00:00:55) Arf: yes
(00:00:56) Dragonene: yeah
(00:00:56) _SMRobot: I'll learn
(00:00:57) Drakkar: but it has a pretty significant C feel too
(00:01:00) Dragonene: C# is Java-like
(00:01:03) Drakkar: so you should have a leg up regardless
(00:01:07) Dragonene: which is A Good Thing (tm)
(00:01:09) Arf: Man
(00:01:12) Drakkar: I agree
(00:01:16) Arf: I should really get back to learning C++ and allegro
(00:01:18) Drakkar: I like C# quite a bit
(00:01:21) gandhi [gandhi@pool-71-178-240-50.washdc.fios.verizon.net] entered the room.
(00:01:23) Cait|Socialist is now known as Cait
(00:01:23) Drakkar: and XNA is
(00:01:24) Dragonene: I haven't actually used C#
(00:01:24) Drakkar: arousing
(00:01:27) Dragonene: just looked at some code
(00:01:29) Drakkar: like
(00:01:34) Arf: man
(00:01:34) Drakkar: I would have sex with it
(00:01:37) Drakkar: right on the spot
(00:01:44) Arf: whoever composed the music for barkley shut up and jam was a fucking genius
(00:01:47) Arf: and I wonder what he used
(00:01:58) _SMRobot: I'm planning on using XNA
(00:01:59) Drakkar: they finally figured out how to document a fucking library
(00:02:00) Drakkar: <_<
(00:02:02) _SMRobot: is it good for 2d?
(00:02:03) Drakkar: dude
(00:02:06) Drakkar: the XNA helpfile
(00:02:08) Drakkar: is so good
(00:02:11) Drakkar: I dunno
(00:02:17) Drakkar: my plans for XNA are purely 3d
(00:02:23) _SMRobot: like sex in a code library good?
(00:02:28) Drakkar: like
(00:02:32) Drakkar: they list you everything you want
(00:02:35) Drakkar: and nothing you don't
(00:02:41) Drakkar: with a minimum of made up jargon
(00:02:42) _SMRobot: man that's cool
(00:02:47) Drakkar: the help file is literally
(00:02:49) Drakkar: category of code
(00:02:49) _SMRobot: and all you get is mac fanboy hate
(00:02:59) Drakkar: > code
(00:03:08) Drakkar: and the actual listing is basically just
(00:03:10) Drakkar: example of use
(00:03:14) _SMRobot: nice
(00:03:14) Drakkar: description of what it does
(00:03:16) Drakkar: and how it does it
(00:03:19) Drakkar: nothing more
(00:03:30) Drakkar: occassionally they go on a little oh you could do this with it too
(00:03:34) _SMRobot: I liked SFML when I tried it
(00:04:16) Arf: that's pretty cool
(00:04:28) Drakkar: its precisely how it should be done
(00:04:35) Drakkar: I was absolutely impressed
(00:04:46) Stargoat: I wonder if "indie" can encompass companies such as Treasure. They pretty much do their own thing, right?
(00:04:58) ***PFawkes yawns
(00:05:06) Drakkar: I guess it could
(00:05:13) Arf: Ikaruga yessss
(00:05:14) PFawkes: being evil in NWN makes me feel like a jerk
(00:05:17) Arf: why isn't there an Ikaruga 2
(00:05:19) PFawkes: er
(00:05:21) SephiRok [innoxious@93-103-9-86.static.t-2.net] entered the room.
(00:05:22) _SMRobot: NWN1 or 2
(00:05:25) PFawkes: NWN1
(00:05:28) PFawkes: I haven't played 2
(00:05:29) _SMRobot: awesome
(00:05:30) Drakkar: being evil is so lacking in rewards
(00:05:30) Stargoat: they were apparently working on a shooter for the 360
(00:05:30) Drakkar: :(
(00:05:36) Stargoat: I dunno if it's still being made
(00:05:36) PFawkes: I just randomly kill people
(00:05:41) Dragonene: Drakkar: I've heard very mixed things about XNA
(00:05:43) PFawkes: especially the nurses in city core
(00:05:46) Drakkar: yeah so have I
(00:05:46) PFawkes: because they respawn
(00:05:52) Drakkar: apparently they fixed the distribution issue though
(00:05:55) PFawkes: so they come back angry at me >.>
(00:06:03) Drakkar: and now you can make installers that install everything you need to where it needs to be
(00:06:07) Drakkar: along with the game
(00:06:12) Dragonene: So you're saying the documentation lives up to Java standards?
(00:06:14) Drakkar: I have yet to test this
(00:06:16) Drakkar: but
(00:06:18) Drakkar: its nice
(00:06:23) Dragonene: because that's the hardest thing about any new language for me. Javadoc is soooo nice :P
(00:06:26) Drakkar: it reminds me more of uh
(00:06:36) Drakkar: game maker's documentation on GML
(00:06:39) PFawkes: javascript
(00:06:41) PFawkes: ;)
(00:06:44) Dragonene: I haven't used game maker.
(00:06:46) Drakkar: like
(00:06:50) Drakkar: it'll have a networking section
(00:06:57) Drakkar: and under that is everything you would use for networking
(00:07:01) Dragonene: ah okay
(00:07:04) Dragonene: yeah, that's nice
(00:07:19) Drakkar: and its all fairly intuitive
(00:07:27) Drakkar: nothing goes where it doesn't belong as far as I've seen
(00:08:35) _SMRobot: so better than flash docs
(00:08:43) Stargoat: have you played Radiant Silvergun, Arf?
(00:08:52) Arf: Noe
(00:08:55) Arf: but  always wanted to
(00:08:58) Stargoat: it's a cool game
(00:09:06) Arf: So I heard
(00:09:14) Arf: most people like that more than Ikaruga
(00:09:15) Drakkar: fff
(00:09:20) Drakkar: I've always wanted to play radiant silvergun
(00:09:23) Drakkar: but not in the uh
(00:09:26) Drakkar: neutered fashion
(00:09:33) Drakkar: that the english speakers recieved
(00:09:34) Stargoat: dispite being the spiritual prequel to Ika, it's almost diametrically opposed in terms of style
(00:09:49) Stargoat: neutered fashion?
(00:09:49) Drakkar: because the arcade version
(00:09:52) Drakkar: which is in english
(00:09:54) Stargoat: Ika was never released outside japan
(00:10:04) Drakkar: actually has a summarized plot
(00:10:09) Stargoat: not ika*
(00:10:11) Stargoat: RS*
(00:10:14) Stargoat: hmm
(00:10:16) Drakkar: instead of the japanese version's
(00:10:18) Stargoat: I didn't know that
(00:10:18) Drakkar: full storyline
(00:10:21) Stargoat: I have it on the Saturn
(00:10:21) Drakkar: dialogue between stages
(00:10:22) Drakkar: BAM
(00:10:36) Drakkar: the arcade version is much lamer
(00:10:41) Stargoat: the Japanese arcade version of RS took out most of the story shit, too
(00:10:44) Drakkar: but it generally covers it
(00:10:45) Drakkar: yeah
(00:10:50) Drakkar: its because of the move to arcade
(00:11:07) Stargoat: the story in RS is pretty awesome, actually
(00:11:17) MisterX left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(00:11:17) Stargoat: reminds me of Neon Genesis, a lot
(00:11:19) Drakkar: so I've heard
(00:11:27) Drakkar: hence why I want to play it in full
(00:11:35) Drakkar: though not the neon genesis part
(00:11:39) Drakkar: I'm not an eva fan :p
(00:11:55) Stargoat: perhaps it'll get an english release XBLA-side or something
(00:11:57) Stargoat: really?
(00:12:06) Stargoat: I thought it was awesome :\
(00:12:13) Drakkar: oh I don't doubt it is
(00:12:16) Drakkar: I just never liked it
(00:12:16) Dragonene: _SMRobot: it's not so hard to have better docs than flash...
(00:12:21) Drakkar: I'm kind of picky with anime
(00:12:22) Dragonene: Staaaaaargoaaaat
(00:12:23) Stargoat: each to their own I guess
(00:12:26) Dragonene: I was at mycube yesterday
(00:12:27) Drakkar: yeah
(00:12:29) Stargoat: yo, Dragonene
(00:12:33) Dragonene: We didn't play blackmail
(00:12:40) Stargoat: damn!
(00:12:41) Stargoat: why not?
(00:12:42) _SMRobot: Flash put mo off docs for a long time
(00:12:46) _SMRobot: this was MX tho
(00:12:50) Dragonene: Forgot to!
(00:12:55) Dragonene: ...(or something)
(00:12:57) Stargoat: ou are a terrible person.
(00:13:00) Stargoat: you*
(00:13:04) Dragonene: Actually we banned it.
(00:13:04) Drakkar: there needs to be some sort of lunch money card rpg
(00:13:06) Dragonene: It's too good
(00:13:08) Drakkar: that would be so rad
(00:13:10) Dragonene: We're unworthy of playing it
(00:13:22) Stargoat: anyway, Radiant Silvergun's pacing and systems are quite dis-similar to Ika's
(00:13:39) Stargoat: where Ika is simplistic, RS is quite complex
(00:13:47) Stargoat: there are around 4-5 different scoring systems
(00:14:13) Stargoat: the levels also feel very long
(00:14:25) Dragonene: I also listened through a QotSA album for the first time
(00:14:29) Stargoat: oh?
(00:14:31) Z80: Does Ika = Ikaruga?
(00:14:31) Stargoat: which album?
(00:14:32) Dragonene: I've never actually listened to an entire album of theirs before
(00:14:33) Stargoat: yeah
(00:14:36) Dragonene: Uh, I can't recall
(00:14:44) Stargoat: what did you think?
(00:14:49) Z80: Ah, okay.
(00:14:49) Dragonene: One of their newer ones I think?
(00:14:53) Drakkar: there's always ika chan
(00:14:53) Dragonene: The one that has go with the flow
(00:14:59) Stargoat: oh
(00:15:02) Stargoat: not really that new
(00:15:04) Stargoat: Songs for the Deaf
(00:15:05) Drakkar: I wish there was a sequel to that
(00:15:08) Dragonene: right
(00:15:09) Stargoat: I think it's their best album
(00:15:09) snakesqzns left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(00:15:12) Dragonene: It was good, aye
(00:15:14) Dragonene: I liked it.
(00:15:17) Stargoat: well... that or Rated R
(00:15:25) Stargoat: their newer stuff is a little ~
(00:15:29) Dragonene: I have two of their albums on my archos
(00:15:35) Stargoat: archos?
(00:15:37) Dragonene: might listen to the other one soonish
(00:15:39) Dragonene: uh
(00:15:41) Dragonene: my PMP
(00:15:46) Dragonene: portable media player
(00:15:46) Stargoat: right
(00:15:48) Dragonene: video player
(00:15:49) Dragonene: whatever :P
(00:15:50) Stargoat: PIMP
(00:15:57) Stargoat: portable interactive media player
(00:16:03) Dragonene: :D
(00:16:15) _SMRobot: My PSP is such a PIMP
(00:16:29) Stargoat: :|
(00:16:38) Dragonene: Hah!
(00:16:44) Dragonene: My PIMP is such a PS- oh wait.
(00:17:17) Stargoat: :| !
(00:17:21) Stargoat: hmm.
(00:17:26) Drakkar: but yeah
(00:17:46) Drakkar: I'm writing a design document that I will probably attempt to turn into a game using XNA
(00:17:49) Stargoat: Anyway, Radiant Silvergun is a great game, but if you like ika, you won't necessarily like RS
(00:18:06) PFawkes: hm
(00:18:13) PFawkes: I have always wanted to play RS
(00:18:53) Stargoat: one of the bosses is inspired by the R-9 ship
(00:18:56) Drakkar: there need to be more blah heroes games
(00:18:59) Drakkar: period
(00:19:04) Drakkar: guardian heroes was great
(00:19:07) Drakkar: gunstar heroes was great
(00:19:10) Stargoat: guardian heroes sequel!
(00:19:15) Drakkar: even the remake of gunstar heroes was pretty great
(00:19:18) Drakkar: though sadly single player
(00:19:29) lemre: http://www.freewebs.com/mistysocean/seel.gif
(00:19:36) Stargoat: ON gba?
(00:19:41) Stargoat: ON*
(00:19:44) Stargoat: on*
(00:19:44) Drakkar: also there were some really ridiculously difficult parts
(00:19:45) Drakkar: yeah
(00:19:47) Stargoat: stupid caps
(00:20:12) Z80: <Drakkar> there need to be more blah heroes games
(00:20:17) Z80: Guitar Heroes
(00:20:25) Drakkar: pssh
(00:20:25) lemre: man
(00:20:30) lemre: i hated that gba sequel
(00:20:32) Drakkar: actually that'd be a hilarious crossover
(00:20:40) lemre: it was just such a weird hodgepodge of ideas
(00:20:52) lemre: that last board game level took up like 4/5 of the game
(00:20:52) Drakkar: it was alot of extra content that meant absolutely nothing yeah
(00:20:55) lemre: such a bizarre structure
(00:20:56) Drakkar: yeaaaaaaaah
(00:21:04) Drakkar: that was probably the biggest issue
(00:21:06) Drakkar: right there
(00:21:08) lazycow [starfox@pD9E46F90.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(00:21:13) Drakkar: but
(00:21:49) Drakkar: the only other issues I had were limitations of the system
(00:21:53) Drakkar: / misuses of the system
(00:21:57) Drakkar: such as the sound
(00:22:00) Drakkar: oh god the sound
(00:22:01) lemre: guardian heroes advance was probably a really poor representation of what the original was like
(00:22:09) lemre: i'd still like to play the original, one of these days
(00:22:12) Drakkar: yeah it was
(00:22:16) Drakkar: quite a bit actually
(00:22:43) Stargoat: I have the original on the Wii
(00:22:49) Drakkar: but it did a few things which as a fanboy I was pretty chuffed about
(00:22:53) Drakkar: like expanding the storyline
(00:22:56) Stargoat: Gunstar is cool, but I prefer Contra and Metal Slug.
(00:23:00) Drakkar: making the seven force fight three times as awesome
(00:23:13) _SMRobot: METAL SLUGH
(00:23:15) BRBobo: hi Stargoat
(00:23:16) Stargoat: I do like the weapon combo system of Gunstar, though.
(00:23:17) BRBobo: Gunstar is better
(00:23:18) Stargoat: yo, bobo
(00:23:19) Drakkar: and I'm pretty sure you could unlock green
(00:23:22) BRBobo is now known as BlademasterBobo
(00:23:24) Drakkar: which
(00:23:34) Stargoat: NO BOBO UR RONG ALL UR OPINIONS ARE RONG
(00:23:36) Drakkar: is quite arousing to a man like me
(00:23:37) Drakkar: ;]
(00:23:52) Drakkar: on the metal slug note though
(00:24:01) Drakkar: I really only enjoy the pixel art of the metal slug games
(00:24:05) Z80: Drakkar finds the color green hot.
(00:24:09) mewse: Hm..  if I required support for pixel shaders in my games, do you suppose that everyone would hate me?
(00:24:11) Drakkar: I do
(00:24:19) Drakkar: I would not
(00:24:23) Drakkar: people will complain though
(00:24:36) Drakkar: is it possibly to do an either/or thing?
(00:24:43) PFawkes: I like Metal Slug
(00:24:43) mewse: People always complain.  ;)
(00:24:46) PFawkes: for the gameplay
(00:24:46) Drakkar: like an option to not use pixel shaders features?
(00:24:51) SnakeyAtWork: mewse: Not really.
(00:24:51) Drakkar: -s
(00:25:01) SnakeyAtWork: I've already decided to make my engine Shader Model 2 dependent
(00:25:02) mewse: Sure, it's possible.  It's just a question of whether it's worth the time to make sure that both approaches work.
(00:25:04) Drakkar: as I've never actually seen it
(00:25:13) Dragonene: I made a game that uses shaders
(00:25:20) SnakeyAtWork: mewse: Well, why would you need Pixel Shaders?
(00:25:22) Dragonene: we decided to keep it so that it'd work both with and without
(00:25:22) Drakkar: I don't think it is if you're looking at
(00:25:28) Dragonene: and without shaders it'll just look plain boring
(00:25:30) Drakkar: how many people will play and won't because of pixel shaders
(00:25:31) mewse: I've made lots of games which use shaders.  But none have actually required them.
(00:25:33) Drakkar: but
(00:25:34) Dragonene: no fancy schmancy stuff
(00:25:42) SnakeyAtWork: But then whats the point?
(00:25:55) Drakkar: there are people who do like to play games on their laptops
(00:26:04) Dragonene: yea
(00:26:11) Dragonene: my laptop supposedly supports shaders
(00:26:13) SnakeyAtWork: Drakkar: Even then, there are lots of laptops that now have pixel shaders
(00:26:14) Dragonene: but in practice...
(00:26:15) Dragonene: not so much
(00:26:17) _SMRobot: I have Pixel shader 3 on my lappy
(00:26:27) Drakkar: yeah but its not always the case as Dragonene stated
(00:26:28) Drakkar: haha
(00:26:29) SnakeyAtWork: mewse: It all comes down to who the game is for.
(00:26:45) ***Stargoat is portable interactive media playering pixel shader 4
(00:26:46) Stargoat: btiches.
(00:26:48) SnakeyAtWork: Since my engine is targetted at actual gamers (who have GPU's) then I didn't matter 
(00:26:49) Dragonene: it's an MMO mmo
(00:26:49) Stargoat: bitches!
(00:26:54) Dragonene: so probably pretty hardcore gamers...
(00:27:06) mewse: Heh.  Probably.  :)

(00:27:47) buick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4gJWJUOBXM
(00:28:17) Drakkar: you probably want to look at who might play the sort of game it is
(00:28:25) Drakkar: and consider the demographics
(00:28:25) Drakkar: :P
(00:28:27) SnakeyAtWork: Drakkar: Yeah I kind of said that :D
(00:28:31) Drakkar: ah
(00:28:32) Drakkar: whoops
(00:28:34) Drakkar: didn't see
(00:28:35) Drakkar: xD
(00:28:48) SnakeyAtWork: Once you know who it's for, it's a little easier :)
(00:28:54) Drakkar: indeed
(00:28:56) Dragonene: ack
(00:29:00) Drakkar: I'm going all out on my XNA game
(00:29:09) SnakeyAtWork: I'd really like to make a web based MMO, but I have trouble thinking outside of a basic war game at the moment.
(00:29:15) Dragonene: I just gave myself a tricky task
(00:29:29) SnakeyAtWork: basic war game = build buildings, get resources, build units, attack
(00:29:38) Drakkar: because the 360 is a very tempting audience
(00:30:16) Drakkar: and also ripe for rpg pickings
(00:31:03) Dragonene: what's that buick
(00:31:06) Dragonene: it confuses me

(00:33:45) mewse: I don't believe in the "pick a demographic and make a game for them" approach.  I mean, yes it works if you're going to make a boring game that's 90% the same as an existing game which everybody's played before.  But sometimes you have to try to carve out your own little niche.  :)

(01:22:58) RinkuHero: i was surprised how many people said that game had bad graphics
(01:23:00) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: almost got a flash thing going
(01:23:02) Dragonene: it also reminds me of one of my games
(01:23:09) RinkuHero: i thought it had some of the better graphics i've seen in indie games in a while
(01:23:13) RinkuHero: (grapple buggy i mean)
(01:23:16) BlademasterBobo: BMcC: Kind of ripping off Alec's component idea for Monocle
(01:23:19) Dragonene: ( http://www.x2d.org/java/4k/spiderball ) see, it's clearly the same game
(01:23:22) Dragonene: although not quite.
(01:23:44) BlademasterBobo: probably going to be really slow! :D
(01:24:06) BMcC: Yeah, the graphics are nasty in a good way
(01:24:11) BMcC: Also, what do you mean, Bobo?
(01:24:15) BMcC: Like, modular code?
(01:24:18) BlademasterBobo: yeah
(01:24:20) BMcC: Ah
(01:24:21) BlademasterBobo: the components thing
(01:24:34) BMcC: I pretend to code that way, but everything winds up referencing everything else :P
(01:24:37) BlademasterBobo: haha
(01:24:43) BMcC: It's been a minor bitch ripping stuff out of BQ
(01:24:48) BMcC: Getting better at it, though
(01:24:48) BlademasterBobo: Well, it's all components, and some reference other stuff
(01:24:51) BlademasterBobo: but not too badly
(01:25:01) BlademasterBobo: mostly though, I just want to be able to whip stuff up quickly
(01:25:09) lemmer: banana quest?
(01:25:14) BMcC: Yes
(01:25:27) BlademasterBobo: The downside is I'll probably have to rip it all apart to optimize if I release anything
(01:25:33) BlademasterBobo: since flash is pretty horrible in that regard
(01:26:11) buick: lemmer: haha man, you still remember banana quest ??
(01:26:28) lemmer: i tried playing it the other day

(01:36:05) xe: i'm sure it was a good pun though

(01:40:08) Dragonene: Oh, I don't actually *use* all that space
(01:40:17) Dragonene: the 1tb drive is for backups only
(01:40:22) Dragonene: I've used maybe 30gb on that one.

(02:16:59) BlademasterBobo: WHat's the difference?
(02:17:14) BMcC: Like, I can drop enough objects in to slow the "normal" game to like 1 frame per five seconds, and with the quadtree it runs fine

(02:18:37) BMcC: Could use it for culling as well, probably
(02:18:45) BMcC: It's so rad
(02:18:54) mewse: If you had scrolling screens, then yes you could.
(02:18:57) BMcC: Tested it on my 2nd oldest computer, too -- big difference
(02:19:02) BMcC: Word
(02:19:04) mewse: Not much point culling in single-screen levels.  :)
(02:19:13) BMcC: The BQ engine has scrolling, hehe
(02:19:28) mewse: And yet that screenshot does not.  :)
(02:19:29) BMcC: AND this is general enough to paste right into The New Engine (which was the point to begin with)

(02:29:14) SMRobot: g'bye buick
(02:29:17) SMRobot: :(
(02:29:19) SMRobot: :'(
(02:29:38) slv: so.... is he like a white bulgarian rupaul?
(02:29:42) slv: WHAT IS GOING ON IN BULGARIA?!?
(02:30:00) RinkuHero: a recession

(02:34:16) Super-Dot left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(02:37:21) Super-Dot [Super-Dot@adsl-76-231-47-165.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(02:38:51) Super-Dot: Woo
(02:39:02) Super-Dot: Minecraft runs on OS X
(02:39:21) Super-Dot: Unlike on Windows where it doesn't
(02:40:57) Dragonene: wat
(02:41:14) Super-Dot: I couldn't get it to run on Windows
(02:41:22) Super-Dot: I got a white screen
(02:44:36) Super-Dot: Man, Minecraft is cool
(02:44:44) RinkuHero: is minecraft that game where you click on stuff to create or destroy it
(02:44:46) RinkuHero: and it's 3d
(02:45:25) Zaratustra: minecraft is the infiniminer clone
(02:45:36) RinkuHero: what's infiniminer
(02:45:47) Super-Dot: Infiniminer is that game where you click on stuff to create or destroy it
(02:45:53) Super-Dot: and it's 3d
(02:45:58) RinkuHero: hm, sounds like minecraft
(02:46:07) RinkuHero: also
(02:46:12) RinkuHero: in LOVE you can do that too
(02:46:15) RinkuHero: i was just watching a video o fit
(02:46:20) RinkuHero: and it reminded me of minecraft
(02:47:17) cowmasterfawkes80|not: man I bet my dick would remind you of minecraft
(02:47:20) cowmasterfawkes80|not: you name whore
(02:47:23) cowmasterfawkes80|not is now known as paul|not
(02:47:39) BMcC: haha, what
(02:49:03) Super-Dot: Awesome
(02:49:11) Arf left the room (quit: Quit: And this time I mean it!).
(02:49:18) Super-Dot: If there's a flat wall, you can make a ladder as you climb it
(02:49:48) Super-Dot: Oh, you can also just look straight down and jump and build
(02:49:51) Super-Dot: I guess that's easier
(02:50:11) Dragonene: :)
(02:50:31) Super-Dot: Whoaaaaaa
(02:50:38) Super-Dot: I can see the whole world from up here
(02:50:41) Dragonene: :P
(02:51:13) paul|not: superdot infiniminer?
(02:51:20) Super-Dot: Minecraft
(02:51:22) paul|not: ah
(02:51:23) paul|not: whatev
(02:51:27) paul|not: apparently the same thing
(02:51:31) paul|not: seeing as you can do both of those
(02:51:33) paul|not: in IM
(02:51:39) Super-Dot: ah, cool
(02:51:55) Super-Dot: Does it take energies or monies or something to build in Infiniminer?
(02:52:39) paul|not: ore
(02:52:52) paul|not: X percentage of rocks are ore, comes in veins
(02:53:06) paul|not: digs out just the same and each block adds +20 ore up to a maximum that varies with your class
(02:53:43) Super-Dot: I like the weird hoppy dudes in Minecraft 
(02:54:17) Cow: I just had a pretty close match of L4D
(02:54:18) Cow: it was fun
(02:54:33) Dragonene: I hate you
(02:54:51) Cow: final score was like 400 - 330 or something
(02:54:54) Dragonene: I want to play L4D, TF2, Empire: Total War, Fallout 3, Mass Effect... but most importantly: DotA
(02:55:03) Dragonene: :D
(02:55:11) Cow: I'm playing the Empire: Total War demo right now
(02:55:14) Cow: at least, it's loading
(02:55:22) Dragonene: I have spent perhaps 2 or 3 hours on gaming since I came to australia
(02:55:25) Dragonene: excluding indie games.
(02:55:26) Cow: it seems to be trying to install itself
(02:55:32) Dragonene: 2 or 3 hours of commercial games, in other words
(02:55:44) Cow: I also have Warcraft III downloaded
(02:55:49) Dragonene: That's... not much for three and a half months
(02:55:50) Cow: so yeah
(02:56:01) Cow: indeed
(02:56:06) Dragonene: I tend to play like 2 or 3 hours *per day* in Sweden
(02:56:08) Dragonene: :)
(02:56:20) Dragonene: Probably more.
(02:56:38) Dragonene: I'm glad though
(02:56:52) Dragonene: I think it shows I don't have to play games :P
(02:57:24) Super-Dot: Woo, floating block in Minecraft isn't that hard
(02:57:29) Super-Dot: to make
(02:57:31) Dragonene: :P
(02:57:32) Dragonene: Anyway.
(02:57:37) Dragonene: I'm going to go buy something to eat
(02:57:42) Dragonene: it's 5pm and I haven't had anything to eat yet
(02:57:49) Dragonene: Once again, I *should* go to the supermarket
(02:57:51) Dragonene: but it's so far away
(02:57:57) Dragonene: so I'm just going to go to 7-11
(02:58:05) Dragonene: Be back in a short bit.
(02:59:17) Cow: BYE
(02:59:32) Cow: Empire Total War doesn't seem to want to get past the intro screen
(02:59:36) SixbitSaturn is now known as SevenbitSundance
(03:00:29) SMRobot: I played minecraft
(03:00:31) SMRobot: it's neat
(03:01:18) Super-Dot: Yay
(03:01:22) Super-Dot: I made a UFO
(03:01:28) Super-Dot: And then got in
(03:01:39) Super-Dot: And destroyed the staircase I used to get in
(03:01:53) SevenbitSundance: night dudes
(03:01:59) Super-Dot: Good night
(03:02:04) SevenbitSundance left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 2.0.0.20/2008121709]).
(03:02:39) Cow: night dudes
(03:03:04) Cow left the room (quit: Quit: Client Exited).
(03:04:56) BMcC left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:05:32) Super-Dot: I doubt this is intentional and it might be a bad thing, but if you stand at the veryvery edge of a block, you can build a block next to the one you're standing on
(03:05:38) Super-Dot: Even if you're way up in the air
(03:05:53) Super-Dot: So that'll be useful for aerial construction
(03:06:18) ArneLurk [chatzilla@h42n2fls34o984.telia.com] entered the room.
(03:06:43) BMcC [bmcc@c-69-251-8-171.hsd1.md.comcast.net] entered the room.
(03:06:47) BMcC: Yay internets
(03:06:59) #tigirc: mode (+o BMcC) by ChanServ
(03:07:48) Dragonene: wtf @ flashgamelicense
(03:08:01) Dragonene: I love how you're just sitting quietly in the chat
(03:08:09) Dragonene: and suddenly I get a popup-window with a PM saying
(03:08:10) Dragonene: "I like to develop new game MotorCycle Game can you be able to handle it"
(03:08:28) BMcC: I can be able to handle it
(03:08:28) Dragonene: I mean, these guys don't even have an idea of who I am
(03:09:35) jstickeur: hi
(03:09:37) Super-Dot: Aerial construction is the best subgame, seriously
(03:09:46) Super-Dot: You're making stuff
(03:09:59) Super-Dot: And there's the constant threat of falling to your great inconvenience
(03:10:05) Dragonene: That came out sounding a bit megalomaniacal
(03:10:14) BMcC: Haha
(03:10:21) BMcC: Respond "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM"
(03:10:23) Super-Dot: Not really
(03:10:28) Super-Dot: Haha
(03:10:28) Dragonene: What I meant was "they don't have any idea of who I am" as in "They don't even know if I can make games or not"
(03:10:44) BMcC: I gotcha
(03:10:46) slv: i have idea for motorcycle concept game, can you make with programming to execute?
(03:10:57) RinkuHero: (03:10:25) Rinku: a shop
(03:10:57) RinkuHero: (03:10:32) Rinku: shops always make games better
(03:10:57) RinkuHero: (03:10:48) Rinku: i think all games can be divided into games with shops (good games) and games without them (bad games)
(03:11:09) BMcC: Hahahaha
(03:12:12) BMcC: Brb, y'alllll
(03:12:25) EdgelordPyl: xenon 2 is a good game :)
(03:12:29) Super-Dot: Minecraft is like LEGO, but from the future
(03:12:33) Super-Dot: And also from the past
(03:12:51) EdgelordPyl: maybe the present as well
(03:13:26) Super-Dot: I doubt it
(03:13:57) Dragonene: what about
(03:14:23) ArneLurk: http://mameosx.sourceforge.net/
(03:14:24) Super-Dot: LEGO from the future, sent forward in time to the past
(03:14:26) ArneLurk: someone used this?
(03:14:44) Dragonene: "Yes, I can be able to handle that. I will pay $2000 for the idea and develop the game for you."
(03:14:52) Dragonene: "For free."
(03:15:57) lemmer: http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=joe+jonas+fan+fiction&aq=f
(03:17:04) RinkuHero: i thought that was super joe fanfiction
(03:18:36) Super-Dot: Aerial construction is so awesome
(03:18:44) Super-Dot: I built a UFO way high up in the air
(03:18:58) Super-Dot: And now I'm trying to figure out how to remove the scaffolding
(03:19:01) BMcC: back
(03:19:02) Super-Dot: But stay in the UFO
(03:19:12) lemmer: Joe: So, Renae, what's your favorite song?
(03:19:12) lemmer: Renae: Hello Beautiful! I love that song. & yours is, Only Hope?
(03:19:13) lemmer: Joe: I love that song!
(03:19:13) lemmer: Renae: I've done Joe Jonas research.
(03:19:39) BMcC: My Name Is (Joe) Jonas
(03:20:30) Super-Dot: I think a multiplayer, infinite-size Minecraft blank slate create mode would be just about the best thing ever
(03:20:47) Super-Dot: So it's just a flat infinite plane
(03:20:51) BMcC: Infiniminer
(03:20:52) Super-Dot: And you can build things
(03:21:09) Super-Dot: And there's no purpose
(03:21:12) paul|not: holy shit cough drops are delicious
(03:21:18) paul|not: there is cocaine and heroin in cough drops
(03:21:18) EdgelordPyl: and fun!
(03:21:22) BMcC: Paul is about to OD
(03:21:32) paul|not: seriously guys buy up like ten bags
(03:22:59) Super-Dot: Cough drops are basically hard candy except they cure a symptom
(03:23:07) Super-Dot: And don't have as much sugar
(03:23:38) paul|not: yep
(03:23:44) Super-Dot: Pretty swell
(03:23:44) paul|not: also they feel amazing on your throat
(03:23:55) paul|not: my throat is getting massaged by a thousand vaginas right now
(03:23:55) guyveroh [veroh@212.14.215.72] entered the room.
(03:24:40) Super-Dot: Okay, figured out how I'm going to remove the scaffolding
(03:24:41) mklee left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:24:48) Super-Dot: Man, I could build a sky city
(03:25:21) Drakkar: notch needs to pop by
(03:25:22) Drakkar: :(
(03:25:42) SMRobot left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(03:27:05) EdgelordPyl: whoaaa
(03:27:12) EdgelordPyl: my netbook does not like minecraft :)
(03:28:52) Super-Dot: It runs slowly if you're looking at a lot of blocks
(03:28:55) slv: can someone link me to minecraft? googling "minecraft" brings up more hits than i'd expect
(03:29:03) EdgelordPyl: http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/
(03:29:03) Super-Dot: Which is why I think a blank slate would be awesome
(03:29:07) slv: awesome thx
(03:29:07) Super-Dot: For create mode
(03:29:12) EdgelordPyl: this should be topiced or something
(03:29:45) EdgelordPyl: it ran great on my desktop, and that's not exactly new
(03:29:49) EdgelordPyl: single core athlon
(03:30:27) guyveroh left the room.
(03:30:52) Evil-Ville: I accidentally said no to the applet permission thing and now I can't run it
(03:31:14) Dragonene: no it shouldn't be topiced
(03:31:21) Dragonene: his blog says it's a private alpha
(03:31:30) Dragonene: and that people should ask him on tigirc or something if they want to try it
(03:31:46) Dragonene: It'd be best not to advertise it outside of this channel unless he agrees first.
(03:32:30) EdgelordPyl: and topicing it is advertising it inside this channel
(03:33:00) Dragonene: point taken, but it might lead to people talking more about it and eventually spreading it
(03:33:12) EdgelordPyl: we're already talking about it and spreading it aplenty
(03:33:13) EdgelordPyl: :o
(03:33:31) Dragonene: Yes, and given how he's not here, I'm not even sure that's appropriate
(03:33:32) Super-Dot: We're spreading it within tigirc, which is fine
(03:33:36) Evil-Ville: How do I get java to reset this permission stuff?
(03:33:39) Dragonene: All I'm saying is you should ask him :)
(03:33:41) Dragonene: Evil-Ville: No idea
(03:33:46) Dragonene: ...try another browser? :P
(03:33:48) Super-Dot: Refresh?
(03:34:02) Evil-Ville: I've refreshed and checked java control panel and nothing works
(03:34:19) Dragonene: windows?
(03:34:20) Dragonene: xp?
(03:34:30) RinkuHero: I SOLVED IT
(03:34:37) RinkuHero: cave story is a clash at demonhead clone
(03:34:39) Evil-Ville: Yes xp
(03:34:50) Super-Dot: Success!
(03:34:51) Dragonene: hm.
(03:34:59) Dragonene: Tried clearing browser cache?
(03:35:04) Super-Dot: I have created a floating spaceship
(03:35:14) Super-Dot: With no remaining scaffolding
(03:35:30) Evil-Ville: Yes that was one of the first things I did
(03:35:34) Super-Dot: Now to make a second adjacent one
(03:35:41) slv: huh i can't get it to work, i just get a white box... it did show java start in the window but it just sits there as a white box
(03:35:50) Super-Dot: So I can screenshot one from the other
(03:35:59) EdgelordPyl: slv: make sure you have java 1.5 or newer
(03:36:48) Drakkar: oh man
(03:36:52) Dragonene: there's also a java cache ville
(03:36:55) Dragonene: did you clear that?
(03:37:11) Drakkar: I need a fedora
(03:37:33) slv: where do i clear that
(03:37:44) Dragonene: I meant Evil-Ville actually
(03:37:48) Evil-Ville: I did now it doesn't work
(03:38:05) Dragonene: Evil-Ville: There's some certificate stuff in the java cpl as well
(03:38:10) Dragonene: I assumed you couldn't find it there?
(03:38:42) Dragonene: which browser do you use?
(03:38:45) Evil-Ville: Yes there's nothing there
(03:38:46) Evil-Ville: firefox
(03:38:52) Dragonene: opera has a certificate manager inside its options
(03:38:59) Dragonene: where you can see a list of rejected certificates
(03:39:03) Dragonene: I'm sure firefox has that too
(03:39:04) Dragonene: somewhere
(03:40:17) Evil-Ville: There isn't any related ones
(03:40:38) Super-Dot: Second UFO created
(03:40:45) Super-Dot: The second is much easier than the first
(03:40:53) Super-Dot: Now to remove the scaffolding
(03:41:00) Dragonene: Evil-Ville: advanced - encryption - show certificates
(03:41:03) Dragonene: is where it's at
(03:41:19) Dragonene: see if you can find mojang, notch or markus persson in the list of rejected certificates
(03:41:40) Evil-Ville: I couldn't
(03:41:55) Dragonene: Huh
(03:42:00) Dragonene: did you try starting it in another browser?
(03:42:22) Super-Dot: Scaffolding removed
(03:42:27) Evil-Ville: Yes it works with IE
(03:42:32) Super-Dot: Now to get back into one of them
(03:42:39) Dragonene: So it must be inside firefox somewhere :)
(03:42:49) Dragonene: try just restarting firefox?
(03:42:57) Zaratustra left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(03:43:12) Dragonene: anyway
(03:43:16) ***Dragonene goes back to studying
(03:43:58) Evil-Ville: Now it started working for no reason
(03:44:21) fartrone: the problems i've had have all been caching relateds
(03:44:22) fartrone: s
(03:44:30) fartrone: so if java didn't quit you'd keep getting the probs
(03:44:46) Evil-Ville: This runs amazingly well
(03:45:19) Super-Dot: Success!
(03:45:30) fartrone: take pictures
(03:46:06) Super-Dot: I'm doing so
(03:46:38) Evil-Ville: This game is going to be amazing
(03:46:47) Super-Dot: http://img177.imageshack.us/img177/3931/picture54.png
(03:47:32) Dragonene: haha
(03:47:32) Dragonene: awesome
(03:47:34) Super-Dot: Is it pretty clear what's going on in the picture?
(03:47:59) Dragonene: not entirely
(03:48:18) Dragonene: I mean I got it from your description
(03:49:29) Super-Dot: I should have made them like
(03:49:33) Super-Dot: one more block apart
(03:50:27) Evil-Ville: I already like this more than infiniminer
(03:50:43) Super-Dot: There we go
(03:51:23) Dragonene: I still haven't played infiniminer
(03:51:31) Super-Dot: http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/7329/picture57.png
(03:51:45) Dragonene: :D
(03:52:38) Evil-Ville: I just noticed it runs at more than 900 fps for me
(03:52:47) Dragonene: it's opengl
(03:52:50) Super-Dot: The black square right above "game requires" is the UFO's shadow
(03:52:55) Dragonene: ...in case anybody was wondering.
(03:52:57) Super-Dot: I get varied FPS
(03:53:12) Super-Dot: It goes way down when I look at some things
(03:54:44) fartrone: the cave systems are awesome
(03:56:14) Super-Dot: I've only been doing stuff on the surface :O
(03:56:37) Super-Dot: And waaay above the surface
(03:57:55) Super-Dot: Augh, fell down
(03:58:05) Super-Dot: While I was trying to make my UFO awesomer
(03:58:16) fartrone: you can get back up on a single tower
(03:58:21) fartrone: just jump and place
(03:59:46) Evil-Ville: I get 500 fps when I am on top of a max height tower
(04:00:04) Super-Dot: Yeah
(04:00:12) Super-Dot: The problem is that that leaves behind a tower
(04:00:36) Super-Dot: What I've been doing is jump, build, destroy the block below the one I'm standing on
(04:01:04) Super-Dot: Doesn't leave a trace when you're done
(04:01:16) fartrone: you can destroy it on your way back down
(04:02:07) Super-Dot: http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/1051/picture58.png
(04:04:37) paul|not: huh
(04:05:13) paul|not: infiniminer and whatever this is look quite similar
(04:05:14) paul|not: interesting
(04:05:26) Drakkar: that was the point
(04:05:38) fartrone: the plan is infiniminer + DF
(04:05:58) Super-Dot: http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4281/picture60.png
(04:05:59) Evil-Ville: http://ville.poronet.com/mobs.PNG
(04:07:14) Super-Dot: 67 FPS with that many dudes? :O
(04:08:18) mewse: Those dudes are all playing the same frame of model animation.  :)
(04:08:34) notch [xNotchX@h-77-240.A165.priv.bahnhof.se] entered the room.
(04:08:36) paul|not: is anyone else slightly stunned by how dumb japanese portrayals of black people can be
(04:08:45) paul|not: like 400% of them feature afros and bad accents
(04:09:02) notch: 400%? :-O
(04:09:23) Super-Dot: Notch!
(04:09:29) notch: Super-Dot!
(04:09:31) Super-Dot: We have all been enjoying your game very much
(04:09:38) Super-Dot: I made a UFO
(04:09:39) Super-Dot: http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4281/picture60.png
(04:09:43) notch: haha, awesome. =D
(04:09:49) Super-Dot: Sans scaffolding!
(04:09:51) notch: any feedback? =)
(04:09:58) Super-Dot: That screenshot is taken from an adjacent UFO
(04:10:08) notch: haha nice
(04:10:14) Super-Dot: It runs really slowly when I look at cliff walls
(04:10:22) Super-Dot: And when I get high above the map and look down
(04:10:39) notch: always, or after having played for a while?
(04:10:41) MrBusiness left the room (quit: Quit: quit it >:[).
(04:10:44) Super-Dot: Always
(04:11:15) notch: ok. It can produce quite a lot of triangles worst case, so not all graphics cards will be able to handle it gracefully
(04:11:35) notch: so I'm going to have to add more advanced culling, and an option to turn down rendering distance, I think
(04:12:02) notch: just going from seeing all 256x256x64 to "just" seeing the nearest 128x128x64 cuts the triangle count down to 1/4'th
(04:12:04) Super-Dot: In create mode, it might be good to have the option to disable map generation
(04:12:05) FinDude [chatzilla@a91-153-165-32.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(04:12:12) Super-Dot: So that you're building stuff on a blank slate
(04:12:18) notch: ah, true
(04:12:28) notch: and to be honest, I'm not very happy with the current map generator. ;)
(04:12:31) Super-Dot: Since in create mode, you're more likely to be looking at lots of things in the distance
(04:12:41) Evil-Ville: hey notch I took a screenshot too http://ville.poronet.com/mobs.PNG
(04:12:44) Dragonene: what no
(04:12:50) Dragonene: map generation is awesome
(04:12:53) notch: oh dear lord Evil-Ville
(04:12:57) notch: haha
(04:12:57) Dragonene: hi btw notch
(04:13:02) notch: hey Dragonene =)
(04:13:32) Super-Dot: Map generation is great and fun, but it's not as necessary in create mode
(04:13:40) FinDude: ville whats that
(04:13:44) Super-Dot: Actually
(04:13:50) Evil-Ville: Now I am experiencing a bug where I can't place any guys
(04:13:55) Evil-Ville: FinDude ask notch
(04:14:04) Super-Dot: It's probably conducive to creativity to start out with some stuff in the environment
(04:14:10) FinDude: notch whats that
(04:14:12) SimonTheDigger [beans@nc-71-55-85-117.dhcp.embarqhsd.net] entered the room.

(04:14:31) notch: http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/
(04:14:45) SimonTheDigger: Hello everyone
(04:14:46) Super-Dot: I reconsider my hypothesis and posit that a flat starting area in create mode would be boring
(04:14:50) Drakkar: notch
(04:14:53) Drakkar: we love you
(04:14:54) Super-Dot: Hello SimonTheDigger 
(04:14:58) Super-Dot: We've been digging
(04:15:02) notch: oh wow
(04:15:14) Drakkar: and there are bugs to be reported
(04:15:31) Super-Dot: I hope you'll join us, since you're an expert in the field
(04:15:51) Evil-Ville: I think flat map should be an option
(04:16:00) Super-Dot: option yeah
(04:16:17) notch: Drakkar: Bugs? Lay them on me =D
(04:16:20) Drakkar: yep
(04:16:21) Drakkar: working on it
(04:16:51) Evil-Ville: I've restarted a few times and still can't place any mobs
(04:17:53) Evil-Ville: I have no idea why because it obviously worked just fine earlier
(04:18:09) SimonTheDigger: It doesn't work for me at all
(04:18:12) SimonTheDigger: all I get is a white screen
(04:18:13) notch: odd, there's no maximum
(04:18:40) paul|not: ooh, sweet, liam neeson kills people is out on DVD
(04:18:54) notch: SimonTheDigger: If you open the java console (in the help menu in your browser in ff), is there something like "org.lwjgl.opengl.OpenGLException: Invalid value (1281)
(04:18:54) notch: " in there?
(04:18:55) paul|not: man I wonder when "out on blu-ray" will supplant "out on dvd"
(04:19:12) EdgelordPyl: if ever
(04:19:26) paul|not: more like
(04:19:28) paul|not: "on torrent"
(04:19:29) Super-Dot: Woo, added a bottom layer to the UFO
(04:19:34) Super-Dot: http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/2489/picture62.png
(04:19:55) paul|not left the room.
(04:19:56) SimonTheDigger: I probably just need to upgrade Java
(04:20:06) paul|not [grif392@adsl-71-142-215-43.dsl.scrm01.pacbell.net] entered the room.
(04:20:10) Dragonene: notch: has it been change since I last played it?
(04:20:23) notch: not since I went to bed some 10 hours ago. =)
(04:20:25) Dragonene: or will it still be ridiculously low-sens and crash by browser? :)
(04:20:29) Dragonene: Okay, fair enough
(04:20:30) paul|not: link it again?
(04:21:09) EdgelordPyl: i know the url by heart by now :p
(04:21:10) Dragonene: I take it paul|not likes Taken.
(04:21:12) Super-Dot: I got the white screen too, on Windows
(04:21:18) Super-Dot: Even with the latest version of Java
(04:21:31) EdgelordPyl: http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/
(04:21:35) Super-Dot: I can't check what was wrong, though, since I'm back in OS X
(04:21:54) paul|not: Dragonene: haven't even seen it
(04:21:55) notch: If you're on an Eee, that's probably why. I get the same thing on mine
(04:22:03) notch: I'm doing something with Opengl that I don't have to
(04:22:04) paul|not: raaagh
(04:22:07) paul|not: I just installed Java
(04:22:15) paul|not: and it's like missing MSC781.DLL or something
(04:22:21) SimonTheDigger: ...
(04:22:34) Dragonene: paul|not: Okay.
(04:22:37) SimonTheDigger: I have the latest version of Java, and I just gave NoScript the okay for your site
(04:22:45) Dragonene: It's a good movie. Not quite as fantastic as some people say
(04:22:47) Dragonene: But it's good.
(04:22:50) EdgelordPyl: it works on my eee, but ridiculously slow when i see a lot of squares or when i'm close to the edge of the map
(04:22:54) SimonTheDigger: but it still doesn't work (and I don't have any "Java console" option in my browser, by the way)
(04:23:11) notch: what graphics card do you have?
(04:23:21) Evil-Ville: You have java console option in java
(04:23:27) EdgelordPyl: pretty good when i tunnel around, though
(04:24:01) SimonTheDigger: It may be that I have a crap graphics card.
(04:24:29) paul|not: so
(04:24:32) paul|not: at least for me
(04:24:34) paul|not: doesn't work in opera
(04:25:04) notch: hey, I've got opera installed already!
(04:25:06) ***notch tries
(04:25:06) paul|not: and then
(04:25:09) paul|not: in IE
(04:25:15) Evil-Ville: notch are you going to release a non-applet version
(04:25:18) slv left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(04:25:19) paul|not: some other error about failing to start error with pixelcraft
(04:25:21) notch: yes, Evil-Ville.
(04:25:39) notch: pixelcraft?
(04:26:16) paul|not: org.lwjgl.LWJGLException: Pixel format not accelerated
(04:26:18) paul|not: read it wrong
(04:26:57) notch: Do you have hardware accelerating graphics cards?
(04:27:10) notch: or just one will do, I guess. ;)
(04:27:11) paul|not: I have absolutely shitty intel integrated
(04:27:26) notch: hmm, should still accelerate, one would think
(04:27:49) SMRobot [littleripp@CPE-58-164-64-145.nsw.bigpond.net.au] entered the room.
(04:27:52) paul|not: no clue
(04:27:54) SMRobot: hey all!
(04:28:02) SMRobot: XNA is so cool

(04:28:21) slv [potatofarm@pool-96-237-13-134.bstnma.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(04:28:23) Dragonene: intel integrated usually works for LWJGL
(04:28:28) Dragonene: but they don't normally work with shaders
(04:28:35) Dragonene: They *can*, but you can't count on it
(04:28:40) paul|not: 1.7 ghz 1gb RAM totally crap toshiba satellite
(04:28:42) paul|not: no idea
(04:28:45) FinDude: om
(04:28:47) FinDude: g
(04:28:50) Dragonene: shaders are very dodgy on intel gama
(04:28:51) Dragonene: gma
(04:28:51) FinDude: @minecraft
(04:28:59) paul|not: what the hell are you doing in here findude
(04:29:09) paul|not: when the hell did you even get here
(04:29:11) paul|not: so confused
(04:29:16) FinDude: Im lurking here always
(04:29:19) FinDude: autojoin
(04:29:21) notch: it works for me on opera. Aw. :-\
(04:29:26) Dragonene: notch: try closing it
(04:29:31) Dragonene: for me it worked fine in opera
(04:29:34) paul|not: notch: I remember having this error with java before
(04:29:34) Dragonene: and crashed when I closed the tab
(04:29:37) notch: hahaaaa, wow
(04:29:40) paul|not: even when reformatting
(04:29:42) paul|not: so
(04:29:47) FinDude: but mostly its just tech & code talk so I just shut up
(04:29:48) paul|not: I think my computer just hates java or summat
(04:29:50) notch: that made it crash, yes, haha
(04:30:07) paul|not: gotta love computers eh
(04:30:33) SMRobot: hey notch
(04:30:40) notch: hey hey
(04:30:40) SMRobot: I played minecraft
(04:30:46) Dragonene: notch: :D
(04:30:46) SMRobot: It's pretty cool :)
(04:30:53) SMRobot: jumping felt off though
(04:30:58) notch: off how?
(04:31:00) Dragonene: ask kappa about that
(04:31:01) Drule_ left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:31:06) SMRobot: Not sure
(04:31:12) SMRobot: sorry to be unhelpful
(04:31:25) SMRobot: Did you read the new stuff on my blog?
(04:31:35) notch: No, but I shall now!
(04:32:08) Drule_ [Drule@c-4f66e8ed-74736162.cust.telenor.se] entered the room.
(04:33:03) notch: sounds like fun, SMRobot. =D
(04:33:20) SMRobot: ya =D
(04:33:26) SMRobot: tho I'm using XNA now
(04:33:39) SMRobot: I just started with it this afternoon and I love it
(04:33:48) notch: what's wrong with XNA?
(04:34:01) Dragonene left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(04:34:11) paul|not: notch is minecraft on tigforum anywhere
(04:34:30) notch: not yet, paul|not. I want to make it slightly more compatible.
(04:34:35) paul|not: k
(04:34:45) notch: getting a million crash bugs is both hard on the soul, and bad for the game's reputation. ;)
(04:34:58) SMRobot: notch, also can you use the scroll whell to select block type as well as numbers
(04:35:08) notch: ooh, yes, sure
(04:35:16) SMRobot: would be much nicer
(04:35:19) notch: and click mouse wheel to copy the hovered tile type?
(04:35:52) SMRobot: yes!
(04:36:14) Super-Dot: I love it when I'm burrowing through the ground and suddenly I see grass
(04:36:25) Super-Dot: And I dig up and behold, it's the surface
(04:37:37) notch: I love when you suddenly get daylight :D
(04:38:05) notch: what about being able to hold shift to build on the opposite side of a block?
(04:38:11) SMRobot: yay
(04:38:14) SMRobot: awesome
(04:38:17) paul|not: Big 0 is like batman with giant robots
(04:38:19) FinDude: minecraft seemed
(04:38:21) FinDude: good
(04:38:24) paul|not: batman the animated series back when it was awesome
(04:38:29) SMRobot: though I'd reserve it for build mode
(04:38:29) FinDude: mining is always nice stuff
(04:38:42) FinDude: collapsing, explosives and guns next plox
(04:38:46) FinDude: :d
(04:39:11) notch: I want collapsing. My girlfriend likes floating stuff
(04:39:18) paul|not: hmm
(04:39:20) paul|not: maybe a threshold?
(04:39:25) paul|not: like DF
(04:39:29) notch: collapsing means I have to add a flood fill in 3d, so I might just let her win. ;)
(04:39:45) Evil-Ville: I want collapsing too
(04:39:54) FinDude: you could make everything over 0 altittude (if thats ground level) atleast collapse always
(04:40:57) FinDude: also "mining" distance seemed a bit long
(04:41:25) Super-Dot: Huh
(04:41:45) Super-Dot: I was going through tunnels and I happened upon a cave whose floors were completely flat
(04:41:55) Super-Dot: I was confused for a while, but then I dug
(04:41:56) krabbo [terithom@d75-155-120-107.bchsia.telus.net] entered the room.
(04:41:57) notch: bottom of the map. Mine one step down. ;D

(04:42:02) Drakkar: XD
(04:42:05) Drakkar: oh god
(04:42:05) Super-Dot: The sky is below me!
(04:42:07) Super-Dot: crazy
(04:42:09) paul|not: so I am assuming procedural gen, notch? haven't played it yet
(04:42:25) FinDude: the size of the world is a bit crazy
(04:42:43) notch: FinDude: all tiles intersecting a 3 meter radius box around the player are interactable. So yeah, he's got huge arms =D
(04:42:51) notch: i need a female model!
(04:42:56) FinDude: lol
(04:42:58) FinDude: boobies!
(04:43:00) paul|not: add spheres to model
(04:43:01) paul|not: done
(04:43:05) notch: then again, it could just be a skin since it's so blocky anyway
(04:43:25) FinDude: so whats this gonna be
(04:43:33) FinDude: lameass sandbox or what
(04:44:22) Evil-Ville: http://notch.tumblr.com/
(04:44:32) notch: I posted some game modes on there. =)
(04:44:45) notch: survival will hopefully be a mix between infiniminer and DF lite
(04:45:28) FinDude: yeah
(04:45:40) FinDude: collapsing would dfeinetly add in lotsof more gameplay
(04:46:08) FinDude: last rocket on your rocket launcher might be more useful in the ceiling of the cave than single opponents face
(04:46:17) FinDude: :d
(04:46:25) FinDude: it IS going to have rocketlaunchers, rite?
(04:46:37) notch: no. =D
(04:47:19) FinDude: lolsucks
(04:47:22) FinDude:  /disconnect

(04:52:15) lemmer: D:
(04:52:36) Super-Dot: Fun times:
(04:52:57) Super-Dot: Dig to the bottom of the map, create a 4*4 open area
(04:53:02) Super-Dot: Spawn a bunch of mobs
(04:53:22) Super-Dot: Poke a hole in the bottom of the floor, and watch them jump through it to their doom
(04:53:54) Super-Dot: http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6863/picture63.png
(04:53:59) Super-Dot: Like that, but with a bigger hole
(04:54:14) Drakkar: its fantastic isn't it?
(04:54:17) Drakkar: they look so happy
(04:55:18) notch: lol
(04:56:32) notch: I can't draw logos!
(04:57:05) Super-Dot: Minecraft logo?
(04:57:10) notch: yar
(04:57:19) Evil-Ville: notch why are you doing everything alone I want to help somehow
(04:57:29) notch: because it's fun!
(04:59:42) Super-Dot: What do you have so far on the logo?
(04:59:51) notch: a very blocky outline
(05:00:05) notch: I can't even think of what style I want
(05:00:25) EdgelordPyl: build the logo all 3d-y, like the logo from the latest fez-trailer
(05:00:54) Super-Dot: Maybe a blocky but incomplete logo
(05:01:01) FinDude: hey
(05:01:06) Super-Dot: Like with some blocks missing
(05:01:08) FinDude: how large is that world

(05:01:44) EdgelordPyl: just
(05:01:47) EdgelordPyl: make the logo ingame

(05:02:25) FinDude: so how does your java app handle 4194304 blocks?
(05:02:30) FinDude: :d
(05:02:53) notch: one byte per block for a total of 4 mb ram for the map data, then I let the graphics card hold all the vertex data
(05:02:58) notch: (display lists)
(05:03:06) notch: worst case, it's three quads per block on average
(05:03:28) notch: and 8 bytes of data per vertex, for a total of 8*4*3*FOUR MILLION

(05:48:51) Siiseli: Evil-Ville, becouse I can develop on it
(05:48:54) Evil-Ville: Just get an ipod touch instead
(05:49:46) Siiseli: but I get the iphone from the work :<
(05:49:53) Siiseli: I don't pay shit for it
(05:50:14) Evil-Ville: oh
(05:50:34) Siiseli: since the job will provide me with a phone and a laptop of some kind
(05:50:40) Siiseli: soI quess macbook and iphone
(05:50:50) Siiseli: they said I could get an iphone as the phone if I'd like
(05:51:23) Evil-Ville: That's alright I guess but if you were the one paying for it yourself then getting an iphone would be stupid
(05:51:48) Siiseli: oh yes it's expensive as fuck
(05:51:58) Siiseli: but I still might get it afterwards. Propably imported, will be cheaper
(05:52:13) Evil-Ville: You'll still have to pay a bullshit contract
(05:53:32) ArneLurk: I wonder if mass effect 2 will have a man on man encounter
(05:53:37) ArneLurk: it would be hilarious
(05:53:54) ArneLurk: like some characters starts coming on to you

(06:01:02) Siiseli: cos' I really jsut want to dev on it
(06:01:20) Siiseli: is ipod touch different in some other ways than it not having phone capabilities
(06:01:41) Evil-Ville: All the same applications work
(06:01:58) Siiseli: but any other major differenes?
(06:02:01) Siiseli: differences*
(06:02:06) Evil-Ville: No I don't think so
(06:02:23) Evil-Ville: My little brother said that newer models of ipod touch are more powerful than iphone but who knows

(06:09:20) C418: interesting
(06:10:01) C418: embedded high quality videos
(06:10:02) C418: nice
(06:10:56) jsticker: Can't find a restricted vid :(
(06:12:01) C418: this weekend was really successful
(06:12:04) C418: musicwise
(06:12:06) Higgins: http://www.yooouuutuuube.com/v/?rows=16&cols=16&id=DnwtsavHlVA&startZoom=1
(06:12:07) C418: 15 minutes :o
(06:12:33) Higgins: have you guys seen ze site?
(06:13:51) C418: this looks exactly like something kraftwerk woud do live
(06:14:13) C418: not the video itself
(06:14:20) C418: that they obviously use
(06:14:22) Higgins: the griditizing?
(06:14:36) C418: yeah
(06:14:45) Higgins: yea
(06:14:46) C418: well, they usually have a very big widescreen behind them
(06:15:05) Higgins: the end of the video done like this is a bit of a dome blower
(06:16:24) FinDude left the room (quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.84 [Firefox 3.0.10/2009042316]).
(06:16:41) Higgins: you can of course put any youtube video in there..

(06:17:50) C418: looks more incredible on smaller videos
(06:18:01) jsticker: The restrictions trick doesn't work, ArneLurk
(06:18:08) jsticker: Also, Youtube now filters search results too
(06:18:21) C418: http://www.yooouuutuuube.com/v/?rows=36&cols=36&id=wBwUJMZNOgQ&startZoom=1

(06:19:44) C418: http://www.yooouuutuuube.com/v/?rows=512&cols=512&id=OvYZMqQffQE&startZoom=1 hmm
(06:19:48) C418: almost like pixels
(06:19:58) C418: it takes a while to fill the screen
(06:20:04) C418: a long while
(06:22:36) C418: 16 is standard...
(06:22:41) Higgins: hehe yeah it's alot of fun
(06:22:50) Higgins: you can zoom out too
(06:22:57) Higgins: and basically plot the frames out and pan around
(06:24:57) jsticker: Yooouuutuuube could be improved if you could take the audio from one yt clip and the video from another
(06:25:30) Higgins: also in my head I always hear the audio through delay, because of all the repeating frames
(06:25:40) BlademasterBobo: your face could be improved if you could take the audio from one face and the video from another
(06:25:42) Dragonene [none@202.171.170.5] entered the room.
(06:25:46) BlademasterBobo: Hello Dragonene
(06:25:50) Higgins: would be nice if there was a delay on/off
(06:25:51) Dragonene: hey
(06:25:56) Dragonene: my internet is unstable apparently
(06:25:57) jsticker: My face would be cool with sound
(06:25:59) Dragonene: got disconnected twice today
(06:26:14) Higgins: I kind of prefer your face to be silent.
(06:26:21) Higgins: :|
(06:26:23) BlademasterBobo: ugh, this thing keeps jumping up and down even when I turn gravity to 0
(06:26:27) BlademasterBobo: what is up with this shit
(06:26:28) BlademasterBobo: :l
(06:26:39) jsticker: What is UP WITH THIS SHIT
(06:27:10) BlademasterBobo: ah
(06:27:12) BlademasterBobo: figgered it out
(06:27:21) BlademasterBobo: stupid clone method having the arguments out of wack
(06:28:56) BlademasterBobo: also, this collision form almost has pixel perfect built in for certain shapes
(06:28:59) BlademasterBobo: which is neat
(06:29:39) C418: collision?
(06:29:43) C418: collision is an awesome softsynth
(06:29:45) C418: very awesome!
(06:30:22) lemmer: Game Maker

(06:36:05) Thi3f left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(06:36:48) C418: obviously
(06:36:58) Evil-Ville: Now I released them
(06:37:11) Evil-Ville: They're jumping off the map
(06:37:23) C418: I can't wait for the multiplayer mode
(06:37:35) C418: it's such a nice little... playground
(06:38:50) Drakkar: yeaaaaah
(06:38:50) Evil-Ville: I can't wait for more stuff to do
(06:39:30) C418: okay
(06:39:32) C418: first step
(06:39:34) C418: "Request to have your music added to the iTunes Store"
(06:44:37) C418: fun fun fun
(06:44:54) jw: minecraft?
(06:44:58) C418: too
(06:50:01) Dragonene: C418....
(06:50:03) Dragonene: I need your music!
(06:50:13) C418: but it is insane!
(06:50:23) Dragonene: Yes well
(06:50:29) notch: music? =D
(06:50:29) Dragonene: I hear people want music in games
(06:50:30) ***notch wants
(06:50:31) Dragonene: So uh
(06:50:49) Dragonene: Have a look at http://www.x2d.org/java/4k/pixeloids4k.html and see if you can think of anything that'd fit that type of game.
(06:50:52) Drakkar: welp
(06:51:00) Dragonene: If you can, and want to make some, I'd love you forever
(06:51:01) Drakkar: it looks like tatsunoko vs capcom might be coming to the US
(06:51:04) C418: ambient of course
(06:51:09) Drakkar: who wants to buy a kidney
(06:51:19) Dragonene: Well see
(06:51:21) Dragonene: you already know this
(06:51:24) notch: i have five!
(06:51:26) Dragonene: But I think some of your music is great
(06:51:30) notch: i kinda collected them for a while
(06:51:31) Dragonene: and I think it might fit that game
(06:51:38) Dragonene: Some of your other music is a bit too weird for me
(06:51:40) notch: C418: I want to hear your music! =D
(06:51:48) C418: c418.bandcamp.com
(06:51:56) C418: :D
(06:52:04) Dragonene: he makes awesome music.
(06:52:15) C418: you'll change your mind after my next album
(06:52:31) Dragonene: Says you
(06:52:44) Dragonene: Now uh... I really have no idea how these things work
(06:53:02) C418: I just think of something and you say shit or not shit
(06:53:40) Dragonene: What I want to do is make a flash version of pixeloids that I'll try to put out for grabs for portals. Which means I *might* make money from it if I can improve it enough compared to the original version. Which means I should probably pay you something, but I don't know how much these things are expected to cost.
(06:53:57) Dragonene: ...If you'd be willing to make something, that is.
(06:54:15) C418: well, if you pay me, I'd see it as allowance
(06:54:15) C418: :D
(06:54:26) C418: because I insist of working free
(06:54:45) Dragonene: Well see, that'd be awesome, but I guess I don't expect people to work for free.
(06:54:56) Dragonene: I also don't know if it'll even be possible to sell the game
(06:55:01) Dragonene: or how much licensing music normally costs.
(06:55:12) jw: minecraft is so addicting
(06:55:19) notch: C418: I haven't listened to much yet, but I like. Minimalistic ambient =D
(06:55:27) Dragonene: Frankly, I don't understand how everybody can think it's addicting.
(06:55:29) notch: oh, wait, it's getting more complex here
(06:55:31) Dragonene: I mean, it's lovely right now
(06:55:34) Dragonene: It's a really cool game.
(06:55:42) Dragonene: But there's not enough gameplay for it to be addicting
(06:55:50) jw: notch you made it right? D:
(06:55:54) Dragonene: I'm sure it *will* be eventually, knowing notch
(06:55:57) jw: <3
(06:55:57) Dragonene: He's good at these things
(06:55:59) C418: oh yes
(06:56:00) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/bridge.jpg
(06:56:04) C418: notch, I had this idea yesterday
(06:56:05) jw: doing shit like this is just fun
(06:56:09) notch: jw: yes =D
(06:56:13) Dragonene: sweet bridge jw
(06:56:15) C418: recording some of your minecraft stuff and making a music video out of that
(06:56:22) C418: just because... yeah, because!
(06:56:28) notch: haha, nice. Bridgemaking is kind of frustrating at the moment, I keep falling off. =D
(06:56:35) jw: yeah same
(06:56:38) jw: I fell like 6 times
(06:56:44) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/castle.png
(06:56:47) jw: made this yesterday
(06:56:48) Dragonene: See C418, when I hear Zweiton, I have a general feeling that could've been in my game.
(06:56:55) Dragonene: It's such a lovely tune.
(06:57:03) notch: i was building a spiral tower for a castle thing last night, and when I wanted it to get bigger on the top floor, I fell like ten times
(06:57:11) notch: nice jw =D
(06:57:12) jw: haha
(06:57:21) Dragonene: Awesome castle :D
(06:57:23) jw: you know what'd be nice
(06:57:27) jw: to be able to place like
(06:57:29) jw: 2x2x2 blocks
(06:57:31) jw: ands tuff
(06:57:32) jw: or bigger
(06:57:37) jw: and delete those
(06:57:49) C418: hm. I would more take the aphex twin approach
(06:57:50) jw: would make life a lot easier
(06:57:51) lansing: the editor in sauerbraten has a good interface for manipulating blocks
(06:57:53) C418: wait a sec... youtube search
(06:58:02) notch: C418: I think you should go more autechre. =)
(06:58:11) Dragonene: C418: Well, what do I know? You're the musician!
(06:58:20) notch: a lot of this sounds more early autechre than afx
(06:58:29) C418: http://c418.org/old.mp3
(06:58:33) C418: did you say something, notch?
(06:58:41) notch: yes? haha
(06:58:51) notch: you make great music
(06:59:05) Dragonene: See
(06:59:09) C418: thanks, I appreciate that
(06:59:11) Dragonene: I don't even like electronic music
(06:59:15) Dragonene: And I like C418's music
(06:59:24) Dragonene: And I'm not even being nice here
(06:59:32) Dragonene: uh
(06:59:34) notch: technicallly, you are. ;)
(06:59:37) Dragonene: I'm not just being nice.
(06:59:39) Dragonene: Is what I meant
(06:59:42) Dragonene: to say :)
(06:59:57) Dragonene: I really do like it.
(07:00:36) C418: ah
(07:00:38) C418: found it
(07:00:38) C418: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCPdPiaQljI&fmt=18
(07:00:42) C418: this would fit more I'd say
(07:00:51) Dragonene: Well, C418, you're the only person I know who makes ambient kind of music. And given pixeloid's abstract graphical style I think your stuff would fit.
(07:00:51) C418: I can't copy this very lovely track, but it would fit
(07:00:55) notch: is it possible to buy physical cds of this, C418?
(07:01:01) C418: sorry
(07:01:07) C418: you just can download the flacs from bandcamp
(07:01:15) C418: which makes me happy anyway
(07:01:17) C418: :D
(07:01:23) notch: hehe, fair enough. =)
(07:01:37) C418: I'm not the person to deal with taxes
(07:01:59) C418: although I know some people don't even think about taxes when selling things...
(07:02:08) Dragonene: C418: Well, yes, that sort of not-so-noisy-and-rather-melodic ambient is what I was thinking also. :)
(07:02:55) Dragonene: notch: hop onto #lwjgl and ask kappa about the applet
(07:02:59) Dragonene: I want you to make it work in opera! :)
(07:03:13) jw: hey notch
(07:03:18) jw: is there max height in minecraft? D:
(07:03:30) notch: yes, total height of the map is 64 tiles
(07:03:45) notch: the start grass is somewhere between 16 and 32 tiles from the top
(07:03:49) notch: (it varies)
(07:03:59) C418: (because it's procedual, duh)
(07:04:06) notch: I'm going to add some clouds or something at the top so you can see how high up it gues
(07:04:07) nyarla: old.mp3 is ace
(07:04:33) Dragonene: C418: that old mp3 starts out goot but gets too crazy after a bit I think.
(07:04:35) Stargoat: yo
(07:04:36) notch: I got a sudden urge to get C418's respect now. I'm trying to supress it, hehe
(07:04:51) Stargoat: dragonene, nyarla, let's hit a bar or something some time for some reason
(07:04:53) nyarla: i like crunchy glitchyish beats
(07:05:02) Dragonene: Sounds good
(07:05:05) Dragonene: In the future
(07:05:10) Stargoat: NO IN HTE PAST
(07:05:11) Dragonene: When I have less pressing engagement
(07:05:14) Dragonene: It should be rather soon
(07:05:15) Stargoat: the future is for gimps
(07:05:17) Dragonene: engagements*
(07:05:22) C418: getting my respect is easy, just let me work for you. I'm just not a really good working person I think
(07:05:32) C418: I tend to... be slow if I have problems going into the project
(07:05:42) Stargoat: lots of exam stuff or something, dragonene?
(07:05:53) C418: I think dragonene's thing won't be a real problem tho
(07:06:21) notch: i have this totally retarded goal of making games totally on my own for a while now. =)
(07:06:35) notch: I'm going to start looking into doing collaborations once I've managed to crank out a game or two
(07:06:37) C418: hello dock!
(07:06:43) Stargoat: C418, you been making music lately?
(07:06:52) C418: this weekend I did, yes
(07:07:01) notch: wait, Stargoat is dock?
(07:07:01) C418: it was quite successful for a weekend
(07:07:03) Stargoat: hit us up with that shit, yo
(07:07:04) Dragonene: Stargoat: Not exam
(07:07:09) ***Stargoat is Stargoat
(07:07:12) notch: phew
(07:07:12) Dragonene: I have one thing to turn in tomorrow
(07:07:15) Dragonene: it's my biggest project
(07:07:19) Stargoat: ah right
(07:07:24) Dragonene: then I have a few minor projects to finish
(07:07:28) Stargoat: what's it on?
(07:07:31) Dragonene: compression
(07:07:39) Dragonene: and then the exam studies and essay writing begins
(07:07:46) Dragonene: but that should be fairly manageable I hope
(07:07:51) Dragonene: so less pressure then
(07:07:53) JohannesG [Esi@adsl-h-56-111.heimsnet.is] entered the room.
(07:08:09) C418: if you want something fast, I can give  you a nice little track from my album that only two people know of
(07:08:17) C418: but I think you don't need it that fast
(07:08:51) Dragonene: C418: No, I've not gotten further than getting it to run in flash
(07:09:06) Dragonene: I've got a working port running which means I could take it to the same stage as the Java game in a day probably
(07:09:14) JohannesG: good morning
(07:09:16) Dragonene: but I want to expand on that, and I don't have all that much time to work on it right now
(07:09:20) notch: haha, zweitonegoismus =D
(07:09:21) Dragonene: so it'll be a while still before I finish this thing
(07:09:24) notch: awesome
(07:10:01) Dragonene: does "einfallslos" mean "infallsl?s"?
(07:10:05) Dragonene: because it sure sounds like it.
(07:10:11) C418: what does infallslös mean?
(07:10:15) Dragonene: Well
(07:10:17) Dragonene: It's not really a word.
(07:10:22) JohannesG: 1935 Twitter? http://3.media.tumblr.com/HSxsT6krCnk4uh6y6Ya4Lu5To1_500.jpg 
(07:10:26) Dragonene: But "infall" is sort of a spontaneous idea
(07:10:37) jw: man notch
(07:10:40) Dragonene: "l?s" means "loose" or "there being a lack of"
(07:10:43) FinDude [chatzilla@a91-153-165-32.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(07:10:44) jw: minecraft is really really cool
(07:10:55) C418: well, there being a lack of comes near to einfallslos
(07:10:56) Dragonene: so "infallsl?s" would sort of mean "not knowing how to tackle the issue"
(07:11:01) jw: sometimes the environment just asks for bridges and all that stuff
(07:11:04) Dragonene: or "not knowing a good approach"
(07:11:06) Dragonene: or something like that.
(07:11:07) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/minecraft.jpg
(07:11:11) C418: near the meaning
(07:11:21) C418: holy lol
(07:11:24) notch: wow jw
(07:11:28) Dragonene: haha jw
(07:11:30) Stargoat: hmm

(07:11:50) FinDude: hey
(07:11:54) JohannesG: oh?
(07:11:58) JohannesG: thank you :)
(07:12:00) FinDude: how about placing blocks on sides of others in minecraft
(07:12:43) jw: infinite range would be nice
(07:12:48) jw: it'd make bridge making super easy
(07:12:53) jw: and zooming option :P
(07:12:57) jw: with scroll
(07:13:02) Dragonene: and you could rename the game
(07:13:03) Dragonene: to...
(07:13:07) Dragonene: SNIPERBLOX
(07:13:10) Dragonene: \o/
(07:13:12) Dragonene: (not.)
(07:13:17) notch: there's supposed to be gameplay around the block editing, so I'm going to avoid spooky action at a distance. :D
(07:13:40) Dragonene: C418: There's no rush, I really onl
(07:13:57) Dragonene: really only need one tune, and I think your music would be a good fit for the game. All I ask is that you consider it! :D
(07:13:57) jw: make it a shooter
(07:13:59) jw: : P
(07:14:02) jw: where you build forts
(07:14:03) jw: and keep people away
(07:14:10) jw: ctf or something
(07:14:11) C418: there is no consideration
(07:14:16) jw: people could dig tunnels
(07:14:18) C418: I of course help you
(07:14:18) jw: into your fortress
(07:14:23) jw: so you have to build caves under it
(07:14:24) jw: with turrets
(07:14:25) notch: fortress mode is planned. =D
(07:14:35) notch: but I'm not so sure about making it a shooter. We'll see.
(07:14:45) jw: and you could take them out from a distance
(07:14:48) C418: shooter? I wouldn't like it as shooter
(07:14:49) jw: so they dont destroy your walls
(07:14:53) C418: I think more of a garrys mod
(07:14:55) jw: tf2 meets minecraft : P
(07:15:06) FinDude: rocket motherfucking launchers
(07:15:08) FinDude: now
(07:15:18) C418: having a multiplayer in the current version would be incredible enough
(07:15:20) notch: I'm a fantasy type of guy
(07:15:28) FinDude: lol
(07:15:31) notch: so you're more likely to get unicorns than rocketlaunchers. ;)
(07:15:36) FinDude: loolllll
(07:15:38) FinDude: loooool
(07:15:40) FinDude: baw
(07:15:56) nyarla: unicorns! <3

(07:16:12) jw: imagine a huge floating island
(07:16:13) notch: and ever since someone mentioned elevators, I've been unable to get them out of my mind
(07:16:14) jw: haha
(07:16:16) notch: and mine carts..
(07:16:17) jw: with your flag or whatever on it
(07:16:25) jw: and people are trying to build towers towards it
(07:16:30) jw: and you shoot arrows at them :P
(07:16:54) FinDude: also fuck sandbox :d
(07:16:55) notch: there will be some form of weaponry in the competetive modes
(07:17:10) jw: brb
(07:17:16) notch: arrows with proper physics would be massively fun
(07:17:19) Dragonene: C418: \o/ \o/ \o/
(07:18:05) nyarla: man, so many hoops you have to jump through to run code on an iphone >:I  especially if you are just a team member and not an admin of a team. send license request thing..wait for it to be accepted.. send device ID..wait for them to add it.. who knows what else.
(07:18:19) nyarla: i just want to see my bouncy purple squares bouncing on hardware! :)
(07:18:19) JohannesG: O_o
(07:18:28) Dragonene: JohannesG: How's white game coming?

(07:18:47) JohannesG: finished a prototype in time for the art exhibition that was couple of weeks ago
(07:19:18) Dragonene: Cool
(07:19:41) Dragonene: C418: PM'd
(07:19:42) JohannesG: it has sort of just been collecting dust on my HD since then because i was just too exhausted. so i took a short break, and plus i couldn't work on it during the finals
(07:20:22) JohannesG: planning to fix the windows/linux version (right now only the mac version works) and do a little bug fixes and throw out a semi-closed beta
(07:20:58) Dragonene: I can understand that.
(07:21:18) Dragonene: I've avoided finishing a game fast once or twice...
(07:21:19) Dragonene: :P
(07:21:23) JohannesG: hehe
(07:21:40) Dragonene: And then there's the ones that never get finished, but are still out there.
(07:21:50) notch: hm.. the particles are causing the crash on my Eee
(07:22:02) JohannesG: the night before the art exhibition I managed to "finish" the game. at like 2 AM i had packaged everything nicely and everything was ready.
(07:22:07) Dragonene: http://multitris.swapgeek.com first version released spring last year, last version in november last year, and I still want to add a lot of stuff to it...
(07:22:21) JohannesG: then i thought "hmmm.. maybe I should do one more beta test run" ran through the game and to my horror it was buggy as hell.
(07:22:36) JohannesG: at 7 AM i finally finished squashing the worst bugs.
(07:22:39) Dragonene: JohannesG: Ah :S
(07:22:40) Dragonene: haha
(07:22:43) Dragonene: Sounds... painful
(07:22:44) Dragonene: :)
(07:22:59) JohannesG: went to bed, woke up at noon, and went to the art exhibition :P
(07:23:02) Fraeon [kzer-za@e212-246-65-153.elisa-laajakaista.fi] entered the room.
(07:23:24) JohannesG: yeah, games are like paintings, the hardest part is to let go.
(07:23:28) JohannesG: a painting is never finished
(07:23:34) Dragonene: Hah
(07:23:34) JohannesG: it's just abandoned
(07:23:47) Dragonene: It depends on how skilled an artist you are and how much patience you have!
(07:23:51) Dragonene: :)
(07:24:04) JohannesG: nah, it just depends on how stubborn you are :P
(07:24:18) Dragonene: same difference :)
(07:24:20) JohannesG: hehe
(07:25:32) JohannesG: it took my friend 8 years to finish his game. and extra 4 or 5 years in "fixing it". and he's still working on it :P

(07:27:29) jw: also
(07:27:40) Dragonene: notch: make the mobs build houses!
(07:27:42) jw: you could make blocks that can be deleted from a distance
(07:27:43) Dragonene: ... :P
(07:27:47) jw: or activated/deactivated
(07:27:53) jw: you could make bridges only you can use
(07:27:55) Dragonene: notch: Better still - add a giant tower
(07:27:56) jw: or trap doors
(07:28:00) jw: with a bottomless pit
(07:28:00) Dragonene: and rename it "Breaking the Tower 3D"

(07:49:16) Stargoat: notch, check out Troddlers for the SNES. You might find a friend in that game. It's similar(ish) to lemmings, but instead, you control one bigger dude, who can place and remove stone blocks, which are used to create new pathes for the little dudes
(07:49:32) notch: ooh, ok. =)
(07:49:35) Drakkar: ooh

(09:01:31) Dragonene: btw notch
(09:01:35) Dragonene: the CTF mode sounds awesome

(09:01:47) worstplay: Evil-Ville: cool
(09:01:48) Dragonene: or whatever
(09:01:50) Dragonene: it would be awesome
(09:02:28) worstplay: absolutely perfect game mode for this would be co-op survival
(09:02:58) ArneLurk: find the hidden panty would rock

(09:06:08) notch: I added it just now, I figured it was stable enough. The only real problem is opera, but I'm stumped there
(09:06:35) worstplay: also, half block or something so players can go up without jumping would be useful
(09:06:52) notch: yep, also planned. And thin walls for doors or whatever
(09:06:59) worstplay: nice
(09:07:21) notch: =D
(09:07:31) notch: thanks for the feedback, btw. I appreciate it
(09:07:57) Dragonene: Ooh
(09:08:01) Dragonene: I know what this game needs
(09:08:10) Dragonene: I doubt you'll agree though :P
(09:08:15) Dragonene: Might not fit the setting very well.
(09:08:19) Dragonene: Launch pads!
(09:08:26) Dragonene: You know, that you step onto, and they'll throw you into the air
(09:08:32) notch: I'm not adding launch pads =)
(09:08:35) Dragonene: :'(
(09:08:40) Dragonene: But but
(09:08:40) notch: elevators, possibly
(09:08:43) Dragonene: Launch pads!
(09:08:47) Kasran: You need a thing where you can snipe the annoying guys.
(09:08:55) Dragonene: No
(09:09:00) Kasran: Yes

(09:12:18) C418: yeah, takes time
(09:12:34) notch: oh wow. =D
(09:13:35) Bigger: such low ceilings
(09:13:42) Bigger: either way that is totally sweet
(09:13:52) C418: how long did this take?
(09:14:09) FinDude: wow
(09:14:13) Evil-Ville: I am not sure few hours maybe
(09:14:19) FinDude: found a 1x high cave
(09:14:22) Bigger: awesome
(09:14:35) Dragonene: wow, that's a massive fort
(09:14:42) Dragonene: needs more textures though
(09:14:45) Dragonene: for visibility indoors!
(09:15:12) Yoren left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).

(09:15:31) Dragonene: Evil-Ville: It stopped loading at pretty much one minute sharp for me
(09:15:34) Dragonene: stupid youtube :S
(09:15:50) nyarla: i dug a tunnel all the way under the map which popped out on top of a hill. i lost my sense of direction underground, came out nowhere near where i thought it would. magic!
(09:15:53) Evil-Ville: Try clearing your cache that fixes youtube for me usually
(09:15:59) jw: im making mario in minecraft
(09:16:01) notch: i agree Evil-Ville. I'm trying to think of a fast way of doing it. =)
(09:16:07) FinDude: ville that seems a bit cramped
(09:16:17) FinDude: 3x high corridors are way more nice
(09:16:22) Yoren [chatzilla@82-171-27-159.ip.telfort.nl] entered the room.
(09:16:28) notch: yeah, that's like real life rooms, FinDude
(09:16:39) notch: i usually go for 2 meter high doors and three meter high rooms
(09:17:19) Evil-Ville: The underground section has higher ceilings atleast partially
(09:18:49) Evil-Ville: I think you should be able to build higher
(09:19:27) notch: i can move the grass level down a bit, but that means less caves
(09:19:34) notch: I don't want to make the world much bigger.. heh
(09:20:23) notch: ooh, your version just hit HD, Evil-Ville.
(09:20:24) FinDude: lul
(09:20:26) notch: what did you use to record it?
(09:20:35) FinDude: but seriously
(09:20:37) FinDude: lava flood
(09:20:42) notch: lava flood!
(09:20:42) Evil-Ville: camtasia studio 6
(09:21:08) notch: the quality is really good. Much better than what I got with camstudio
(09:21:15) Evil-Ville: Would it be much slower if there was more empty area on top?
(09:21:36) notch: probably not, but the memory usage would go up
(09:21:57) notch: i'm not so worried about the framerate. This doesn't even do any advanced culling yet
(09:22:06) FinDude: besides
(09:22:11) notch: but it has to download the map when you connect to a server and so, so it's mostly a memory thing
(09:22:18) notch: (and also, applets have a rather tight memory cap)
(09:22:27) Evil-Ville: Maybe you could let people decide themselves? Atleast for the non-applet version
(09:22:29) FinDude: dont both collapsing and lava require 3d fill of some sort?
(09:22:58) notch: FinDude: Yep. Lava's "easier" as it only needs to fill along one material
(09:23:29) notch: checking for the collapse is pretty easy too since it only has to reach any other known solid tile
(09:23:42) FinDude: gogo!
(09:24:04) notch: i want the collapsing tiles to really animate and move down and not just magically be at the ground
(09:24:14) notch: that requires a bit of rewriting, but it shouldn't be too bad
(09:25:58) notch: jw: How's your vid coming along? =D
(09:26:25) Kasran is now known as Kas_away

(09:28:06) Dragonene: Stargoat: you around?
(09:28:17) Dragonene: There's surprisingly much talk going on on that QotSA album
(09:28:48) jw: still uploading notch
(09:28:55) notch: C418: No, not yet. It won't be there in the final version, obviously.
(09:28:58) worstplay: damn
(09:29:02) C418: no, of course not
(09:29:05) notch: I kinda like how it shows up in all the videos and screenshots so I can check it. ;)
(09:29:21) jw: notch
(09:29:26) C418: I'm just asking, for filming purposes
(09:29:28) jw: this needs a community site
(09:29:33) jw: were people can post their worlds
(09:29:37) jw: and they should be savable
(09:29:40) Dragonene: AKA worldpress blog
(09:29:41) notch: hmmm

(09:29:46) worstplay: i just spend 45 minutes building flying building
(09:29:53) worstplay: and now i realized i can't get in
(09:30:05) Dragonene: notch: setting up a wordpress blog is easycookies, allows multiple users, and will only let them edit their own entries
(09:30:09) Dragonene: Community magic!

(09:31:58) notch: minecraft.com is taken :-(
(09:32:23) worstplay: notch: would it be hard to check whether there are flying blocks?
(09:33:14) notch: it requires a 3d flood fill. But it only has to be done when a block connecting two other blocks is removed
(09:33:19) jw: notch
(09:33:20) notch: so no, it shouldn't be too hard
(09:33:28) jw: can you make
(09:33:35) jw: that if you keep delete pressed
(09:33:37) jw: lmb I mean to delete
(09:33:41) jw: it auto does it after 1 sec or something

(09:51:02) Siiseli: yeah
(09:51:04) Bood_War: EvilVille is now a god among men
(09:51:08) Siiseli: but oh well you saved it on video
(09:51:14) Siiseli: indeed
(09:51:17) Siiseli: let us all lick his feet
(09:51:42) Bood_War: but he also scares me
(09:52:00) Evil-Ville: It isn't even that well built I just spent a lot of time
(09:52:04) C418: well, if notch takes my idea, everything should be more interesting
(09:52:10) C418: imagine someone randomly loads your castle
(09:52:26) Rotab [Rotab@h45n2c1o291.bredband.skanova.com] entered the room.
(09:52:28) Siiseli: :D
(09:52:28) C418: he either will build more or will love to destroy it
(09:52:49) qubodup: you guys are familiar with the cube2 engine?
(09:52:49) C418: but a broken castle should be interesting too
(09:52:59) C418: sauerbraten?
(09:53:01) qubodup: yeah
(09:53:11) Bood_War: CUBE 2
(09:53:16) qubodup: its the same
(09:53:22) C418: yeah, that guy is half responsible for the first cryengine
(09:53:37) jsticker: A Yerli made it?
(09:53:47) qubodup: anyways. minecraft kind of looks like it
(09:53:54) qubodup: just like less
(09:53:59) qubodup: and in java
(09:55:37) C418: not only yerlis worked on the engine
(09:58:17) jw: minecraft is wasting my time
(09:58:27) C418: mine too
(09:58:32) Dragonene: I've been like the world's best student today
(09:58:38) Dragonene: I've got so much stuff done
(09:58:54) qubodup: jw, C418: oh, so it's the game who is at fault. riiiigh
(09:58:55) qubodup: t
(09:59:03) C418: of course it is
(09:59:06) jw: I made a giant bridge

(09:59:15) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/superbridge.jpg
(09:59:16) qubodup: Dragonene: what do you mean by that. is this self-sarkasm?
(09:59:21) Dragonene: No.
(09:59:29) Dragonene: I've actually studied a lot today
(09:59:37) qubodup: Dragonene: what did you learn?
(09:59:50) jw: ouch
(09:59:57) qubodup: jw: I recommend some sauerbraten I think
(10:00:35) jw: I dont have time
(10:00:41) MisterX [MisterX@p5DDE7E03.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(10:02:40) qubodup: Then I de-recommend it
(10:03:03) lemmer: D:
(10:04:20) Evil-Ville: decommend
(10:04:30) Campster left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(10:05:59) Dragonene: qubodup: I didn't really learn anything
(10:06:05) Dragonene: just wrote a lot of text.
(10:06:40) Dragonene: cute bridge. Looks a bit unstable though, jw... :D
(10:13:37) ArneLurk: it's possible to do hovering blocks no?
(10:13:52) ArneLurk: just remove the path up
(10:14:54) lemmer: I asked one of the developers at TGS, you know I was like, come on everybody just wants Sonic running, like whats up with the werehog? And he was like, well, heres the deal... he runs at this miles per hour, kilometers per hour, and he laid out all of the statistics on how fast this hedgehog goes, and he was like In order to make a game where Sonic is running and everybody enjoys the whole thing we'd have to design this many
(10:14:54) lemmer: miles of level, and it was some ungodly number. And he's like and that would be like maybe a three hour game and I was like wow, well that kinda stinks and he's like yeah, so we gotta do this other stuff.
(10:14:59) Dragonene: Yeah, I didn't really mean ingame ArneLurk
(10:15:03) Dragonene: I meant in theory :P
(10:15:06) C418: sauerbraten is different
(10:16:03) Dragonene: lemmer: lots of "like" in there
(10:16:45) jw: there was a cave under my castle D:
(10:16:47) jw: awesome
(10:16:53) Bood_War: I made a spirally thing
(10:17:00) qubodup: lemmer: TLDR
(10:17:05) buick: the blocks are too small for my liking in sauerbraten 
(10:17:14) qubodup: buick: l. o. l.
(10:17:17) lemmer: qubodup: DFC
(10:17:23) qubodup: lemmer: kk

(10:17:55) qubodup: buick: you know you can change the size of the selection rectangle?
(10:18:11) buick: having the option 
(10:18:18) Jrsquee [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:18:22) buick: I feel compelled to use the smallest 
(10:18:24) buick: because I can
(10:18:32) qubodup: buick: ? g+mopusewheel if i remember correctly
(10:18:39) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/tower.jpg
(10:18:40) buick: whereas Infiniminer & Minecraft
(10:18:45) buick: There is no choice
(10:18:50) buick: so I don't have to even think about it
(10:19:13) Dragonene: buick: what are you doing her
(10:19:15) Dragonene: here*
(10:19:19) Dragonene: you were supposed to be gone for a week
(10:19:28) buick: I will be!
(10:19:31) buick: I'm all packed
(10:19:37) buick: waiting for my ride to the airport
(10:20:13) C418: you intend to make this whole tower?
(10:20:33) Fraeon: Heh, I could get a thin client with a display for really cheap 
(10:20:35) Fraeon: Like 20 EUR :P
(10:21:27) Kas_away is now known as Kasran
(10:22:09) buick left the room (quit: Quit: buick).
(10:22:54) Bood_War: I need yous'es sereal opinions. I am making a platforming sandbox game, in the sense that it's like a playground, where you just can do whatever. What should I call it? P.S. There is a shogun
(10:23:08) Bood_War: *shotgun
(10:23:11) Dragonene: is that shoegun
(10:23:14) Dragonene: or shotgun
(10:23:15) Dragonene: ah damn
(10:23:22) Dragonene: I was hoping there'd be a shoegun
(10:23:29) Bood_War: Possibly
(10:23:49) Dragonene: Bood_War: Your description is vague
(10:23:55) Dragonene: With that description you could call it anything
(10:24:10) Dragonene: Super Barbie Land or Box-Builder Remix would work equally well
(10:24:22) pd_tsc [hunter@71.232.50.3] entered the room.
(10:24:30) Dragonene: Or perhaps Double-barrel Slaughterhouse
(10:26:19) Bood_War: It's just a world where you can wander around, with lots of curiosities, like a Zombie shooting range, a water slide, and all kinds of stuff. The 'goal' is to collect golden triangles. But you cna do pretty much whateever
(10:26:28) xe0n left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(10:26:41) Bood_War: Are you familiar with the Playground level-type in Knytt?
(10:26:41) Dragonene: Sounds to me like you need to decide on a theme :P
(10:26:45) Dragonene: Or pick a very generic name
(10:26:47) Dragonene: Nah
(10:26:54) Dragonene: I've only played knytt briefly
(10:26:58) Evil-Ville: It doesn't really seem like it matters what you call it
(10:27:00) Dragonene: perhaps half an hour
(10:27:17) Dragonene: Well, it will surely matter what you call it, but there's a wide range of names that could work
(10:27:18) Cait: Wander around a world with all sorts of curiosities while collecting golden triangles? Didn't Zelda do that first?
(10:27:23) Dragonene: Haha
(10:27:24) Dragonene: :D
(10:27:34) Bood_War: Well, it's about exploration.
(10:27:39) Bood_War: That's the theme
(10:27:48) Jrsquee: Gobbledegook
(10:27:51) Jrsquee: hey hey
(10:28:30) Bood_War: Right now I have Delve, but that sounds to much like an underground exp. thing
(10:28:53) Dragonene: "Curiosities"?
(10:28:58) lemmer: f
(10:28:59) Dragonene: "Curiosity"
(10:29:19) Dragonene: "Curious Realm/Land/World/Place/Space"
(10:29:37) Bood_War: Hmm...
(10:29:44) Yoren: shotgun boy in wonder land
(10:29:50) Dragonene: "Explore/Explode"
(10:30:02) Dragonene: Explorde"
(10:30:10) Dragonene: Asploration!
(10:30:15) Dragonene: ....what
(10:30:20) Bood_War: Yoren:..........Yes
(10:30:27) Bood_War: YOUR-HEAD-A-SPLODE
(10:30:38) Stargoat: urgh
(10:30:46) Stargoat: JA2, I think I might have to let a town go :\
(10:30:47) Bood_War: Hey Stargoat
(10:31:06) Dragonene: Ooh ooh I know
(10:31:08) Yoren: boomstick b-something that alliterates?
