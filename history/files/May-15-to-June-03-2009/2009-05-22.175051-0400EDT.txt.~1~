(17:50:52) Xander: I do prefer it though to how it is now.
(17:50:55) jstickeur: And the better team wins
(17:51:03) jstickeur: That's kind of what is fun

(17:51:12) jstickeur: Not random bullshit kindergarten games
(17:51:19) Dragonmaw: XD
(17:51:30) Dragonmaw: The thing is, now people are just sitting AFK in servers
(17:51:33) phonygerbil [phonygerbi@5ac78c51.bb.sky.com] entered the room.
(17:51:35) jstickeur: Yeah
(17:51:39) Dragonmaw: At least in my unlock system, people are playing
(17:51:45) Xander: The different equipment isn't necessarily better. But I actually kind of agree with this, are there any servers that work on the original pure mechanics?
(17:51:46) jstickeur: Yeah but see
(17:51:48) Xander: No unlocks or anything?
(17:51:49) BlademasterBobo: I've played for ~3 hours and gotten one axtinguisher
(17:51:53) jstickeur: If you want people to play your game
(17:51:53) BlademasterBobo: which I already had
(17:51:55) jstickeur: Make your game fun
(17:51:56) phonygerbil: Xander: Yes
(17:52:01) jstickeur: Don't hold a carrot in front of them
(17:52:04) Xander: ah. awesomes
(17:52:04) Dragonmaw: Xander: Yes, it's a cvar
(17:52:12) BlademasterBobo: and then I saw a free weekender join and get a huntsman on his first kill
(17:52:18) BlademasterBobo: and shortly after both watches
(17:52:19) jstickeur: heh
(17:52:23) Dragonmaw: I got a natascha
(17:52:26) Dragonmaw: which i didn't have
(17:52:29) Dragonmaw: so i'm happy
(17:52:33) jstickeur: I didn't get anything according to C418
(17:52:38) Dragonmaw: honestly i don't give a shit about the unlocks
(17:52:48) BlademasterBobo: honestly what's the point of the update then
(17:52:48) Dragonmaw: so this system is like "whatever bro"
(17:52:49) jstickeur: Un-according to him I got 3 weapons I already had :s
(17:52:57) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(17:53:00) C418: nothing changed
(17:53:25) Dragonmaw: Bobo: The weapons are there, I figure I'll get them eventually.
(17:53:41) Dragonmaw: It's not like I'm at a huge disadvantage without the Huntsman or Ambassador.
(17:53:53) The_Doctor2 [the_doctor@pool-72-68-109-198.nwrknj.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(17:53:56) jstickeur: You sure? Ambassador is one huge weapon
(17:54:05) jstickeur: That gun changes a lot
(17:54:09) BlademasterBobo: Dragonmaw: Well, that's not how I feel about it :P
(17:54:09) Dragonmaw: I'm more of a stabby stab man
(17:54:15) jstickeur: Still
(17:54:16) BlademasterBobo: I was excited about the new weapons
(17:54:20) jstickeur: It basically kills with one shot
(17:54:21) Dragonmaw: I'm excited too!
(17:54:21) BlademasterBobo: and now I am disappointed
(17:54:25) Dragonmaw: But the thing is
(17:54:25) BlademasterBobo: and angry
(17:54:29) Dragonmaw: In normal gameplay
(17:54:30) jstickeur: Yeah, bobo
(17:54:32) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(17:54:36) Dragonmaw: It's not a big deal if you don't have them
(17:54:39) BlademasterBobo: no
(17:54:40) BlademasterBobo: it is
(17:54:41) Dragonmaw: And you'll get them eventually
(17:54:42) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:54:44) Dragonmaw: So don't fret it
(17:54:48) BlademasterBobo: because that's what I was excited about
(17:54:55) jstickeur: What are you, valve's lawyer?
(17:54:59) BlademasterBobo: Like
(17:55:02) BlademasterBobo: someone walks up and says
(17:55:03) Dragonmaw: Naw, I'm just not like
(17:55:08) Dragonmaw: OMFG NEW WEAPONS
(17:55:08) BlademasterBobo: come over to my house, I'll give you cake
(17:55:11) phonygerbil: It's nice to have the choice to use the extra weapons. It's silly they make you wait long and put you at he mercy of a random variable
(17:55:13) Dragonmaw: I DIDN'T GET THEM IMMEDIATELY?!?!?!
(17:55:15) BlademasterBobo: and you get there
(17:55:15) Dragonmaw: WHAT THE FUCK
(17:55:17) BlademasterBobo: and they say
(17:55:18) Dragonmaw: I HATE YOU VALVE
(17:55:19) BlademasterBobo: oh
(17:55:20) Dragonmaw: YLOUASSS
(17:55:21) BlademasterBobo: you can't have cake
(17:55:23) BlademasterBobo: for 5 hours
(17:55:27) BlademasterBobo: but everyone else can have cake
(17:55:30) jstickeur: That's not what we're doing, Dragonmaw
(17:55:36) BlademasterBobo: you went over for cake
(17:55:37) jstickeur: We're not bitter because we didn't get the weapons
(17:55:39) BlademasterBobo: but now you can't have cake
(17:55:44) Dragonmaw: I'm more parodying the steam forums, js
(17:55:44) BlademasterBobo: how would you feel dragonmaw
(17:55:45) The_Doctor left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(17:55:45) jstickeur: But because of the shit system that's now in place
(17:55:45) phonygerbil: Nobody is doing that Dragonmaw 
(17:55:50) jstickeur: And how TF2 was consequently ruined
(17:55:59) Dragonmaw: Bobo: Bad analogy, I don't like cake.
(17:56:04) Dragonmaw: I'm more of a pie person.
(17:56:12) jstickeur: *ruined is an exaggeration, it stands for "definitely worsened"
(17:56:13) BlademasterBobo: fine, pie whatever
(17:56:19) Dragonmaw: It wouldn't bother me
(17:56:21) BlademasterBobo: The game isn't ruined
(17:56:22) Dragonmaw: I'm patient.
(17:56:38) BlademasterBobo: but I'm probably not going to play again until I forget about wanting the new weapons and the update shit.
(17:56:48) phonygerbil left the room (quit: Quit: byeeeeeee~~~~~).

(17:57:21) Nightro [Nightro@60-241-47-103.static.tpgi.com.au] entered the room.
(17:57:30) jstickeur: Let's just delete tf2 and let the PopCap people pretend they play an FPS
(17:57:39) Dragonmaw: IDK, I know the system is bugged, but even if it wasn't, I wouldn't be bothered
(17:57:48) BlademasterBobo: Dragonmaw you don't get it
(17:57:54) BlademasterBobo: that's fine for you I guess
(17:57:54) Dragonmaw: Naw, I do
(17:58:01) Dragonmaw: It just doesn't bother me personally
(17:58:01) BlademasterBobo: jsticker: I'm tempted to
(17:58:18) BlademasterBobo: it just makes me turn into one of those Rage Assholes
(17:58:24) jstickeur: :D
(17:58:24) BlademasterBobo: right now
(17:58:33) Dragonmaw: I play TF2 because it's a fun multiplayer FPS
(17:58:39) BlademasterBobo: me too
(17:58:42) tantan: dragonmaw is right
(17:58:43) Dragonmaw: Not because I want to fuck around with balance-fucking weapons
(17:58:45) tantan: he is a good person
(17:58:46) BlademasterBobo: BUT
(17:58:49) BlademasterBobo: While it's at this point
(17:58:55) BlademasterBobo: where the new weapons are what I was playing to try out
(17:59:01) BlademasterBobo: I'm going to be angry about not having them
(17:59:02) tantan: nevermind
(17:59:04) jstickeur: I kinda see it like this
(17:59:09) Dragonmaw: Why does your enjoyment of the game revolve around unlockables?
(17:59:12) jstickeur: With the old acievement unlocks you had a capitalistic way
(17:59:13) BlademasterBobo: Because
(17:59:14) BlademasterBobo: That
(17:59:15) BlademasterBobo: is why
(17:59:20) jstickeur: The good players had the good weapons
(17:59:22) BlademasterBobo: I started playing again at htis point in time
(17:59:25) tantan: hey does the update remove all your old unlocks
(17:59:26) Dragonmaw: js: not true
(17:59:30) BlademasterBobo: because the update
(17:59:31) Dragonmaw: bad players had the unlockable
(17:59:34) Z80 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(17:59:34) BlademasterBobo: the weapons looked cool
(17:59:35) jstickeur: Now TF2 is a kind of USA in the 60s
(17:59:36) Dragonmaw: they just grinded for them.
(17:59:36) Xander: Because they're there dangled infront of me
(17:59:37) Evil-Ville: As if grinding achievements took skill
(17:59:37) BlademasterBobo: so I wanted to try them
(17:59:41) jstickeur: With white people and black people
(17:59:42) BlademasterBobo: and it turns out 
(17:59:43) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(17:59:44) BlademasterBobo: I can't
(17:59:45) Xander: I didnt want them until they existed for me to want
(17:59:46) jstickeur: White people get new weapon unlocks
(17:59:50) jstickeur: Because of their DNA
(17:59:51) BlademasterBobo: hahaha
(17:59:56) jstickeur: And black people don't
(17:59:59) Dragonmaw: Also, most of the achievements don't take any skill
(17:59:59) jstickeur: They just unlucky
(18:00:05) tantan: and black people have different water fountains
(18:00:10) Dragonmaw: Some of them are just dumb fucking luck
(18:00:14) jstickeur: I'm just trying to find an Art Game point of view
(18:00:17) Dragonmaw: Or rigging the system
(18:00:28) jstickeur: So Valve tried to teach us that Capitalism is still better than Apartheit
(18:00:33) jstickeur: Thanks valve!
(18:00:35) jstickeur: I knew that
(18:00:52) pyl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El0b0-hoU1k
(18:00:59) BlademasterBobo: maybe valve should just make them microtransactions
(18:01:00) Androu1 left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(18:01:02) BlademasterBobo: >________>
(18:01:04) Androu1 [Androu1@190-76-62-60.dyn.movilnet.com.ve] entered the room.
(18:01:09) Evil-Ville: I didn't get any new unlockables when I played for a few hours but in the end it doesn't matter to me because for the first time in ages I actually had fun playing TF2
(18:01:11) jstickeur: Yeah I thought about that while playing
(18:01:24) jstickeur: Maybe this is just a setup to introduce weapons as DLC
(18:01:28) Arne left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(18:01:38) jstickeur: "Tired of waiting for the final random unlock? Just buy it! Two dollar!"
(18:01:43) BlademasterBobo: lol
(18:01:53) jstickeur: srsly
(18:01:57) BlademasterBobo: nah
(18:02:03) BlademasterBobo: supposedly the long wait times are bugs
(18:02:11) BlademasterBobo: :I
(18:02:15) jstickeur: it's still gonna take long, even if it's fixed
(18:02:16) LordMetroid: I want to code but I feel so exhausted I can't put source on file
(18:02:19) jstickeur: You know it and I know it
(18:02:26) BlademasterBobo: lol
(18:02:35) BlademasterBobo: maybe I should just leave TF2 running in spec mode
(18:02:41) jstickeur: :]
(18:02:42) BlademasterBobo: in the background
(18:02:51) jstickeur: That's a fun game then
(18:03:04) BlademasterBobo: indeed
(18:03:13) Evil-Ville: The game's just going to taunt you by giving you 20 sandviches
(18:03:18) BlademasterBobo: yeah
(18:03:25) mewse [mewse@c122-107-189-4.eburwd5.vic.optusnet.com.au] entered the room.
(18:03:31) jstickeur: The only conclusion I can draw, from whatever PoV, is that it's a flawed game deeply in need of a good fix, and that more is gained by not playing
(18:03:45) jstickeur: But that's the same conclusion I drew months ago
(18:03:50) jstickeur: It's just clearer
(18:03:52) jstickeur: :(
(18:04:05) BlademasterBobo: wat
(18:04:07) BlademasterBobo: it's still fun
(18:04:11) BlademasterBobo: it's just irritating sometimes
(18:04:15) jstickeur: haha
(18:04:31) Dragonmaw: you guys are just getting really upset over optional unlockables XD
(18:04:39) Dragonmaw: just enjoy the core gameplay experience already!
(18:04:42) C418: everyone gets the wepon by cheating the achievements anyway
(18:04:44) jstickeur: The world of multiplayer games is so broad
(18:04:48) C418: I did with medic and pyro
(18:04:48) The_Doctor2 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(18:04:57) C418: I don't know how to get them else
(18:05:00) Dragonmaw: I actually got mine through actual achievements
(18:05:02) C418: except by incredible luck
(18:05:03) Dragonmaw: i didn't grind
(18:05:04) BlademasterBobo: Dragonmaw
(18:05:06) Dragonmaw: despite my guides
(18:05:17) BlademasterBobo: you don't get it
(18:05:21) BlademasterBobo: and that's fine
(18:05:26) Dragonmaw: no, i understand perfectly
(18:05:30) Dragonmaw: i just disagree
(18:05:30) BlademasterBobo: but quit trying to shove your viewpoint down our throats
(18:05:34) BlademasterBobo: because you won't change our minds
(18:05:40) jstickeur: But bobo
(18:05:41) Dragonmaw: stop bitching
(18:05:42) BlademasterBobo: because it's not like we want to be angry about it
(18:05:47) jstickeur: You shove ours down his throat right now then
(18:05:48) Kobel: Drama?
(18:05:49) Dragonmaw: or i'll continue bitching about your bitching XD
(18:05:51) Kobel: DRAMA?
(18:05:52) BlademasterBobo: not really

(18:06:33) Kobel: Dragonmaw
(18:06:35) jstickeur: Dragonmaw's just good at smelling blood
(18:06:36) Cthulhu32: my work let everyone out early

(18:06:43) BlademasterBobo left the room (quit: Quit: BlademasterBobo).
(18:06:46) Cthulhu32: oh mai
(18:06:48) jstickeur: And when he smells blood, he'll make sure you get pissed off good
(18:06:49) Kobel: That is the least good thing to say to someone angry ever

(18:07:20) Cthulhu32: haha
(18:07:21) Cthulhu32: awesome
(18:07:31) C418: but bobo often goes angry easily

(18:09:40) Kobel: I suppose the chips are renowned for penetrating the dip.
(18:09:44) Kobel: I'll give you that one.
(18:10:20) Z80: Remember, pedophile does not necessarily equal child molestor.
(18:10:31) Kobel: I have NEVER forgotten that.

(18:15:29) Kobel: Because I'd heard the original DB wasn't that bad and it ended up segueing right in
(18:15:38) Kobel: And I was like fuck it, whatever, let's see where this goes
(18:15:55) Siiseli: ASDASD
(18:16:14) Siiseli: "My name is ken. Whta I'm about to do might feel a little strange at first but I promise not to hurt you"
(18:16:22) Siiseli: this ugh.. this he said to a little girl
(18:16:32) Kobel: This sounds awesome.
(18:16:32) Z80: Wat.
(18:16:46) Kobel: I also read like half of Jojo's Bizarre adventure a little bit back
(18:16:49) Siiseli: ?:D
(18:16:55) Siiseli: same author btw
(18:16:56) Cthulhu32: that comic rules
(18:17:01) Kobel: Most of the shonen manga writers... have no fucking idea where they're going with these, do they?
(18:17:03) Cthulhu32: did you see the new jojo animation?
(18:17:13) Siiseli: Kobel, no they don't
(18:17:16) Kobel: They just completely make it up as they go
(18:17:26) Cthulhu32: Kobel: have you read/seen Gantz?
(18:17:33) Kobel: I read up to the part with the plant cat.
(18:17:41) Kobel: The telekinetic cat flower.
(18:17:41) Cthulhu32: that comic is weird
(18:17:43) Cthulhu32: yeah
(18:17:49) Kobel: I read some of Gantz
(18:18:02) Kobel: But it wasn't done at the time so once I got to the end of what'd been made I stopped
(18:18:10) Kobel: I liked it though
(18:18:18) Cthulhu32: it was really good, the ending is really sudden though
(18:18:30) Cthulhu32: of the animation*
(18:18:36) Ciahnensy [pyx@24-119-17-103.cpe.cableone.net] entered the room.
(18:18:39) Kobel: Oh well, better that than trailing off into complete ridiculousness like a lot of them do
(18:18:41) Cthulhu32: I have the first comic in japanese, but my kanji is waaaay to shitty to read it
(18:18:44) Cthulhu32: yeah
(18:19:03) Cthulhu32: non-anime comics, you read Transmetropolitan?
(18:19:08) Kobel: Mostly I'm just totally gay for One Piece nowadays
(18:19:09) Kobel: Yeah
(18:19:12) Siiseli: yes
(18:19:12) Kobel: That was solid
(18:19:13) Siiseli: GOD YES
(18:19:17) Siiseli: it is the best comic ever
(18:19:18) Siiseli: period.
(18:19:19) Cthulhu32: the ending made me so happy
(18:19:22) Jr: Hey zaity and jorbert
(18:19:22) Siiseli: no wait, the best THING ever
(18:19:24) Cthulhu32: it gave me the best happy ending
(18:19:34) Kobel: I don't remember too well
(18:19:36) Siiseli: yeas and it hasn't even been raped to a movie!
(18:19:38) Siiseli: it's solid gold
(18:19:40) Kobel: Read it a few years ago
(18:19:44) Jr: Foo!  Man, I am /reeling/ from sleep inertia
(18:19:46) Cthulhu32: yeah! they probably won't ever do it either cause its a little older
(18:19:50) Kobel: Um
(18:19:51) Siiseli: I've read it a million times
(18:19:53) Jr: I don't usually take naps
(18:19:56) Kobel: They just made a Watchmen movie?
(18:19:59) Cthulhu32: thats true
(18:19:59) Siiseli: Cthulhu32, which is good
(18:20:06) Cthulhu32: i hope they don't fuck up Trans
(18:20:26) Cthulhu32: the only thing I want is a platform-rpg transmetropolitan
(18:20:32) Cthulhu32: damn my cat just knocked over something big
(18:20:33) Siiseli: I don't
(18:20:33) Kobel: It's not something most execs would think would make a good movie I think
(18:20:39) Kobel: So it should be safe
(18:20:46) Cthulhu32: yeah
(18:20:57) Cthulhu32: "oh... he's naked... and he shoots people with a shit gun.."
(18:21:05) Xander: In the words of Francis Bacon

(18:21:08) Kobel: I think an [AS] animated show of it could potentially be awesome though.
(18:21:13) Cthulhu32: they did turn Judge Dredd into a movie !_!
(18:21:13) pekuja: mmm... bacon
(18:21:22) Xander: What the cunt just flew into my room?!
(18:21:24) Siiseli: KonamiCode, could be
(18:21:25) Cthulhu32: whatsup pekuja

(18:21:39) Xander: Where's mah pokeballs!"
(18:21:39) Cthulhu32: kill it with fire
(18:21:42) Siiseli: Cthulhu32, remember "nobody touch that dog, I'm having that for dinner"
(18:21:47) Cthulhu32: haha
(18:21:52) Cthulhu32: was that when he was tripping hella bad
(18:22:02) Cthulhu32: so damn good

(18:22:11) Xander: shit.. okay.. this sucks
(18:22:22) Xander: where the fuck did it go, and how much fire do I need?
(18:22:25) Jr: is it eating you
(18:22:27) Siiseli: Cthulhu32, no that was when he threw the guy out of the window onto the dog
(18:22:30) Jr: check your pants
(18:22:30) Cthulhu32: cool, I see more and more people from various chats I've been in in the past move here :D
(18:22:34) Cthulhu32: oh yeah
(18:22:38) Cthulhu32: haha so awesome Siiseli
(18:22:48) Siiseli: it was.. it was so beautiful
(18:22:51) Cthulhu32: Xander: so much fire
(18:22:53) Siiseli: I'll buy the comics when I can
(18:23:03) Cthulhu32: yeah I have them on internet-share version
(18:23:55) Xander: well, fuck
(18:23:59) Jr: HEY SIISELI
(18:24:05) Xander: There's a giant beetle currently camping behidn my tv somewhere
(18:24:16) KonamiCode: what'd I do?
(18:24:16) Jr: Xander:  awesome!
(18:24:17) Jr: dinner!

(18:24:46) Z80: Hahahahaha.
(18:24:52) Cthulhu32: my company is talking about contracting out some big name for it, and I was like "Jesus let me code it"
(18:25:04) Cthulhu32: soon the beetle will have babies
(18:25:11) Cthulhu32: and you'll be in ass deep
(18:25:13) Xander: I think I might abandon this room

(18:27:33) jstickeur: What the hell, Cthulhu32
(18:27:44) jstickeur: As if actual beetles weren't creepy enough
(18:27:51) nyarla [nyarla@203.219.52.142] entered the room.
(18:28:13) Cthulhu32: haha i love how they did the hack
(18:28:19) Cthulhu32: my wife was so offended by it, it made me smile
(18:28:44) Cthulhu32: "The rhinoceros beetle was selected because of its weight-carrying abilities - it can fly with up to 3g of cargo attached - but also because “they look cool”, apparently."
(18:29:03) Xander left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).
(18:29:25) jstickeur: They're protected by law in germany
(18:29:30) jstickeur: Because they're so rare
(18:29:38) jstickeur: An you guys just plug a computer into them
(18:30:03) Jr: Hey jstickeur 
(18:30:10) jstickeur: Hello!
(18:30:13) Cthulhu32: haha
(18:30:17) squiggly_p: I'm sure they breed them there in a lab and don't go out looking for wile beetles
(18:30:24) squiggly_p: that is extremely creepy, tho
(18:30:31) Cthulhu32: i <3 my new house
(18:30:40) Cthulhu32: yeah there's no way they'd go catching beetles
(18:31:22) squiggly_p: ten years from now when they can spy on you through a fly or something even smaller....
(18:31:37) Jr: crap
(18:31:41) Jr: I don't like that
(18:31:41) Kobel: Solitaire would be super easy to code in Flash
(18:31:53) Cthulhu32: Kobel: yeah I'm doing a prototype for my company in python
(18:31:56) Kobel: A little less easy in something where you have to handle low level stuff
(18:31:57) Jr: I need to go moisturize my face
(18:31:57) Cthulhu32: spent maybe 3 hours so far, and its almost done
(18:32:10) Kobel: Yeah I can't imagine what would be especially difficult...
(18:32:18) Kobel: I probably wouldn't be that fast though, haha
(18:32:22) Cthulhu32: yeah, 100% of the rules are known, a lot of it is tweaking
(18:32:22) jstickeur: Oh, Jr is making himself pretty
(18:32:24) Kobel: But I tend to dick around a lot
(18:32:32) Evil-Ville left the room (quit: Quit: yare yare daze).
(18:32:37) Cthulhu32: yeah I'm getting better at avoiding rewriting my sprite engine 100 times
(18:32:52) Kobel: Right now I'm trying to figure out the prettiest way to make something rotate back to equilibrium
(18:32:58) Kobel: I think maybe some kind of spring system
(18:33:21) Cthulhu32: yeah you could do something fancy like a spring system
(18:33:30) lansing: jstickeur, I would have read that.
(18:33:32) Kobel: I wouldn't consider it too fancy
(18:33:41) jstickeur: Read what, lansing
(18:33:47) lansing: jstickeur, your TF2 rant
(18:33:52) jstickeur: Oh
(18:33:54) Cthulhu32: you could always just have a little curve that makes it start slowly coming back, then zips towards the end
(18:33:58) Cthulhu32: so its quadratic as it comes in
(18:34:24) Kobel: Oh gosh math is hard
(18:34:28) Kobel: Let's go shopping
(18:34:36) Jr: let's get some shoes
(18:34:50) C418: shit
(18:34:58) C418: the video of heavy rain looks like a b movie
(18:35:03) Jr: yes
(18:35:03) C418: not that it's totally surprising
(18:35:17) C418: but I expected a ~tad~ more
(18:35:31) C418: and look at those faces. not what they were advertising for in the first place

(18:39:57) Cthulhu32: woot, all I got left is letting Aces go to the 4 final spots, fixing maybe a few bugs, and solitaire is done
(18:40:16) Cthulhu32: in python with messy coding and its only 236 lines so far
(18:40:33) The_Doctor left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds).

(18:40:43) notch: hah, ok, so loading a 16x4096 pixel texture on my Eee crashes it. :D

(18:44:31) Siiseli: but clever stuff
(18:44:44) Xander: I can only suppose I can leave the window open when I sleep, turn off everything with lights and just hide for 8 hours in another room to sleep

(18:45:11) mbbird left the room.
(18:45:12) Siiseli: Cthulhu32, funny I got the samew feeling

(18:46:01) fartron: last night my friend saw space ghost for the first time
(18:46:01) Siiseli: I just think it's a little story/technical demo foa girl who can't go outside so she creates her own world/develops schitzofrenia
(18:46:03) fartron: his mind was blown
(18:46:05) Z80: But I thought that it was about how this innocent kid saw her surroundings.
(18:46:22) Z80: Siiseli, yeah, good point.
(18:46:23) Cthulhu32: space ghost for the FIRST time?
(18:46:25) notch: oh, wow, it's working
(18:46:25) Cthulhu32: that show is so old

(18:57:59) pekuja: Xander: so you're playing the game? is it good?
(18:58:29) pekuja: Xander: I'm interested in it, but the mediocre reviews are holding me back
(18:58:29) Xander: I was playing, I'm now playing 'Jesus christ the beetle is still here'
(18:58:31) Z80: I want to record myself during a session of L4D.  In video, to see how stupid I look.
(18:58:37) Xander: It's not something I'd buy
(18:58:52) Xander: There's definitely something missing.. but I've still had fun with it
(18:58:53) pekuja: Xander: you rented it?
(18:59:02) Kobel: I can't record myself, my computer isn't good enough :(
(18:59:04) Xander: Well I do an online rental thing ala gamefly
(18:59:08) pekuja: ok
(18:59:47) Xander: According to the save data I'm basically at the end of the game, and I've been playing off and on since about 1
(19:00:13) Xander: Gameplay is pretty solid, the arm is fun to smash people to hell with, but it just doesn't make much sense
(19:00:30) Siiseli: Z80, there is a recording thing in l4d
(19:00:32) Xander: The 2D version is much better, and is also made by the same people
(19:00:33) Siiseli: from the console
(19:00:41) Siiseli: you may playback the game from the console as well
(19:00:58) Xander: (Rearmed, obviously not the NES game). So, it feels really kind of pointless a game
(19:01:17) Z80: Siiseli, I meant record my physical self.
(19:01:22) Siiseli: Z80, oh right
(19:01:31) Xander: It sort of works well as a 3D game, but they don't exploit the swinging fully, it's like you're swinging on a path or in an area rather than sprawling places you really need to swing like crap to get to
(19:01:38) Siiseli: hey does anyone have need for/an idea for me to do some php excercise
(19:01:42) pekuja: Xander: how long is "since about 1"? I'm probably not on the same timezone
(19:01:48) Xander: It's fun, I've definitely enjoyed playing it.
(19:02:04) Xander: That was about 11 hours ago, but I'd say I've really been playing it about 6 of those hours so far
(19:02:24) Xander: Not as short as Wanted
(19:02:40) lemre: D:
(19:03:00) Rock_D: My jar-fu is strong, webstart success!

(19:03:21) Zaratustra: has anyone gotten unlockables from spectating a LAN game
(19:03:36) Xander: Lots of tiny areas linked together rather than a bunch of levels with a boss at the end like Lost Planet did it
(19:03:43) Xander: Which I think would've suited the game much better
(19:03:47) jstickeur: No idea, Zaratustra
(19:04:12) Xander: Given that I've only fought three bosses this entire time. All painfully easy too
(19:04:19) Siiseli: fuck yesit's raining
(19:04:24) Siiseli: oh man I've missed the rain

(19:04:55) lansing: Siiseli, the clouds look pregnant here :D

(19:07:00) jstickeur: there go my movie plans for tonight
(19:07:01) lansing: jstickeur, did you include anything on how they made the medic utter 'i am ze ubermensch'?  I tried the game yesterday but after hearing that, I promptly deleted it.
(19:07:08) pekuja: Xander: thanks for your opinion
(19:07:15) jstickeur: lansing, no, sorry
(19:07:18) pekuja: oops he left
(19:07:43) lansing: jstickeur, is it supposed to be funny because Nietzsche served as a medic in the franco prussian war? I don't get the joke.
(19:07:53) Siiseli: come now surely there is a need for some sort of a website that uses php and sql
(19:08:05) pekuja: anyways, maybe I won't get Bionic Commando. maybe if I can rent it, but we don't really have good rental places in Finland
(19:08:06) lansing: maybe it's just nonsense
(19:08:18) jstickeur: lansing, the medic is supposed to be a ww2 nazi doctor from the concentration camps, kind of
(19:08:38) lansing: jstickeur, maybe a coincidence then
(19:08:51) jstickeur: But I guess they also plugged nietzsche there
(19:09:34) jstickeur: did that really piss you off enough to delete the game?
(19:09:38) lansing: yup

(20:50:26) Kobel: Oh my god who doesn't love doing bit shifting
(20:50:34) Kobel: Makes you feel like a LEEK HATZPAR
(20:50:37) Siiseli: o/ I don't
(20:50:38) Stargoat: is that like tiltshifting?
(20:50:59) Z80: I think that it is something about Kobel masturbating at sprites.

(20:52:04) Blood_War: *compo match
(20:52:11) RinkuHero: if someone can host
(20:52:12) Kobel: Okay Sii the main reason I'm hyped is just because I haven't gotten to even though I have a lot of divide by 2 operations
(20:52:19) Kobel: Because they're mostly on fucking floats
(20:52:20) Siiseli: :D
(20:52:22) Kobel: Or doubles, technically

(20:59:14) Z80_: What the hell does that mean?  I'm assuming it's something backwards.
(20:59:28) Z80_: But...
(20:59:33) Siiseli: so did I
(20:59:34) Z80_: Siwtsou?
(20:59:35) Siiseli: but it isn't
(20:59:44) Z80_: What is it?
(20:59:48) Kobel: It's backwards and upside down
(20:59:54) Z80_: :'(
(21:00:01) Kobel: It's a joke from The Simpsons
(21:00:03) Siiseli: blhe
(21:00:08) Z80_: Oh, yeah.
(21:00:09) Siiseli: what does it mean
(21:00:11) Siiseli: say it, fool
(21:00:23) Kobel: Wiggum: Put out an APB on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh. Uh, better start with Greektown.
(21:00:23) Kobel: Friday: That's "Homer J. Simpson", Chief. You're reading it upside down.
(21:00:39) Siiseli: OH right
(21:01:14) Z80_: The capital R was confusing, see?
(21:01:20) Z80_: THAT IS MY EXCUSE.
(21:01:20) Siiseli: it was
(21:01:36) Siiseli: also D

(21:02:00) Z80_: Yeah, I actually read that.
(21:02:29) Kobel: Maybe I'll change my display name in L4D to that
(21:02:36) Z80_: You should.
(21:04:24) Kobel: Man
(21:04:46) Kobel: Now that I have this engine working most games they expect me to make here... really aren't much work
(21:04:50) Kobel: Which is pretty neat.
(21:05:15) Z80_: Except for that one game.
(21:05:18) Z80_: That game.
(21:05:29) Z80_: In which you shoot terrorists FOR THE GOOD OF THE NATION.
(21:05:34) Z80_: TARGET: TERROR
(21:05:40) Siiseli: TERRORISM!
(21:05:43) Kobel: whart?
(21:05:43) ***Siiseli freaks out
(21:05:44) Z80_: No wait Cthulhu32 helped make that.

(21:17:02) Stargoat: blood_war, you really need to build more drones
(21:17:02) Siiseli: for it makes you bored
(21:17:10) Blood_War: I know...
(21:17:20) Blood_War: Rinku, best 2 of 3
(21:17:26) Stargoat: you guys wanna go again?
(21:17:28) Blood_War:  Tommorow.
(21:17:32) Stargoat: okay
(21:17:48) Stargoat: blood_war, in the meantime, watch some replays, it'll help
(21:18:00) Blood_War: Hmm, I'm going to practice with my friend.
(21:18:03) iZ80: I never have anything to do.
(21:18:04) RinkuHero: k
(21:18:08) RinkuHero: you needed to build more drones
(21:18:10) RinkuHero: and expand
(21:18:18) Blood_War: He's i think 1170 on the list
(21:18:19) Stargoat: also, use your minerals
(21:18:21) iZ80: I get no social interaction.
(21:18:30) Siiseli: same
(21:18:35) Blood_War: whats with the i?

(21:18:43) Stargoat: I noticed you wern't doing anything, until you bought 3 overlords at the start
(21:18:48) Stargoat: that really shouldn't have happened
(21:19:00) Blood_War: Hmm
(21:19:19) Kobel: Summer break is great except for the summer part
(21:19:22) Stargoat: one overlord, to keep your production going, the rest of the money should be spent on drones/tech
(21:19:29) Stargoat: or whatever you decide to do
(21:19:39) Blood_War: I need to practice with MSUDean...
(21:19:41) Siiseli: summer break is great except for the being home doing absolutely nothing part
(21:19:45) Kobel: Summer break will always be associated with playing Chrono Trigger at 4am on the couch though
(21:19:54) Kobel: Which is probably why I think it's awesome
(21:20:14) Stargoat: Getting better at Starcraft is all about learning from your mistakes.
(21:20:18) Stargoat: but watching replays will help
(21:20:22) Stargoat: get solid build orders
(21:20:32) Kobel: I thought getting better was all about not losing
(21:20:36) Blood_War: Erhermm... I will... um... get Arsenic Cookies done this summer... ehemm....

(21:23:10) Z80: D':

(21:24:11) RinkuHero: yes, the best training for sc
(21:24:13) RinkuHero: is just this:
(21:24:19) RinkuHero: play alone, no opponent
(21:24:25) RinkuHero: and try to reach 200 workers as fast as possible
(21:24:28) RinkuHero: and try to beat that time
(21:24:32) RinkuHero: that'll teach you how to macro
(21:24:40) Z80: Stargoat, the Internet has made you a bit sensitive.  Still not trolling.  Take that comment however you want.  It was not meant as an insult.
(21:24:57) Blood_War: Stargoat I'm going to send you a map I like. Whats your email? I know, It's an excuse, but that map didn't feel right.

(21:25:51) Thi3f: Z80, it is enjoyable
(21:26:14) Stargoat: the iccup maps are fun, but they take a little learning
(21:26:16) Thi3f: Easy to find easy instructions too, but not more advanced ones :(
(21:26:16) Blood_War: Anyway, Roaches are gonna be AWESOME!
(21:26:20) Z80: I must admit that I've become much more interested in the banjo as of late.
(21:26:30) Thi3f: Well, there's the banjo ukulele ;P
(21:26:41) Z80: Good point.
(21:26:44) Stargoat: I guess. The unit seems a little boring to me. A zerg mid-range unit with regen

(21:27:22) Kobel: I wanted one for Christmas but it didn't happen. I did get a bass though, which I also wanted
(21:27:23) Thi3f: And I'd just end up playing totally redneck music

(21:28:27) Stargoat: any time
(21:28:28) Blood_War: Besides the Nydus Worn

(21:28:35) Blood_War: *Nydus Worm
(21:28:41) Kobel: If Starcraft was as popular in Japan as it was in Korea there would be a lot more Kerrigan porn.
(21:28:47) Kobel: I regret that this is not the case.
(21:28:59) Z80: Kobel likes every form of porn that ever was.
(21:29:00) SirTopHat: heavy metal eh? SoaD, Metallica, Slayer, Cannibal Corpse and Sodom, eh?

(21:30:05) Kobel: Well it's not like it doesn't exist
(21:30:07) Blood_War: We know
(21:30:11) Z80: Oh, Siiseli, you were talking about my Steam avatar.
(21:30:13) Kobel: But if SC was big in Japan there would be a lot more.
(21:30:21) Siiseli: Z80, yes
(21:30:22) Z80: I made it a long time ago,
(21:30:23) Siiseli: yes I was
(21:30:34) Kobel: Although if that were true then does that mean they'd make a lot of Tom Waits porn? Hm
(21:30:41) Z80: I have always wanted to curve the arms.
(21:30:42) Kobel: A delicate conundrum.
(21:30:50) RinkuHero: there is kerrigan porn
(21:30:52) RinkuHero: but it's terrible
(21:30:54) Blood_War: I don't know why koreans are so obsessed with SC. It's wierd
(21:30:59) Kobel: Not all of it.
(21:31:02) Kobel: But yeah most of it
(21:31:18) Thi3f: Well, I guess it fits their obsessive control freak nature
(21:31:27) RinkuHero: it's because it's on tv there
(21:31:28) Z80: Yay stereotypes.
(21:31:33) Thi3f: Z80, nothing better
(21:31:33) RinkuHero: and not all of them are obsessed
(21:31:39) RinkuHero: mainly young folk
(21:31:45) RinkuHero: and not a majority of them either
(21:31:45) SnakeyAtWork: Japanese are very obsessed about a game called "Monster Hunter" right now.
(21:31:48) RinkuHero: it has its own station, but
(21:31:51) Kobel: What's interesting to me
(21:31:52) SnakeyAtWork: As well as the new Final Fantasy movie.
(21:31:52) RinkuHero: it's sort o flike basketball here
(21:31:55) RinkuHero: not everyone is into it
(21:32:03) Kobel: Is there's a pretty obvious connection between like
(21:32:19) Blood_War: Moster Hunter is great =D
(21:32:21) Kobel: The japanese grind fetish and the way shonen manga are like "I'm training! I'm training!"

(21:32:45) RinkuHero: all of them
(21:32:49) RinkuHero: so they mostly play western games
(21:32:50) SnakeyAtWork: Why is that?
(21:32:50) Kobel: Huh
(21:32:56) Z80 [reetva@c-67-166-57-102.hsd1.co.comcast.net] entered the room.
(21:32:57) Siiseli: what
(21:33:00) Kobel: Because Japan is historically an asshole
(21:33:03) RinkuHero: it's because they were invaded during ww2 by japan
(21:33:14) RinkuHero: so they'r enot really too friendly with them
(21:33:18) SnakeyAtWork: Right.
(21:33:23) C418 left the room (quit: Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de).

(21:33:34) Blood_War: I went to Japan, It's awesome
(21:33:40) Kobel: I mean you know how Japanese people love fictional rape? Turns out they love the real thing too!
(21:33:43) Kobel: Wacky guys
(21:33:48) Siiseli: :D
(21:33:51) Stargoat: the japanese are so whacky and random, what cool guys

(21:38:01) Blood_War: Smaller, but close
(21:38:09) Blood_War: and not a nazi
(21:38:12) ljnc: sibling

(21:38:35) Stargoat: a babby
(21:38:40) Blood_War: Very close
(21:38:43) Thi3f: A Stargoat
(21:38:43) Kobel: how is babby deformed?
(21:38:48) Blood_War: A specific type of baby
(21:38:53) Stargoat: wut.
(21:38:54) SnakeyAtWork: Kobel: The palin way
(21:38:56) Thi3f: A... fat baby?
(21:39:04) ljnc: elephant babby
(21:39:08) Blood_War: Nope, think mental stuff
(21:39:14) Blood_War: and human
(21:39:23) Kobel: A grown man with the mind of a child
(21:39:28) Stargoat: manchild!
(21:39:28) Blood_War: No
(21:39:36) SnakeyAtWork: A Palin baby?
(21:39:36) Kobel: A grown midget with the mind of a child
(21:39:41) Blood_War: No
(21:39:44) Thi3f: A cripple
(21:39:50) Blood_War: IT WAS...
(21:39:51) Kobel: The brain of a child held in a jar by a grown man
(21:39:57) Blood_War: A RETARDED BABY!
(21:40:01) Stargoat: um....
(21:40:04) Blood_War: Yay! =D
(21:40:08) Kobel: How can you tell?
(21:40:17) Kobel: Or do you mean afterwards?
(21:40:19) RinkuHero: "haha listen up here serious sam; im not going to give a detailed breakdown of why you are wrong and stupid but you are"
(21:40:21) RinkuHero: superjoe
(21:40:23) RinkuHero: :D
(21:40:36) Stargoat: I love SuperJoe's posts.
(21:40:36) Kobel: Super Joe has my man babies within him
(21:40:40) Kobel: Someday he'll know
(21:40:44) Thi3f: I hate SuperJoe
(21:40:44) Kobel: And knowing is half the battle
(21:40:46) Blood_War: Before it was retarded, and after, it waseven more retarded!
(21:40:49) Kobel: Go Joe!
(21:41:03) Thi3f: E-thugs should be banned from the internet, even if they're trying to be funny
(21:41:10) Stargoat: Blood_War, you're either starved for attnetion of a maniac; why are you telling us this?
(21:41:25) Stargoat: fuck
(21:41:30) Stargoat: attention, or*
(21:41:37) Blood_War: It was a joke my friend told me
(21:41:44) Stargoat: it's not that funny :|
(21:41:49) Thi3f: That was a joke?
(21:41:50) RinkuHero: mike tyson's quotes are great
(21:41:50) Kobel: "this has a point mroeover the point is clearly communicated? how about i blow you up with my hands homeboy"
(21:41:52) RinkuHero: rereading them now
(21:41:55) Kobel: <3
(21:41:56) RinkuHero: "Real freedom is having nothing. I was freer when I didn't have a cent. Do you know what I do sometimes? Put on a ski mask and dress in old clothes, go out on the streets and beg for quarters."
(21:41:59) Blood_War: I gotta go, night all.
(21:42:06) ljnc: needs more punchline
(21:42:27) Blood_War: It's not as funny on IRC

(21:43:05) Stargoat: hmm
(21:43:33) Stargoat: Thie3f, SuperJoe is totally an anti-troll
(21:43:44) Stargoat: ack
(21:43:47) Thi3f: Stargoat, yes, but neither should exist
(21:43:50) Stargoat: my hands arn't working today
(21:43:52) Thi3f: Evil defeating evil is still evil
(21:44:05) Kobel: Even when I'm concentrated on derailing a forum I'm not as good at it as Joe
(21:44:08) Stargoat: but defeating evil with such style and class?
(21:44:10) Kobel: And IMO I'm pretty good at it
(21:44:22) Jr [Mibbit@c-75-69-236-203.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] entered the room.
(21:44:22) Thi3f: I guess we've got different definition of class
(21:44:32) Kobel: I don't have the same attention span though.
(21:45:10) Stargoat: Thi3f, I don't like you because we don't have exactly the same taste in troll.
(21:45:11) Kobel: Thi3f my time calculations completely worked and you're wrong about super joe too
(21:45:38) Thi3f: Kobel, I'm pretty sure you didn't test it in an unstable enough environment to be sure
(21:45:52) Thi3f: Which I totally mentioned
(21:45:53) Stargoat: time calculations?
(21:45:56) qubodup_ [qubodup@brln-4db95b33.pool.einsundeins.de] entered the room.
(21:46:15) Kobel: My framerate independent time calculations
(21:46:23) Kobel: And I tested it with a 10fps drop
(21:46:32) Thi3f: lol
(21:46:38) Thi3f: You think 10 fps would do it?
(21:47:00) Kobel: Well the bottom limit for the framerate the way it's set up is 15fps
(21:47:05) Kobel: Anything below that doesn't matter
(21:47:28) qubodup left the room (quit: Read error: Operation timed out).
(21:47:35) Kobel: IE at 15fps the game slows down instead of just the framerate dropping
(21:48:06) Thi3f: Yeah, I'm sure it would work well enough, I just said it wasn't completely framerate independant :P
(21:48:22) Thi3f: Or well, I said I think It wouldn't be, or something like that
(21:48:22) Kobel: Not yet, I still need to work on the damping
(21:48:47) Thi3f: But as long as you're making something awesome, who cares :<
(21:48:53) Kobel: Yeah you've got basically nothing except a hunch to back that up, it's mathemagically sound
(21:49:05) Kobel: Except for the damping :\
(21:49:06) Thi3f: And my weird logic
(21:49:13) Kobel: Which I need to figure out... sometime
(21:49:29) mewse: Damping?
(21:49:40) Kobel: Like velocity *= 1-damping
(21:50:00) Kobel: It's getting compounded at a different rate based on frame rate right now
(21:50:10) Kobel: So I need to look up some stuff on continuous compounding
(21:50:16) mewse: Oh!  Gotcha.
(21:50:38) Kobel: It's not a big deal, but it's sloppy
(21:50:50) mewse: Well..  the easy way to do it is to run your damping at a particular set frame rate, and just apply it multiple times if you're running slower than the damping rate.
(21:51:07) Kobel: Hm
(21:51:09) mewse: So like.. if you tune your damping to be applied 60 times a second, and you're rendering at 30fps right now, you apply the damping function twice per frame.
(21:51:28) Kobel: That makes a lot of sense and I feel retarded for not thinking of it.
(21:51:42) mewse: It's a hack, but it works.  :)
(21:51:59) Kobel: It's a little hacky but not too bad
(21:52:32) ***mewse has shipped a couple games using that hack.  Including one which subdivided the frame ludicrously, and applied a physics calculation 2000 times per frame, at 30fps.
(21:53:15) Stargoat: “[He] called me a ‘rapist’ and a ‘recluse.’ I’m not a recluse.”

(21:54:30) mewse: (In that spot, the player was being controlled by a flight simulation under ludicrously extreme forces.  Had to massively subdivide the frame in order to keep the simulation stable)
(21:56:00) Kobel: Haha wow that's crazy

(21:56:06) Stargoat: "I feel like sometimes that I was born, that I'm not meant for this society because everyone here is a fucking hypocrite. Everybody says they believe in God but they don't do God's work. Everybody counteracts what God is really about. If Jesus was here, do you think Jesus would show me any love? Do you think Jesus would love me? I'm a Muslim, but do you think Jesus would love me ... I think Jesus would have a drink with me and discuss .
(21:56:08) Stargoat: .. why you acting like that? Now, he would be cool. He would talk to me. No Christian ever did that and said in the name of Jesus even ... They'd throw me in jail and write bad articles about me and then go to church on Sunday and say Jesus is a wonderful man and he's coming back to save us. But they don't understand that when he comes back, that these crazy greedy capitalistic men are gonna kill him again."

(21:56:25) Kobel: Even fixing this shit is above and beyond the call of what they seem to expect of me XD
(21:56:25) mewse: On a comedy quiz program out here this week, one of the questions came up as; "In 1997, Mike Tyson bit off a part of Evander Holyfield's ear.  What did the ear taste like?"  The correct answer was, of course, "Ear".
(21:57:39) Kobel: That makes sense to me.

(22:38:05) PFawkes: It is a glorious thing.
(22:38:19) ljnc: maybe i should have learned someone else on sf3a before playing 4
(22:38:32) Z80_: My sister is graduating RIGHT NOW.
(22:38:36) PFawkes: Nice.
(22:38:41) PFawkes: Grats

(22:41:00) PFawkes: :D

(22:41:08) PFawkes: I never got into SF too much

(22:42:41) ljnc: (i didn't play 4 very long)
(22:43:10) PFawkes: I played 4 once, but not very long
(22:43:18) PFawkes: Just happened to be at a thing I was at
(22:43:29) PFawkes: Spinning Bird KICK!
(22:44:28) shinygerbil: never played the alpha series
(22:45:06) PFawkes: Now, those I DID play
(22:45:12) shinygerbil: also, i had no idea it was possible to play most street fighter games with the exception of 4 online with an arcade emulator :O
(22:45:22) PFawkes: Kawaks, ya?
(22:45:28) shinygerbil: no, GGPO
(22:45:34) PFawkes: or kawaks >.>

(22:45:49) shinygerbil: which has kaillera, I'm guessing
(22:45:53) PFawkes: yeah
(22:45:58) shinygerbil: kaillera as pretty crap compared to GGPO
(22:46:07) shinygerbil: *is
(22:46:14) PFawkes: yeah
(22:46:23) shinygerbil: apparently GGPO technology is used in the HD remix
(22:46:36) PFawkes: The local cinema has a SF Alpha 3 cabinet
(22:46:40) shinygerbil: awesome
(22:46:53) shinygerbil: i should persuade the cinema where I work to get a SF cabinet :D
(22:46:57) ljnc: some parts of hd remix make me sad
(22:47:07) PFawkes: My favorite SF game is, of course, SUPER GEM FIGHTERS MINI MIX
(22:47:15) PFawkes: which is the best fighting game
(22:47:20) shinygerbil: the animations look all wrong, because they're so HD and yet so weird-looking

(22:48:14) PFawkes: True
(22:48:24) PFawkes: I see there is an HD remix of Super Puzzle Fighter
(22:48:29) PFawkes: that is <amazing>
(22:48:30) shinygerbil: yep
(22:48:37) PFawkes: I must own this thing :(
(22:48:38) shinygerbil: but it's not super gem fighter though :<
(22:48:41) PFawkes: and play as Dan
(22:48:59) shinygerbil: if it was super gem fighter I'd own it fo sho
(22:49:03) PFawkes: Yeah
(22:49:11) PFawkes: they should port that to something at least
(22:49:18) PFawkes: and some of the darkstalker games
(22:49:33) PFawkes: Actually, what I really want is a port of Red Earth
