A12:25:19 <Darkebrz> Taking what sort of hint about what?
A12:25:27 <PuyoDead> about shutting the hell up about it

A12:27:10 <Darkebrz> We should not be required to make a donation for a forum of a game

A12:28:01 <mail2345> if you like the fourms
A12:28:12 <Darkebrz> Lol, I donate by buying the game
A12:28:26 <UnknownX> That money goes to notch
A12:28:45 <UnknownX> Notch doesn't give citricsquid shit
A12:28:48 <Darkebrz> And Notch should not help at all in the upkeep of several key sites for minecraft?

A12:29:45 <mail2345> insightful non-sequirs
A12:29:45 <UnknownX> Citricsquid runs the forums because he knows this game will rocket up later on and notch will eventually pay him
A12:29:57 <mail2345> along with
A12:30:18 <mail2345> minecraft<x>.net
A12:30:21 <mail2345> alot of
A12:30:23 <mail2345> dammit
A12:31:11 <Darkebrz> Lol, notch has already made a fair amount of money off of this. And it barely costs him anything to develop it
A12:31:23 <mail2345> time
A12:31:26 <mail2345> alot of time
A12:31:44 <Darkebrz> 3 days a week
A12:31:58 <Darkebrz> Sure, that means he is now getting less cash from his actual job
A12:32:38 <Darkebrz> But thats not an excuse to sacrifice a fairly small amount of that money into the forums/wiki/that other site that nobody uses
A12:32:43 <UnknownX> Notch could just give citricsquid 10,000 euros near the time minecraft hits 100,000 buyers
A12:33:15 <Darkebrz> Yeah...
A12:33:23 <Darkebrz> And in the meantime citricsquid scrambles for money
A12:33:24 <UnknownX> Which may be near the end of this year
A12:33:30 <Darkebrz> Haha, I doubt it

A12:34:20 <Colain> yeah it is
A12:34:20 <Darkebrz> I mean, it is for an alpha
A12:34:28 <Darkebrz> But minecraft is pretty nice as it is
A12:34:28 <Colain> When you think about the game and how easy it is.
A12:34:36 <UnknownX> When beta comes it will probably go to 10000 within the month
A12:34:57 <|404notfound> why do you suppose?
10A12:35:05 * mai (gerard@cpe-70-95-131-103.hawaii.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
A12:35:07 <Colain> Maybe 5000, 10000 is kinda high, and don't forget the prices go up.
A12:35:40 <UnknownX> Colain that depends on how many people buy before beta

A1:33:52 <vede> And I think sand will take a bit longer to fall.
A1:34:02 <vede> And grass won't grow.
A1:34:13 <vede> It's actually beneficial for some types of maps.
A1:34:25 <Darkebrz> And water wont flow
A1:34:30 <vede> Yes it will.
A1:34:31 <Darkebrz> And the edges look glitchy
A1:34:38 <Darkebrz> It doesnt flow well
A1:34:59 <vede> The 384x384x128 desert map had flowing water and the edges weren't glitchy at all.
A1:35:22 <Darkebrz> Weird
A1:35:33 <vede> And the plants never died, so it was awesome.

A4:38:46 <JoeyJo0> Yeah, that's the only thing that's bad about private servers.
A4:39:03 <JoeyJo0> By the way, is movement calculated server- or clientside?
A4:40:38 <aera> JoeyJo0: mostly client-side
A4:42:23 <tywashere> how come when I edit my levels with omen, It ass unbreakable bricks to the sides of it?
A4:42:34 <tywashere> Ijust want the top of the level to get bigger lol
A4:45:57 <aera> tywashere: clients automatically add unbreakable bricks up to halfway up the level
A4:46:14 <tywashere> oh... D:

A4:47:37 <tywashere> Between the Giant castle, the underground houses, the ATAT's with giant ejaculating penises, I would say it is almost perfect.
A4:48:20 <aera> sounds roughly correct for an unmoderated online building game
A4:48:31 <tywashere> I moderate it =P
A4:48:47 <tywashere> People can build ANYTHING, But they cant destroy it.
A4:48:49 <aera> well, same difference
13A4:49:13 * aera is piqued by the idea of preventing any destroy commands
A4:49:17 <tywashere> griefing is a problem though... and I cant ALWAYS be there :\
A4:49:30 <aera> yeah, griefing is a general issue
A4:49:41 <tywashere> Well, I shouldnt say you CANT desktor things =P
A4:49:59 <aera> one reason my server has extra user levels, but even that doesn't prevent everything
A4:50:04 <tywashere> I mean, PEople come in and grief grief grief =(
A4:50:38 <JoeyJo0> It's all gonna be over once Notch decides Minecraft isn't free anymore.
A4:51:06 <aera> economics is a surprisingly good preventative measure
A4:51:10 <tywashere> I'm going to buy it tomorrow =)
A4:51:56 <tywashere> Will the flying cheat ever be removed?... I  like it...
A4:52:33 <aera> tywashere: same - I've never used it, but would love it to be an option in the client
A4:52:48 <aera> after all, even with survival/dungeon/whatever mode, people need to buid
A4:52:52 <tywashere> I also like the flying cheat, because It's a seperate client =P
A4:53:11 <tywashere> it should be round based man, where theres building time, then fighting time.
A4:53:37 <aera> well, Notch will be in here at some point, but the man has enough suggestions to wade through :)

A8:36:57 <Quatroking> I was so cool, I just had to forward my ports and it worked
A8:37:03 <flyboy> I think it's the fact that myrouter is using a 3g connection
A8:37:06 <Quatroking> and I still am cool in fact!
A8:37:07 <flyboy> not ips
A8:37:15 <Quatroking> nah, thats bullshit

A9:11:46 <asiekierka> 1 - fixed a drawing when screen is offset bug
A9:11:53 <asiekierka> 2 - ADDED LIQUID (water) SUPPORT
A9:12:05 <asiekierka> It works like this
A9:12:11 <asiekierka> every 10 frames it goes down
A9:12:29 <asiekierka> and it randomly goes left (25% chance), right (25% chance) or nowhere else at all (50% chance)
A9:12:33 <asiekierka> :)
A9:12:38 <aera> asiekierka: what are you writing?

A10:41:37 <ChJees> No way to fail that

A10:42:14 <ChJees> EVERY FRIKKIN GAME DO THAT
A10:42:28 <08Notch> not me =D
A10:42:31 <LKA> make it a green cross then
A10:42:41 <aera> just use a small ring pie chart thing or something :)
A10:42:53 <aera> or, make the person just walk slower and wobblier
A10:42:59 <aera> and desaturate the screen

A10:43:28 <JoeyJo0> I've tried KoL, never really sticked with it.
A10:43:32 <citricsquid> My girlfriend showed me a pregnancy test she took last night, and the result was positive. I said, "Should we keep it?" "No point" she replied, "You can only use them once."
A10:43:41 <08Notch> I was afraid the numbers in the inventory would be too intrusive, but now that they're there, they're kinda neat
A10:43:52 <JoeyJo0> lol'd
A10:43:53 <08Notch> so a health bar with numbers in it might fit
A10:44:03 <08Notch> like a bar, and "96%" in the middle
A10:44:05 <ChJees> Make numbers toggleable?
A10:44:10 <citricsquid> my current life goal is to play survival. Will the beta for paid only be multiplayer also?
A10:44:21 <08Notch> if people really don't like them and have good arguments, I'll get rid of them
A10:44:33 <JoeyJo0> Really, I am totally going to program some gamemodes :P
A10:44:35 <ChJees> pix :3?
A10:44:37 <08Notch> No, there will be free beta test of survival
A10:44:47 <08Notch> but after beta, it'll no longer be free to the same extent
A10:45:07 <08Notch> also, lol, citricsquid
A10:45:12 <ChJees> Make a huge fat sign then on the test version :P
A10:45:24 <ChJees> Saying it is no longer free after done testing

A10:46:37 <JoeyJo0> By the way, Notch, why did you write the MC server in Java? D:
A10:46:48 <ChJees> It is easy :p
A10:46:48 <08Notch> because I like java. =D
A10:46:54 <PuyoDead> dur.
A10:46:55 <JoeyJo0> I noticed.
A10:47:07 <08Notch> it's cross platform, so people can host on almost anything
A10:47:09 <JoeyJo0> All your stuff is in Java.
A10:47:11 <ChJees> heh

A10:48:13 <AlexVMiner> and alien mobs
A10:48:19 <ChJees> It would be like a multiplayer Red Faction XD
A10:48:36 <08Notch> i won't make one. There might be third party mods
A10:49:00 <JoeyJo0> I will make mods :P
A10:49:11 <ChJees> How will "player" defined models work?
A10:49:22 <ChJees> Will there be predefined "bones" to attach them to?

A10:49:44 <ChJees> :P
A10:49:50 <08Notch> I'm going to implement a few mobs "soon" (next week, probably). I'll decide something then. =)

A10:50:16 <AlexVMiner> wait, are you saying soon making skins and mobs will be like the spore creature creator?

A10:50:30 <AlexVMiner> lol

A11:14:45 <08Notch> shoot
A11:14:52 <E1025> my first idea is being able to add an message onto kicking / banning people
A11:15:05 <E1025> such as /kick bob <reason>
A11:15:40 <E1025> second is a bring command, similar to teleporting as an admin but teleporting a certain player to you
A11:15:45 <E1025> such as /bring bob
A11:15:47 <08Notch> first one, sure.
A11:15:50 <08Notch> second one, no. =D
A11:16:16 <E1025> how come?
A11:16:23 <C418> easy
A11:16:28 <C418> admins can be assholes
A11:16:38 <C418> and you don't need more asswhipping weapons
A11:16:46 <E1025> I see
A11:17:00 <citricsquid> the real reason is notch doesn't like the word bring, it sounds funny.
A11:17:02 <08Notch> actually, it's because I think people would use it to request tps from admins
A11:17:10 <C418> you ever played one of those roleplaying modes from gmod?
A11:17:30 <C418> most admins really are totally annoying
A11:17:35 <E1025> ah
A11:17:44 <C418> like, they make you into a ragdoll and play around with you. stupid
A11:17:53 <E1025> yes that is annoying
A11:17:54 <08Notch> lol
A11:18:07 <E1025> more often than not you're put into a sex position
A11:18:08 <C418> and I think something like bringing a person to you, can get equally annoying
A11:18:30 <AlexVMiner> maybe a /bring command where the person being taken away can choose yes or no or something
A11:18:34 <E1025> another thing you probably know about is hacks
A11:18:53 <E1025> I've seen a lot of people coming onto my server and noclipping / flying / running like mad
A11:18:59 <AlexVMiner> there is, like, no way to stop hax
A11:19:00 <citricsquid> AlexVMiner: that'd be silly though, I assume the point of /bring would be for griefers.
A11:19:11 <AlexVMiner> then you can just tp
A11:19:24 <AlexVMiner> bring would be for easier travel, like an admin giving a tour

P1:06:56 <utilitas> chjees:?
P1:07:08 <utilitas> AVM is now AVMan
P1:07:16 <ChJees> ?
P1:07:31 <ChJees> Also, i has to use ZomBuster's sprite :p
P1:07:39 <ChJees> And give proper credit ^_^
P1:07:55 <ChJees> For use in the demonstration app
P1:08:32 <ChJees> If i know right Pixel perfect collision is just a lot more AABB tests :P

P1:09:43 <ChJees> You  think i should implement some kind of "material" system for my collision system?
P1:09:52 <Miclee> Hey everyone.
P1:09:54 <ChJees> So you can have Ice and such
P1:09:56 <vede> Why do you need pixel-perfect collisions?
P1:09:59 <AlexVMiner> yo miclee
P1:10:09 <ChJees> vede, i don't ;Â
P1:10:12 <ChJees> ;p
P1:10:46 <vede> So why implement it? That's a lot of processing that could be used for other things.

P1:56:30 <vede> Why?
P1:56:33 <PuyoDead> which just came out this week, so pretty much no DSi's out right now will have it anyway
P1:56:34 <liq3> DRM?

P1:56:55 <vede> Ghey.
P1:56:58 <Miclee> Heh. That won't happen to my PSP.
P1:56:59 <Miclee> CFW.
P1:57:01 <liq3> Which it'll lose as always. :/
P1:57:07 <liq3> Has DRM EVER worked?
P1:57:09 <liq3> Like, just once?
P1:57:15 <vede> Sort of.
P1:57:15 <PuyoDead> Miclee, that's been happening with PSP since it came out
P1:57:27 <liq3> vede, eh?
P1:57:36 <Miclee> Except I haven't had OFW since the first month after the PSP came out.
P1:57:40 <vede> I believe Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory took over a year to crack.
P1:57:53 <liq3> ... is that because the DRM was good, or because the pirates were lazy?
P1:57:54 <liq3> :P
P1:57:54 <PuyoDead> yea, the only reason to have OFW is for games that require it
P1:58:01 <Miclee> AGAIN: D2D or Gamersgate.
P1:58:04 <vede> Dunno.
P1:58:13 <PuyoDead> but the teams break the protection before those games even really come out
P1:58:19 <liq3> Miclee: what for?
P1:58:27 <Miclee> Games.
P1:58:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> what games

P1:59:09 <TheCell> did someone played foreign legion: buckets of blood?
P1:59:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
P1:59:18 <TheCell> weekend deal from steam
P1:59:20 <PuyoDead> for now, the DSi is still using flashcarts (which themselves only run in DS mode), so unless CFW is created, it'll stay like this
P1:59:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> it looks generic
P1:59:29 <TheCell> im on place 42 in the veteran highscore
P1:59:31 <TheCell> :D
P1:59:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> what is it fun?

P2:00:15 <TheCell> ye 2 hrs i think
P2:00:24 <TheCell> i played 1.6hrs
P2:00:57 <Senidog> Hey guys, by now, the onlt thing I can do after I bought the game is changing my skin, right?
P2:01:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P2:01:12 <TheCell> for NOW
P2:01:21 <Senidog> ok
P2:01:24 <Miclee> I WANT SURVIVAL NAO! :P
P2:01:32 <fydo> i want a grape
P2:01:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> and ops won't follow you as much if you have a skin
P2:01:33 <TheCell> the game is in alpha its only the sandbox mode at moment
P2:01:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's true
P2:01:50 <TheCell> yes
P2:01:50 <fydo> Notch sound send each paying user a single grape in the mail
P2:01:53 <fydo> because I want one
P2:01:53 <TheCell> thats true
P2:01:58 <liq3> Tho, Notch said ppl who've bought it get Survival a week early <3
P2:02:03 <SMP1> you also get the password to the secret clu

P2:02:08 <Darkebrz>     So
P2:02:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> no you don't

P2:02:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm super cool
P2:02:47 <PuyoDead> vede, yea, current flashcarts run as if they are DS games
P2:02:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't remember inviting you to the mostly super coolpeopleclub
P2:02:59 <Miclee> We have to get a full survival game going once we can play it, and split up in teams.
P2:03:07 <PuyoDead> hence, they can't take advantage of the faster CPU, higher memory, cameras, etc
P2:03:10 <liq3> Miclee: Of course. :D
P2:03:15 <SMP1> its the club with the...thing right?
P2:03:18 <SMP1> with the guy?
P2:03:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> you are wrong

P2:04:35 <fydo> though, if you want to spend an extra $5, i'd TOTALLY recommend this weekend's sale

P2:04:47 <fydo> 10 indie games for $30 is awesome

P2:33:34 <SMP1> i thought you were going with Company of Heroes
P2:33:35 <vede> There's a Spring version of TA.
P2:33:46 <Miclee> I might go with CoH.
P2:33:47 <vede> But Spring is actually an RTS ENGINE if I recall correctly.
P2:34:03 <fydo> Miclee: do you like tactical RPGs?
P2:34:19 <Miclee> Depends, some.
P2:34:26 <vede> Miclee: http://springrts.com/wiki/Games
P2:34:36 <Miclee> But nothing can top Fallout Tactics in the tactical RPG genre.
P2:34:46 <SMP1> does audiosurf have multiplayer?
P2:34:58 <fydo> yeah, fallout tactics is good
P2:35:08 <Parthon> Miclee: there's Sun Age - http://www.vertex4.com/sunage/

P2:37:41 <Quatroking> are the forums and wiki back yet
P2:37:43 <TheCell> http://www.eu.darkfallonline.com/default.php
P2:37:44 <Parthon> plus, blizzard always makes lots of changes to their designs before they go live .. so while it could be true now, I'm not sure it will last through the development process :P
P2:37:46 <TheCell> have some fun guys
P2:37:50 <Miclee> What is it? I dont read german.
P2:37:53 <Parthon> eww darkfall

P2:39:16 <TheCell> miclee u have to get sacred 2
P2:39:24 <TheCell> y
P2:39:33 <TheCell> no not mid next year i think begin 
P2:39:47 <Parthon> because blizzard are never on time :P
P2:39:49 <TheCell> and they will announce somtin about the new mmorpg 
P2:39:53 <TheCell> ^^
P2:40:04 <TheCell> and maybe the sc 2 beta
P2:40:06 <TheCell> will start
P2:40:15 <Parthon> that new concept I'm intrigued by
P2:40:15 <TheCell> at blizzcon or somtime around it
P2:40:50 <TheCell> what if the new mmorpg is a shooter?
P2:40:56 <Parthon> good
P2:40:57 <TheCell> that would be kick ass

P2:56:56 <Miclee> Why do you need LAN when you have normal internet?
P2:57:03 <Darkebrz> Lan = Half the fun for me
P2:57:03 <liq3> Yes, exactlly.
P2:57:05 <vede> Yeah, it's confirmed.
P2:57:10 <vede> Cell is a troll.
P2:57:20 <Darkebrz> Ah
P2:57:21 <Darkebrz> I see
P2:57:24 <liq3> Darkebrz: You play 'lan' online, simple.
P2:57:28 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P2:57:40 <Darkebrz> So not buying the other 2 games has no negative affects
P2:57:40 <TheCell> im sorry for my bad english but i understand it but i dont think vede u cant speak german 
P2:57:41 <liq3> vede: I figured out Cell is a troll ages ago, since Cell was talking normally earlier.
P2:57:54 <Darkebrz> If I just buy the one game I get everything
P2:57:59 <TheCell> omg guys
P2:58:06 <vede> Whether or not I speak German is irrelevant here, because this channel's language is ENGLISH.
P2:58:10 <TheCell> LAN is needet for LAN PARTYS?
P2:58:19 <liq3> No it's not.
P2:58:25 <Darkebrz> LAN is not needed for LAN parties
P2:58:27 <TheCell> yes but u should respect others who learn english
P2:58:30 <TheCell> @ vede
P2:58:36 <Parthon> also, the two other campaigns for SC2 are going to have new units for use in multiplayer, much like broodwars did
P2:58:40 <fydo> the big draw of LAN parties is for low ping times. you think you can have 8+ people on a single net connection and it'll still be fast?
P2:58:48 <liq3> Parthon: are you sure? 
P2:58:51 <TheCell> it is needed if the lanparty doesnt have internet access
P2:59:05 <Parthon> liq3: it's been mentioned on the blizzard forums
P2:59:05 <Darkebrz> Parthon: I find it ridiculous that they want you to pay $150 dollars to get everything in multiplayer
P2:59:13 <liq3> Parthon: By who?
P2:59:29 <Parthon> one of the bliz reps
P2:59:33 <Darkebrz> -_-
P2:59:34 <liq3> ...kay...
P2:59:40 <Darkebrz> I am starting to hate Blizzard
P2:59:51 <vede> I always had a hatred for Blizzard, actually.
P2:59:53 <Parthon> I don't really read the boards, I just remember someone posting the link to the forums as a response to the outcry over the news on rock-paper-shotgun
P2:59:54 <Miclee> I've hated them for a looooonnnngg time.
P2:59:55 <vede> Never really knew why.

P3:00:22 <Setveen> hey guys
P3:00:25 <liq3> Yes, Blizzard are evil. doesn't change the fact they've made the best RTS ever.
P3:00:29 <Parthon> lol
P3:00:34 <TheCell> miclee get mass effect
P3:00:36 <liq3> well, to date at least. :P
P3:00:39 <Parthon> they make good games, then charge for them ...... that's evil because?
P3:00:45 <Miclee> I already have Mass Effect.
P3:00:46 <vede> WoW isn't really a good game if you ask me.
P3:00:51 <liq3> Parthon: They made WoW. WoW is morally evil.
P3:01:04 <liq3> It's evil like McDonalds is.
P3:01:08 <liq3> It takes advantage of stupid people.
P3:01:18 <Darkebrz> Parthon: Could you possibly supply a link to the multiplayer thing?
P3:01:23 <Darkebrz> Im searching for it right now...
P3:01:46 <vede> I actually don't mind taking advantage of stupid people.
P3:01:50 <liq3> Yeh, Parthon, I've heard blizz say the 2 expasnions will be single player only.
P3:02:04 <vede> I mind how fucking lucrative it is to take advantage of stupid people.
P3:02:13 <liq3> vede: what?
P3:02:25 <Darkebrz>  However, some units will now be unique to the campaigns and will not be playable in multiplayer.
P3:02:32 <vede> Taking advantage of stupid people = okay if you ask me.
P3:02:33 <Parthon> honestly .. everyone should shut the fuck up :D
P3:02:42 <Darkebrz> Parthon: What they said was that some of the units _won't_ be available online
P3:02:46 <Darkebrz> Not that they will
P3:02:56 <vede> But it pisses me off that there's so many stupid people around that taking advantage of even half of them can make you the richest dickwad on the block.
P3:02:58 <Miclee> That's because of balance and shit.

P3:03:41 <liq3> The people in power have been doing their best to make people stupid for pretty much all eternity.
P3:03:55 <vede> Yeah yeah I know that.
P3:04:02 <Parthon> from the official SC2 faq: How will the expansion sets impact multiplayer gameplay?
P3:04:03 <Parthon>     The expansion sets will add new content to each race for use in multiplayer matches. This could include additions such as new units, abilities, and structures, along with new maps and Battle.net updates.
P3:04:12 <TheCell> darkebrz just wait u cant wait it until its released

P6:13:25 <LucanC> I played it and it crashed at most, every 10 minutes, at least every 2 hours.
P6:13:31 <vede> Crash-to-desktop is prolly the most pissing-me-off thing a game can do.

P7:53:55 <Quatroking> MOVE TO THE ATTIC
P7:54:03 <Quatroking> AND BECOME A REAL STUDENT
P7:54:10 <Snowman> Like you?
P7:54:13 <Darkebrz> I ALREADY LIVE IN AN ATTIC :D
P7:54:14 <Quatroking> Yes

P7:54:24 <Darkebrz> Yep :D
P7:54:36 <Snowman> Dude, this laptop is better than some desktops I've seen
P7:54:39 <Quatroking> My definition of a real student: attics
P7:54:55 <Darkebrz> I am going to be getting another gig of ram after I start to actually care
P7:55:02 <Snowman> DO you go to VMBO?
P7:55:04 <Darkebrz> And then if I have the money, a better video card
P7:55:06 <Quatroking> snowman: that's pretty easy to say with the shitbags buying dualcore 1,6GHZ pc's with 1GB ram so they can use VISTA
P7:55:09 <tastypotato> How is living in an attic a definition of a real student? D:
P7:55:29 <Quatroking> well
P7:55:34 <Snowman> Tell me
P7:55:34 <Quatroking> erm
P7:55:44 <Quatroking> actually I sort of meant nerd.

P7:59:49 <ZomBuster> middle bears
P8:00:04 <Quatroking> snowman is saying how I appearantly suck at school because I'm on the lowest level
P8:00:05 <Darkebrz> Dutch language seems very... inconvienent
P8:00:11 <Snowman> I did not say that
P8:00:16 <Quatroking> you are.
P8:00:37 <Snowman> No, I just said you were less smart, because you did VMBO

P8:02:04 <Quatroking> let's put it like this: when you finish VMBO, you go to tertiary.
P8:02:08 <tastypotato> looks like someone was trying to figure out how to come up with a name so they slammed their fists on the keyboard till somemthing pronouncable came out.
P8:02:09 <Quatroking> thats a fact
P8:02:21 <Darkebrz> Lol
P8:02:31 <Snowman> When you finish VWO, you go University
P8:02:33 <Darkebrz> Im guessing all of the Dutch language is like that
P8:02:36 <Snowman> Or HBO
P8:02:37 <tastypotato> I hope not.
P8:02:43 <Quatroking> now, haven't you noticed yet that tertiary is ALWAYS first two years of mbo mixed up with the study you want

Het leidde tot een ramp waarin 262 mensen het leven lieten, waaronder 136 Italianen en 95 Belgen. Marcinelle ligt net ten zuiden van Charleroi.
P8:06:10 <Chrstfer> anyone here want to help rebuild zachariassmiths spleef server?
P8:06:10 <Snowman> Door deze ramp kwam er ook een verschuiving in de immigratie in Belgi√´. Door het grote aantal Italiaanse slachtoffers zegde de Italiaanse regering het immigratiecontract met Belgi√´ definitief op. De Belgische overheid moest haar arbeiders voortaan elders zoeken: in Griekenland en Spanje en later in Marokko en Turkije.

P10:02:56 <Quatroking> lying in wait
P10:03:07 <Quatroking> I can replay that if you want
P10:03:34 <Quatroking> i love it when lying in wait comes when you're just moving with your army to the enemy
P10:03:51 <Quatroking> with like, 10 apocalypse tanks rushing in
P10:04:06 <Quatroking> hell march 2 anyone?
P10:05:25 <Lmaoboat> I don't get what was up with RA3's naval focus
P10:05:54 <Quatroking> i liked it
P10:06:04 <Lmaoboat> meh

P10:09:30 <Quatroking> I love these songs with epic chords
P10:10:07 <kalanosh> RA2 the best
P10:10:18 <Quatroking> no doubt in that

P10:11:00 <AlexVMiner|MAKINGCOMIC> lol
P10:11:26 <Quatroking> too bad, I could've used another addition to the Quatroworld network
P10:11:31 <Lmaoboat> I liked the mission where you have to sabotage the nukes at the german border in RA2
P10:11:34 <AlexVMiner|MAKINGCOMIC> :D
P10:11:43 <AlexVMiner|MAKINGCOMIC> it is a 15 frame comic
P10:11:49 <Quatroking> lmaoboat: oh yes, the nukes!!
P10:11:54 <AlexVMiner|MAKINGCOMIC> making "fun" of minecraft and users
P10:11:57 <Quatroking> i loved the nuclear nukes
P10:11:59 <kalanosh> to be fair never palyed 3 tho
P10:12:14 <Lmaoboat> And if you blew up the farm fence, you got a "Bovine freed" message and got to use the cow as a scout
P10:12:53 <Lmaoboat> 5 Chrono Ivan IFV + chronosphere ? nuke
P10:13:01 <Lmaoboat> >
P10:13:06 <Lmaoboat> not ?
P10:13:08 <Quatroking> oh yes the cows
P10:13:14 <Quatroking> and the busses you could take over
P10:13:51 <Lmaoboat> And blowing up oil barrels next to monkeys
P10:13:56 <Quatroking> yes
P10:14:07 <Quatroking> don't forget stealing their technologies
P10:14:34 <Lmaoboat> If I remember, mind controlled monkeys could fling poo as an attack
P10:14:34 <Quatroking> I loved opening a crate and finding a MCV truck from an other force
P10:15:15 <Colain> Who here can back me up that Minecraft TV is my project? Chrstfr is saying that he helped create it and that he is equal to me.
P10:15:32 <Lmaoboat> I was always a turtle in that game
P10:16:01 <kalanosh> no clue
P10:16:05 <kalanosh> its all hear say here
P10:16:06 <Lmaoboat> I'd find the least accesible area of the map and build lots of walls and defenses
P10:16:27 <Lmaoboat> Then i'd slow build outward gaining footholds
P10:16:48 <kalanosh> anyone like to explain why a series of if statements wouldn't be better than switch cases? im reading about switch cases and don't understand why i would sue them over if

P11:22:12 <venn177> Conveniently my IP has been the same for over two years :D
P11:22:26 <kalanosh> if your public on minecraft you won't need static, but if your private youll need to send everyone the new link when your ip chagnes

P11:23:23 <kalanosh> so hes fine if he opens his port
P11:23:48 <Dan> Its private, not public

P11:34:04 <Dan> It could even be Eagle!
P11:34:10 <Dan> Trying to throw us off the scent!
P11:34:10 <Eagle> It could be you!
P11:34:13 <Eagle> It could be me!
P11:34:13 <Daidoji> fps engines have always used a lot of data
P11:34:15 <Daidoji> just an fyi
P11:34:17 <Eagle> It could even be-
P11:34:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> blam
13P11:34:21 * Eagle head asplode
P11:34:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> it was obvious
P11:34:34 <Dan> All it has to do is a very basic push in direction movement
P11:34:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm eagle
P11:34:40 <Eagle> AnnihilatorBeta that was perfect timing
P11:34:41 <Daidoji> I remember back when playing CS (not even the source version) and it would rack up 50mb after a few rounds easily
P11:34:47 <Daidoji> and that didn't have the silly physics
P11:35:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> that did have simple sortofish physics
P11:35:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> also gay fish
P11:36:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> precise calculations for bullets, hitboxes, grenade and projectiles etc
P11:36:04 <Daidoji> it had objects with collision detection but the objects didn't rotate
P11:36:23 <Daidoji> bullets were not physics based
P11:36:49 <Daidoji> it was a hitscan and with a random offset

P11:37:57 <Daidoji> that's irrelevent, as a whole the bullets were drawn with a line not some trajectory.

P11:38:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah blah blah blthing is minecraft doesn't have all that
P11:38:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> all it has is block addition/removal, player coordination, floods
P11:38:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> and grass
P11:38:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes, grass
P11:38:44 <Eagle> It has clouds too
P11:38:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> are clientside
P11:39:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> grass is serversiddon't you understand how important they are?
P11:39:34 <Daidoji> he should waste all that extra space with advanced grass module
P11:40:11 <Daidoji> so instead of any block overhead killing grass, it should maybe have to be less than 5 blocks to kill it
P11:40:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> snail race
P11:40:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> i bet on purple
P11:41:26 <Daidoji> actually I think he should just get rid of the grass killing in shade and base it on map height
P11:41:41 <Daidoji> like if all walls are enclosed around it, kill grass.
P11:41:45 <Daidoji> not just above
P11:41:53 <Daidoji> so caves and such wouldn't have grassy dirt caves
P11:41:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> advanced plant growth system
P11:42:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> for survival would be cool
P11:42:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> y'know, plant seeds, grow flowers and farm stuff
10P11:42:19 * Hamelin (Mibbit@c-69-246-77-185.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P11:42:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> just like harvest moon
P11:42:32 <Daidoji> well he did that with wurm fairly easily
P11:42:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> eat flowers for substinence
P11:42:44 <Daidoji> I kind of hope he kind of steals his own idea from wurm
P11:42:48 <Hamelin> hay guys, how's it hangin?
P11:42:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> eat a red flower and become an enraged rabbit monster
P11:42:50 <Daidoji> and makes trees models instead of blocks
P11:42:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what
P11:42:57 <Daidoji> in that young trees were just resized models
P11:43:06 <Daidoji> and they grew to mature in about a week of real time
P11:43:09 <Hamelin> no, no models like that, that sounds like it would look terrible
P11:43:17 <Hamelin> like how wurm looks terrible
P11:43:19 <Daidoji> no it would look fine
P11:43:28 <Daidoji> think like mario trees
P11:43:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> sprite based?
P11:43:41 <Hamelin> oh, well, maybe if they're flat like the flowers are
P11:43:42 <Daidoji> well, 3D sprite
P11:44:08 <Daidoji> http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mario64-metalgearsolid.jpg
P11:44:11 <Daidoji> the mario 64 ones
P11:44:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> hrhm
P11:44:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> how would that fit in
P11:45:04 <Daidoji> they were sprite, yet not sprite. rather they just had various sprites for certain angels
P11:45:12 <Daidoji> angles.
10P11:45:18 * AlLnAtuRalX (quassel@pool-71-125-32-74.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
P11:46:07 <Daidoji> anyway I'd rather see sprite trees than the current ones
P11:46:29 <Hamelin> I dunno, I like the current ones, they just need more variety
P11:46:34 <Hamelin> maybe a branch/leaves block
P11:47:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah, i like the current ones
P11:47:12 <Daidoji> maybe, if the game rotated them properly
P11:47:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> it could start off like a lil bush
P11:47:21 <Daidoji> but the game is minecraft, not blockland
P11:47:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> as it grows, it turns into wood
P11:47:30 <Daidoji> even though the base terrain is blocky.
P11:47:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> and gradually grows into a full sized tree
P11:47:48 <Hamelin> why should he change the style he's been going for now?
P11:48:36 <Daidoji> because for survival mode having growing trees you can chop down is a lot better than deleting 60 blocks
P11:49:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> now uh
P11:49:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't recall him giving away any details bout that yet
10P11:49:32 * mail2345 (gerard.mai@cpe-70-95-131-103.hawaii.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P11:49:36 <mail2345> hello
P11:49:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh hey mai
P11:49:41 <Hamelin> sup
P11:49:44 <mail2345> hmm
P11:49:49 <mail2345> I see teh fourms
P11:49:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're not mai? get out
P11:49:53 <mail2345> are still down
P11:51:06 <Plinky> AnnihilatorBeta: Notch talks about this stuff lots in IRC.
P11:51:20 <mail2345> i missed notch
P11:51:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> what'd he say?
P11:51:35 <mail2345> damm parentls picking me up at like 7
P11:52:11 <Daidoji> notch stated a long time ago that survival mode would be ~similar~ to wurm in terms of gathering crap and crafting, and running from BEARS but it would be way faster and less tedious
P11:52:21 <Darkebrz> mail2345: I have a final request for my server
P11:52:29 <Darkebrz> Change it to "Darke's Flatgrass"
P11:52:42 <Darkebrz> I seem to have a strong wanting to run a flatgrass
P11:52:58 <Hamelin> I hope so, wurm is slow and uninteresting
P11:53:10 <mail2345> hmm
P11:53:16 <mail2345> have a map in mind
P11:53:21 <Daidoji> honestly I only got into wurm because of the digging
P11:53:24 <Darkebrz> Ah, yes
P11:53:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> wurm is interesting in many aspects but i just couldn't waste all my day leveling
P11:53:29 <Darkebrz> I need to find a flatgrass map...
P11:53:37 <mail2345> or do you want me to make one?
P11:53:46 <Daidoji> the crafting was pretty detailed and neat, but holy HELL did it take forever to make anything.
P11:54:02 <Daidoji> also failing was hilarious
P11:54:05 <Darkebrz> Well, it would probably be easier for you to make one than for me to upload one, no?
P11:54:08 <Hamelin> complex levelling is tedious. normal levelling is tedious too, but having to level a bunch of mundane crap is stupid and boring
P11:54:12 <mail2345> yea
P11:54:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> i hope survival is a mix breed of wurm and stranded
P11:54:21 <Daidoji> in the early days for example you could spend a few hours just making a cart so you can haul ore and such
P11:54:21 <mail2345> just say water or no water
P11:54:45 <Daidoji> like you'd chop down trees to make planks, and mine iron to make nails and wheel axles
P11:55:20 <Daidoji> so you'd make your two wheels and what not, attach a wheel to the axle, hey this is cool! and then you'd go to attach the second wheel. FAILURE. and then you'd have to make all three items again.
P11:55:26 <Darkebrz> Water
P11:55:27 <Daidoji> of course they did change that to just damaging the items.
P11:55:30 <mail2345> cool
P11:55:32 <mail2345> okay
P11:55:32 <Darkebrz> Erm
P11:55:34 <mail2345> lava?
P11:55:36 <Hamelin> I always enjoyed Schiffbruch. It was all time based, of course, that game wasn't terribly complex
P11:55:37 <Darkebrz> Sheild around the water
P11:55:41 <mail2345> and minerals?
P11:55:50 <Darkebrz> No lava, no minerals I guess
P11:56:00 <mail2345> no underground liquids?
P11:56:22 <Darkebrz> Er, no
P11:56:27 <mail2345> okay.
P11:56:30 <mail2345> finalquestion
P11:56:35 <mail2345> do you want a flood box?
P11:56:43 <Darkebrz> No
P11:56:48 <mail2345> mkay
P11:56:53 <Darkebrz> Damn, what the hell...
