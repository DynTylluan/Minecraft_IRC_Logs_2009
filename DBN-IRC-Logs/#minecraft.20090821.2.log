10P5:32:09 * Now talking in #minecraft
10P5:32:09 * Topic is 'http://www.minecraft.net/  |  Keep it clean, keep it nice. Spamming nonsense can go in another channel.  |  Forums are down; back soon. | Survival beta sept 1st. http://tr.im/survivalbeta | 50,000 registred players, yay!'

P5:32:12 <Griskard> You know how when you destroy items you get stuff to build more blocks. Would it be possible to make a non mineable one? For say, money?
P5:32:16 <citricsquid> before I spoke to Notch, I was a nice person, now I beat up women and punch kids.
P5:32:21 <08Notch> vede: I forgot about that, so I've only got like two archived versions
P5:32:27 <ChJees> lol citric
P5:32:30 <08Notch> dunno which version numbers, but around that time
12P5:32:32 * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P5:32:33 <Snowman2> Citricsquid, there's nothing wrong with that
P5:32:33 <Eagle> Before I spoke to Notch, I was a cockroach
P5:32:37 <Miclee> Notch: Will we get viking helmets and be able to raid towns and rape women?
P5:32:38 <vede> The island-in-the-sky thing was cool, and the level generator was way better than it is now.
10P5:32:39 * Snowman2 is now known as Snowman
P5:32:39 <Quatroking> hey Notch, how about meeting up in Rotterdam tomorrow and drink a beer, maybe watch a movie over at my place
P5:32:41 <fydo> now you are a NotchRoach?
P5:32:45 <08Notch> Miclee: No. =D
P5:32:49 <Miclee> Awwwww. :P
P5:32:51 <Eagle> Now I'm a human.
P5:32:52 <Quatroking> I've got 7.1 audio! **winks**
P5:33:00 <Snowman> I've got... a headset
P5:33:00 <Eagle> I kinda liked being a cockroach better though...
P5:33:01 <Eagle> :/
P5:33:02 <Griskard> Before I spoke to Notch, I was awesome, now I have gone up a level
P5:33:04 <Griskard> Now Im German
P5:33:05 <08Notch> Quatroking: Sounds expensive.
P5:33:09 <08Notch> lol
P5:33:12 <Quatroking> literally
P5:33:12 <fydo> 7.1 Surround Sound support!
P5:33:15 <Quatroking> and figurally
P5:33:18 <darkparadox> why are you all harassing Notch D:
P5:33:25 <Snowman> Cause we like it :D
P5:33:27 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch! Watch the movie "The Man from Earth" You will like it!
P5:33:30 <Eagle> Why not?
P5:33:33 <Griskard> Notch: You know how when you destroy items you get stuff to build more blocks. Would it be possible to make a non mineable one? For say, money?
P5:33:35 <Miclee> Since we already asked all the serious questions.
P5:33:49 <Evil-Ville> Why is this channel filled with sycophantic creeps? Serious question
P5:33:59 <Snowman> Notch, what is your opinion on Obama's healthcare plans?
P5:34:01 <Eagle> Notch: If food restores HP, how much? 20 HP sounds like a lot of health.
P5:34:03 <Miclee> Notch, in survival multiplayer, will we be able to trade with other "tribes"?
P5:34:10 <08Notch> fleshBasedProcessor: I will try. You should watch The Wrestler.
12P5:34:20 * Bossman (Bossman-DJ@216.119.27.20) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P5:34:21 <Quatroking> Ch ch ch chip and Dales  Rescue rangers
10P5:34:27 * Bossman (Bossman-DJ@216.119.27.20) has joined #minecraft
P5:34:27 <08Notch> Griskard: Non-minable blocks? or items?
P5:34:35 <08Notch> Snowman: I don't know what they are.
P5:34:35 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch, if netflix has it on demand I will!
P5:34:42 <Snowman> ...
P5:34:46 <Griskard> The items. You know those little things on the ground you pick up?
P5:34:56 <08Notch> Eagle: Probably quite a lot. You won't be able to stack food in the inventory, so each food item takes up an entire slot
P5:34:56 <Griskard> And go in your inventory to allow you to build them again?
P5:34:58 <Eagle> Snowman he isn't American. Just to let you know in case you forgot.
P5:35:13 <08Notch> Miclee: No, not planned.
P5:35:13 <Eagle> 20 HP is still a lot
P5:35:16 <Snowman> I know, but he can still watch international news :D
P5:35:18 <Miclee> Dang.
P5:35:19 <Griskard> Although that brings the problem of trading "Blocks" from one char to another
P5:35:27 <Eagle> You could fall of a deadly cliff three times and still be alive
P5:35:31 <08Notch> Griskard: There are items that don't produce blocks
P5:35:45 <Miclee> Will we have some kind of parry/block system with swords?
10P5:35:52 * Bossman-DJ (Bossman-DJ@216.119.27.20) has joined #minecraft
P5:36:04 <Griskard> Thats one more thing, Do you plan on having some sort of "Trading" system. 
P5:36:06 <fleshBasedProcessor> I don't want any official money/trading system. Stealing and devising fair trading systems is half the fun!
P5:36:10 <08Notch> Eagle: I could increase falling damage if it's too low.
12P5:36:13 * Bossman (Bossman-DJ@216.119.27.20) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P5:36:13 <Eagle> Notch will we be able to get more Heart Containers? (:P)
P5:36:15 <Miclee> Griskard, I just asked him that.
P5:36:22 <Miclee> He said Not planned.
P5:36:27 <Griskard> Ahh Ok
P5:36:32 <08Notch> Griskard: I've played with the idea, but decided to scrap it.
P5:36:37 <08Notch> in the far future, maybe.
P5:36:46 <Eagle> Notch also, will there be options like Easy Mode, Normal Mode, and Hard Mode?
P5:36:47 <08Notch> Eagle: I have no idea what you're referring to. ;)
P5:36:58 <Eagle> Hard Mode having several instant deaths.
P5:36:59 <08Notch> Eagle: More like Hard Mode, Impossible Mode and European Extreme
P5:37:03 <pimpmasta> Notch: I am starting to think you have a gay crush on me.
P5:37:03 <Eagle> I like instant deaths.
P5:37:17 <Miclee> Will we have some kind of parry/block system with swords?
P5:37:18 <08Notch> pimpmasta: If I was going to go gay for anyone, it'd be for brad pitt.
P5:37:21 <Morgranth> What about the ppl who jsut liek to build stuff ? 
10P5:37:21 * LucanC_ (IceChat7@86-42-228-34-dynamic.b-ras1.cld.dublin.eircom.net) has left #minecraft
P5:37:23 <Super-Dot> I could never be as extreme as a European
P5:37:24 <Griskard> So, when I build a block again, and then destroy it, I dont get any Block builders back, do I? If not, will there be an option to turn it on so I can build and destroy and get my block back
P5:37:24 <Eagle> Is lava an instant death, Notch?
P5:37:33 <08Notch> Eagle: No, but almost. =)
P5:37:37 <ChJees> I heard Japanese Hard Mode was Easy mode in Europe
P5:37:38 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch I really think you should make trading compleatly player controlled. Knowing the other guy might rip you off is half the fun.
P5:37:39 <Eagle> :O
P5:37:43 <pimpmasta> Notch: Who is this "Brad Pitt" Of which you speak?
P5:37:49 <Eagle> Gooogle
P5:38:09 <08Notch> Griskard: Most blocks will give you resources to build the same block
10P5:38:15 * princepsregulus (princepsre@70.239.9.126) has joined #minecraft
P5:38:16 <Eagle> Notch: Will we be able to increase our maximum health?
P5:38:20 <Evil-Ville> Do leaf blocks still give you resources
P5:38:23 <Evil-Ville> Because they shouldn't
P5:38:26 <Griskard> Even If Its a block I just build?
P5:38:28 <08Notch> Eagle: No. But you will be able to wear armor.
P5:38:34 <Eagle> I see.
P5:38:34 <Miclee> Will we have some kind of parry/block system with swords?
P5:38:39 <Griskard> built*
P5:38:39 <citricsquid> can we have penis armor?
P5:38:41 <08Notch> Evil-Ville: They do, but they won't later on.
P5:38:48 <Eagle> Citric that's called a codpiece
P5:38:50 <pimpmasta> Okay, Notch A serious question... exactly how "Rare" Will  ore be?
P5:38:56 <Evil-Ville> Oh good
P5:38:57 <08Notch> Miclee: No, sorry
P5:38:57 <citricsquid> Eagle: I meant armor that looks like a penis.
12P5:39:00 * Bossman-DJ (Bossman-DJ@216.119.27.20) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P5:39:02 <Eagle> Oh
P5:39:05 <Miclee> Dang.
P5:39:07 <Eagle> That's less awesome.
P5:39:09 <08Notch> pimpmasta: Same as now
P5:39:15 <pimpmasta> Okay...
P5:39:23 <08Notch> citricsquid: Wait, your penis doesn't look like armor?
P5:39:26 <Miclee> I need to think of questions.
P5:39:28 <Super-Dot> Notch: Will there ever be metal?
10P5:39:32 * KatMan (Mibbit@ip98-179-180-215.ri.ri.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
P5:39:33 <08Notch> yes, Super-Dot.
12P5:39:37 * osici (osici@stav225.univ.ox.ac.uk) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P5:39:38 <Super-Dot> Oh boy :D
P5:39:42 <KatMan> Yes to what?
P5:39:43 <Miclee> Super, what do you think ore will do?
P5:39:44 <Griskard> Will I get resources back from a block I just built? Notch?
P5:39:45 <citricsquid> Notch: http://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/tentacle-arm.jpg It's basically that
P5:39:47 <citricsquid> but a bit longer
P5:39:57 <08Notch> Griskard: Yes, if you destroy it.
P5:40:03 <Eagle> Notch: In order to make armor, do we just have the option? Or do we have to make some crafting station first?
P5:40:14 <Miclee> Anvils!!
P5:40:19 <Miclee> And hammers!
P5:40:24 <Super-Dot> Oh right, armor means metal
P5:40:28 <Super-Dot> And ore
P5:40:31 <08Notch> Eagle: I don't know yet. 
P5:40:38 <Snowman> My penis is like this http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Penis_from_snow.jpg
P5:40:48 <Testvan> very white
P5:40:48 <KatMan> You buy armor from a store in the map, of course!
P5:40:52 <Eagle> Also will we be able to make buildings like craftstations and anvils and farms and kitchens etc, like in DF?
P5:40:55 <Eagle> Notch?
P5:40:59 <fleshBasedProcessor> Building a golden castle will be the most epic thing ever in survival. Building a massive golden castle and then luring in and fighting the final boss in your thrown room will make you a god.
P5:41:02 <08Notch> hopefully, yes
P5:41:09 <fleshBasedProcessor> *throne
P5:41:14 <Eagle> Cool.
P5:41:16 <Griskard> Awesome
12P5:41:17 * princepsregulus (princepsre@70.239.9.126) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P5:41:17 <Miclee> Eventually someone will make a "DF" mode.
P5:41:24 <Griskard> My RPG server is looking better and better!
P5:41:28 <citricsquid> Notch: Will we be able to push things, like, will we have a hitbox so people can't work through us anymore?
P5:41:28 <Miclee> WHERE??
P5:41:32 <Griskard> Now I just need people who can mod
P5:41:35 <Miclee> Where is the RPG server?
P5:41:40 <KatMan> Notch: Maybe instead of building armor, you buy it from a store on the map?
P5:41:41 <Griskard> Erm. Im making one
P5:41:43 <Eagle> Notch: Friendly fire?
P5:41:47 <08Notch> citricsquid: Well, standing inside another mob will push you both away from each other
P5:41:48 <Miclee> I might be able to mod.
P5:41:51 <Griskard> Once I can get some people who are willing to mod a bit.
P5:41:55 <Griskard> I dont really have the time
P5:41:58 <08Notch> so you can walk through people, and you can push people off cliffs
P5:42:00 <fleshBasedProcessor> I plan on making a survival extra hard mode where you have to eat and drink to survive and some other things are harder/more realistic
P5:42:05 <Griskard> But I have money, lots of money for big uber server
P5:42:06 <Eagle> XD
P5:42:06 <08Notch> Eagle: On by default.

P5:42:42 <Eagle> (DF reference)
P5:43:00 <08Notch> Eagle: No kittens, they're too dangerous
P5:43:06 <Super-Dot> Will there be cow tipping?
P5:43:06 <Eagle> Carp?
P5:43:07 <pimpmasta> Inorite?

P5:44:00 <Eagle> Aw.
P5:44:04 <Super-Dot> Elephants would be sweet :O
P5:44:05 <Eagle> :/
P5:44:08 <citricsquid> Notch: No water animals?!
P5:44:10 <pimpmasta> Maybe, you could make cats a monster, In survival.
P5:44:11 <Miclee> WHAT?
P5:44:16 <Miclee> WHAT WILL WATER BE OOD FOR?
P5:44:18 <Miclee> GOOD*
P5:44:21 <KatMan> Make horses that you can ride on!
P5:44:22 <pimpmasta> Only On extra hard though,
P5:44:25 <citricsquid> Miclee: not squids, that's for sure!
P5:44:25 <08Notch> irrigation. :D
13P5:44:26 * citricsquid cries
P5:44:28 <Eagle> Elephants would be a bit startling to see in a forest setting like minecraft
P5:44:34 <Super-Dot> Plumbing
P5:44:40 <fleshBasedProcessor> we get horse animations when wurm gets horse animations :P
P5:44:44 <Griskard> Drowning stuff
P5:45:01 <Super-Dot> Charlie the Unicorn-style horse animation
P5:45:04 <Quatroking> Notch: that 3D-glasses thingie, will it be implented on 1 september?
P5:45:17 <fleshBasedProcessor> oh yeah, make that an option.
P5:45:24 <08Notch> it requires a startup parameter, you can't change it in the game yet
P5:45:27 <Eagle> Notch: Will beta testers get a special prize?
P5:45:30 <Eagle> :D
P5:45:31 <pimpmasta> super-dot: For the love of god(notch) NO!
P5:45:32 <Miclee> :D
P5:45:36 <08Notch> (it has to rebuild all textures, and I don't have that code yet)
P5:45:40 <Super-Dot> :D
P5:45:43 <08Notch> Eagle: You already got a special price. :D
P5:45:46 <Quatroking> So..

P5:45:48 <Eagle> :O
P5:45:52 <Griskard> Hey Notch, What about sharks and turtles?
P5:45:53 <Eagle> I just remembered tha
P5:45:55 <Eagle> *that
P5:45:57 <Quatroking> if you would put it online seperatly, would it run?
P5:46:14 <Quatroking> so you would choose between 3d glasses yes/no before starting the client
P5:46:25 <08Notch> Quatroking: Yes, or perhaps if you added &3dmode=true to the url or something 
P5:46:30 <Miclee> Notch, can we have a rundown of the things in the Survival Beta?
P5:46:32 <KatMan> Notch: Bear traps?
P5:46:35 <Quatroking> Please, PLEASE do so!
P5:46:37 <citricsquid> &trippyshit=true
P5:46:52 <fleshBasedProcessor> even if it was just a small thing that only worked on singleplayer creative, I would still play it
P5:47:00 <Super-Dot> &catsposions=true
P5:47:12 <08Notch> Miclee: Health, food, enemies, resources. Maybe crafting.
P5:47:15 <Eagle> Notch: Will you make it so mushrooms can grow in caves? D:
P5:47:17 <Quatroking> I'm buying 3D glasses soon and I'd love to be able to do this
P5:47:18 <citricsquid> &squids=true. needs squids. squids that grab you from the water and pull you in.
P5:47:20 <Miclee> Cool.

P5:47:26 <pimpmasta> notch: How come I never see you online... EVER I mean it is your game...
P5:47:28 <08Notch> Eagle: Yes, but not for this version
P5:47:29 <mail2345> Miclee it will be easy
P5:47:29 <KatMan> Notch, maybe you could have bear traps that players could set?
P5:47:33 <mail2345> to do in Lua
P5:47:41 <ChJees> pimpmasta, Swedish time LOLZ
P5:47:43 <08Notch> pimpmasta: I've been in single player only for quite some time now, in survival mode
P5:47:46 <Super-Dot> citricsquid fell in love with the majesty of colors

P5:47:59 <pimpmasta> Mkay...
P5:48:01 <08Notch> Eagle: I'd like that, yes. =)
P5:48:08 <ChJees> GMT +1 FYI
P5:48:11 <Griskard> Squid would be awesomely cool
P5:48:15 <vede> Why have you not made mushrooms darkness-resistant yet, Notch?
P5:48:24 <Eagle> Notch: Also, can you pick mushrooms already on the ground?
P5:48:25 <vede> I told you about this a long time ago.
P5:48:27 <Griskard> Hmm. I reckon a piece of armour that acts like scuba gear would be awesome
P5:48:29 <08Notch> because I've been focusing on other things, and it's a trivial fix.
P5:48:29 <Eagle> For trippy side effects and stuff
P5:48:31 <fleshBasedProcessor> oh god, I want to play survival so bad.
P5:48:36 <08Notch> trivial fixes never get done until the last minute, hehe
P5:48:42 <vede>  -_-
P5:48:49 <Miclee> I'm sitting here, bored, wanting to play survival so badly.
P5:48:53 <Eagle> That describes vista! :O
P5:48:56 <08Notch> lol
P5:48:57 <Griskard> Masturbate
P5:48:59 <Miclee> 11 days!
P5:49:01 <Griskard> Then do it again
P5:49:03 <Griskard> and again
P5:49:06 <Griskard> Untill you collapse
P5:49:07 <KatMan> Notch, what kind of mining tools are we gonna have?
13P5:49:10 * Super-Dot trivially fixes vede a mug of hot chocolate
P5:49:13 <Griskard> And sleep until survival
P5:49:16 <vede>  :o
P5:49:23 <Miclee> I shall hibernate!
13P5:49:26 * vede drinks the hot chocolate.
P5:49:27 <vede> YUMMM
P5:49:33 <08Notch> KatMan: Bare hands
P5:49:38 <Eagle> Notch: What if you don't finish by Sept. 1st?
P5:49:43 <ChJees> A hibernation device would be nice :P
P5:49:47 <ChJees> cold sleep
P5:49:47 <08Notch> Eagle: I'll release whatever I have on sept 1.
P5:49:57 <Eagle> Hm.
P5:50:01 <KatMan> @Notch, awww... I wanted a particle destroyer...
P5:50:02 <vede> Notch, just because I'm interested, how do you save signs in the map file?
P5:50:07 <fleshBasedProcessor> I go to college tomorrow, that *might* keep my mind of minecraft
P5:50:19 <Quatroking> Notch: so will you PLEAAAAAASE put the 3D glasses client online for us to try?
P5:50:20 <Eagle> fleshBasedProcessor nice
P5:50:26 <vede> They can't be stored like normal blocks, so I figure they must be special somehow.
P5:50:32 <08Notch> Quatroking: No, not yet. September 1. =)
P5:50:40 <Miclee> I know programs that make anything 3D.
P5:50:41 <08Notch> vede: Indeed, they're objects. =)
P5:50:44 <Quatroking> Yeah, on september 1 I mean
P5:50:45 <Snowman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMjTzc_QMwc
P5:50:45 <Miclee> Left 4 Dead in 3d is crazy.
P5:50:49 <vede> What do you mean?
P5:50:50 <fleshBasedProcessor> Why not :( </pout>
P5:50:58 <Quatroking> Notch: wait, is it actually compatible with multiplayer?
P5:51:06 <08Notch> 3d? yes.

P5:51:39 <Griskard> Heres one notch, Would it be feasable to make movable vehicles?
P5:51:46 <KatMan> So, how do you put things on signs?
P5:51:48 <08Notch> I will change it to a new file format in the future, the current one is too unstable.
P5:51:50 <Eagle> Notch: Switches?
P5:51:53 <08Notch> Griskard: Not yet.
P5:51:57 <08Notch> Eagle: With the expansion. =)
P5:51:57 <Eagle> Switches/levers?
P5:52:00 <Eagle> Oh right
P5:52:04 <Eagle> Heh.
P5:52:09 <08Notch> Dungeons and Levers! It's right there, in the name!
P5:52:15 <Eagle> I forgot! D:
P5:52:22 <08Notch> hehe
P5:52:27 <Miclee> Survival in a dungeon!
P5:52:28 <Miclee> :D
P5:52:29 <KatMan> Notch: 2.5d mode, perhaps?
P5:52:29 <Miclee> :P
P5:52:37 <vede> Custom enemies, yes? No?
P5:52:38 <08Notch> lol, what?
P5:52:44 <Miclee> 2.5d?
P5:52:48 <08Notch> no custom models, but custom behavior, sure
P5:52:49 <Griskard> So you mean not yet in the "Its far to much and unimportant for me to put in" or the "The drain on resources would be huge"?
P5:52:57 <Griskard> At Notch ^
P5:53:00 <vede> Enemy textures?
P5:53:12 <Morgranth> notch will there be a way to classeffy waht u build a vehicle, so that u can use it to travel aroudn the map ?
P5:53:12 <vede> That seems like something you should REALLY implement.
P5:53:17 <Super-Dot> Player textures?
P5:53:18 <Eagle> Notch: With a map editor, can't people just make a room with everything they'll ever need and close it off from the enemies?
P5:53:20 <vede> Even if you don't want block textures.
P5:53:21 <08Notch> Griskard: It's not in my plans, and I don't want to add too much extra features. It's possible it might make an interesting expansion. =)
P5:53:24 <Eagle> Also can't they make impossible maps?
P5:53:31 <Daroh> Out of curiosity, will maps be transferrable across modes of play?
P5:53:31 <Miclee> Eagle, they can dig!!
P5:53:37 <Super-Dot> Enemy and player textures do seem like a bit of a must
P5:53:39 <Miclee> I think.
P5:53:47 <KatMan> Notch: RACETRACK EXPANSION?
P5:53:55 <08Notch> Daroh: Yes, but I'm not sure what to do about mobs
P5:53:55 <Miclee> With zombie!
P5:53:57 <Eagle> Enemies can dig?
P5:54:01 <vede> Notch: Question
P5:54:05 <fleshBasedProcessor> Morganth, if your going to ask a stupid question at least use proper grammar and spelling
P5:54:06 <vede> Question?
P5:54:09 <08Notch> I could just remove all mobs and items when in survival mode
P5:54:22 <Daroh> sounds reasonable
P5:54:24 <08Notch> no custom textures, vede.
P5:54:31 <Eagle> XD

P5:54:43 <Eagle> Shush vede.
P5:54:43 <08Notch> yes, you've mentioned that.
P5:55:02 <citricsquid> vede: If I had a custom texture for everytime you said that, I'd have lots of custom textures. 
P5:55:09 <08Notch> lol
P5:55:09 <Miclee> Anyone else think Blizzard is just milking WoW now?
P5:55:11 <Eagle> Notch: Leaves are a lame resource
P5:55:15 <Daroh> Would the player be able to re-add any items that are lost manually? I ask due to wanting to create specific scenarios and/or dungeons
P5:55:16 <KatMan> Notch: Sorry to ask again, but what do you think of making a racetrack mode?
P5:55:19 <Eagle> What can you make with leaves?
P5:55:20 <vede> So we can't even make our own monsters as an extension of existing monsters?
P5:55:26 <08Notch> KatMan: I think that's best left to a mod.

P5:56:20 <Eagle> Swarming around you?
P5:56:23 <Miclee> Hmmm... Notch: Could each person set a custom skin for mobs? When the server is spawning mobs, it randomly picks from the available?
P5:56:40 <08Notch> :-o
P5:56:42 <Eagle> Notch: Do enemies just spawn wherever?
P5:56:46 <vede> If you're going to have parts of the game like this so restricted from customization, you should at least supply a good amount of things as a base.
P5:56:49 <Super-Dot> Notch: Mob scaling by powers of two, or by anything?
P5:56:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> Lets try to focus on singleplayer for a while. Multiplayer is after The Boat

P5:57:20 <Eagle> Notch: Like if you built a house couldn't a zombie spawn in your basement or something? (>:D) D:
P5:57:24 <Eagle> Oh
P5:57:29 <Miclee> Notch: Could each person set a custom skin for mobs? When the server is spawning mobs, it randomly picks from the available?
P5:57:30 <08Notch> it could, yes =D

P5:58:20 <vede> Yes.
P5:58:21 <Peerko> YES

P5:58:36 <Super-Dot> Touch fuzzy, get dizzy
P5:58:40 <citricsquid> It'd be cool if everything started morphing slightly :D
P5:58:42 <Peerko> shrooms are ok, mmmkay?
P5:58:46 <08Notch> Super-Dot: Ok, we're going to need a run-up for that
P5:58:58 <vede> I played a roguelike that handled drugs amazingly well for a roguelike once.
P5:59:12 <vede> I suggest that if you get really high, objects start to look like other objects.
P5:59:17 <Daroh> i'd rather you leave only specific types of fungus did that, you need to eat while in caves too after all :P
P5:59:21 <Super-Dot> o\               /o
P5:59:23 <vede> So fellow players could appear to be dragons or pigs.

P6:03:10 <08Notch> mail2345: Well, for example by reversing time. All physical interactions are time agnostic
P6:03:11 <citricsquid> proper flying/noclip would just make them concentrate on other things.
P6:03:24 <vede> How did TF2 do model changing, and how did it suck?
P6:03:36 <fleshBasedProcessor> I don't actually like flying or no-clip, but the less stuff you leave to the hackers the less destructive hacking there is. Only a theory
P6:03:39 <mail2345> aww, you should have anwered "THERE IS YET INSUFFICENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER"
P6:03:54 <08Notch> Oh yeah!! Sorry, I forgot that (very awesome) short story!

P6:12:16 <Miclee> Griskard, what kind of mod should I make for it?

P6:12:28 <Griskard> Dunno. I like Custom Settlements myself
P6:12:34 <pimpmasta> Looking for something.
P6:12:37 <08Notch> I could add sprinting and make it infinite in creative
P6:12:42 <Miclee> What kind of mod would you want?
P6:12:48 <Daroh> sounds fair
P6:12:55 <LucanC> Notch, if you implement sprinting, you should make it infinite in sandbox mode
P6:12:55 <Griskard> Eh. Im a bit over it atm. So I dunno
P6:12:56 <Veronika> If you do, please make it a toggle (Capslock?)

P6:13:31 <Griskard> Hey Notch. Will there be the ability to add AI that people can use. Like bodyguards, guards, challenges and so on
P6:13:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> Veronika, becouse we want everyone yelling "SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS I'M SPRINTING RIGHT NOW"

13P6:14:20 * fleshBasedProcessor traps skeletons in pits and tries to make them breed
P6:14:23 <08Notch> the mobs and creatures will be very old-school predictable
P6:14:35 <08Notch> difficult because they cheat (like in good old games), not because they're clever
P6:14:38 <Griskard> But we could mod it to make it smarter, right?
P6:14:41 <08Notch> yes
P6:15:14 <Griskard> Ok. Just that I think on an RPG server, if clans want their own bases and such they will probably need NPC guards
P6:15:26 <LG_Legacy> Modding enemies to speak while attacking..
P6:15:36 <pimpmasta> Ah yes.
P6:15:36 <LG_Legacy> Why do i sense some twisted Final Fantasy playing type?
P6:15:38 <citricsquid> LG_Legacy: "ow that hurt, stop it!"
P6:15:50 <Griskard> Just a blood curdling super scream. So that people crap themselves
P6:15:56 <LG_Legacy> Heh
P6:16:00 <citricsquid> Someone will mod swords to penises and make sex talk come from the skeletons if we have custom textures.
P6:16:17 <LG_Legacy> Notch, you should add a ghoul/twisted monster that screams when it tries to get you, or  when it dies.
P6:16:22 <pimpmasta> You must make zombies scream "ARRRRRGGGHHH"
P6:16:32 <Griskard> Id be happy with sharks, turtles and squid, first
P6:16:36 <Griskard> Especially squid
