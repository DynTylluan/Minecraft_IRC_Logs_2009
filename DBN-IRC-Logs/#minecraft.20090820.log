A2:43:56 <tarkata14> yeah.
A2:44:27 <Daidoji> as in like..man I don't even know. even a standard map will run out of memory if there's too many blocks
A2:44:27 <tarkata14> I've made a map that's 1204x1204x512, but it was over 2MB, and wouldn't work on any server.

A6:02:03 <prakCurie> What is going on with the forums?
A6:02:12 <FlyZ> They are temp. down.
A6:02:56 <prakCurie> Right, I got that much.  It seems like rather longer than what is normally accepted for temp.
A6:03:22 <prakCurie> Unless I've just gotten very unlucky with the times I have checked.
A6:03:40 <FlyZ> Well, I don't know what's going on. :;
A6:03:42 <FlyZ> :l
A6:05:36 <iPope> Its very simple, citric ran out of money and can't pay afford the server
A6:05:39 <citricsquid> I rent a server, this server costs me $150/month, every month I pay for this server and I run the forum, wiki, skins site and numerous sites of my own. I make websites for people and get paid for it, I made a website and the person paying for it is taking ages to pay, so I ran out of money so I couldn't pay my $150/m bill, so the server went offline.
A6:05:40 <citricsquid> I am waiting to be paid, I am supposedly getting paid this weekend, but I have no guarantees I will. That explain it?
A6:05:41 <iPope> Unless thats what I thought
A6:06:16 <prakCurie> That does it for me.  Thank you.
A6:06:54 <iPope> citric you should just get an automated message that every time someone says forum and down in the same sentance it explains
A6:07:01 <iPope> Only problem is it would flood the chatroom
A6:07:01 <citricsquid> If they're not back - or the process of coming back - for monday, I'm going to take someone up on the offer of hosting them for me (assuming one of the people who offered is still interested.)
A6:07:53 <iPope> citric how many mods do we have on the forums?
A6:07:55 <prakCurie> Or add it to the Minecraft website.
A6:08:31 <citricsquid> iPope: uh, zuriki (no idea what happened to him though, disappeared, maybe holiday), puyo, ez, me and wolfram. I think.
A6:09:14 <Peerko> Zuriki was in here earlier
A6:09:20 <Peerko> or was that a fake?
A6:09:22 <prakCurie> I, at least, would have been able to find out that way

A6:11:25 <Griskard> Or froze and wasnt unfroze after 25 mins
A6:11:28 <citricsquid> I don't think it can do above 512
A6:11:37 <iPope> Citric: why are the forums down? why are the forums down? why are the forums down? why are the forums down?
A6:11:40 <citricsquid> I know most servers can't handle greater than 512 anyway, because of Ram.

A6:12:51 <FlyZ> citric, i use to play your server, made a huggggge castle the size of half the map once, got griefed :(
A6:12:51 <iPope> so 4096x4096
A6:13:13 <Griskard> That was citric
A6:13:18 <Griskard> He didnt like it
A6:13:25 <Griskard> And he went Rage-Squid on it
A6:13:47 <FlyZ> eh?
A6:14:06 <Peerko> I think maps should have dimensions a multiple of 16 too
A6:14:15 <Peerko> because the client makes displaylists
A6:14:42 <Peerko> or, did anyone try 20x20x20 or something like that?
A6:15:20 <prakCurie> Is $150 just the cost of running the Minecraft forums or is a reasonable amount of that unrelated projects you have bundled with your host?
A6:15:48 <Peerko> it's also for running his pr0n and warez sites
A6:16:22 <Griskard> Yeah, He owns piratebay
A6:16:24 <iPope> Yeh they've got great download speeds
A6:16:26 <Griskard> and Ebay
A6:16:30 <prakCurie> Cool.  I've always imaged those would be a great deal more expensive to run.

A7:02:15 <PuyoDead> 99% of the time, they are far worse than the original
A7:02:18 <vede> That happens already, Notch.

A7:02:29 <08Notch> with blocks, yes
A7:02:35 <vede> PuyoDead, 99% of the time, ALL mods are worse than the original game.
A7:02:41 <08Notch> if every block was a huge thurgid penis, it'd look very bad.
A7:02:43 <vede> So should we also not allow mods?
A7:02:47 <PuyoDead> you play some terrible games, then
A7:03:05 <Snowman> WTF
A7:03:06 <vede> That doesn't mean that the majority of mods suck.
A7:03:07 <08Notch> not that penises aren't pretty. They just don't stack well.
A7:03:12 <PuyoDead> hah
A7:03:24 <08Notch> that's why you keep them in cans
A7:03:30 <08Notch> wait.. I should stop talking now
A7:03:39 <Snowman> Refueling is gonna be prohibited next F1 season
A7:03:39 <08Notch> how long should you be able to swim under water before losing health?
A7:03:45 <Snowman> WTF is that shit?
A7:03:47 <citricsquid> Notch: 10 seconds!
A7:03:48 <08Notch> Snowman: Really? :-O
A7:03:49 <ZomBuster>  <@Notch> not that penises aren't pretty. They just don't stack well. 
A7:03:51 <ZomBuster> what the
A7:03:54 <Snowman> Just heard on the news

A7:04:25 <08Notch> Peerko: I did. :D 52 seconds
A7:04:31 <Peerko> while exercising?
A7:04:40 <08Notch> no, while sitting still. I should try under water
A7:04:40 <zagabar> Peerko: I can hold my breath for 2 minutes without loosng health.

A7:05:04 <citricsquid> I used to be able to do it for over a minute when I swam, now I can do about 10 seconds without passng out.
A7:05:05 <Peerko> :D
A7:05:06 <zagabar> Nut I think about 5-20 seconds should be good. Maybe  make it a setting?
A7:05:19 <zagabar> But**

A7:07:09 <Peerko> game development is so much fun
A7:07:13 <08Notch> haha yes
A7:07:17 <zagabar> IMO the more stuff that's able to be changed in server options and such, the better. Then everybody could make minecraft like they want to have it. =)
A7:07:27 <08Notch> I'd rather have it be like I want it. :D

A7:07:59 <08Notch> I don't want to tweak every last setting before playing
A7:08:08 <zagabar> Templates are good for that.
A7:08:13 <08Notch> and I hate it when I join a tf2 server that has some custom setting
A7:08:29 <vede> You seem awfully anti-modding today, Notch.
A7:08:33 <citricsquid> I hardly play source games because of the constant downloading and variation.
A7:08:42 <zagabar> Make an option then that turns of options. xD
A7:09:02 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/fccg1vfwy_DSCF0083.JPG Fullscreen minecraft on 22", it gave me a headache :D
A7:09:13 <vede> If you don't want people to be able to change the game from your version, then stop making promises for modding.
A7:09:14 <08Notch> I guess I am less pro-modding today, yes. Weird.
A7:09:22 <Evil-Ville> I love it when I join a TF2 server and it's a constant barrage of doh.wav
A7:09:34 <Siiseli> <3
A7:09:36 <08Notch> ok, I'll stop promising modding. ;)
A7:09:37 <PuyoDead> man, I loves me some TF2, but god I hate a server full of custom stuff

A7:11:33 <zagabar> I have been playing a game called clonk for like 4-5 years and I still play it. The original game was fun, but you would get tired after about a month. The thing is that there exists a TON of mods and object packs that are all player made. The scripting is done in C++-similar code and it has really great possibilities. I have scripted a lot for it and it still keeps me to the game. All without the developers needing to do a thing a
A7:11:35 <Siiseli> citricsquid makes no sense to me
A7:11:42 <vede> Yeah, Minecraft is suddenly less interesting to me.
A7:11:45 <citricsquid> Siiseli makes dinner for me
A7:11:59 <Siiseli> citricsquid will massage my feet
A7:12:41 <vede> Way to make massive false promises, Notch.

A7:19:37 <PuyoDead> I was just worried you lost your mind, is all, heh
A7:19:48 <08Notch> I should make the health bar flash the amount of health you lost in the last hit
A7:19:57 <PuyoDead> sounds good
A7:20:00 <08Notch> that way you can always see exactly how much damage stuff does without having to remember your old health
A7:20:24 <08Notch> any ideas for showing your breath-holding abilities?
A7:20:26 <citricsquid> Can we get health back?
A7:20:29 <FlyZ> what about losing health after being in water for so long, or maybe have a "breath bar".
A7:20:33 <08Notch> not yet, but it'll be from eating food
A7:20:33 <bombadil> you could also make a little number appear beside the health bar for a few seconds, then fade out (i.e.  -3.5)
A7:20:35 <ZomBuster> like with a health bar, where the lost health is red then it slowly dissapears?
A7:20:48 <Peerko> how about air bubbles
A7:20:53 <PuyoDead> maybe have a little blue bar above health?
A7:21:00 <Peerko> kinda like the hearts but with air
A7:21:01 <08Notch> bombadil: I think I can get away with that by just showing the hearts as blinking
A7:21:10 <zagabar> Notch: Btw, did you have any game designing related education or the such that has helped you as a developer?
A7:21:11 <PuyoDead> it goes down, then health starts depleting
A7:21:17 <ZomBuster> maybe a blue overlay on the hears bar
A7:21:27 <08Notch> zagabar: No official ones, but I've read a lot of forums and blogs online
A7:21:29 <ZomBuster> combining the health and air in one
A7:21:38 <PuyoDead> yea, Zom's sounds good, too
A7:21:42 <ZomBuster> when the air runs out the health starts draining
A7:21:56 <bombadil> perhaps the -3.5 or other damage number could momentarily float off the top of a person's head, viewable to other players
A7:22:03 <FlyZ> Notch: Do you lose health from being under water for a certain amount of time?
A7:22:10 <PuyoDead> although, people would start with "why did my health turn blue!?"
A7:22:14 <08Notch> bombadil: Showing damage done to others is a good idea
A7:22:23 <08Notch> FlyZ: Not yet, I'm going to implement that now
A7:22:25 <citricsquid> http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/8/23113224249-orig.jpg health like that?
A7:22:28 <Peerko> how about water rising over the hearts
A7:22:31 <08Notch> either you start losing health, or you just DIE
A7:22:33 <FlyZ> okay :)
A7:22:35 <08Notch> just DYING would add some intensity. ;D
A7:22:42 <Peerko> when it reaches the top you start drowning
A7:22:47 <bombadil> haha
A7:22:54 <ZomBuster> maybe a few seconds of choking noises before dieing :P
A7:23:03 <08Notch> haha yeah
A7:23:08 <ZomBuster> like GET OUT OF THE WATER NOW
A7:23:09 <citricsquid> It'd be pretty cool if we didn't have a health bar and you had to guage your own health levels based upon movement speed. Would make it more ...involved, kinda.
A7:23:11 <08Notch> *gluk* *gluk* *gluk* *DEATH*
A7:23:26 <08Notch> I considered that. But I'm going retro game design here. :D
A7:23:34 <citricsquid> :D
A7:23:41 <08Notch> Knowing your exact health helps add to resource management as well
A7:23:52 <FlyZ> Notch: Is there a server behind "breaking the tower", or is it all client side, (i want to save the jar incase anything happens_.
A7:24:07 <08Notch> it checks an online highscore list, but that's it
A7:24:12 <08Notch> it should work offline
A7:24:16 <FlyZ> okay :D
A7:25:22 <08Notch> air bubbles as air supply meter? =D
A7:25:31 <08Notch> "NOOO I'M DOWN TO JUST ONE BUBBLE OMG"
A7:25:43 <FlyZ> lol
A7:25:44 <PuyoDead> hah

A7:29:28 <FlyZ> world of minecraft is a custom written private server i beleive.
A7:29:31 <08Notch> but right now, it's VERY not final
A7:29:33 <bombadil> how about a game mode where there are two bases and two teams. resources must be mined, and then can be used to summon/buy AI units that meander towards the enemy base and start ripping it down.
A7:29:39 <Peerko> so go ahead and change it
A7:29:45 <Ausfriend> Infiniminer would like to have a word with you
A7:29:57 <08Notch> I bet :D
A7:30:01 <Peerko> there's a version number somewhere if I recall correctly
A7:30:08 <Peerko> so it's not like they won't notice
A7:30:20 <Peerko> or be able to detect newer clients
A7:30:42 <08Notch> yeah, there's a protocl version. I always forget about that when I first make a protocol or file format.
A7:30:46 <citricsquid> also minecraft is now alexa rank 80,000! 
A7:30:53 <08Notch> is that good?
A7:31:00 <citricsquid> For 4 months, yeah.
A7:31:08 <FlyZ> Oh course it's good, it's minecraft! :D
A7:31:11 <Peerko> in fact, I would encourage you to update the protocol, I even sent you suggestions a while ago
A7:31:25 <Ausfriend> real men wear night vision goggles while snorkeling
A7:31:29 <zagabar> I would like to see a game mode where mining for gems and treasures is the main focus. Maybe with lethal caves underground. Like filled with lava and zombies, bats or w/e. Then from the resourses you can buy better digging equips and tools and such. 
A7:31:30 <08Notch> I've been looking at a few libraries for it, they do cleanup much better than me
A7:31:36 <zagabar> That would be dorfy. =)
A7:31:37 <do0han> Real men snorkel without a snorkel!
A7:31:42 <do0han> Just hold their breath.
A7:32:04 <FlyZ> Notch: Would it be possible to build/get a Windows 7 native library?
A7:32:08 <bombadil> zagabar: cool idea. how about combining your perilous mining idea with my base siege idea? 
A7:32:18 <ZomBuster> I breath water, my lungs complain but I just say BREATH WATER DAMNIT and they do
A7:32:22 <08Notch> I have no such plans, FlyZ
A7:32:25 <zagabar> bombadil: Yeah, would be great. =)
A7:32:32 <do0han> Notch, does lwjgl work with windows 7?
A7:32:39 <08Notch> I don't know
A7:32:40 <do0han> Was that the question?
A7:32:44 <FlyZ> Well I have a friend who played minecraft a lot, but can't now since there is no native librarys.
A7:32:59 <do0han> Ahh yeah, you'll have to wait for the lwjgl boys to make a new build for that I guess.
A7:33:08 <Peerko> Notch can you get even a bit coding done when we're asking all these questions?
A7:33:15 <zagabar> Notch: Also, will more than one untit to control ever be implemented? Like you can buy more than one dude and switch between them with some key?
A7:33:18 <do0han> But surely that should be the same as the other windows ones though?

A7:34:41 <Ausfriend> its so horrible ;_;
A7:34:46 <zagabar> I like it. =)

A7:34:49 <08Notch> zagabar: I won't add it, but it might be possible to mod it.
A7:34:55 <zagabar> I see.
A7:35:09 <08Notch> ausfriend: Low res! =D
A7:35:17 <Ausfriend> low res is for the weak
A7:35:46 <zagabar> Ausfriend: you call megaman for the weak? >: (
A7:35:57 <Ausfriend> almost any textures i make for anything are like 2000x2000
A7:35:58 <08Notch> how many of you have android phones?
A7:36:02 <Ausfriend> whut
A7:36:10 <08Notch> Google Android
A7:36:17 <citricsquid> I doubt anyone of us do :( I like the android logo though!
A7:36:18 <08Notch> I might make a very scaled down client. :D
A7:36:18 <Ausfriend> zag: theres a difference between 8bit and low res

A7:36:50 <PuyoDead> also, on jayisgames.com, minecraft has "Rating: 4.8/5 (137 votes cast)"
A7:37:00 <08Notch> oh wow
A7:37:00 <bombadil> if you developed one for the iphone i bet minecraft would become a lot more popular
A7:37:08 <08Notch> I don't like iphone :-(
A7:37:16 <bombadil> i have never used one before ^^

A7:37:45 <bombadil> i have been reading about android for a long time. i don't have an android phone but i might consider getting one
A7:37:47 <ZomBuster> there will be an official app later on

A7:40:20 <Ausfriend> Any plans on making a flash version for the mac users?

A7:42:05 <Ausfriend> aaaand since im a minority, theres not a need
A7:42:08 <aera> Ausfriend: oh, I would have thought people would have got that far by now.
A7:42:10 <08Notch> it's probably LWJGL that doesn't do 64 bit mac
A7:42:10 <Ausfriend> when theres not a need, nothing is done
A7:42:27 <aera> seems 64-bit on mac is as neglected as on Windows, then

A7:42:51 <08Notch> it doesn't work on 64 bit windows either? :-O

A7:43:20 <aera> Notch: I don't know if it does or doesn't, just that 64-bit windows has been a damp squib for ages
A7:43:32 <aera> i would _hope_ it did :)
A7:43:35 <08Notch> ah. Yes. The entire 64 bit revolution kinda failed. :D
A7:43:42 <Ausfriend> and to think this machine used to be 32 bit
A7:43:43 <Ausfriend> fffffffffffff
A7:43:43 <08Notch> "You need this!!"

A7:44:18 <bombadil> Snow Leopard is 64 bit. it is being released next month
A7:44:38 <Ausfriend> Yeah, thats good and all but i need a 64 bit web browser, not OS
A7:44:40 <citricsquid> I downloaded 32 bit w7 because nothing seems to work properly on 64bit windows. My wireless drivers can't handle 64 bit :(
A7:44:53 <Ausfriend> Safari is supposedly 64 bit but it still runs java as a 32bit applet
A7:44:56 <Akai> so wait...
A7:45:06 <Akai> i should be glad I didn't push for 64 bit?
A7:45:09 <Ausfriend> Yes
A7:45:14 <aera> citricsquid: yes, this is the problem with an OS that only had binary files >-<
A7:45:21 <Peerko> my 64bits Linux runs fine
A7:45:23 <Ausfriend> 64 is a pile of shit anyway
A7:45:26 <Ausfriend> any 64bit
A7:45:29 <bombadil> screw 64 bit though. i want a quantum computer :P
A7:45:43 <aera> Peerko: as does mine, linux is the only OS with proper support it seems
A7:45:51 <Ausfriend> although 64bit can handle over 300,000,000,000 GB of RAM
A7:46:03 <bombadil> there's nothing wrong with 64 bit
A7:46:03 <citricsquid> over  300,000,000,000 GB?!
A7:46:07 <Ausfriend> Yeah
A7:46:11 <aera> just think what size minecraft level we can fit in that!

A8:04:01 <zagabar> Jakkarra: Notch got a temporary depression and tried to drown himself in a sink. 
A8:05:05 <08Notch> drowning damage works now. :D
A8:05:35 <Jakkarra> soooooooo
A8:05:41 <Jakkarra> zagabar is being dramatic?
A8:05:50 <08Notch> haha, yes
A8:05:56 <Jakkarra> oh good ^^
A8:05:58 <08Notch> I tested how long I could hold my breath under water
A8:06:00 <08Notch> one minute =D
A8:06:02 <08Notch> (in a sink)
A8:06:11 <Jakkarra> i assume by a similar vein, maga also Murderises you?
A8:06:14 <Jakkarra> one minute
A8:06:17 <Jakkarra> not bad :D
A8:06:17 <do0han> Realism for minecraft eh notch?
A8:06:31 <08Notch> well, no. I was just curious. :D
A8:06:37 <Jakkarra> at least we don't have Super Drowning Skills
A8:06:38 <zagabar> Notch: Oh wait... You aint gonna try how long you can hold your breath in magma are you?
A8:06:39 <08Notch> it has to feel fun and feel right. Then I can worry about realism
A8:06:59 <08Notch> i made it drain health when you run out of air. It's more fun than dying immediately
A8:07:01 <LKA> sap guys.
A8:07:02 <do0han> I think when you decided that people would have perfectly cubic heads, realism went out hte window :P
A8:07:07 <Jakkarra> how about by how long guybrush threepwood can hold his breath?
A8:07:11 <LKA> super drowning skills? sonic drowning go
A8:07:16 <do0han> 10 minutes Jakkarra?
A8:07:19 <Jakkarra> hehehe
A8:07:24 <Jakkarra> mmmmmaaaaayyyyyyyybbbbe
A8:07:59 <bombadil> Notch: if you breathe in and out very quickly (like hyperventilating, but using your entire lung capacity for each inhalation and exhalation) for 15 - 20 seconds before you hold you breath, you can hold it for much longer. this is because it expels CO2 out of your blood. the intense urge to breathe when holding one's breath is induced by the body's need to purge CO2 from the blood
A8:08:12 <zagabar> In the phone catalog of luleÃ¥ (a town near here) of some year, you could see the name Guybrush Threepwood. That was awesome.
A8:08:14 <08Notch> really?
A8:08:18 <08Notch> cool :D
A8:08:22 <Jakkarra> woo
A8:08:27 <Jakkarra> thats useful to know
A8:08:40 <|404notfound> that reminds me, I need to play the first Tales of Monkey Island episode
A8:08:55 <Jakkarra> ive only played that three dimensional one,
A8:08:55 <zagabar> Yeah, I saw it at a freinds home when we where bored and looked through old phone catalogs after odd names. xD
A8:08:56 <bombadil> yep it works

A8:26:38 <Ausfriend_> god
A8:26:38 <Jakkarra> only seven?

A8:26:44 <Jakkarra> i thought it was older
A8:26:46 <Ausfriend_> you're making me feel old ;_;
A8:26:50 <08Notch> zagabar: Yes, you can mod hunger. There's no goal to survival yet.
A8:26:54 <Roadcrosser> and maybe a setting to filter vulgar language on a server?
A8:26:57 <Ausfriend_> i still remember getting my first ps1
A8:26:59 <08Notch> I think I'm going to have to add a goal to prevent it from being pointless
A8:27:22 <Roadcrosser> Get to the top of mount everest
A8:27:26 <Roadcrosser> lol
A8:27:35 <Jakkarra> defeat the Magical pixies
A8:27:39 <Roadcrosser> and maybe a setting to filter vulgar language on a server?
A8:27:41 <Jakkarra> or the goblins, whatever
A8:27:48 <Ausfriend_> I wish Bioware still had it's main writer 
A8:27:49 <Ausfriend_> :(
A8:27:53 <Roadcrosser> ?
A8:27:59 <zagabar> Notch: I see. Yeah probably. But please make it so that you can continue play after the goal is done. I would hate to lose all constructions and so just because you reached the goal before you got bored. : )
A8:28:00 <Jakkarra> they could have a randomly generated fortress
A8:28:08 <08Notch> good point!
A8:28:12 <08Notch> I will make it so.
A8:28:17 <Jakkarra> yay
A8:28:29 <Roadcrosser> twhat so?
A8:28:31 <zagabar> Nice.
A8:28:59 <Roadcrosser> and please ignore the Ts at the beginning
A8:29:01 <Peerko> language filters never work
A8:29:07 <osici> will mobs respawn?
A8:29:13 <Roadcrosser> im so used to minecraft
A8:29:21 <zagabar> Hahaha.
A8:29:21 <Roadcrosser> hey peerko
A8:29:25 <Peerko> hello
A8:29:36 <Roadcrosser> havent seen you in awhile
A8:29:44 <bombadil> there could be a "vampire" mob that ingests damage taken from players. after ingesting a certain amount it divides
A8:29:51 <Peerko> I have been here for like forever
A8:29:54 <Peerko> just changed my nick
A8:30:04 <Testvan> i love you puyodead
A8:30:17 <Roadcrosser> could you uh explain why language filters dont work
A8:30:17 <Jakkarra> any flying Mobs, notch?
A8:30:42 <Peerko> because people find ways around them and in the end you end up censoring more than is good
A8:30:49 <zagabar> Or swimming mobs?
A8:30:56 <Roadcrosser> oh
A8:31:00 <Jakkarra> OHSHI- CAAAAAAARP!
A8:31:01 <08Notch> Jakkarra: Do you want it? What kind?
A8:31:10 <Ausfriend_> Also Notch, i've always been curious, how did you create and animate the player models?
A8:31:18 <Jakkarra> well, personally, harpies or something i guess
A8:31:19 <Peerko> I want vehicles
A8:31:23 <08Notch> right now I define it all in code procedurally
A8:31:28 <Roadcrosser> YEAH!
A8:31:30 <zagabar> Jakkarra: Yeah! Carrrrrps! >: D
A8:31:35 <zagabar> And elefants!
A8:31:41 <Roadcrosser> there should be moving blocks
A8:31:41 <Jakkarra> its kinda easy to win if theres just the ground mobs

A8:32:03 <Ausfriend_> awesome
A8:32:05 <zagabar> Digging mobs would be cool.
A8:32:08 <bombadil> mob AI should be able to build stairs :D
A8:32:08 <gea1> grumble grumble
A8:32:14 <gea1> someone cheer me up
A8:32:17 <Jakkarra> Climbing mobs?

A8:32:31 <Iguana> Mob AI that destroy all player-made blocks they touch. =O
A8:32:42 <Ausfriend_> in a radius
A8:32:44 <Ausfriend_> of 20 blocks
A8:32:47 <Ausfriend_> also super speed
A8:32:55 <bombadil> there should be a giant "troll" mob, or just some giants
A8:32:55 <Peerko> how about survival being like the player in a house/building/fortress/whatever and has to fight off hordes of zombies and evil birds
A8:33:11 <08Notch> Peerko: Zombie Siege mode. :D
A8:33:13 <Peerko> and evil fishes through the plumbing
A8:33:17 <Roadcrosser> WEAPONS!
A8:33:23 <Roadcrosser> lol
A8:33:23 <gear|grunt> i see you guys are in excited mode
A8:33:25 <Jakkarra> zombie seige mode
A8:33:28 <08Notch> the plan right now is to release Zombie Siege as the first reference mod when I release modding
A8:33:29 <bombadil> maybe a cube snake. every time it bites a player it grows a cube in length!
A8:33:32 <Jakkarra> PLEASE add zombie seige mode!
A8:33:41 <Iguana> Kay.
A8:33:44 <08Notch> lol bombadil
A8:33:44 <Jakkarra> it could work very well!
A8:33:53 <osici> Notch, will mobs randomly respawn in survival?
A8:33:54 <Iguana> Or a dinosaur
A8:34:00 <08Notch> yes, osici
A8:34:04 <Peerko> zombies would break down walls slowly but steadily
A8:34:08 <Iguana> Make a dino mob. ^^
A8:34:09 <Peerko> and you have to rebuild them
A8:34:12 <Peerko> or die
A8:34:20 <Iguana> Every player made block it touchs!
A8:34:22 <bombadil> sand worm / cube snake. it would be able to dig / tunnel under ground
A8:34:26 <Roadcrosser> a bigifier to make you big!
A8:34:27 <Peerko> like griefer zombies
A8:34:34 <Roadcrosser> lol
A8:34:37 <Jakkarra> iguana: that could be circumvented EASILY
A8:34:44 <Iguana> ?
A8:34:46 <Iguana> How so?
A8:34:46 <Jakkarra> just by digging out your fort
A8:35:00 <Roadcrosser> tjust dig traps
A8:35:01 <Jakkarra> making it from natural landscapeness
A8:35:14 <Ausfriend_> Holy shit
A8:35:18 <Peerko> Roadcrosser, what's with the t's anyway?

A8:36:42 <zagabar> How? =O
A8:36:44 <Jakkarra> i hope Notch adds Zombie survival mode
A8:36:51 <Testvan> he is
A8:36:54 <Jakkarra> all it needs is a house
A8:36:58 <mezo> so notch, it wont be possible for non-coders to make heavily customized maps?
A8:37:00 <Jakkarra> or some building
A8:37:08 <Roadcrosser> i hope notch adds sized blocks
A8:37:11 <Jakkarra> and everyones in it
A8:37:21 <Roadcrosser> and lightbulbs
A8:37:21 <Jakkarra> and Zambas come to eeeeat joo
A8:37:24 <Peerko> I hope blocks stay just like they are now
A8:37:31 <Roadcrosser> ?
A8:37:32 <08Notch> mezo: Aren't there map editors already?
A8:37:42 <mezo> that's not what i mean
A8:37:49 <08Notch> how did you mean, then?
A8:37:52 <Iguana> With lava?
A8:37:54 <do0han> He means the scripting
A8:37:57 <Iguana> And still water?
A8:38:03 <mezo> yeah i mean scripting, thanks
A8:38:13 <08Notch> to do scripting, you need to know coding, yes..
A8:38:23 <Roadcrosser> the best server is...
A8:38:27 <mezo> like if i want to make a map where there's a castle with some wizard in it who summons stuff every once in a while and it exits the castle to roam the wilderness
A8:38:30 <Peerko> or you rent a coder
A8:38:47 <08Notch> that's require programming, mezo.
A8:38:47 <mezo> there wont be mobs that can be set to spawn other mobs, each of whom are given basic ai?
A8:38:47 <do0han> Wait till someone makes a gui that writes code fro you :P
A8:38:51 <mezo> k
A8:38:51 <zagabar> Lightbulbs, torches and a new lightingsystem would be cool. so that it gets totally pitch dark underground. You have to carry/build torches that you make out of wood that you chop from the growing forest. It would be great for a minign mode.
A8:39:03 <08Notch> zagabar: Yes, I agree! =D
A8:39:04 <mezo> that kind of thing can be done with a basic editor of sorts
A8:39:10 <osici> ooh lighting :)
A8:39:14 <08Notch> I actually started work on a new lighting code engine that I think would work
A8:39:17 <08Notch> but it got buggy and SLOOW
A8:39:18 <Roadcrosser> lights!
A8:39:22 <08Notch> so I need to rethink it
A8:39:32 <08Notch> i want lava to cast light :D
A8:39:33 <Roadcrosser> whats the best server?
A8:39:45 <Jakkarra> why does it not currently notch?
A8:39:49 <Jakkarra> lava i mean
A8:39:54 <Jakkarra> too much work for the moment?
A8:39:58 <08Notch> because nothing can cast light at the moment
A8:40:03 <Jakkarra> k
A8:40:08 <Roadcrosser> exept sky
A8:40:16 <08Notch> yeah, but that's just a heightmap test. =D
A8:40:27 <zagabar> Notch: Too bad. :/ I hope you get it right. It would be really awesome. Yeah, Imagine digging in a dark dark tunnel, carrying only a torch, searching for precious gems (or HFS!) and then you stumble upon a lava cave that emitts a warm red shimmer.
A8:40:32 <08Notch> it's a shame the new lighting code didn't work out, it'd add a lot of atmosphere
A8:40:32 <Jakkarra> immah looking forwards to Survivahl!
A8:40:45 <Jakkarra> will a Hell ofr sorts be added?
A8:40:55 <Peerko> good sound adds admosphere
A8:40:56 <Roadcrosser> and ability to see clearly in lava/water
A8:41:00 <Jakkarra> just a hollow underground full of DEEEEEMMMMMMOOOONNNNNSSS!!!
A8:41:08 <08Notch> It's quite likely deep underground will have more caverns and more lava laves, yes, Jakkarra. ;)
A8:41:14 <08Notch> and more nasties, and more treasures
A8:41:14 <Jakkarra> Huzzah!
A8:41:23 <Roadcrosser> and ability to see clearly in lava/water
A8:41:31 <Jakkarra> i am pleased that you are ables to code all of this notch!
A8:41:44 <08Notch> we'll just have to see how long it takes, Jakkarra. =D
A8:41:50 <08Notch> but I'm dedicated! =D
A8:41:51 <Jakkarra> :D

A8:47:20 <Siiseli> take roquelikes

A8:48:59 <Ausfriend_> Did you have a disease?
A8:49:00 <zagabar> Crawl is a good roguelike.
A8:49:13 <Ausfriend_> A boar ate my arm off, so i prayed to a god and my made was remade out of rubies
A8:49:17 <Rock_D> nethack isn't easy for newcomers. it's more of a skill/knowledge based game instead of luck like crawl
A8:49:18 <Roadcrosser> what abt day/night?
A8:49:21 <Ausfriend_> *my arm was remade

A8:56:11 <08Notch> I want them to be very readable in the game
A8:56:13 <Jakkarra> so, its all going to be that bright silver?
A8:56:20 <UnknownX> No
A8:56:22 <Jakkarra> or orange
A8:56:23 <08Notch> no, there will be different armor types. Probably like 3-4 types.
A8:56:27 <UnknownX> Its going to be different types
A8:56:28 <08Notch> and that's a temporary texture
A8:56:32 <Jakkarra> oh good
A8:56:41 <FlyZ> Notch, before i get off, why does the scripting have to me in Lua, I never even heard of Lua, Java is my main language and a language I been programming in for 4 years. :'(
A8:56:47 <Quatroking> Notch: what about different pallette's for armors, so they are at least a bit personalized?
A8:56:48 <FlyZ> be in*
A8:57:14 <Quatroking> for example, I carry a black wooden shield around while bobby carries the same shield, but in pink
A8:57:15 <08Notch> FlyZ: Because I asked the community what they prefered, and a vast majority voted Lua
A8:57:19 <Quatroking> because he's a hippie
A8:57:25 <08Notch> I wanted Java personally, but I'm not the one who's going to use it the most. =)
A8:57:31 <Jakkarra> ^^
A8:57:36 <Jakkarra> i don't know Luas
A8:57:37 <FlyZ> Well how about both?
A8:57:39 <Peerko> only because javascript wasn't a choice option :(
A8:57:43 <Peerko> </rant>
A8:57:43 <Jakkarra> ill have to force someone else to do it
A8:57:48 <FlyZ> I'm sure you cn make it have Jave and Lua scripting.
A8:57:50 <FlyZ> :D?
A8:57:52 <Jakkarra> DO IT, DO IT NAOUGH!
A8:58:00 <Jakkarra> :D
A8:58:00 <08Notch> Well, I might allow custom logos/emblems on the armor and shields

A8:58:59 <Snowman> :'(

A9:00:05 <Peerko> security by obscurity is the only way for now
A9:00:31 <08Notch> it should get a bit better when I update the server software when I release mp survival
A9:00:41 <08Notch> since flying and running through walls would be impossible
A9:00:42 <antinull> hmm, mabey make it so that people cant just make a million accounts
A9:01:11 <antinull> they get banned and they are back in 10 min with a new name/ip
A9:01:14 <citricsquid> antinull: Impossible, unless you did human verification for accounts and that isn't practical.
A9:01:30 <Quatroking> steal VAC.
A9:01:33 <Quatroking> >:D
A9:01:41 <citricsquid> Quatroking: You can have multiple accounts w/ CAV.

A9:02:06 <Jakkarra> its VAC silly
A9:02:19 <citricsquid> Jakkarra: It doesn't work like that. That'd be like Notch refusing money.

A9:09:50 <Jakkarra> i doubt we can get the Cloth blox in Survival, right?
A9:09:54 <08Notch> it's not possible to do in the engine at the moment without a lot of rewrites
A9:10:03 <Jakkarra> id have lieked em for Flags, though

A9:11:21 <zagabar> Notch: I see. How about a block that upon choosing, opens up a menu of predefined single coloured boxes? To make more colours available. (if the problem with the previous idea was the untextured block witha colour only)
A9:12:30 <gear|grunt> my good friend notch, buddy, pal, ever consider making a map preview applet? similar to the skin preview
A9:13:25 <08Notch> zagabar: I have a fixed palette of a total of 256 different unique blocks now.
A9:13:30 <Piecat> Omen won't work :S

A9:13:59 <08Notch> gear|grunt: I think that would be difficult
A9:14:06 <Ausfriend> for a player owned castle
A9:14:09 <08Notch> flags and signs are both good ideas. :D
A9:14:15 <Ausfriend> Maybe we can make our own skins for flags?
A9:14:16 <gear|grunt> mmmmmmmk
A9:14:20 <Piecat> Could someone help me Fix OMEN???
A9:14:21 <Ausfriend> Like the player skin?
A9:15:03 <zagabar> Piecat: what happens? Do you have java SDK?
A9:15:10 <zagabar> Notch: Awesome! =D
A9:15:12 <Piecat> nope
A9:15:16 <zagabar> Get it. ;)
A9:15:36 <zagabar> Also you need to run it from the server folder IIRC.
A9:15:38 <08Notch> signs would probably just be plank base texture + custom text
A9:15:47 <zagabar> Would be enough.
A9:15:50 <08Notch> and there would probably be a maximum number of signs per level
A9:16:20 <Jakkarra> k
A9:16:25 <Siiseli> Notch, also if your mouse is over text it'll show up in opaque text box on the screen
A9:16:30 <Jakkarra> a few each'd be enough
A9:16:45 <08Notch> why not just render the text on the sign in the game?
A9:16:54 <Siiseli> well
A9:16:59 <Siiseli> it might be abit unreadablë
A9:17:05 <Jakkarra> yeah
A9:17:06 <Siiseli> especially if there's alot of text
A9:17:11 <Siiseli> I'd say for claritys sake
A9:17:15 <08Notch> I was thinkint like 32 characters per sign
A9:17:18 <08Notch> *thinking
A9:17:22 <Jakkarra> if it was unpixellated, that would be good, if thats possible
A9:17:22 <Siiseli> mnyeah but still 
A9:17:25 <08Notch> two lines of 16 chars
A9:17:37 <08Notch> lemme test it right now
A9:17:39 <08Notch> RIIGHT NOOOWW
13A9:17:45 * Notch goes to implement signs
A9:17:47 <Siiseli> goodie
13A9:17:59 * Siiseli waits patiently for all the "penis" signgs

A9:18:13 <Jakkarra> hehe
A9:18:17 <Jakkarra> Jakkaria
A9:18:24 <Jakkarra> that's the name of my state
13A9:18:30 * UnknownX was thinking along the lines of "This way to penisville!"
A9:19:04 <Ausfriend> Notch, is it possible (just theoretically) to compile java apps into windows executables?
A9:19:40 <08Notch> yes, there are some java->native compilers
A9:19:56 <Ausfriend> right, thanks
A9:19:57 <Peerko> I think Azureus was compiled to exe?
A9:20:11 <osici> Notch, any chance of url/link blocks that could join Minecraft servers together?
A9:21:09 <zagabar> Problem with popping up an opaque box every time you point at a sight would be the annoyance factor.
A9:21:13 <08Notch> Unlikely, osici.
A9:21:19 <Siiseli> Notch, any chance of saving map files to hard drive and loading them on servers etc.? or is this already in
A9:21:25 <Peerko> how about scriptable dialogs?
A9:21:28 <08Notch> Peerko: I think it just has a small exe wrapper, actually.
A9:21:28 <Siiseli> it'd be great to share your creations with othersa
A9:21:39 <08Notch> Siiseli: Local map saving is coming
A9:21:43 <Jakkarra> hmm
A9:21:43 <Siiseli> Notch, mmkay
A9:21:47 <Jakkarra> i wonder
A9:21:50 <Siiseli> Notch, why'd you make me op btw :D
A9:21:51 <Peerko> "Do you really want to enter the scare cave?" [YES] [No]
A9:21:52 <Siiseli> just curious
A9:21:55 <Jakkarra> will there ever be sort of a "war" mode?
A9:22:08 <Jakkarra> basically PvP
A9:22:16 <zagabar> Jakkarra: Now THAT woudl be cool!
A9:22:16 <Ausfriend> needs more invisible bear traps that are only visible to level 10 miners
A9:22:55 <Jakkarra> hehe
A9:22:56 <zagabar> Yeye, this game has soo much potential. =)
A9:24:16 <Quatroking> we need mines.
A9:24:19 <Quatroking> landmines.
A9:24:30 <Siiseli> Quatroking is right
A9:24:33 <Siiseli> but visible ones :|
A9:24:34 <Ausfriend> and bear traps
A9:24:40 <Quatroking> Visible, yes
A9:24:45 <Siiseli> and bear traps that like
A9:24:52 <zagabar> Bombs in general would be cool. That can be dropped and thown and damage blocks.
A9:24:53 <Siiseli> you step on them and a bear springs from the ground
A9:25:02 <Jakkarra> yay
A9:25:20 <UnknownX> Notch will we be able to walk through leaves in survival?
A9:25:37 <Quatroking> mines that have to be removed with some sort of tool, which you have to forge first
A9:25:41 <Ausfriend> WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK THAT
A9:25:43 <Ausfriend> GET OUT OF MY HEA

A9:50:24 <Darkebrz> Didn't think so
A9:50:29 <Magnulus> Would have been awesome.
A9:50:30 <Quatroking> Not even going to try that
A9:50:47 <Quatroking> A bank should be easy to implent

A9:51:24 <zagabar> Darkebrz: Okay. Do yuo have any idea of how do get it?
A9:51:37 <Quatroking> using some entities I made a fully functioning bank system :D
A9:51:40 <Darkebrz> Ask the owner of the bot when he comes on
A9:51:48 <Darkebrz> It requires several channels
A9:51:57 <Darkebrz> So you would have to chagne some stuff to run it here
A9:51:57 <Magnulus> It sounds like it could easily work, though. Make harvesting materials take a while so that people are inclined to gather materials to sell to others, add quests and monsters, and you have a full-fledged miniMMO.

A10:20:34 <Quatroking> the teachers didn't like it if you would say goddamnit, but they did it too so they didn't mind most of the time
A10:21:03 <Quatroking> and special education knows no god

A10:22:14 <ONI> Catholics beleive in evolition
A10:22:22 <Quatroking> true
A10:22:25 <Snowman> She should throw darwin's book at the teacher

A10:25:25 <Magnulus> If everyone could understand that no one belief is better than any other, things would be so much easier.
A10:25:26 <Quatroking> I hate people who act like that

A10:25:38 <Magnulus> That's not a failing of religion, though.

A10:25:44 <Snowman> Letting your children die cause "god wants it" doesn't sound very fair to me
A10:25:54 <Quatroking> If god didn't want evil stuff then he wouldn't have made africa and the middle east
A10:25:56 <Magnulus> That's a failing of some of the people who practice it.
A10:26:03 <ONI> Jesus was real
A10:26:03 <Quatroking> He wouldn't even made mankind
A10:26:13 <Quatroking> Jesus is a meme
A10:26:16 <ONI> whether he was the son of god is whats up for debate
A10:26:19 <Magnulus> Are you saying Africa and the Middle East are inherently EVIL+
A10:26:21 <Magnulus> What?
A10:26:29 <Quatroking> Africa is poor as shit
A10:26:45 <Quatroking> CHILD SLAVERYYY
A10:26:46 <Magnulus> That's not a failing of religion. That's a failing of enterprising Europeans.
A10:26:49 <Quatroking> Seems pretty evil to me.
A10:26:58 <08Notch> I blogged the signs

A10:27:35 <Quatroking> that looks great
A10:27:36 <Magnulus> I'm out of this argument. It will not lead anywhere.
A10:27:54 <PuyoDead> what if the font looked "chiseled", or burnt in?
A10:28:05 <PuyoDead> or would that hinder readability
A10:28:09 <Quatroking> guys, give me three names of great african inventions that helped the entire world
A10:28:20 <08Notch> i tried to make it look burnt in, but it just looked transparent, haha

A10:31:33 <citricsquid> I love cool original flavour, they're so awesome.

A10:32:35 <Quatroking> ONI: link
A10:32:38 <08Notch> people have requested signs, and I assume they will be used to mark your creations and/or being racist
A10:32:46 <mezo> rof
A10:32:51 <08Notch> a lot of them will probably mention body parts
A10:32:56 <citricsquid> Notch: Can admins remove signs? and are they just like normal blocks?
A10:32:58 <ZomBuster> haha
A10:33:03 <08Notch> they're not signs at all, they're items. :D
A10:33:07 <08Notch> and yes, sure
A10:33:25 <ONI> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACvtzOlrOsM
A10:33:29 <08Notch> the resources in the game are items as well
A10:33:29 <mezo> you place it on the ground and then type the message?
A10:33:34 <mezo> walk us through the process
A10:33:43 <08Notch> Right now you just press H and the default sign appears
A10:33:50 <ONI> there ya go Quatro
A10:33:55 <08Notch> in survival mode, you'll craft one and enter a message, then have it in your inventory
A10:33:59 <08Notch> when you drop it, it shows up like that
A10:34:00 <ZomBuster> items = not blocky models I guess
A10:34:03 <iPope> Notch, could you apply a similiar thing to rock walls?
A10:34:05 <Magnulus> Is there any way to make sloped blocks? I know it must be difficult since they're voxels, but is it possible?
A10:34:07 <citricsquid> Notch: Awesome! :D
A10:34:07 <mezo> so no re-writes?
A10:34:09 <08Notch> in creative, I don't know
A10:34:17 <Magnulus> And I know it's not possible NOW.
A10:34:20 <08Notch> mezo: No re-writes yet.
A10:34:23 <Magnulus> Just wondering about the future of the game.
A10:34:24 <ZomBuster> are you using some kind of model format now
A10:34:36 <mezo> what about spellcheck?
A10:34:37 <08Notch> Magnulus: I want sloped blocks. That's about how clear I can be at the moment
A10:34:38 <Quatroking> Notch: 3D beards?
A10:34:41 <mezo> joke
A10:34:42 <Quatroking> must have
A10:34:43 <Magnulus> Hahah.
A10:34:45 <08Notch> probably not, Quatroking. :D
A10:34:47 <Magnulus> Thanks.
A10:34:49 <tarkata14> woah, notch is on
A10:34:50 <iPope> Notch: Could you do the same thing so with a chisel you could carve messages into rocks?
A10:34:52 <Quatroking> D:
A10:35:01 <08Notch> hmm
A10:35:02 <ONI> No I'm so British Mustaches?
A10:35:06 <offset> Cave art :D
A10:35:06 <Quatroking> so no afro's and mohawk's either?
A10:35:15 <zagabar> Notch: will trees ever grow?
A10:35:16 <mezo> open up a paint interface and let people chisel by pixel :D
A10:35:22 <08Notch> that's a bit more difficult, ipope
A10:35:29 <mezo> so we can carve grand murals across great walls
A10:35:38 <08Notch> that'd be a lot of network traffic. ;)
A10:35:42 <Magnulus> Any plans for building with larger areas so you can choose to build instantly with grids of several blocks?
A10:35:44 <ZomBuster> just remove the sign and make it use a rock block?
A10:35:55 <08Notch> no Magnulus. That's a completely different game from what I'm doing
A10:35:59 <08Notch> use a level editor for that.
A10:36:01 <ONI> anyway of a graffiti type thing Notch?
A10:36:03 <Magnulus> All right, thanks.
A10:36:15 <zagabar> Notch: also, the music. Where does it come from? Is it downloadable? Possible to get more from the same author? it is nice.
A10:36:17 <Quatroking> ONI: Like in Source?

A10:36:35 <iPope> Notch: Well you convert a blcok into a sign type object, and the text appears onto the wall
A10:36:36 <ONI> maybe freeform
A10:36:45 <iPope> Its like the sign without the stick inside a block
A10:36:53 <08Notch> iPope: Items are passable. I could make it a very thin object that just attaches to a wall
A10:37:02 <08Notch> ah yes
A10:37:07 <08Notch> that could work, yes. =)
A10:37:10 <Nalok> Hey Notch, are you going to have like..an adventure mode?
A10:37:23 <citricsquid> happy 40th birthday unix!
A10:37:27 <iPope> It could work notch, and it would be awesome
A10:37:29 <08Notch> how is that different from survival mode?
A10:37:52 <iPope> Notch: I think he means quests and shiz
A10:38:04 <08Notch> oohh.
A10:38:16 <ONI> Mini MMORPG type thing
A10:38:19 <Magnulus> Better yet: Will we at some point be able to MAKE quests and... "shiz"

A10:38:28 <Nalok> Well, I was thinking, your player could start off in a town, either generated or player made, then you can buy stuff and go on quests and yadda yaddA
A10:38:34 <08Notch> the first expansion will let you build levels for others to play on, though
A10:38:40 <Nalok> Yeah
A10:38:44 <08Notch> and there will be no breaking walls/building blocks in that game mode
A10:38:50 <08Notch> so you can't cheat as easy
A10:38:53 <zagabar> Notch: cool. I'll listen to his music. And did you miss my question about the trees?
A10:38:55 <Magnulus> Nice one.
A10:39:01 <08Notch> yes, zagabar, I did
A10:39:12 <mezo> why add that arbitrary rule to all custom maps?
A10:39:21 <Nalok> It would take a considerable amount of time to make, considering NPC dialouge and quests logs and etc.
A10:39:21 <08Notch> I won't. =)
A10:39:22 <Magnulus> Well, I guess it wouldn't have to be no-breaking as long as breaking things is slow.

A10:39:40 <08Notch> Oh, yes, probably
A10:39:52 <08Notch> the current plan is to have the small saplings turn into trees after a while if there's room
A10:39:54 <Magnulus> (and that such breakage would be undone when that player logs out or something)
A10:40:03 <Magnulus> That's pretty awesome.
A10:40:06 <ZomBuster> make the trees grow infinite

A10:41:50 <Magnulus> I made a tree like that by hand in a free-building server a friend is running. ^_^
A10:41:55 <ONI> That would be intresting
A10:42:11 <Elwebbaro> interesting and annoying
A10:42:17 <Elwebbaro> xD
A10:42:32 <ONI> not if only kie 2 become giant
A10:42:45 <Elwebbaro> true
A10:43:10 <ZomBuster> virus mode: virus blocks slowly cover up the entire map, killing all plants
A10:43:25 <ONI> And a redwood forest might be intresting for survival stuff

Then you choose a race, Human, Elf, or Dwarf, which does not have an affect in SP. OK So, after choosing your name you're started off in your town, you buy some gear and go on a quest to hunt something, then as the game progres
A10:45:39 <Nalok> ....holy wow mouthfull

A10:48:35 <Nalok> In the Multiplayer aspect of the game though, you choose from a bunch of different servers and start off in a hub city, And since it's multiplayer, everything will br a bit harder, also once you choose your race you get a skin resembling the race

A10:51:20 <Nalok> So that's why I'm thinking of all this
A10:51:36 <zagabar> Notch: Adding weather + day/night would add alot to the atmosphere. Raining could be just some rainy overlay on the screen + lighting changes. Waterblocks might spawn in pits too. And snow could work in the same way, just that it would leave snow blocks. I imagine a very very rainy evening (with rain and lightning ambient sounds+flashes) and you are out running, knowing that predators hunts in the night. You are lost due to the bad

A10:52:34 <Xzalander> Whey i finally got here
A10:52:39 <Nalok> The only snow we have currently is white cloth on dirt :/
A10:52:43 <zagabar> yeah
A10:52:52 <Elwebbaro> just to add something to zagabars words: forced misty weather ;p
A10:53:11 <zagabar> Yeah, that would also be cool.^^
A10:53:33 <KatamariManatee> Hey Notch, which feature do you expect to be out first? Signs, extra clothes options, ect?
A10:53:47 <iPope> Hes not here
A10:53:52 <iPope> Hes eating, give the man a break
A10:53:55 <Xzalander> haha
A10:53:55 <Nalok> lol
A10:53:57 <KatamariManatee> Oh, sorry
A10:54:02 <Magnulus> I love the idea of rain filling pools and that kind of thing.
A10:54:34 <zagabar> Two players to each other in game: "Hey where are you? we should hurry to the cottage!" "I know, but this mist is so thick, I got lost!" "I can hear the predators near, we really should hurry"
A10:54:35 <Xzalander> Cant wait till he figures out the nonexpansive water code.
A10:54:35 <iPope> Finite water is coming for survival
A10:54:42 <Xzalander> mm ^
A10:54:48 <Nalok> Snow would be about as easy as making a skin, all you do is add bits of white to it.
A10:55:09 <Xzalander> Snow text could easily be grass tex recoloured white
A10:55:13 <iPope> Notch considered falling snow and said sort of yes
A10:55:15 <Nalok> And speaking of White, I want a white cloth skin for snow maps :D
A10:55:26 <ZomBuster> wouldnt be that hard to just add an extra texture for snow
A10:55:44 <iPope> But not snow tiles
A10:55:44 <iPope> It was something like that
A10:55:51 <Nalok> Like I said, it'd be like a skin
A10:56:02 <KatamariManatee> Maybe walking on snow leaves footprints?
A10:56:04 <Nalok> Just whiten it a bit and voila
13A10:56:10 * gear|grunt sighs
A10:56:18 <Nalok> That'd be a neat concept
A10:56:21 <Xzalander> Kata thats going a bit extreme isnt it?
A10:56:24 <iPope> Notch dun wnat lots of block types you cant acess
A10:56:38 <Nalok> Well after a minute or two it dissapears
A10:56:44 <Nalok> or 30 seconds
A10:56:55 <KatamariManatee> It's just a seperate texture that goes over the snow
A10:56:55 <iPope> Xza: can be done, hard to do in a browser game
A10:57:00 <Xzalander> thats what I mean.
A10:57:14 <ZomBuster> snow would look like grass
A10:57:17 <ZomBuster> but white
A10:57:22 <ZomBuster> and on any block
A10:57:22 <Xzalander> In a browser its not exactly easy for notch to do and I'd rather get more substance than aesthetics now.
A10:57:23 <gear|grunt> you need to remember a lot of these things are just stress on the server
A10:57:26 <Nalok> What about Ice blocks?
A10:57:27 <Xzalander> Dunno about anyone else.
A10:57:29 <KatamariManatee> It would probably be too hard to handle
A10:57:29 <gear|grunt> for not much real gain
A10:57:49 <Elwebbaro> slippy ice blocks would be cool.
A10:58:09 <Xzalander> mm TBH my main wishlist would be Blocks with effect and LADDERS <<<

A10:59:05 <PuyoDead> I have no idea how I closed xchat
A10:59:19 <Elwebbaro> pressing space every second sucks, so stairs would be cool.
A10:59:23 <Magnulus> Shouldn't be TOO hard to get varying degrees of slipperyness to different blocks, should it?

A10:59:43 <Nalok> I wonder what ice blocks would look like..
A10:59:53 <Magnulus> I'm not programmer, but that seems like something that's been in games for a long time.
A11:00:02 <Xzalander> I bet ice blocks would look like glass except more blue and opaque
A11:00:05 <Magnulus> Nalok: Like glass blocks, but bluer?
A11:00:11 <Magnulus> heh, yeah.
A11:00:24 <Magnulus> Hey, Puyo.
A11:00:31 <PuyoDead> 'allo
A11:00:42 <citricsquid> PuyoDead is my favourite #minecraft person.
A11:00:49 <PuyoDead> wee!
A11:00:51 <Xzalander> Oh Hey citric.
13A11:00:56 * citricsquid takes his bribe
A11:01:00 <Xzalander> Haha
13A11:01:05 * C418 thinks he'd love to make another ambient album. but people think C418 sucks at that
A11:01:06 <PuyoDead> good doing business
A11:01:17 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: See you next week?
A11:01:19 <Magnulus> And if you have varying friction in blocks, and then weather, it wouldn't be far removed to make blocks have less friction during rain.
A11:01:26 <Magnulus> ^_^
A11:01:31 <Xzalander> I like it C418. Although the one track does grate.
A11:01:32 <PuyoDead> I'll schedule you in
A11:01:46 <citricsquid> C418: I'm going to listen to some of your music now, is it on your website? :D
A11:01:55 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: okay great!
A11:02:07 <C418> big things are all on c418.bandcamp.com
13A11:02:08 * zagabar likes C418's music in minecraft
A11:02:13 <C418> they're great at hostig music
A11:02:15 <Magnulus> So a block with relatively low friction (like glass, which is not as slippery as ice but not as frictioned as a rock) would be slippery as hell during rain.
A11:02:30 <Xzalander> a multiplier Magnus
A11:02:41 <Xzalander> rain could Multiply the effect of bricks x05 or something
A11:02:54 <Magnulus> Yeah, for example.
A11:03:21 <Xzalander> haha > lava gets hotter cause it got rained on.... /fail

A11:04:28 <C418> I don't know how lava works. but that stuff is so hot that water would either do nothing at all, or it would splatter all over the place
A11:04:39 <Magnulus> Rain multplies slipperyness by .5 and heat by -.5
A11:04:46 <Magnulus> Not that hard, Xza.
A11:04:47 <Xzalander> oh yes.
A11:04:50 <Xzalander> <Has simple mind
A11:04:54 <Magnulus> ^_^
A11:05:00 <Xzalander> Tis if you dont programm Magnulus
A11:05:18 <Xzalander> Last time I coded something was Visual basic 4 years ago.
A11:05:24 <Magnulus> I don't program either.
A11:05:31 <Magnulus> I probably couldn't even do Visual Basic.
A11:05:41 <chrstfer> omg im so bored
A11:05:56 <Xzalander> trust me you could. 
A11:06:03 <Magnulus> I did make extremely simple text-adventures in Turbo Pascal about 17 years ago, though.
A11:06:03 <C418> you're bored AND in an irc channel! strike.
A11:06:33 <Xzalander> mmm Text adventures... I miss Zork
A11:07:10 <Magnulus> Nowhere near that advanced, obviously. More like choose-your-own-adventure books than games, really. ^_^

A11:11:28 <ZomBuster> is it choppy?
A11:11:41 <gear|grunt> its blurry

A11:11:52 <gear|grunt> motion blurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
A11:11:53 <Magnulus> What is that proving?
A11:12:07 <Xzalander> Voila - Translated I managed to make you look stupid to anyone in your room.
A11:12:21 <gear|grunt> people expect me to be odd anyway
A11:12:26 <Xzalander> haha

A11:12:36 <gear|grunt> wtf twitter
A11:12:42 <gear|grunt> 503 die
A11:12:51 <ZomBuster> noo
A11:12:55 <ZomBuster> the world will collapse 
A11:13:19 <Xzalander> Are there any unofficial MC forums set up? Or are well all still waiting for the official ones to come back up?
A11:13:21 <gear|grunt> the twittersphere..
A11:13:52 <gear|grunt> can no one else get on twitter?
A11:14:05 <Xzalander> dont use it gear :(
A11:14:09 <ZomBuster> the "official" ones are the unofficial
A11:14:14 <gear|grunt> well at least go to the site
A11:14:18 <gear|grunt> tell me if you get an error
A11:14:24 <Xzalander> ok
A11:14:31 <Magnulus> Notch, perhaps when you're running out of health, the bar could pulsate? Or just blink?
A11:14:42 <Xzalander> getting error 503
A11:14:45 <gear|grunt> hmmk
A11:14:50 <Magnulus> Perhaps blink between red and yellow or something.
A11:14:51 <gear|grunt> a slow growing pulse would be good
A11:16:21 <UnknownX> Notch: You need to add trolls, giants, and gnomes as monsters
A11:16:24 <Xzalander> How about a simple colour change
A11:16:34 <Xzalander> from green when at full to yellow at 50% and red <25%
A11:16:48 <UnknownX> I don't want a green heart
A11:17:01 <UnknownX> That would make me have green blood
A11:17:06 <ZomBuster> the screen should pulsate red and letters show up saying "You are wounded, find cover!"
A11:17:21 <ZomBuster> and then you wait 3 seconds and you are fully healed
A11:17:24 <Xzalander> haha Call of Duty
A11:17:32 <KatamariManatee> Notch, what feature will be added first? Or will they all be at the same time?
A11:17:36 <ZomBuster> and every other fps nowadays :(
A11:17:36 <Magnulus> it could make the whole computer shake aggressively!!!
A11:17:40 <fydo> how about you use a sweet blur shader to randomly blur the screen when your health is very low
A11:17:52 <Elwebbaro> if that is possible...
A11:17:54 <fydo> because your vision suffers from lack of hearts
A11:17:55 <Xzalander> Id be scared if my monitor started vibrating
A11:17:56 <Xzalander> xD
A11:18:00 <UnknownX> ZomBuster: You got that from Wolfensteine too
A11:18:04 <Xzalander> Black and White vision!
A11:18:05 <Magnulus> Yeah, sweet fydo, except that this is a browser game.
A11:18:16 <UnknownX> Wolfenstein*
A11:18:27 <fydo> Magnulus: it's still opengl, perfectly capable of making use of shaders
A11:18:28 <ZomBuster> yeh its in every game :/
A11:18:41 <ZomBuster> but wolfenstein still looks goof
A11:18:43 <ZomBuster> d
A11:18:44 <Magnulus> Still, though, it's already hogging CPU power.
A11:19:04 <ZomBuster> shaders are GPU..
A11:19:05 <fydo> unless your GPU is crap, adding shaders won't increase CPU load
A11:19:07 <UnknownX> I want a black and white screen when you get badly damaged
A11:19:18 <Magnulus> All right right.
A11:19:24 <Magnulus> - right

A11:22:13 <Magnulus> That you're 100% fighting fit when within an inch of your life kind of annoys me a bit.
A11:22:21 <Jakkarra> bin looking at the Devlog
A11:22:24 <Jakkarra> i love the signs
A11:22:34 <Jakkarra> but, the Invulnerability, not so much
A11:22:41 <Jakkarra> could it be a Server Option?
A11:22:50 <Magnulus> Though I can understand it to some degree from a playability design point of view, you can use the slowdown as a gameplay element.
A11:23:11 <Jakkarra> mm,
A11:23:26 <Jakkarra> it does mean that One enemy attacking you is the same as a hundred
A11:23:31 <Jakkarra> though
A11:23:37 <Xzalander> Magnulus it reminds me of L4Ds slowdown on hit from the zombies
A11:23:40 <Jakkarra> as only one can damage you
A11:24:05 <UnknownX> The invulnerability is bad
A11:24:09 <Jakkarra> yeah
A11:24:15 <Jakkarra> we can playtest it though
A11:24:19 <Jakkarra> from sept 1

A11:25:11 <Magnulus> ?
A11:25:15 <Elwebbaro> Notch: yeah, i guess you have a good income with minecraft :P
A11:25:17 <ONI> I could do that
A11:25:17 <citricsquid> LKA: Without surfacing.
A11:25:18 <UnknownX> Sounds bad

A11:33:45 <citricsquid> in the taskbar there's a little java icon
A11:33:46 <08Notch> Magnulus: Sure thing. =)
A11:33:49 <citricsquid> right click and it's there, I think
A11:33:57 <Joey90> ok I'll see
A11:34:13 <Magnulus> Oooh! So if there is then rain, would glass tiles get slippery?! ^_^
A11:34:24 <08Notch> yes, that's possible. =)
A11:34:30 <Elwebbaro> YE!
A11:34:35 <Xzalander> =)
A11:34:42 <citricsquid> java icon > right click > open control panel > settings (under temporary internet files) > delete files.
A11:34:46 <Veronika> So is there any possibility of stairs in the near-ish future?
A11:34:53 <Xzalander> Veronika we have them...
A11:35:01 <08Notch> Veronika: I don't know yet. I want them.
A11:35:01 <Xzalander> or do you mean stairs with half height steps?
A11:35:02 <Magnulus> Oh, wait. I guess I have one more: If you're planning weather, are you planning on having it affect water levels?
A11:35:16 <08Notch> I'm considering weather, not planning it yet.
A11:35:17 <PuyoDead> yea, what citric said
A11:35:22 <Veronika> Basically anything that can be walked up smoothly without having to jump.
A11:35:23 <Magnulus> Ah yes.
A11:35:27 <Joey90> thanks :)
A11:35:29 <Joey90> worked
A11:35:32 <Xzalander> ah I see what you mean now mm
A11:35:33 <08Notch> and yes, possibly. :D

A11:35:39 <PuyoDead> heh
A11:35:41 <UnknownX> Notch: Can we have dough?
A11:35:42 <Magnulus> Anyway, you've done a great job so far. Looking forward to seeing it progress. ^_^

A11:36:19 <zagabar> Notch: Will it be possible with modding to add a mob that is one tile high and 2 tiles long that chases the players and stings them, thus poisoning them? They should grow(spawn) on bushlike tiles that slowly spreads over the map, spawning more of the mobs. They would look like this picture: http://en.wiki.nosebud.de/wiki/Image:Pallkars.png  But this image is 2d, and the minecraft ingame thing would be 3d.
A11:36:21 <Xzalander> Notch is there anything stopping me from paying again for the game?

A11:40:53 <Xzalander> Ok cause considering Ive paid only £8.50 odd for Minecraft im willing to pay more when its finished I think :D
A11:41:05 <08Notch> wow, awesome. :D
A11:41:24 <08Notch> you can also donate by just paypaling money to markus@mojang.com if you want to. But you don't have to. =D

A11:42:09 <fydo> Notch: so, you going to add some sweet shaders? ;)
A11:42:20 <fydo> I ate too much dinner last night
A11:42:20 <08Notch> no shaders! Opengl 1.2 for the victory!
A11:42:22 <PuyoDead> "Your musical compatibility with Quatroking is Very High"
A11:42:24 <PuyoDead> WHAT
A11:42:34 <08Notch> now: pigs
A11:42:35 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: haha, and he's a weaboo fag!

A11:43:04 <PuyoDead> "Music you have in common includes Oingo Boingo, The Bloodhound Gang, the pillows, Bis and The Seatbelts. "

A11:43:31 <Xzalander> Who wants to get totgether for a big build project of somekind?
A11:43:35 <Jakkarra> i do!
A11:43:39 <Jakkarra> :D
A11:43:47 <KatamariManatee> Notch: There should be a one in four chance you can get poisoned by eating mushrooms in survival mode!
A11:43:54 <PuyoDead> you're just jealous of danny elfman, admit it!
A11:43:55 <Xzalander> Anybody else?
A11:44:01 <Jakkarra> ill do it as well!
A11:44:03 <08Notch> good idea
A11:44:11 <Jakkarra> we should get notch to come!
A11:44:14 <Jakkarra> he is awsum!
A11:44:19 <Jakkarra> also, i has hax now
A11:44:23 <08Notch> fydo: Well, kinda. It plays on my Eee PC now, and I've got hopes for a (very scaled down) Android port
A11:44:35 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: "rock band Oingo Boingo". Rock? wat.
A11:44:43 <Xzalander> setting up me server then
A11:44:49 <fydo> Notch: hey, that's pretty cool
A11:45:00 <PuyoDead> applies about as much as rock band beatles
A11:45:19 <fydo> Notch: though you can always test for extensions and use them if they are available
A11:45:43 <08Notch> i could, yeah. I'm trying to stay away from fancy graphics, though. It's a time wasting ninja thief.
A11:45:44 <fydo> anyways, just suggestions, I know you already have a huge todo list
A11:46:00 <KatamariManatee> Notch, ports to handhelds please? (DSI FTW)
A11:46:03 <Veronika> Any chance of you making a public todo list and changelog?
A11:46:22 <08Notch> Veronika: It changes too much for me to dare promise details
A11:46:31 <fydo> public changelog would be cool, but I don't think publishing the todo list wouldn't be a good idea
A11:46:39 <08Notch> I try to document changes as much as I can during releases
A11:46:40 <fydo> er, oops on the double negative
A11:46:58 <Jakkarra> put a linky in the chat for me, im busy at this sec

P12:20:39 <Soviet82> can anybody tell me how to create my own server please?
P12:20:52 <Dudebro> Instructions are included in the download
P12:21:02 <Dudebro> what specifically do you need help with?
P12:21:06 <Soviet82> i followed it... but i can't connect to it
P12:21:22 <Dudebro> uhhh
P12:21:22 <Marach> its clearly visible on test signs pic, both look distorted
P12:21:23 <Dudebro> idk
P12:21:26 <Soviet82> it keeps telling me unable to connect - the server might be down
P12:21:52 <Marach> you should put a setting for it, like in most fps games
P12:22:26 <08Notch> Marach: Because I liked the effect, mostly
P12:22:55 <08Notch> it pulls the view pack a couple of inches before rendering, causing a parallax effect when looking around
P12:23:15 <gear|grunt> i dont tihnk i ever even noticed
P12:23:30 <08Notch> it's meant to be subtle, so that's a good thing.
P12:24:26 <Marach> its not subtle for me ;/ for me, its somitimes even disturbing
P12:24:54 <Marach> its the first thing i ever noticed when p,ayed minecraft first time
P12:24:59 <gear|grunt> maybe something is rendering weird for you

P1:44:40 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch, I love the signs, but they are going to cause lots of problems in multiplayer. They will be a great target for greifing, but making them hard to take down would be bad as well because of he people who would try to advertise or write profane stuff on them
P1:45:03 <fleshBasedProcessor> maybe only be able to build them if your an op or on that server for > 2 hours?
P1:45:28 <Dudebro> Maybe only 5 signs up at a time per person?
P1:45:42 <08Notch> it's very likely they'll be op only in creative mode
P1:46:53 <ChJees> Notch, DOOORS
P1:47:01 <liq3> Notch: That's probably the best way to go. Anyone who's not an op that needs a sign, can just ask an op to make one.

P3:06:39 <PuyoDead> yea, the server browser is a bit lacking
P3:08:15 <citricsquid> play online > all > United kingdom 
P3:08:25 <citricsquid> and then the second server down should be "BCS fun tracks" or something like that.
P3:08:34 <PuyoDead> hmm, ok
P3:08:34 <citricsquid> has about 20 players in, that's the server :)
P3:08:41 <PuyoDead> I might have been on that one before, actually
P3:08:45 <citricsquid> "BCS FunTastic".
P3:10:52 <PuyoDead> interesting, now every time I run TM, it removes one of my shortcuts from my favorites list, renames it, and places a second (non-working) trackman shortcut in the list
P3:12:03 <citricsquid> silly steam :(
P3:12:04 <Quatroking> wow.
P3:12:12 <Quatroking> people actually used that "trusted list".

P3:35:21 <Eagle> Kirby Super Star on the wii
P3:35:29 <PuyoDead> god lord, dissidia is huge
P3:35:30 <Quatroking> if you download it through homebrew browser you only get episode one which is still about six levels plus boss
P3:35:33 <Quatroking> YES
P3:35:37 <Quatroking> KIRBY SUPERSTAR
P3:35:41 <Quatroking> and yoshi's island
P3:35:46 <Eagle> Which one
P3:35:51 <Eagle> SNES or N64
P3:35:52 <Magnulus> There were many games I enjoyed before that, and I had friends who anticipated games like Quake, but my heart waited for Jazz 2.
P3:35:54 <Quatroking> snes
P3:35:57 <Quatroking> n64 sucked
P3:36:04 <Eagle> I have that one on the GBA
P3:36:11 <Eagle> On the homebrew channel
P3:36:18 <Quatroking> get the original snes one
P3:36:23 <Eagle> Aren't they the same?
P3:36:24 <PuyoDead> kirby's dream course it pretty fun, too
P3:36:43 <PuyoDead> and yea Eagle, they are
P3:36:49 <Eagle> I have that one but I haven't played it
P3:36:50 <Quatroking> eagle: why would you run a port using emulation if you can play the original through emulation
P3:37:03 <Magnulus> I remember when I friend showed me some kind of pre-release of Quake with no monsters in it. He threw a stick of dynamite and went "Look! Particles!" and I looked at him and said I couldn't see any particles... I could only see brown.
P3:37:11 <Magnulus> Brown, brown and more brown.
P3:37:19 <Quatroking> poop
P3:37:25 <Nalok> Real = Brown
P3:37:39 <Quatroking> real = insanse amounts of HDR and bloom
P3:37:43 <Quatroking> insane*
P3:37:46 <Eagle> FFV is surprisingly very good
P3:37:47 <Magnulus> BROWN HDR and bloom!
P3:37:49 <Eagle> ... On the wii :P
P3:38:08 <Quatroking> actually
P3:38:16 <Quatroking> I only play homebrew and roms on my wii
P3:38:21 <Quatroking> and I watch the news on it
P3:38:34 <Meizlizard> That's from a VG cats comic.
P3:38:37 <PuyoDead> I have the USB loader, so I've been playing a lot more wii games on it
P3:38:38 <Eagle> None of the actual homebrew games are any good
P3:38:44 <Eagle> :/
P3:38:44 <Meizlizard> The brown=real thing.
P3:38:48 <Magnulus> I love how games still to some degree use cinematic effects to look "real".
P3:38:50 <Quatroking> yep
P3:39:04 <Quatroking> [Prototype] is a great example of that
P3:39:08 <Magnulus> I've seen that VG cats comic, yeah.
P3:39:10 <fydo> depth of field is great
P3:39:14 <Eagle> That one 3D platformer is kinda nice but it's very unfinished
P3:39:16 <Quatroking> the cutscenes look almost real
P3:39:29 <Magnulus> Depth of field is fantastic, but it doesn't make things look REAL.
P3:39:37 <Magnulus> It makes them look more like a film.

P3:40:11 <Quatroking> eagle, turn your wii on
P3:40:16 <Magnulus> Because we know inherently and without thinking that games are not real, so we don't want them to look that way, either.
P3:40:16 <Quatroking> download openjazz
P3:40:19 <Eagle> The more realistic they try to make things the deeper it goes into the uncanny valley

P3:40:32 <PuyoDead> I just need a HDD for my wii, now
P3:40:36 <vede> Um, you know, some people LIKE realistic games.
P3:40:40 <vede> coughmecough
P3:40:41 <Quatroking> you're a newbie at gaming if you don't play jazz jackrabbit
P3:40:41 <Magnulus> We want them to look like the fake reality we have become accustomed to.
P3:40:51 <Eagle> Finefinefine
P3:41:03 <vede> Assuming that everyone wants games to be unrealistic is extremely stupid.
P3:41:16 <Magnulus> Who said everyone wants games to be unrealistic?
P3:41:18 <Eagle> No no no I'm all for realistic games, but they're trying too hard it seems
P3:41:26 <vede> Um, so?
P3:41:29 <Eagle> I don't care if real life is brown
P3:41:35 <Eagle> That is not interesting and fun in a game
P3:42:00 <Magnulus> And also: real life is NOT brown, so that would be a bunk argument, anyway.

P3:42:10 <Eagle> Just trying to make a point
P3:42:11 <Quatroking> THE HALO 1 PHYSICS ARE SOOOO REALISTICC
P3:42:13 <vede> Lots of stuff in real life is brown.
P3:42:14 <ONI> thats about it
P3:42:18 <Magnulus> There's a fantastic quote in a book called Red Mars.
P3:42:28 <vede> The standard color for "dirtiness" is brown.
P3:42:42 <ONI> becaus edirt is brown
P3:42:47 <vede> Exactly.
P3:42:51 <Magnulus> They're looking at a Martian sunset and remark that nature has no taste.
P3:43:01 <Magnulus> Nature is gaudy and full of colours.
P3:43:09 <ONI> in reality Earth is Blue
P3:43:20 <ONI> if you look at the big picture
P3:43:24 <Magnulus> Pinks and greens and blues and yellows. It's insane.
P3:43:30 <vede> If you make lots of stuff brown, there's a base concept that the game world is dirty and nasty, not pleasant and green.
P3:43:43 <vede> It only falls apart when you actually start to be meta about it.
P3:43:58 <Quatroking> Eagle, are you downloading OpenJazz already
P3:44:07 <Eagle> Oh hey they just updated the apps
P3:44:09 <Magnulus> Of course, what you REALLY need to make a dirty and nasty world isn't brown, it's contrast and low-key lighting.

P4:01:19 <Quatroking> "Jazz Jackrabbit was created by Cliff Bleszinski and Arjan Brussee, and inspired by classic console games such as Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, and especially the fast-paced Sonic the Hedgehog."
P4:01:19 <Eagle> The furry main character, the powerups inside TVs, the graphics, the spring things
P4:01:26 <Eagle> I see
P4:01:52 <Quatroking> the whole speed thing is sonic-inspired, yeah
P4:01:54 <Magnulus> Furry?
P4:01:56 <Quatroking> and its done lovely
P4:02:07 <Magnulus> I would call Sonic prickly rather than furty.
P4:02:10 <Magnulus> FURTY?!
P4:02:12 <Magnulus> Whaaat?
P4:02:15 <Quatroking> fruity
P4:02:21 <Magnulus> Sonic was a total fruit.

P7:10:05 <PuyoDead> oh, I see. nevermind
P7:10:17 <Quatroking> Heh
P7:10:36 <Quatroking> Minecraft of course, I wouldn't pay for such a thing like a snes emulator
P7:10:41 <Fonzi_254> Storms are freaky
P7:10:44 <PuyoDead> yea, I was really confused
P7:10:57 <Quatroking> Have you played freddi fish yet, on your wii
P7:11:03 <PuyoDead> no
P7:11:05 <Quatroking> they're supported by ScummVM
P7:11:05 <Fonzi_254> Hey
P7:11:08 <Quatroking> :P
P7:11:20 <Fonzi_254> Does Java work on the Wii?
P7:11:26 <Quatroking> Nope

P7:11:42 <Quatroking> Oh.
P7:11:46 <Quatroking> Erm
P7:11:46 <Fonzi_254> I got a wii For my B-Day
P7:11:52 <Fonzi_254> Which is in a few days
P7:12:07 <Fonzi_254> :)!
P7:12:07 <Quatroking> chipmod of softwarehack?
P7:12:32 <Fonzi_254> u need to by a certain Zelda game to hack it
P7:12:45 <Quatroking> o rly
P7:12:48 <PuyoDead> that won't work if you get a newer copy
P7:12:48 <Quatroking> Guess what
P7:13:02 <PuyoDead> plus, a more effective method is out now
P7:13:02 <Fonzi_254> Newer copy of the game?
P7:13:08 <Fonzi_254> Really?
P7:13:09 <Quatroking> I doubt they update the Wii firmware for every new unit they sell tho
P7:13:10 <Fonzi_254> What is it?
P7:13:24 <PuyoDead> bannerbomb
P7:13:32 <Quatroking> newer copy of the firmware
P7:13:32 <Fonzi_254> Bannerbomb?
P7:13:49 <Quatroking> Twilighthack works great tho
P7:13:50 <PuyoDead> basically exploits the new SD card functionality
P7:13:52 <Fonzi_254> Link me to a place where it can show me how to hax it that way
P7:14:03 <PuyoDead> yea, but for those that have a newer updated wii, it's not an option
P7:14:05 <Quatroking> Wiibrew.org
P7:14:10 <PuyoDead> just a sec...

P7:14:49 <PuyoDead> http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=171901
P7:14:57 <Quatroking> But just to clear it up, hacking a Wii isn't really that spectacular these days :P
P7:15:02 <Fonzi_254> Does bannerbomb work as good as the Twilight Hack?
P7:15:17 <PuyoDead> yea, it's really not that "clean" of a process
P7:15:28 <PuyoDead> yea, it's pretty much the same thing, in terms of what it does
P7:15:33 <Quatroking> I really hate my little brother to update to 1,4
P7:15:46 <Quatroking> screwed up the .wad installer
P7:15:56 <PuyoDead> weird
P7:16:12 <Fonzi_254> So which one would you recomend? Twilight or Bannerbomb hack?
P7:16:15 <Quatroking> Unless they have a new one out, of course

P7:16:36 <Jakkarra> Hey
P7:16:40 <PuyoDead> well, if you're getting a new wii, there's a good chance it'll come with 4.1 pre-installed
P7:16:48 <Jakkarra> who wants a Wii?
P7:17:03 <PuyoDead> hence, you won't be able to use the twilight hack
P7:17:11 <Quatroking> People who don't give a fuck about power and just want to play a nice casual game once in a while?
P7:17:13 <PuyoDead> you planned this, didn't you Jakkarra?
P7:17:16 <Fonzi_254> So which one would you recomend? Twilight or Bannerbomb hack?
P7:17:34 <Quatroking> i only have experience with twilighthack
P7:17:41 <Fonzi_254> ok
P7:17:58 <Quatroking> Which worked flawless, but then again, that was back in Wii Firmware V1.1
P7:18:01 <PuyoDead> just go to that above link, it's about the simplest method there is
P7:18:02 <Fonzi_254> But with the Twilight hack i have to buy Zelda: Twilight Princess
P7:18:05 <Quatroking> I have no idea how it works currently
P7:18:07 <Fonzi_254> Which is $75
P7:18:11 <PuyoDead> yea, nothing wrong with that
P7:18:12 <Quatroking> the fuck?
P7:18:20 <PuyoDead> whoa, aussie?

P7:18:24 <Fonzi_254> Yea
P7:18:29 <Fonzi_254> Im from australia
P7:18:46 <Quatroking> Wow, they sell Twilight around here for about 30 euro's or something
P7:18:58 <Quatroking> and normally we're the ones getting ripped off, in the EU
P7:19:09 <PuyoDead> get pick up a used one, the older the better, anyway
