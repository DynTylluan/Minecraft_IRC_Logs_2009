A12:35:55 <Darkebrz> Hello Nalok
A12:35:59 <Super-Dot> My dad the system administrator doesn't want to port forward until he knows that it won't endanger our datas.
A12:36:13 <Super-Dot> Where can I find information on the potential dangers?
A12:36:39 <citricsquidatlan> opening ports is like putting a naked child in a cage with a convicted sex offender, bad things will happen!
A12:36:44 <citricsquidatlan> trust me, I'm at a lan.
A12:36:57 <Nalok> Is the NG server up Citric?
A12:37:03 <citricsquidatlan> should be
A12:37:06 <Darkebrz> I like to do nice things for people just so I can think of myself as a nice person then tell other people I'm a nice person making me feel like a nice person
A12:37:24 <mail2345> oh, come on, there are bigger targets than MC.
A12:37:33 <mail2345> anyway, just ask you dad to isolate your comp
A12:37:40 <mail2345> from the rest of the network :P
A12:37:42 <Darkebrz> Hm
A12:38:00 <Darkebrz> I also notice that I am often ignored by people that are being productive
A12:38:50 <Darkebrz> Or simply that most people do not constantly check IRC like I do
A12:39:02 <Darkebrz> Or they do and just tune me out because I am an annoying 12 year old

A1:00:24 <Darkebrz> I have no games to snatch/get
A1:00:30 <LG_Legacy> Hm
A1:00:43 <LG_Legacy> IF you're into those basic rpg games, look into Angband

A1:03:01 <LG_Legacy> That would be my situation

A1:03:12 <LG_Legacy> Though
A1:03:15 <LG_Legacy> If you want a game
A1:03:21 <LG_Legacy> I highly suggest getting an emulator
A1:03:29 <LG_Legacy> Countless hours can be wasted playing old-school games
A1:03:35 <Darkebrz> I do have an emulator
A1:03:41 <LG_Legacy> Get another
A1:03:44 <LG_Legacy> Or

A1:25:57 <Darkebrz> Well
A1:26:05 <Darkebrz> Why would I have those?

A1:26:31 <Darkebrz> No
A1:26:39 <Darkebrz> Why would I have Doom/Doom2
A1:26:54 <LG_Legacy> Because you need it
A1:27:17 <Darkebrz> Okay
A1:27:23 <LG_Legacy> Heres how it works
A1:27:27 <Darkebrz> I understand

A2:07:12 <LG_Legacy> It gets even more awesome in skulltag
A2:07:20 <LG_Legacy> Skulltag features a 3D OpenGL Mode
A2:07:22 <LG_Legacy> In which
A2:07:32 <LG_Legacy> Some lucky bastard is abusing the hell out of it and creating a HDR Mod out of it
A2:08:16 <LG_Legacy> If you want a look at the HDR Mod, check it out: http://skulltag.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=156704#p156704
A2:08:23 <LG_Legacy> It pushes the engine to it's core limits
A2:08:46 <Darkebrz> Well
A2:08:50 <Darkebrz> I will
A2:08:54 <Darkebrz> AFTER I beat Doom

A2:21:37 <LG_Legacy> Do me a favor, sticky my FAQ.
A2:21:48 <LG_Legacy> If you want, add some to it if you want.
A2:24:01 <maver> Is the game eventually going to be pay2play only?
A2:26:17 <LG_Legacy> What?
A2:26:19 <LG_Legacy> Doubtful
A2:26:38 <LG_Legacy> I believe notch will leave it free except for some things being Pay-for only
