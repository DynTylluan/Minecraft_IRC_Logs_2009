P2:42:45 <dickdong> And instead went to moordrecht
P2:42:45 <Azrael-> PROTIP: You can write 'particle accelerator', and when you interact with it it spawns a black hole.
P2:42:56 <Azrael-> Probably gets you more style points than just spawning a black hole directly.
P2:42:56 <Eagle> Oh hey it worked. Thanks.
P2:42:58 <dickdong> Azrael, or just spawn a black hole

P3:01:47 <Azrael-> ^
P3:01:58 <Snowman> All software should be free imho :p

P3:02:20 <doohan> Snowman, that makes alot of fun software less likely to happen
P3:02:25 <Snowman> oh well
P3:02:32 <citricsquid> lol
P3:02:34 <Snowman> Take all money from religion and put it there
P3:02:35 <doohan> Money has to come from somewhere
P3:02:40 <Azrael-> Snowman, you are so right.
P3:02:46 <citricsquid> brb I'll just make a fl- oh I'll make a websi- oh shit.
P3:02:55 <doohan> And not every product can be made with a service or support contract
P3:03:09 <citricsquid> Nothing should be free, but nobody should be obligated to charge.
P3:03:14 <Azrael-> This just in: COMMUNISM.
P3:03:16 <Eagle> What can catch falling objects in Scribblenauts?
P3:03:23 <Azrael-> Eagle, 'net'.
P3:03:24 <Snowman> Oh Azrael shut it
P3:03:29 <TheOne> spiderman?
P3:03:30 <Eagle> I have nothing to attach it to.
P3:03:32 <doohan> Azrael-, you show me where communism is working just now.
P3:03:36 <citricsquid> Eagle: pole!
P3:03:39 <Eagle> :O
P3:03:45 <PuyoDead> lasso maybe, if you have good aim
P3:03:48 <Snowman> I hate Americans for being super scared of socialism
P3:03:53 <Azrael-> doohan, in many small communities.
P3:03:54 <Eagle> I'll go over par though!
P3:04:03 <doohan> Socialism != communism
P3:04:04 <PuyoDead> Snowman, that's just the idiots shouting the loudest
P3:04:06 <Azrael-> How about an airship?
P3:04:09 <Eagle> Two poles plus net plus ladder = 1 over par
P3:04:11 <PuyoDead> we're not all that stupid
P3:04:14 <Snowman> I know it isn't socialism is milder
P3:04:26 <doohan> I still want paying for my work
P3:04:26 <Eagle> Airship?
P3:04:34 <Eagle> Airships catch stuff?
P3:04:36 <Azrael-> Airship. Blimp. Large flying object.
P3:04:38 <doohan> I also like the fact that I get paid more for not bieng stupid.
P3:04:44 <Eagle> Will it fly without me in it?
P3:04:46 <Azrael-> If you drop something on top of it, it won't fall through.
P3:04:49 <Azrael-> No, it won't.
P3:05:00 <Azrael-> So what's the level?
P3:05:00 <doohan> I don't like that I pay for lazy sods that don't want to work.
P3:05:02 <Eagle> I kinda need to be somewhere to push the button to make the starite drop though.
P3:05:04 <Azrael-> I have my DS with me.
P3:05:09 <Snowman> Eagle, what level?
P3:05:09 <citricsquid> doohan: oh hello there.
P3:05:09 <doohan> I don't mind paying for people that can't work.
P3:05:13 <Eagle> 1-11

P3:05:25 <Eagle> TABLE
P3:05:26 <Eagle> Yes
13P3:05:29 * citricsquid doesn't claim benefits or shit so it's all good bro

P3:05:34 <doohan> Sorry citricsquid, but you're not stupid in that sense. You've got skills that you can use.
P3:05:42 <Snowman> then catch the starite in mid air
P3:05:48 <Azrael-> I think I put a ramp on top of the spike.
P3:05:48 <PuyoDead> oh yea, I did the table thing there
P3:05:59 <Azrael-> (still starting up scribblenauts, not sure if i'm thinking of the same level)
P3:06:12 <citricsquid> I rage quit scribblenauts after getting lost on the first level

P3:06:18 <PuyoDead> then I dropped a boulder on the switch, and just jumped out at the same time the starite fell
P3:06:19 <Snowman> lol fail citric
P3:06:24 <citricsquid> also life needs automcomplete, keep trying to do it on forums and msn now
P3:06:24 <doohan> What I was trying to say though is that if you work hard generally you get something out of it.
P3:06:28 <Snowman> same puyo, only I dropped a brick :p
P3:06:30 <citricsquid> like then, tried to auto complete scribblenauts.
P3:06:55 <citricsquid> doohan: my dad works 12 hours a day and gets to fund his alcoholism, life ftw.
P3:06:56 <Azrael-> Yeah, I put a ramp on top of the spike.
P3:07:10 <Snowman> citricsquid, kill him
P3:07:24 <Azrael-> Also, you can easily fly directly below the starite and drop a rock on the button.

P3:08:23 <Eagle> I'm not so good at flying. :P
P3:08:32 <Eagle> I blame the controls
P3:08:39 <Azrael-> Try 'wings', 'helibackpack' or 'jetpack'
P3:08:51 <Eagle> Jetpack I use the most.
P3:08:57 <Eagle> It doesn't let me just hover in midair though.
P3:09:01 <Snowman> Try tacgnol
P3:09:07 <Azrael-> 'longcat' works, I know.
P3:09:11 <Azrael-> Does tacgnol?
P3:09:17 <Snowman> dunno
P3:09:19 <Eagle> tacgnol makes a black longcat
P3:09:20 <Snowman> heard it I think
P3:09:21 <Eagle> I tried it.
P3:09:28 <Azrael-> Nice.
P3:09:39 <Azrael-> I like just playing around on the title screen.

P3:11:10 <Eagle> Sun + Space background = :/?
P3:11:16 <Azrael-> Snowman, oh yes it is.
P3:11:16 <Eagle> Rick Astley is too in
P3:11:21 <doohan> I like using the teleporter
P3:11:23 <Snowman> Oh It's rick roll
P3:11:29 <Azrael-> If you can't spell it, 'rickroll' also works.
P3:11:31 <Eagle> Teleporter takes me to mars most of the time.
P3:11:42 <Azrael-> I usually end up in 5th Cell HQ
P3:11:49 <Eagle> I never go there.
P3:11:50 <Eagle> :(
P3:12:04 <Snowman> Over ninethousand gives a monocle/scouter
P3:12:07 <Eagle> Just like the time machine always takes me to Midevil times.
P3:12:30 <Azrael-> Snowman, I think that's because 'over' is a word in another language
P3:12:40 <PuyoDead> teleporter took me to a room with all the developers once
P3:12:46 <Azrael-> Yeah, 5th Cell HQ
P3:13:01 <Eagle> PARTICLE ACCELERATOR keeps killing me. :(
P3:13:06 <Eagle> I don't have enough time to ruuun
P3:13:11 <Azrael-> Anybody tried the level editor?
P3:13:15 <Snowman> HEV suit gives a suit :p
P3:13:15 <Azrael-> Doesn't seem very powerful or fun.
P3:13:24 <Azrael-> hazmat suit gives an HEV suit
P3:13:37 <Azrael-> Snowman, if it only recognises one of the words, it will just use that one.
P3:13:43 <Snowman> AARG
P3:13:50 <Snowman> Anti-Mass spectrometer isnt in
P3:13:50 <Azrael-> For example, when confronted with 'HEV suit' it will just think you mean a type of suit.
P3:13:59 <Azrael-> What about mass spectrometer?
P3:14:03 <Azrael-> Because that's a real thing.
P3:14:19 <Snowman> Anti-mass spectrometer is from hl
P3:14:24 <Azrael-> I'm aware of that.
P3:14:33 <Azrael-> But my point still stands.
P3:14:43 <Snowman> no mass spectrometer

P3:15:12 <Eagle> I tried mass spectrometer
P3:15:20 <Azrael-> 'higgs boson', 'gluon', 'quark', etc. all give you a tiny little particle

P3:16:51 <Snowman> Squid you can
P3:16:54 <Azrael-> You can spawn a kraken if you want.
P3:16:55 <citricsquid> awesome

P3:18:53 <Azrael-> (protip: "suspension bridge" is longer than "bridge" and so is better for gap-crossing)
P3:19:03 <Snowman> I used a 3 planks and glue
P3:19:09 <PuyoDead> road is also a good one
P3:19:14 <Snowman> citricsquid join a server already

P3:19:34 <citricsquid> level 1 complete
P3:19:39 <Azrael-> lolol
P3:19:42 <PuyoDead> probably about as much as the susspension bridge, but it's just a thin slab
P3:19:42 <Snowman> is that the tree one?
P3:19:50 <Azrael-> Yes, gardens
P3:19:59 <Azrael-> Unless he's talking about the academy; that's level 0
P3:20:03 <Snowman> you can cut down the tree with a beaver :D
P3:20:13 <Azrael-> also woodchipper
P3:20:50 <Azrael-> Also you can give a jigsaw to the lumberjack.
P3:21:35 <citricsquid> caught the butterfly :D
P3:21:43 <Iguana> ?
P3:21:48 <Iguana> I like butterflies. :D
P3:22:03 <Azrael-> Catch it with a grappling hook, or an airship and a net.
P3:22:11 <Azrael-> Both awesome methods.
P3:22:15 <PuyoDead> or a tranquilizer gun
P3:22:16 <Azrael-> Also I think it was a ladybug.
P3:22:54 <Azrael-> Protip: if you don't want rough matches (ie. "hev suit" -> "suit"), leave out the spaces.

P3:50:51 <Quatroking> Welcome to the minecraft IRC. today, we discuss PASSWORD DRAMA
P3:50:53 <AlexVMiner> I have a server up on weekends
P3:50:55 <citricsquid> then continued doing it, even AFTER being kicked.

P3:51:05 <AlexVMiner> Citric
P3:51:13 <AlexVMiner> do you know who was ghosting me?
P3:51:14 <Eagle> It was Quatro and Chemo that did it multiple times.

P3:51:19 <AlexVMiner> Oh
P3:51:20 <Quatroking> no?

P3:52:23 <AlexVMiner> Who did it twice?
P3:52:29 <Darkebrz> I DID!
P3:52:30 <Quatroking> chemo did three times or something
P3:52:34 <Eagle> Chemo did it every time that wasn't me and Quatro
P3:52:35 <vede> Chemo went insane with it.
P3:52:44 <Eagle> I did it, Quatro did it, and Chemo did it like fifty times
P3:52:57 <vede> And then Eagle went insane with the hyperbole.
P3:52:57 <Quatroking> chemo probably didn't do it though
P3:53:00 <Quatroking> lol
P3:53:00 <AlexVMiner> That is because I hate CHemo and he hates me
