A12:50:44 <Super-Dot> So JTE, I /still/ haven't convinced my dad that port forwarding isn't a security risk when you do it right
A12:50:53 <JTE> Ouch.
A12:51:06 <Super-Dot> It's a bit of a bother
A12:51:07 <Eagle> How do you portforward wrong? O.o
A12:51:10 <mail2345> err
A12:51:12 <mail2345> range
A12:51:17 <mail2345> 1-65356
A12:51:19 <mail2345> or something
A12:51:22 <mail2345> :P
A12:51:29 <JTE> I prefer 0-65535
A12:51:33 <UnknownX> Port forwarding is basically never a risk
A12:51:37 <mail2345> ahh, that;s what I was aiming for
A12:51:37 <Super-Dot> The problem is that he doesn't understand how port forwarding works
A12:51:43 <mail2345> unless you open a retarded port
A12:51:44 <mail2345> like
A12:51:45 <Super-Dot> So I need to explain it to him
A12:51:46 <mail2345> 139
A12:51:51 <mail2345> 139 = retard port
A12:51:54 <UnknownX> Who even uses a port to hack someone anyway?
A12:52:01 <Super-Dot> But I don't fully understand how it works
A12:52:02 <Eagle> Why is 139 a retarded port?
A12:52:06 <UnknownX> They mostly never work
A12:52:17 <mail2345> massive security hole is massive

A12:52:28 <Eagle> uh
A12:52:33 <Eagle> >.>
A12:52:33 <UnknownX> 139 is a massive hole?
A12:52:33 <mail2345> goddam consumers, being appealed by superfical value
A12:52:47 <Super-Dot> I need a reputable source that says "hey port forwarding isn't a risk"
A12:52:50 <mail2345> err
A12:52:56 <mail2345> hmm
A12:53:07 <UnknownX> Hey port forwarding isn't a risk!
A12:53:08 <mail2345> go make a nice svg diagram of how portfowrading works
A12:53:10 <Super-Dot> "when you do it right"
A12:53:13 <UnknownX> Show that to him
A12:53:16 <mail2345> as in not open
A12:53:17 <mail2345> port 139
A12:53:23 <mail2345> or any other ports of fail
A12:53:29 <Eagle> That's all the chart is
A12:53:30 <Super-Dot> I don't want to make a /diagram/ D:
A12:53:32 <UnknownX> What is 139?
A12:53:37 <Eagle> "DON'T OPEN PORT 139!"
A12:53:53 <mail2345> 139 = NetBIOS port

A8:06:14 <iPope> would of been funny
A8:06:40 <iPope> someone just said that 99% if fp gets photoshop illegally :'( I didnt
A8:07:03 <Underd0g> How do I cover all layers in a map (with Omen) with stone? Is there a fast way or do I have to manually fill every layer?
A8:07:17 <PuyoDead> 99%? someone pulled that number out of their dog's ass
A8:07:41 <PuyoDead> Underd0g, there's the Flood Fill 3d tool
A8:08:04 <Underd0g> What's the difference between the 2D and the 3D one?
A8:08:30 <PuyoDead> 2D will fill the same material within that layer you're on
A8:09:11 <PuyoDead> 3D will fill that material, plus any of the same material connected from nearby layers
A8:09:33 <Underd0g> Thanks
A8:09:49 <PuyoDead> so, say you open a normal generated map, and flood fill 3d stone somewhere along the ground. it'll replace all stone touching that layer

A8:17:10 <geekahedron> so they both flood, just one moves slower?

A9:55:48 <geekahedron> there was "goof troop," but there was also " a goofy movie" and "an extremely goofy movie"
A9:56:05 <Underd0g> I seem to get an error sometimes on my server. It's never happened before and I don't know what's causing it. All of a sudden alot of text appears in the server window and everyone is like disconnected (still on, but mot moving)
A9:56:14 <Underd0g> Anyone knows what could be wrong?
A9:56:26 <geekahedron> reading the text that appears will probably help
A9:56:27 <citricsquid> what is the text that appears?
A9:56:34 <citricsquid> haha
A9:57:15 <Underd0g> That's funny, geek. It's over 50 lines probably, but I'll try to read it the next time. I'm just curious if someone has experienced anything like this before

A9:58:16 <Underd0g> Log doesn't say anything since I've rebooted the server since the last time it happened, but I'll post it the next time
A9:58:27 <citricsquid> rebooting shouldn't clear the log.

A10:15:14 <r4dio> ok guys , what's the max size for a map on minecraft'
A10:15:24 <LG_Legacy> Over 9000
A10:15:58 <r4dio> ...
A10:16:13 <r4dio> cmonn
10A10:16:19 * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) has joined #minecraft
A10:16:23 <fleshBasedProcessor> I think the max on any one dimension is 1024
A10:16:23 <citricsquid> uh
A10:16:38 <citricsquid> it's limited by what your server can handle, but after a certain height it fucks up
A10:16:38 <fleshBasedProcessor> and that is with the other dimension 64x64 I think
A10:17:17 <fleshBasedProcessor> so I think the answer is 4194304
A10:17:24 <fleshBasedProcessor> m^3
A10:17:56 <fleshBasedProcessor> but don't quote me on that
A10:18:07 <aera> the protocol allows maps up to 4294967296 blocks
A10:18:18 <Quatroking> someone quickly give me a pic of notch
A10:18:26 <aera> but that's only technically; in reality, it depends on the client
A10:18:32 <LG_Legacy> A big guy with a beard
A10:18:37 <aera> still, in theory you can have up to 1024x1024x1024
A10:18:59 <r4dio> okk
A10:19:01 <r4dio> thanks
A10:19:12 <Leyart> But with omen i Can't go past 256
A10:19:20 <Leyart> if i put 1024 it wil crash
A10:19:27 <iPope> http://filesmelt.com/downloader/notch_red1.png
A10:19:28 <aera> because loading a map that size into memory is quite difficult
A10:19:34 <iPope> tada, had to build it again :(
A10:19:46 <Leyart> I have 4gb of ram
A10:20:02 <Leyart> even an Unreal 3 map is able to fit in such ram
A10:20:09 <aera> Leyart: yes, but java has a limited heap size
A10:20:15 <aera> you'll need to tell it to use more
A10:20:18 <aera> but I forget how
A10:20:23 <Leyart> if I increase the heap size it will work?
A10:20:30 <iPope> Its limited for us with only 1gb
A10:20:48 <citricsquid> what about: http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/8/22316212551-orig.jpg ;)
A10:20:54 <Snowman> Guys I'm gonna go

A10:45:20 <aera> ew, ass-licking

A10:45:32 <doohan> Would you like a spoon Visiiri?
A10:45:35 <geekahedron> skip the kissing and get right to the point
A10:45:51 <Visiiri> Andrew, where do you live?
A10:45:58 <aera> Visiiri: the UK, why?
A10:46:06 <Visiiri> British English.
A10:46:06 <aera> do I have to get my stalker-dar out?
A10:46:11 <Visiiri> It's the same in Australia.
A10:46:18 <Visiiri> But ass licking is so much nicer :D
A10:46:43 <aera> I'll leave that comment hanging.
A10:46:56 <geekahedron> the comment isn't all
A10:47:31 <Visiiri> :D
A10:47:36 <Visiiri> ><>M
A10:47:41 <aera> although according to my magic box, you're in Idaho
A10:47:46 <aera> after having moved from Oz
A10:47:49 <aera> which explains a lot
A10:48:08 <aera> actually, it doesn't, but it explains the british english thing
A10:48:40 <aera> still, if I ever do try and make a building-focused clone of minecraft, I'm sure this community will be the first to know

A10:49:37 <Asmageddon> Hi, anybody there>
A10:49:47 <Asmageddon> there?*
A10:49:47 <LG_Legacy> Why?
A10:49:53 <citricsquid> definitelty.
A10:50:00 <Leyart> How an i join my own hosted server?
A10:50:05 <Leyart> the old method does not work
A10:50:06 <Quatroking> doohan: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1673597/ircyes.png & http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1673597/ircno.png
A10:50:08 <Quatroking> how bout that
A10:50:11 <Asmageddon> I'm looking for someone, who could send me Dwarf Fortress->Minecraft converter
A10:50:23 <osici> is there one?
A10:50:38 <Asmageddon> I recently started playing DF, and I really enjoy some of the maps
A10:51:12 <Asmageddon> I've seen some topic on forum, but before I didn't ever seen DF, so I did not download it
A10:51:36 <osici> ah that topic was just a suggestion
A10:51:36 <doohan> Quatroking, that's awesome
A10:51:44 <osici> i don't think it exists yet
A10:51:45 <Quatroking> kay
A10:51:57 <doohan> Thanks :)
A10:52:18 <citricsquid> Quatroking: win.
A10:52:20 <Quatroking> no problem
A10:52:22 <doohan> Oh, make sure to sign it
A10:52:28 <citricsquid> Quatroking: that was what I expected from you.
A10:52:42 <Asmageddon> Hmm, would it be possible to write a custom server, that would work like another gamemode?
A10:52:53 <aera> Asmageddon: entirely possible.
A10:52:53 <Quatroking> citricsquid, sicne you like it so much, pay me back by putting more effort in getting the community back online
A10:52:59 <Quatroking> since*
A10:53:02 <citricsquid> Quatroking: hurr durr
A10:53:19 <aera> Asmageddon: however, us custom server writers are holding back from stepping on Notch's toes
A10:53:21 <doohan> citricsquid, is it still hte lack of a server that's the hold up?
A10:53:34 <citricsquid> yeah, waiting for client to pay me :|
A10:53:55 <Visiiri> D:
A10:53:58 <Asmageddon> I never wrote anything in java, and never wrote any network-based app, how hard it is?
A10:54:12 <gear|lololol> have you written these things in other languages?
A10:54:16 <osici> have you coded at all
A10:54:19 <Asmageddon> nope
A10:54:20 <doohan> You have a learning curve infront of you.
A10:54:23 <osici> hard
A10:54:24 <gear|lololol> then hard
A10:54:25 <Asmageddon> only some in C++ or C#
A10:54:25 <gear|lololol> lol
A10:54:27 <doohan> One that looks like this |
A10:54:28 <aera> Asmageddon: there's no need to write anything in Java - mine's in Python - but it's gonna be tough if you're that new
A10:54:29 <citricsquid> a very big learning curve
A10:54:44 <aera> i'm a networking veteran, and it took me at least 5 days
A10:54:53 <Asmageddon> I tought about modifying default server code
A10:55:02 <osici> It's not public
A10:55:25 <aera> Asmageddon: you can do that, but you can never distribute it
A10:55:29 <aera> since it would be illegal
A10:55:31 <Asmageddon> And did anybody ever wrote open source server?
A10:55:55 <osici> people who have written custom servers have not released them
A10:56:04 <Asmageddon> Or any server code, that I could download and play?
A10:56:11 <Asmageddon> oh, too bad
A10:56:19 <LG_Legacy> Except
A10:56:22 <LG_Legacy> Jte's i think
10A10:56:30 * kingnerd (kingnerd@92.81.31.139) has joined #minecraft
A10:56:33 <aera> no, JTE's was never released in a readable form
A10:56:38 <doohan> hahaha
A10:56:45 <doohan> Is that why he's not about anymore?
A10:56:55 <citricsquid> he's not about because he thinks we all hate him, afaik.
A10:57:06 <LG_Legacy> Meh..
A10:57:07 <doohan> He kept talking in the 3rd person
A10:57:15 <LG_Legacy> Jte went onto something different
A10:57:19 <doohan> Good times.
A10:57:24 <LG_Legacy> I don't blame him either >_>
A10:57:34 <aera> JTE was pretty much sidelined by everyone
A10:57:43 <aera> I don't blame him leaving
A10:57:50 <Asmageddon> aera, You said You wrote a server, could i ask You, what kind of server was that?
A10:58:05 <aera> Asmageddon: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f052712ff7a1f86b59f1b251c81aca25
A10:58:13 <citricsquid> He kept misunderstanding what I said to him. Told him he couldn't distribute IF he made it so that you could do things that Notch had planned for free and he went mad and said we were being dicks, or something like that :(
A10:58:17 <citricsquid> he was cool though D:
A10:58:36 <aera> citricsquid: yeah, I know how it played out, I've chatted with him
A10:58:52 <aera> I think there was some inflated egos on both sides, but nevermind
A10:58:59 <kingnerd> citricsquid, yeah, you guys kind of were being dicks to him... Especially Zuriki
A10:59:10 <kingnerd> His forum posts back when I used to read it didn't come across the me well at all
A10:59:33 <r4dio> i want an antigrief script :(
A10:59:41 <citricsquid> kingnerd: ugh, was I? I tried not to be, but he didn't seem to accept what I said. I was trying to make him understand that if he distributed it and it had the ability to provide paid to frees he'd be banned.

P12:29:28 <Quatroking> IPB these days is rather crappy
P12:29:34 <LG_Legacy> I don't mind Ipb
P12:29:36 <Quatroking> I loved IPB v1,3 tho
P12:29:39 <LG_Legacy> I use to work with a forum with ipb
P12:29:42 <tyteen4a03> IPB3 -_-
P12:29:47 <citricsquid> ugh, phpbb3 is so bloated.
P12:29:55 <tyteen4a03> and way too stupid
P12:30:09 <tyteen4a03> the permission setting is even worse than phpBB2
P12:30:24 <gear|lololol> permissions in bb3
P12:30:24 <citricsquid> phpbb2 isn't bad, but permissions on phpbb3... my god.
P12:30:26 <gear|lololol> are a nightmare
P12:30:27 <LG_Legacy> I prefer the permissions over phpbb2 :l
P12:30:28 <tyteen4a03> it eats my whole day just setting up the permissions
P12:30:33 <tyteen4a03> me too
P12:30:39 <tyteen4a03> I was like WTF?
P12:30:41 <LG_Legacy> Why am i the only one who likes setting those permissions?
P12:30:46 <citricsquid> tyteen4a03: yeah, it's so damn complicated, so much erroneous crap.
P12:30:51 <mail2345> putting peroggi as an admin is the main reason
P12:30:55 <mail2345> i don't trust WoM

P12:31:10 <LG_Legacy> I prefer: Doing shit the manual way
P12:31:13 <mail2345> that and a bit of mindfucking from the admins
P12:31:26 <tyteen4a03> [01:35] <LG_Legacy> Why am i the only one who likes setting those permissions?<I like to change them too,but phpBB3's permission is pure fail
P12:31:50 <tyteen4a03> it requires a whole lot more clicks than phpBB2 do
P12:31:50 <LG_Legacy> Thats why we have/had a topic for this griefer-list Mail
P12:31:56 <LG_Legacy> And so far it's doing quite well
P12:32:01 <citricsquid> phpbb3 is like, "Right, guests set as unable to post here." "Okay, now they can post here" ... 3 hours later, "okay no guests can post anywhere now".
P12:32:20 <Siiseli> haha
P12:32:23 <LG_Legacy> The only problem i ever had with phpbb3 is
P12:32:26 <tyteen4a03> 200% fail
P12:32:28 <LG_Legacy> No multi-delete users

P5:15:27 <citricsquid> you're allowed to make stuff for yourself, but distributing it is bad
P5:15:31 <citricsquid> and he's disallowed that
P5:15:55 <mail2345|afk> even the sprites
P5:16:16 <Moujave> I didn't say I made it.
P5:16:19 <mail2345|afk> ugh
P5:16:19 <Moujave> I know who did.
P5:16:24 <Moujave> and they are not here
P5:16:26 <mail2345|afk> does it even have
P5:16:32 <mail2345|afk> a little bit of notch's sprites
P5:16:42 <Moujave> no it doesn't
P5:16:54 <citricsquid> PM me a link, please.
P5:16:58 <Peroggi> mail stop asking questions you obviously just want to type in all caps omg omg then its illegal
P5:17:03 <mail2345|afk> send a screeny
P5:17:15 <Quatroking> Peroggi, go prove its not using Notch's code
P5:17:16 <mail2345|afk> and if you think that
P5:17:34 <mail2345|afk> i'm basely blabbing
P5:17:36 <Peroggi> I can do no such thing Quatro as I do not have a full understanding of the client or programming in general
P5:17:40 <mail2345|afk> go study copyright law
P5:17:53 <citricsquid> I'm still waiting for a link :)
P5:17:58 <Moujave> So what is the actual problem?
P5:18:09 <Moujave> The custom client or the server?
P5:18:15 <Peroggi> well I'm not giving you the link, you would not be able to access it anyway
P5:18:18 <Peroggi> its not public :O
P5:18:23 <mail2345|afk> ugh
P5:18:28 <citricsquid> peerkoel: Just because the forum is passworded
P5:18:30 <Moujave> Peroggi ease up.
P5:18:31 <mail2345|afk> i have a reasonable doubt that
P5:18:31 <citricsquid> that does not mean it's hidden
P5:18:35 <Moujave> trying to sort it out dude
P5:18:37 <citricsquid> which I assume is what you're getting at
P5:18:42 <Peroggi> kk sorry I let you handle it now
P5:18:47 <Peroggi> was just trying to help as little as I could XD
P5:18:50 <mail2345|afk> it is useing 0% of notch's code
P5:18:53 <citricsquid> if ANYONE but the CREATOR downloads it, IE the creator distributes it then THEY HAVE DONE WRONG. Understandable?
P5:18:53 <peerkoel> huh? I just tried the link
P5:18:54 <mail2345|afk> i mean 0

P5:21:14 <Peroggi> I'm pretty sure that has been outlined to us before citric
P5:21:20 <Quatroking> what the hell
P5:21:22 <peerkoel> you pe-tabbed the wrong nick
P5:21:28 <Peroggi> can make your own things do not distribute its illegal ect.
P5:21:38 <citricsquid> peerkoel: oh haha sorry <3
P5:21:38 <Quatroking> that "stand alone" client isnt' written from scratch, only the runner is
P5:21:46 <mail2345|afk> told you
P5:21:47 <Moujave> Anyway if you have a problem with it contact the owner of WoM

P5:21:55 <peerkoel> brilliant, as I just loaded the forum to see if it was working yet :)
P5:21:56 <citricsquid> Peroggi: Exactly, so that client you're distributing or talking about breaks this.
P5:22:15 <Peroggi> I am not distributing it citric I am just a moderator on WoM
10P5:22:28 * SENOR_QUE_NO_ARF is now known as Arf
P5:22:31 <Peroggi> please get into contact with the creators of the client and WoM as they will be able to clear this all up
P5:22:35 <citricsquid> Peroggi: Therefore you're involved in the distribution from my POV.
P5:22:44 <Peroggi> are you going to ban me again?

13P5:32:08 * citricsquid bans quatroking
P5:32:10 <Doohan> I mean that makes you complicit in providing it.
P5:32:19 <Quatroking> D:
P5:32:52 <Peroggi> All I have said is that I do not fully understand it, to get into contact with WoM staff and that I understand the terms of the agreement
P5:33:00 <citricsquid> "This child porn? It's okay, I can distribute it because I didn't make it and I don't fully understand it!"
P5:33:00 <Quatroking> Still, "Ya because you guys are all to grumpy. When someone actually wants to make sense of it contact TRIDDIN or the WoM community." and "Moujave (triddin@60-241-222-183.static.tpgi.com.au) has left #minecraft" made me chuckle.
P5:33:01 <Peroggi> not fully understand the client that is
P5:33:08 <vede> What are we arguing about?
P5:33:15 <Quatroking> vede: womanhood
P5:33:20 <Peroggi> internet law
P5:33:21 <mail2345|semi-afk> clients
P5:33:25 <citricsquid> vede: They're trying to justify distributing modified clients even though Notch said NOEZ.
P5:33:37 <vede> Uh, how can this even be argued?
P5:33:41 <mail2345|semi-afk> idk
P5:33:43 <Peroggi> citricsquid I have at no one point tried to justify distributing illegal programs
P5:33:45 <Zachariasmith> thats what im thinking
P5:33:45 <Doohan> Basicly it's theft, once you remove the need for notchs client
P5:33:49 <mail2345|semi-afk> by making such good points
P5:33:52 <vede> Notch said NO, therefore the people who say that you shouldn't do it are right.
P5:33:54 <Doohan> Theres no longer any need to pay for it.
P5:33:58 <mail2345|semi-afk> that they get embarrased and leave
P5:34:05 <Zachariasmith> Doohan is correct
P5:34:06 <Doohan> So you're being a bunch of douches.
P5:34:07 <mail2345|semi-afk> who knows, notch might ad adds
P5:34:10 <Quatroking> Annihilator, thats a bot trying to sell you an instrument
P5:34:13 <Peroggi> mail you have not made a single good point only citric has really done that
P5:34:17 <Quatroking> not a homeless person
P5:34:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P5:34:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> totally
P5:34:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> ugh
P5:34:37 <citricsquid> Peroggi: You're part of the group doing it and were siding with that moujave guy, therefore you're part of it. 
P5:34:40 <Doohan> Peroggi, mail2345|semi-afk was implying everyone made good points.
P5:34:50 <mail2345|semi-afk> and you ignored them
P5:34:50 <Quatroking> Did I make a good point
P5:34:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> i cleared that part up
P5:34:54 <mail2345|semi-afk> badly
P5:34:55 <Peroggi> kay but I said he was not, he is annoying me :O
P5:34:57 <citricsquid> my points were rubbish
P5:35:13 <Peroggi> well really you were just relaying laws and trying to figure it out
P5:35:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> if it were real
P5:35:15 <Peroggi> but better than mail lol
P5:35:25 <Quatroking> lol
P5:35:31 <Doohan> There's nothing to figure out

P5:35:40 <mail2345|semi-afk> except as to weather or not

P8:30:02 <Quatroking> citricsquid: where in the HTML do I need to put the div tags?
P8:30:06 <Peroggi> citricsquid notch can't stop all hacks just with server authentication you know
P8:30:17 <citricsquid> Peroggi: lol yes. The majority anyway.
P8:30:27 <citricsquid> Sure he won't, but it's entirely possible.
P8:30:30 <citricsquid> Simply verify EVERY move
P8:30:32 <mail2345|semi-afk> the entire debate
P8:30:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> could have been stoped
P8:30:38 <citricsquid> noclip can't be stopped, but that's clientside.
P8:30:38 <Darke> And when survival comes out, most servers wont allow hacks
P8:30:40 <Peroggi> there are still exploits that could be used in the java code
P8:30:45 <mail2345|semi-afk> if you had simply admitted that it was a hack
P8:30:50 <triddin> citricsquid: where do you want it sent?
P8:30:54 <Darke> Only dick servers will -_-
P8:31:02 <citricsquid> /msg citricsquid
P8:31:33 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm
P8:31:38 <mail2345|semi-afk> I should make a script that
P8:31:40 <citricsquid> uh, quatro. Don't use wordpress.
P8:31:44 <citricsquid> I'll take a look soon.
P8:31:44 <mail2345|semi-afk> kicks non-prenium players
P8:31:52 <Peroggi> in fact there was a hack out for a long time that used java exploits instead of packet manipulation citric
P8:31:57 <citricsquid> mail2345|semi-afk: That'd be easy ;)
P8:32:15 <Quatroking> aww why not :(
P8:32:30 <mail2345|semi-afk> actually, the more apropriate term is wrapper
10P8:32:34 * mooogle (skylerschu@pool-173-65-88-8.tampfl.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
P8:32:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> wrapper != client
P8:32:47 <mail2345|semi-afk> i'm sure your not that dumb to know the diffrence
P8:33:48 <Peroggi> so citric you are in agreement that the WoM client is now legal?
P8:34:11 <mail2345|semi-afk> it's a wrapper
P8:35:00 <citricsquid> Peroggi: uh, I'm just a community member, please don't take my word as any more official than anyone else heres. However, from my point of view it does look "legal", but it's still dubious morally because it has hacks, but meh, that's up to you.
P8:35:05 <mail2345|semi-afk> stop maniuplating words for the sake of trolling
P8:35:19 <Peroggi> mail stfu
P8:35:25 <Peroggi> also kay citricsquid
P8:35:44 <mail2345|semi-afk> how about you ignore me if you think i'm mindlessly spamming
P8:35:49 <Peroggi> how is hacking morally unacceptable? it makes the game more enjoyable 
P8:36:11 <Peroggi> I mean client aside, this conversation would just be me being curious
P8:36:18 <citricsquid> Peroggi: You're enabling people to do what is not intended. I personally think allowing people to move faster than intended is wrong, but it's up to you.
P8:36:36 <Quatroking> Hmm
P8:36:37 <Peroggi> no not really up to me, I just agree with WoM :)
P8:36:50 <vede> I dislike hacking simply because a large part of the community seems to DEPEND on hacking now.
P8:37:14 <mail2345|semi-afk> hacking promotes unfair competition
P8:37:16 <Quatroking> I put div tags around the sidebars, and added a #height in the CSS with height: 100%; but it's not doing anything
P8:37:22 <Quatroking> did I do it wrong?
P8:37:26 <vede> Servers with anti-hax rules are the minority, and quite a few people will actually LEAVE SERVERS if they don't allow hacks.
P8:37:28 <testvan> link me a boss server
P8:37:29 <mail2345|semi-afk> if you don't hack, it will be harder to make good stuff, vs hackers
P8:37:30 <Peroggi> vede: that is actually a legit reason
P8:37:35 <triddin> I personally welcome changes to the server to stop this kind of thing
P8:37:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> ask jte
P8:37:47 <mail2345|semi-afk> jk
P8:37:55 <mail2345|semi-afk> anyway
P8:38:02 <triddin> unfortunately it's only through widespread distribution that this can (or will) occur

P8:38:31 <Peroggi> mhm think of it as motivating Notch to fix things up citricsquid :)
P8:38:33 <triddin> otherwise you'll just have a small group of elitist hackers that have their way
P8:38:34 <mail2345|semi-afk> triddin, what is a more apropiate word for your creation: "wrapper" or "client"
P8:38:39 <Peroggi> lol
P8:38:48 <triddin> wrapper probably
P8:39:47 <Moujave> lol
P8:40:06 <mail2345|semi-afk> see.
P8:40:18 <Peroggi> see what mail whats your point?
P8:40:26 <Moujave> someone doesn't have there sarcasm detector turned on!
P8:40:33 <mail2345|semi-afk> that you were trolling, by insiting it was a client
P8:40:40 <Peroggi> LOL
P8:40:41 <Peroggi> gtfo
P8:40:46 <Peroggi> if I was trolling you would have killed yourself by now
P8:40:57 <Moujave> hahaha
P8:41:01 <triddin> I didn't say it's not a client
P8:41:11 <triddin> just that wrapper would be more apt
P8:41:31 <mail2345|semi-afk> does it contact the server, or doess it just manipulate the game engine?
P8:42:35 <triddin> it doesn't do anything but host the original client
P8:42:46 <Quatroking> oh wow
P8:42:48 <triddin> cumulatively it's still a client
P8:42:58 <Quatroking> citricsquid, I found a really easy solution
P8:43:09 <Peroggi> what you up to anyway quatro?
P8:43:14 <triddin> seperately it's a wrapper + the original client
P8:43:23 <Quatroking> editing my website so it suits my needs
P8:43:36 <Peroggi> link?
P8:43:56 <Quatroking> quatroworld.org
P8:44:30 <Quatroking> ah goddamnit
P8:44:37 <Quatroking> citricsquid: nevermind, didn't work.
P8:44:48 <Peroggi> olol darke has a block
P8:44:52 <Quatroking> I tried adding a border but that doesn't work in any way
P8:44:53 <Peroggi> cool site tho
P8:45:06 <Quatroking> Thanks
P8:45:08 <Peroggi> bars on side kinda squished but it looks nice and tidy :D
P8:45:34 <Quatroking> Yeah I'm still trying to figure out how to extend the sidebars to the footer
P8:46:11 <Peroggi> pretty sure I used to know html really well when I was 7 and was on neopets
P8:46:15 <Peroggi> but now I am idiot at it
P8:46:34 <Quatroking> eh
P8:46:37 <Quatroking> its probably CSS
P8:46:41 <Peroggi> ah
P8:46:57 <Peroggi> oh oh oh
P8:47:07 <Peroggi> Quatroking: is ponyo similar to the little mermaid?
P8:47:19 <Quatroking> Sounds like it, but its really not
P8:47:25 <Peroggi> ya I didn't think so
P8:47:34 <Peroggi> it looked more like spirited away to me, same guy did them too
P8:47:43 <Quatroking> Same studios, yes
P8:47:54 <Peroggi> miuzaki or whatever
P8:48:05 <Peroggi> anyways I call bullshit on your better than the little mermaid comment
P8:48:09 <Peroggi> that movie is amazing, a classic
P8:48:16 <Quatroking> Its better.
P8:48:22 <Peroggi> :(
P8:48:28 <Peroggi> have you seen spirited away? is it better than that?
P8:48:31 <Quatroking> Go see it yourself then
P8:48:40 <Quatroking> Spirited away isn't really comparable
P8:48:41 <Peroggi> might torrent it
P8:48:48 <Peroggi> wat it is good movie :O
P8:48:52 <Quatroking> considering its one of the first anime movies I saw
P8:48:57 <Quatroking> BATTLE ROYALE 2
P8:49:02 <Peroggi> O.o
P8:49:11 <Quatroking> better than the original
P8:49:15 <Peroggi> seen howl's moving castle? that was cool but not really too good in a critical sense
P8:49:19 <Quatroking> it even has an EMP
P8:49:22 <Peroggi> wat
P8:49:27 <Quatroking> howl's was great
P8:49:41 <Quatroking> I've seen most of the ghibli movies
P8:49:43 <Peroggi> I really enjoyed watching it but the character development and story wasn't all that spectacular
P8:49:51 <Peroggi> spirited away however was amazing
P8:49:53 <Peroggi> :O
P8:50:09 <Peroggi> BRB torrenting Ponyo
P8:50:11 <Quatroking> Totoro, mononoke, howl's castle, spirited away, kiki's delivery service, ponyo
P8:50:17 <Quatroking> all really great movies
P8:50:23 <Peroggi> only other one of those I seen is mononoke
P8:50:27 <Peroggi> which I didn't like much actually
P8:50:29 <Peroggi> anyways
P8:50:30 <Quatroking> mononoke is epic
P8:50:36 <PuyoDead> Quatro, did you see Castle of Cagliostro?
P8:50:42 <Quatroking> no
P8:50:49 <Quatroking> go see steamboy
P8:50:53 <PuyoDead> ever watch Lupin the 3rd?
P8:51:04 <Quatroking> nop
P8:51:18 <PuyoDead> it's basically Miyazaki's Lupin movie
P8:51:22 <PuyoDead> damn fine one
P8:51:24 <Quatroking> steamboy is the only good western-made anime movie
P8:51:31 <Peroggi> OMG STEAMBOY
P8:51:32 <Peroggi> I HATE THAT
P8:51:33 <PuyoDead> (also, I own steamboy)
P8:51:38 <Quatroking> even tough its length is over 2 hours its really enjoyable
P8:51:44 <Peroggi> I disagree
P8:51:46 <Peroggi> I hated it
P8:51:51 <Quatroking> I loved the steampunk machines in it
P8:52:01 <Peroggi> I hate steampunk for the most part

P10:53:35 <mail2345|semi-afk> how would it determine their status?
P10:53:48 <vede> A while back someone found a way to put someone's name into a url and the page would say whether or not that name was a paid-for name.

P11:50:11 <Peroggi> the nay saying of whatever you said
P11:50:14 <Darkebrz> Organizing griefing?
P11:50:21 <Peroggi> no a strawman is if I were to misrepresent your position which I did not
P11:50:25 <mail2345|semi-afk> you did
P11:50:33 <mail2345|semi-afk> I thought it would be illegal
P11:50:37 <mail2345|semi-afk> if I relased it
P11:50:45 <Peroggi> I did not I just kept repeating my own position which was that it was illegal regardless of if you release it or not
P11:51:02 <Peroggi> and disregarding the evidence you gave, none btw
P11:51:23 <mail2345|semi-afk> you have a copy of the wrapper with a minecraft.jar, am I right?
P11:51:28 <Peroggi> now you see I have ACTUALLY proved that you are an idiot
P11:51:36 <Peroggi> we are not discussing that mail stop diverting the debate
P11:51:40 <mail2345|semi-afk> ugh
P11:52:04 <mail2345|semi-afk> seriosly
P11:52:07 <UnknownX> deeebaaaateeee!!!!
P11:52:08 <mail2345|semi-afk> your ignoring my point
P11:52:16 <Peroggi> darkebz I'm pretty sure Notch deletes all bans every so often
P11:52:19 <Peroggi> but also I swapped routers
P11:52:28 <mail2345|semi-afk> the wrapper and minecraft.jar is to what my script and adura's regexp are
P11:52:46 <Peroggi> you are making a comparison not a point
P11:52:49 <mail2345|semi-afk> ugh
P11:52:52 <UnknownX> Notch revoked all bans two days ago
P11:52:54 <Hiturunk> >.<
P11:52:58 <Peroggi> there you go darke
P11:53:14 <UnknownX> Including the one on mair <3
P11:53:16 <Hiturunk> his is the most annoying thing ever, Crashing my browser every time I attempt to play.
P11:53:25 <Peroggi> lol what is it hit?
P11:53:29 <mail2345|semi-afk> really, you have a wrapper with a minecraft.jar in it. then you are violating the law like i am, if you were right
P11:53:48 <Darkebrz> mail2345|semi-afk: You have minecraft.jar also
P11:53:49 <Hiturunk> I don't think the game likes the newest version of Java..Or somehing.
P11:53:51 <Darkebrz> You can't deny that
P11:54:00 <Peroggi> wether or not I am voilating the law is irrelevant to the fact that you are violating internet law
P11:54:01 <Darkebrz> Hiturunk: I have newest java
P11:54:04 <Darkebrz> It works fine
P11:54:39 <Hiturunk> Well, Java crashes every time I try and start the game, So..
P11:55:05 <Peroggi> Hit you could use the worldofminecraft.com client but it is highly illegal and you might get v&
