A12:50:04 <Saladan0> Is there a thread in the forums with instructions on how to host?
A12:52:56 <Saladan0> Im getting an error trying to host saying "Java" is not used as an external or internal....
10A12:53:15 * hey5000 (Mibbit@71-218-156-154.hlrn.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:54:21 <Gauphastus> Oh, Saladan.
A12:54:33 <Gauphastus> I had that error. I could help you with it.
A12:56:03 <Saladan0> :O!!
A12:56:07 <Saladan0> WOuld be much appreciated
A12:56:20 <Saladan0> trying to show my friends this game, and was going to host a private server for them
A12:56:30 <Saladan0> That way our funw ouldnt be ruined by griefers and such
A12:56:36 <Gauphastus> First of all, are you behind a router? Do you know how to port forward and stuff?
A12:56:46 <Gauphastus> Otherwise, people can't connect anyway. :/
A12:56:56 <Gauphastus> Still, I could at least get the server running.
A12:58:07 <Saladan0> I dont believe I am, Im plugged straight into a modem
A12:58:16 <Gauphastus> Oh, you should be golden then.
A12:58:17 <Saladan0> No, im not behind a router
A12:58:29 <Gauphastus> Alright. Listen carefully then.
A12:58:47 <Gauphastus> What I did was I right clicked on My Computer in the start menu. I went to properties.
A12:59:05 <Gauphastus> Clicked on the Advanced tab.
A12:59:12 <Saladan0> With you
A12:59:14 <Saladan0> so far
A12:59:22 <Gauphastus> Down toward the bottom is a button called Environment Variables
A12:59:25 <Gauphastus> Click on that.
A12:59:29 <Saladan0> DOne
A12:59:41 <Gauphastus> In the system variables box at the bottom, look for a variable called PATH
A12:59:57 <Gauphastus> Next, we need to find out where your Java installation is.
A1:00:07 <Gauphastus> You installed it somewhere in Program Files probably.
A1:00:25 <Saladan0> AH, I see where you are going I think
A1:00:34 <Saladan0> My PATH is set to quicktime right now
A1:00:37 <Saladan0> I want to change it to Java
A1:00:38 <Saladan0> Right?
A1:00:39 <Gauphastus> Oh, no. Leave that.
A1:00:45 <Saladan0> damn
A1:00:47 <Gauphastus> You have to add a new entry to that variable.
A1:00:52 <Gauphastus> Quicktime can stay anyway.
A1:01:10 <Gauphastus> What you want is to add the path to your Java BIN folder.
A1:01:14 <Gauphastus> Like mine is C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin
A1:01:24 <Saladan0> Same
A1:01:39 <Gauphastus> Alright. So you add that to the path variable, seperate it from quicktime with a semicolon;
A1:01:43 <Saladan0> C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin
A1:02:02 <Gauphastus> So it would be C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin;
A1:02:07 <Gauphastus> And leave the quicktime stuff.
A1:02:31 <Gauphastus> Cool?
A1:02:33 <Saladan0> Do I put a space inbetween the colon and the next path?
A1:02:36 <Gauphastus> Nope.
A1:02:38 <Saladan0> COol
A1:02:41 <Gauphastus> Just the semicolon is fine.
A1:02:47 <Gauphastus> Click okay and try to run the server.
A1:02:58 <Saladan0> hmmm
A1:02:59 <Gauphastus> If everything checks out, it should actually start up now.
A1:03:37 <Saladan0> %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program Files (x86)\QuickTime\QTSystem\
A1:03:42 <Saladan0> wait what
A1:03:47 <Saladan0> it didnt save the java thing
A1:03:48 <Saladan0> One sec
A1:04:26 <Gauphastus> Yeah, there was probably more in there than just quicktime.
A1:04:40 <Gauphastus> There's a system32 path and perhaps other things.
A1:04:52 <Gauphastus> But really, all you need is to seperate with a semicolon.
A1:04:54 <Gauphastus> Though..
A1:04:56 <Saladan0> Oh wow it worked
A1:04:59 <Saladan0> THank you VERYmuch
A1:05:03 <Gauphastus> If you put it at the end..
A1:05:05 <Saladan0> for helping out a noob
A1:05:05 <Gauphastus> Oh, good.
A1:05:15 <Gauphastus> Sure. I had to find that solution on my own too.
A1:05:17 <Saladan0> I put it at the begining the first time
A1:05:24 <Gauphastus> It was posted on the forum somewhere but I'd have no luck finding it.
A1:05:40 <Gauphastus> This is an awfully specific thing to search for I think.
A1:05:53 <Saladan0> Now is there a way to make a server private?
A1:05:56 <Gauphastus> Yep.
A1:06:04 <Gauphastus> In the server properties file.
A1:06:06 <Saladan0> I looked at the server text file
A1:06:10 <Saladan0> Set the names up and stuff
A1:06:18 <Gauphastus> public=false
A1:06:43 <Saladan0> And then how would I get my friends to hop on if its not on the list?
A1:07:02 <Gauphastus> There should be a generated text file in your server directory called external URL.
A1:07:19 <Gauphastus> It will give you a unique URL you can give to people you want to join your game.
A1:07:20 <Genisi> hey, is it possible to place lava or water as blocks, or no?
A1:07:29 <Gauphastus> Not at the moment.
A1:07:33 <Gauphastus> Maybe later in creative mode.
A1:07:39 <Gauphastus> But that's just a guess on my part.
A1:07:47 <Saladan0> Thank you a bunch
A1:07:48 <Gauphastus> After he works out liquid issues so they don't flood infinitely. :P
A1:07:51 <Gauphastus> Sure, man.
A1:07:56 <Genisi> ah
A1:09:57 <Saladan0> Ok, server CMD window is doing funky things, ill just let it do what I hope its supposed to be doing. ALthough it would be nice to know when the server was actually up
A1:10:12 <Saladan0> It seems to be doing the same thing over and over again
A1:10:19 <Gauphastus> What is it?
A1:10:20 <mezo> game isnt centered anymore?
A1:10:23 <Gauphastus> Timeout?
A1:10:27 <Saladan0> "Failed to assemble heartbeat"
A1:10:35 <Gauphastus> Well, that is weird.
A1:10:38 <Gauphastus> I've never heard that one.
A1:10:43 <Gauphastus> JRE6..
A1:10:47 <Saladan0> connection reset
A1:10:55 <Gauphastus> I don't think that's the latest. Do you think you could get the latest version of Java?
A1:10:57 <Gauphastus> That might help.
A1:11:00 <Saladan0> Sure
A1:11:05 <Gauphastus> Then readjust the path to the bin folder.
A1:11:07 <Saladan0> ill probably have to redo the path file then
A1:11:14 <Gauphastus> I didn't need to uninstall the old one. I have no problems.
A1:11:19 <Gauphastus> Probably should get rid of it though..
A1:11:20 <Gauphastus> Eh.
A1:16:41 <Gauphastus> What is with the couple of dissenters on the forums?
A1:16:50 <Gauphastus> Man, can anyone just enjoy games anymore?
A1:18:00 <Saladan0> Ill hapilly play it while its free, and if me and my friends have a good enough time, we may end up paying for it and play it weekly
A1:19:32 <Saladan0> Depends on how much it is though
A1:19:43 <Saladan0> ANyways, I need to get this server up and running first
A1:22:17 <Gauphastus> Yeah, survival mode will hopefully be a lot of fun.
A1:22:45 <Saladan0> I redownloaded it, and the newest version of Java is jre6
A1:23:17 <Saladan0> Still not connecting, damn, I wonder what im doing wrong
A1:24:13 <Saladan0> Does this look right to you?

A1:27:23 <Saladan0> I want the destination to be \bin right?
A1:27:26 <Gauphastus> jre6?
A1:27:34 <Gauphastus> Didn't you update?
A1:27:43 <Gauphastus> My installation looks different is why I ask.
A1:27:51 <Saladan0> Yea, I uninstalled, Dled the new one, and that is what it had my default destination creation path as

A1:28:41 <Saladan0> Maybe?
A1:28:46 <Gauphastus> You might have to ask on the forum.
A1:28:48 <Gauphastus> Try that.
A1:28:51 <Gauphastus> That should clear it out.
A1:28:55 <Gauphastus> If it's creating a conflict.
A1:29:03 <Gauphastus> Something's not getting where it needs to be.
A1:29:09 <Gauphastus> What's the error again? Same as before?
A1:29:45 <Saladan0> "Failed to assemble heartbeat: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset"
A1:32:03 <Saladan0> This makes me sad :<

A1:33:01 <Gauphastus> It's not in there. It's in a text document.

A1:34:16 <Saladan0> It worked for me, Hang on, I got people connected via Hamachi
A1:34:21 <Saladan0> ill see if it works for them
A1:34:26 <Gauphastus> Oh, okay.
A1:36:10 <Saladan0> Ok, I wasnt logged on
A1:36:11 <Saladan0> anyways
A1:36:16 <Saladan0> My friend said he could get on

A1:37:33 <Saladan0> ?
A1:37:37 <Gauphastus> Oh, you can.
A1:37:43 <Gauphastus> The forums are still up anyway.
A1:37:51 <Saladan0> Hrmm
A1:37:55 <Saladan0> musta been the main website
A1:37:57 <Gauphastus> I remember when I first got my server working, I couldn't access the main site.
A1:38:07 <Saladan0> its been screwing with my browser for te past half hour
A1:38:08 <Gauphastus> Had to wait until the next day for it to work.
A1:38:11 <Saladan0> Half the time it crashes
A1:38:22 <Saladan0> Can I get the forums link please?
A1:38:49 <Gauphastus> http://www.mojang.com/forum/
A1:39:11 <Saladan0> Works now
A1:39:12 <Saladan0> thank
A1:40:41 <Gauphastus> Here's a site that posts a solution to this issue.

A1:40:54 <Gauphastus> It's basically what we just did.
A1:42:55 <Saladan0> everything works now
A1:42:57 <Saladan0> Thanks alot
A1:43:38 <Gauphastus> Alright. Good luck.
A1:43:44 <Gauphastus> Want me to test or are you good?
A1:44:11 <Jesse> I still think notch should change the purchase info page, it says "what you'll get" and nearly everyone with common sense would assume that means what you get upon purchase. Not planned features you'll get in the future.

A1:45:01 <Gauphastus> I agree. Someone else said the same thing before.
A1:45:07 <Gauphastus> Though it might have been you. >.>
A1:45:35 <Saladan0> Is there a way to plant grass in game?
A1:45:41 <Saladan0> Or is there a grass block?
A1:45:44 <Gauphastus> Just place soil.
A1:45:48 <Gauphastus> Grass will eventually grow.
A1:45:53 <Gauphastus> But only if the soil is near other grass.
A1:45:54 <Gauphastus> I think.
A1:46:00 <Gauphastus> And not blocked from the sun.
12A1:46:36 * Joat (JavaUser@ip68-102-9-202.ks.ok.cox.net) Quit (Quit: GameSurge - The Next Step in the Evolution of Gaming IRC)
A1:47:49 <paul|notlaptop> I am pretty sure it grows on any soil tile in the sun
A1:47:54 <paul|notlaptop> it grows faster with grass around
A1:48:26 <Gauphastus> I thought it was random anyway.
A1:49:53 <Rydia> i'd like a sandstone tile
A1:50:09 <Gauphastus> Improved geology would be nice.
A1:50:19 <Gauphastus> Different types of stone, different density.
A1:50:20 <paul|notlaptop> at the very least a bit more diversity
A1:50:24 <Gauphastus> Yeah.
A1:50:37 <Gauphastus> I mean, unlike DF, we don't need it to be super realistic or whatever.
A1:50:44 <Gauphastus> With material shear strength and stuff.
A1:50:49 <Rydia> lol i wish it were like DF
A1:50:52 <Gauphastus> Haha.
A1:51:01 <Gauphastus> Notch is inspired by DF and Infiniminer, so..
A1:51:07 <Gauphastus> He says on his new "about" page
A1:51:15 <Gauphastus> that he'd rather the game be too hard than too easy.
A1:51:22 <Gauphastus> I think I'm going to like Notch.
A1:52:18 <paul|notlaptop> he's a cool dood
A1:57:26 <El_Joe> seriously guys this goddamn colossus

A1:57:44 <Gauphastus> What the..
A1:57:51 <Gauphastus> That's fucking awesome.
A1:57:52 <Gauphastus> Haha.
A1:58:07 <Gauphastus> Figures there's a swastika in the background though.
A1:58:09 <Gauphastus> <.<
A1:58:24 <El_Joe> someone from new zealand built it there overnight
A2:01:26 <Jesse> Some more map options would be nice in this. Like less water, more lava, more caverns, map depth and dimmensions.
A2:01:37 <Jesse> dimensions* 
A2:01:53 <Jesse> just some sliders and stuff to mess around with.
A2:01:55 <Jesse> :D

A2:15:32 <Daidoji> <Gauphastus> He says on his new "about" page
A2:15:32 <Daidoji> <Gauphastus> that he'd rather the game be too hard than too easy.
A2:15:55 <Daidoji> pretty sure he was referring to the effort involved in mining and scavenging for food
A2:16:19 <Gauphastus> Oh, I don't know.
A2:16:22 <Daidoji> I mean in free-mode you got the whole one click or hold the mouse down tunneling going on
A2:16:25 <Gauphastus> He's going to have dangerous wildlife and stuff.
A2:16:33 <Gauphastus> Yeah.
A2:16:36 <Daidoji> but in survival mode it's gonna be a little more effortous.
A2:16:38 <Gauphastus> I figured mining would require tools.
A2:16:55 <Daidoji> like to make a rock block you're gonna have to go mine a rockblock first etc
A2:17:01 <Gauphastus> Yeah.
A2:17:06 <Gauphastus> I'd love that.

A3:43:38 <Saladan0> preferably a private server
A3:43:40 <Saladan0> without griefers
A3:43:52 <ShadowAddict> most of my friends are like "wtf mang you're gonna pay 15 bucks for a java game from the 90's?"

A3:44:27 <Gauphastus> I have a server but it's for my forum only. Sorry. :P

A3:48:47 <Saladan0> Well I can understand for this game, I mean, 15-30$ for a game that could hardly be called Alpha?
A3:49:28 <paul|notlaptop> 14.29 for a game that was developed in a month
A3:49:38 <paul|notlaptop> assuming 2 hours of work a day
A3:49:44 <paul|notlaptop> that's a pittance per work hour
A3:49:53 <paul|notlaptop> I am hardly outraged at the price
A3:50:07 <paul|notlaptop> plus I am paying for all future updates
A3:51:13 <ShadowAddict> If it wasn't future updates, I'm not sure I'd pay
A3:51:29 <ShadowAddict> but survival mode + that zombie mode + whatever else he throws in is TOTALLY worth 13 bucks

A4:00:28 <Gauphastus> I guess the purchase announcement really took a lot of people by surprise.
A4:00:41 <ShadowAddict> is this a "not worth buying" argument?
A4:00:47 <paul|notlaptop> no
A4:00:50 <Gauphastus> And if this is all the outcry we're getting, I don't think Notch is gonna have any trouble.
A4:00:54 <Gauphastus> Oh, no. I'm buying it soon.
A4:00:55 <paul|notlaptop> this is a "what's with people who think it's not worth buying"

A5:02:48 <ShadowAddict> I just hadn't been gaming too much
A5:03:38 <ShadowAddict> griefers are a problem but my experience of being on a server that's made of about a third admins (including myself) leads me to believe it's easy to combat griefers if everyone pays attention
A5:03:46 <ShadowAddict> though it was impossible before the playerlist
A5:04:37 <Zolyx> yeah, definitely - what I hope is that a teleport-to-player admin command will be added this weekend
A5:04:41 <Zolyx> that'll make it easier again
A5:05:21 <Zolyx> it's irksome having to walk across the map to check on griefing, by which time they've probably gone somewhere else
A5:05:29 <ShadowAddict> We lost the central piece of our server because we thought the guy's name was Quendanation instead of Ouendanation
A5:05:32 <ShadowAddict> yes it is
A5:06:09 <ShadowAddict> if we're not in a position where an admin can verify, we just make sure at least two or three of our more trusted members confirm it

A5:42:14 <checkers> yes, got it working now thanks
A5:42:56 <checkers> if you're part of the team it might be worth mentioning that dependancy on java6, and for debian in particular the sun-java6-bin package

A6:53:35 <Rydia> here's a question
A6:53:40 <Rydia> why doesn't your game work
A6:53:49 <C418> because it's sometimes too awesome
A6:54:03 <Notch> uhm, I don't think I can answer that on the information given
A6:54:04 <Rydia> specifically i can't edit anything
A6:54:08 <Rydia> it never highlights
A6:54:20 <Notch> ok, that bug. I don't know why that happens to some people
A6:54:21 <C418> tried another browser?
A6:54:26 <Notch> what graphics card do you have?
A6:54:27 <Rydia> tried every browser
A6:54:31 <Rydia> Radeon 9600XT
A6:54:39 <Notch> browser shouldn't matter here
A6:54:40 <Notch> os?
A6:54:43 <Rydia> Windows XP
A6:55:04 <Notch> not insanely old drivers and so, I assume?
A6:55:09 <Rydia> nope
A6:55:15 <Rydia> got the latest java and latest drivers for my card
A6:55:21 <Notch> ok. we-heeeeird
A6:55:41 <Rydia> and it can't be anti-aliasing because it's set to application decides
A6:55:59 <Rydia> unless something else is doing it
A6:56:02 <Notch> I use very plain old opengl picking
A6:56:08 <Saladan0> Anyone hoting a game at MC game at the moment?
A6:56:22 <Saladan0> hosting*
A6:56:28 <Notch> I use quads instead of the normal triangles, I don't know if that can affect things
A6:56:47 <Notch> Saladan0: There are 74 servers!
A6:57:20 <Saladan0> I prefer Private ones with few people. I learned from garrys mod to be carefull to work on something for hours only to have someone come in and ruin it in minutes
A6:57:24 <Saladan0> D:
A6:57:53 <Notch> ah yeah
A6:58:19 <ZomBuster> mhh I got a nice private one
A6:58:40 <C418> good news and bad news
A6:58:47 <C418> which one first?
A6:58:53 <Notch> bad!
A6:59:03 <Rydia> i wish i could actually build anything :c

A7:00:16 <Saladan0> I hope the word didnt get out
A7:00:23 <Saladan0> Im sorry if it did. D:
A7:00:35 <Rydia> btw notch what are you gonna do about upgrading the wawda
A7:00:36 <ZomBuster> what is wrong with writing shit everywjere
A7:00:44 <ZomBuster> I think its quite creative
A7:00:48 <Notch> wawda?
A7:00:51 <Rydia> water
A7:01:00 <ZomBuster> sssh
A7:01:04 <Notch> oic
A7:01:05 <ZomBuster> we dont speak the w-word
A7:01:12 <Rydia> lol
A7:01:25 <Notch> I'm postponing the water fix a bit
A7:01:41 <Notch> multiplayer drained away all of my hard work patience, so I need to relax with some new content now
A7:01:53 <Rydia> any plans to give the water multiple depths per tile or is it going to be 1 block forever
A7:01:59 <Notch> i don't know
A7:02:11 <Notch> my gut feeling is that it'll stay 1 block
A7:02:19 <Notch> but I'm not ruling anything out
A7:02:49 <ZomBuster> one block is fine
A7:03:24 <Saladan0> I think I might go play DF, where dtriking water while mining is actually fun
A7:03:30 <Saladan0> striking*
A7:03:31 <Rydia> also what about sandstone? buidling forts/pyramids outta pure sand is kinda challenging
A7:04:22 <peerkoel> what about red bricks..
A7:04:30 <Rydia> yeah and red bricks
A7:04:40 <peerkoel> there's tons of materials to make nice buildings with
A7:04:43 <peerkoel> like glass
A7:04:55 <Rydia> leaves are basically glass for now
A7:05:05 <peerkoel> yes I used that :)
A7:05:13 <peerkoel> hold on, I have a screenshot somewhere..
A7:05:25 <Rydia> i made a bathysphere out of leaves once

A7:05:42 <Snowman> shit
A7:05:47 <Snowman> this is not good...
A7:06:15 <Snowman> watch your servers
A7:06:29 <Saladan0> I just got done making a pirate ship
A7:06:30 <Rydia> an ominous warning
A7:06:32 <Saladan0> It was kinda awesome
A7:06:46 <Snowman> minecraft is being raided by /b/
A7:06:50 <Saladan0> Ah
A7:06:53 <checkers> also: how long until beta?
A7:06:54 <Saladan0> Griefing at its worse

A7:07:05 <Rydia> notch ideally minecraft will have every single kind of rock in existence, much like dwarf fortress
A7:07:20 <Saladan0> Gonna go see in my ship still exists or if B got to it
A7:07:27 <Snowman> yeh some people from /b/ came in the server
A7:07:27 <Notch> well..
A7:07:32 <Snowman> so i looked on 4chan
A7:07:44 <Snowman> http://img.4chan.org/b/res/141208408.html
A7:07:56 <Snowman> and someone posted in that thread with your name Notch
A7:08:00 <Notch> that was me
A7:08:00 <checkers> is there any problem with running multiple instances of minecraft in the same browser?
A7:08:24 <Notch> I think so, checkers
A7:08:25 <Saladan0> Probabloy, Theres problems with just running one instance on MC on a browser
A7:08:37 <checkers> about 10% of the time I start a new instance it crashes firefox
A7:08:55 <checkers> *100
A7:09:33 <checkers> yeah, gotta use mutiple browsers, or perhaps chrome
A7:09:42 <Saladan0> About 50% of the time I leave a game, my browser freezes. Its as if the game has its own soul, and is bitter everytime I leave so it punishes me by freezing
A7:09:49 <Snowman> ive run 2 minecraft gmes at once one time, not much trouble
A7:10:01 <C418> oh, checker said it may be useful if you say that you need java 6 for the server, notch
A7:10:18 <C418> plus s
A7:10:19 <Notch> ah yeah
A7:10:49 <Snowman> SHIT
A7:10:51 <checkers> sun-java6-bin is the package for debian (and probably ubuntu)
A7:10:52 <Notch> Saladan0: There's something very wrong about my cleanup code..
A7:10:55 <Snowman> giant pyramid is getting destroyed
A7:11:24 <Saladan0> You're cleanup code?
A7:11:27 <Saladan0> You made this game?
A7:11:31 <Notch> yes
A7:12:22 <ZomBuster> to fix the browser crashing you need to kill the java process
A7:12:37 <ZomBuster> don't know why it doesn't stop itself
A7:12:49 <Saladan0> Hah, well, I think your top priority right now is a proper anti-grifing system
A7:12:57 <checkers> can't you ban?
A7:13:06 <Saladan0> I think you can Ip ban
A7:13:14 <Saladan0> but that doesnt help you when you are getting raided by 50 people

A7:13:42 <Saladan0> But I guess whev we eventually start playing, and have Pay to play servers, you wont get as much greifing
A7:13:42 <Tim>  /banip <name/ip> bans and kicks a player
A7:13:46 <Saladan0> Since paying people dont want to get banned
A7:13:51 <C418> yeah. especially with names like .._..-atr-:::..
A7:13:53 <checkers> i don't think much would, but thats not to say I don't want a solution
A7:13:58 <ZomBuster> if you are really worried about raids make auto-backups of the level every 10 minutes
A7:14:55 <Saladan0> Is there a count on how many people have already pre paid?
A7:15:05 <ZomBuster> look on the main site
A7:15:09 <Saladan0> Wondering if the money will scare to many people away to keep the servers alive

A7:16:26 <Notch> 467.65 euros! :D
A7:16:29 <Saladan0> Or is it more of a, "Keep this guy alive so he can keep making the game better" fund
A7:16:39 <Daz> Energy drinks, so he can code 24/7
A7:16:39 <C418> minus 20 percent...

A7:24:07 <Ush> yes
A7:24:22 <Ush> hey! zombuster
A7:24:40 <Stargoat> Rydia, what's your idea?
A7:24:41 <ZomBuster> hey :P
A7:25:05 <Ush> did you get that in-game message just beforehand too?
A7:25:56 <Rydia> a lemmings/worms style game using little robots
A7:25:57 <Saladan0> So are there any safe servers at the moment?
A7:26:09 <Ush> are they all crashing?
A7:26:22 <Saladan0> Not so much crashing as being invaded
A7:26:23 <checkers> i have a game idea
A7:26:24 <Stargoat> nah brah
A7:26:25 <Stargoat> 4chan raid
A7:26:29 <checkers> basically you can build blocks in a 3d world
A7:26:33 <Ush> by  "Pilot"
A7:26:41 <checkers> I'll call it "blockcraft"
A7:27:10 <Stargoat> Rydia: Sounds interesting. Got anything else past that?
A7:27:18 <Ush> Oh, those wonderful merry 4chan folks
A7:27:40 <Saladan0> Man
A7:27:45 <Saladan0> The giant pyramid got raped
A7:27:50 <Rydia> and basically you have to collect nanite to make nanobots and then upgrade them to do specific things
A7:28:19 <Stargoat> hmm
A7:28:52 <Stargoat> that sounds pretty cool, actually
A7:29:20 <Stargoat> do you directly control the nanobots, or is their behaviour determined by what upgrades they have?
A7:29:33 <Rydia> and the bigger gimmick is that there is a background and a foreground and the players see the field from opposite sides
A7:29:46 <Stargoat> hmm

A7:31:05 <Rydia> you can use nanite to upgrade them into microbots which are under direct control and have actual weapons

A7:32:43 <checkers> LOVE looks great
A7:32:55 <Stargoat> it looks like it could be great
A7:33:07 <Stargoat> it all depends on how streamlined the UI is, I think

A7:35:19 <ZomBuster> I dont think it is
A7:35:39 <Deiz> It must be, because teleport location saving centers on tiles
A7:36:16 <ZomBuster> yeh but if you move around you dont move one block at a time
A7:36:19 <Rydia> i'm designing the units so that the fabricator looks and functions like a momma bot, the nanobots are just cute little robot eyes with tentacles, and microbots have some different personalities
A7:36:55 <Deiz> ZomBuster: Yes, but there's a degree of interoperability, and mapping one to the other is  necessary to save a player's position on a tile
A7:38:28 <Notch> Deiz: Well, when you save a spawn location, you save the tile you're on
A7:38:42 <Notch> over the network, player positions have a granularity of 1/32'rd block

A9:59:03 <Haruhi2> yes please do sound
A9:59:19 <Haruhi2> add sound right now

A9:59:22 <Haruhi2> at this instant
A9:59:29 <Daidoji> that better not be anything else than 'fun'
A9:59:52 <C418> but it is. games don't always have to be fun

A10:00:47 <Notch> ooohhh =D
A10:00:59 <Notch> sound is important
A10:01:30 <Daidoji> and I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. I mean a challenging game can be well uh challenging but is the game FUN even while losing repeatedly?
A10:01:58 <C418> theres other things than just fun
A10:02:17 <Daidoji> what
A10:02:28 <Notch> yes, Daidoji. =)
A10:02:31 <Notch> nethack is fun and hard
A10:02:39 <C418> can't you think of anything? for example, silent hill is not fun at all
A10:02:40 <Notch> so is DF, even if some people seem to find it easy
A10:02:41 <Notch> brb, food!
A10:02:53 <C418> but it's very interesting
A10:02:59 <Daidoji> uh yeah it is
A10:03:18 <C418> I don't see fun in barely pointing at monsters and shooting them down
A10:03:25 <C418> or running around with the help of maps
A10:03:30 <C418> that game isn
A10:03:33 <C418> 't supposed to be fun

A10:04:37 <CheeToS> yeah, there's a way to
A10:04:38 <Daidoji> I mean that's just...

A10:05:07 <C418> if you have fear, you get a happy feeling after it
A10:05:17 <C418> you could call that fun
A10:05:24 <C418> but it's a weird way of having fun, isn't it?

A10:23:32 <akuryo> i'm not talking to you anyway
A10:23:39 <Parthon> your keyboard is not qwerty is it?

A10:24:04 <akuryo> ...
A10:24:04 <checkers> if you can't type the five given letter you have bigger problems than one game
A10:24:06 <Parthon> the problem is that java binds to letter keys and not positions

A10:24:16 <akuryo> YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND
A10:24:18 <akuryo> when i type messages

A10:24:30 <akuryo> M and , are reverted
A10:24:38 <akuryo> and all punctuation...etc is horrible
A10:24:44 <akuryo> i have to press 10 key, and again with shift
A10:24:51 <akuryo> to guess how to make a simple fucking point
A10:24:53 <akuryo> or a ! or a ?
A10:24:54 <sppt> why dont people just all switch to dvorak
A10:25:05 <akuryo> because even if i switch to dvorak
A10:25:08 <akuryo> THIS WONT CHANGE ANYTHING

A10:25:41 <checkers> frenchies rock
A10:25:43 <Parthon> I'm confused
A10:25:54 <Parthon> I didn't think they made azerty keyboards
A10:25:59 <sppt> checkers, dvorak is so much better, isnt it
A10:26:04 <akuryo> no
A10:26:10 <akuryo> because you use english dvorak
A10:26:13 <akuryo> the french dvorak is shit
A10:26:21 <sppt> meh
A10:26:26 <akuryo> and if french made azerty
A10:26:30 <checkers> sppt: i used to think so, but now I don't really notice a difference
A10:26:30 <sppt> i'd rather have dutch dvorak
A10:26:30 <akuryo> it's because of key placement
A10:26:47 <akuryo> dvorak
A10:26:53 <Parthon> you don't explain yourself very well akuryo :D
A10:26:55 <akuryo> anton dvorak was a great man
A10:27:02 <akuryo> i do not need to explain
A10:27:07 <akuryo> i'm just asking notch
A10:27:10 <akuryo> to make an option
10A10:27:10 * Notch changes topic to 'http://www.minecraft.net/  |  If the site doesn't look right, try control+r. Also, I intend on making it pass the w3 html verifier. :D'

A10:27:52 <Notch> calm down, please
A10:27:53 <akuryo> this is perfect
A10:27:56 <akuryo> notch you do not even answer
A10:27:58 <akuryo> then you boot me out
A10:28:00 <akuryo> very nice
A10:28:05 <Notch> I have answered you
A10:28:08 <checkers> oh, conspiracy theorist too.. I'll go do something else
A10:28:11 <Notch> I said I was going to do it, but not now
A10:28:19 <akuryo> lemme do it so!
A10:28:23 <akuryo> it's horrible really
A10:28:28 <Notch> you kept talking about it, I didn't want to get dragged into a discussion
A10:28:32 <Notch> then you got abusive
A10:28:58 <Notch> I know it's easy. You are aware that there are other kb layouts as well, though, right?
A10:29:09 <akuryo> yeah
A10:29:10 <akuryo> can i know
A10:29:15 <akuryo> what are you working on right now?
A10:29:17 <akuryo> just wondering
A10:29:31 <Notch> right now, I've eaten and I'm considering a nap. I'm horribly tired
A10:29:42 <Notch> Before that, I fixed a few bugs in the server
A10:29:47 <Haruhi2> notch have you ever considered making a 3D interface for DF lol
A10:29:49 <sppt> no wonder, you were still here at 3 in the morning
A10:29:59 <Notch> after the nap, I'm going to implement custom skins in multiplayer
A10:30:06 <Haruhi2> :o
A10:30:09 <Zolyx> woot :)
A10:30:17 <Notch> after that, I'm going to prototype some survival mode
A10:30:23 <Parthon> woot! :D
A10:30:23 <akuryo> water first =(
A10:30:25 <checkers> YESSS
A10:30:25 <akuryo> wait
A10:30:27 <akuryo> just a question
A10:30:28 <Notch> water also comes later
A10:30:31 <akuryo> can you put a new version
A10:30:34 <akuryo> with a changelog
A10:30:38 <akuryo> with azerty
A10:30:40 <akuryo> skins
A10:30:42 <akuryo> and also
A10:30:47 <akuryo> auto click rate changing
A10:30:49 <akuryo> in options
A10:30:52 <checkers> having an admin command to force a floodfill calculation could be nice
A10:30:53 <sppt> why not custom keybinds in general
A10:30:57 <Notch> auto click rate is not going to change
A10:31:01 <akuryo> why?
A10:31:05 <Notch> custom keybinds in the solution I'm going for, yes
A10:31:06 <akuryo> abuses?
A10:31:08 <sppt> so people using dvorak, svorak, japanese, french etc keyboards can bind their own keybinds
A10:31:19 <akuryo> yeag
A10:31:21 <akuryo> yeah
A10:31:21 <Notch> no, not because of abuse
A10:31:28 <akuryo> and make this save
A10:31:30 <akuryo> too
A10:31:31 <akuryo> so why?
A10:31:36 <Notch> because of pacing. The click rate is fast enough to be convenient (about as fast as you can walk)
A10:31:50 <Notch> but it encourages clicking for fast removal. It's kinda like how shooting works in good shoot-em-ups
A10:31:53 <sppt> what about the water?
A10:32:09 <Notch> you can just hold down the fire key, but it's faster to click. It makes it feel very interactive and responsive, and I likes it.
10A10:32:10 * paul|notsleep (grif392@adsl-71-142-226-209.dsl.scrm01.pacbell.net) has left #minecraft
A10:32:16 <Notch> water is coming later, not this weekend
A10:32:18 <sppt> because im confused as to what should happen to it
A10:32:23 <Notch> me too
A10:32:24 <Parthon> Notch: finger gets tired with big constructions :P
10A10:32:28 * Conic is now known as ConicAway
A10:32:31 <Parthon> but holding it down is sufficient
A10:32:32 <akuryo> yeah
A10:32:36 <akuryo> oh and
A10:32:40 <akuryo> i know
A10:32:42 <Zeno> it works when you hold it now?
A10:32:43 <akuryo> it may be hard
A10:32:47 <akuryo> but something would be great
A10:32:49 <akuryo> like
A10:32:53 <akuryo> middle click spawn a block
A10:32:56 <akuryo> at the other end
A10:32:58 <Zeno> I could build a tool that autoclicks very fast when a button is held down...
A10:32:59 <akuryo> i mean...
A10:33:07 <Notch> please type out your sentences before pressing enter, akuryo
A10:33:10 <Zeno> that would take me 20 minutes max.
A10:33:12 <akuryo> lol
A10:33:19 <Notch> Zeno: Go ahead, I don't mind. =)
A10:33:25 <akuryo> if i make a drawing(paint xD) you'll watch it?
A10:33:26 <Notch> But I don't want to make that part of the core game
A10:33:27 <Zeno> as long as you're cool with it notch
A10:33:37 <Notch> absolutely. =)
A10:33:55 <Zeno> would just be a quick autoit script probably
A10:34:04 <akuryo> erm
10A10:34:07 * ConicAway is now known as Conic
A10:34:07 <akuryo> using windows library
A10:34:11 <akuryo> i can program a auto clicker
A10:34:13 <akuryo> in some minutes
A10:34:17 <Zeno> you
A10:34:17 <Parthon> zeno: I'd love to have it if you make it :D
A10:34:18 <Zeno> need
A10:34:18 <akuryo> and that would actually be a .exe
A10:34:18 <Zeno> to
A10:34:19 <Zeno> stop
A10:34:21 <Zeno> typing
A10:34:21 <Zeno> like
A10:34:22 <Zeno> this
A10:34:26 <Zeno> its annoying and moronic.
A10:34:29 <akuryo> ok
A10:34:31 <akuryo> i'll stop
A10:34:33 <akuryo> :)
A10:34:36 <checkers> i bet it would only work in azerty
A10:34:37 <sppt> Not As Annoying As This Is Though Zeno My Friend
A10:34:38 <Zeno> and you can compile autoit scripts into exes
A10:34:52 <akuryo> yeah but
A10:34:55 <Parthon> sppt: It's Really Not That Annoying :P
A10:34:55 <akuryo> way of simplicity
A10:34:57 <akuryo> sux
A10:34:57 <Zeno> the reason I use autoit is because I have my own security system so only people I want using my stuff can use it
A10:35:15 <sppt> Yes It Is
A10:35:21 <Zeno> sppppt
A10:35:23 <Zeno> how goes it
A10:35:31 <sppt> still lolbanned
A10:35:33 <sppt> so i guess bad
A10:35:39 <Zeno> on wurm? me too haha
A10:35:49 <sppt> for what?
A10:35:50 <Zeno> oracle wont reverse my 30 day ban for "emote spamming"
A10:35:55 <sppt> oh yeah
A10:35:59 <Zeno> it was the most ridiculous ban ever, EVER
A10:36:04 <sppt> well all i can hope for is the ip ban to be lifted
A10:36:11 <Notch> brb, nap
A10:36:11 <Zeno> and by dream master... a guy who hates me and looks for an excuse to ban me all the time
10A10:36:15 * Notch is now known as Notch|NAP
A10:36:17 <Zolyx> later Notch
A10:36:34 <sppt> yeah the GMs are pretty corrupt, zeno
A10:37:11 <Zeno> aye, always have been
A10:37:22 <Zeno> ive only survived this long because a few of them like me.
A10:37:28 <Zeno> the rest want me perma banned
A10:37:33 <sppt> heh
A10:37:52 <sppt> well i befriended some GMs, so i guess they can put up a good word for me
A10:37:58 <Zeno> I mean, they could never perma banned me if I didnt feel like staying perma banned, but still, its obnoxious
10A10:38:15 * DamnedGoat is now known as Stargoat
A10:38:54 <Zeno> I dont get people raging over notch asking for money for the game now
A10:39:08 <Zeno> its pretty much the exact same strategy mount&blade took... and that game is fantastic
A10:39:11 <sppt> Zeno, it's funny how prom has been cheating for years now
A10:39:17 <sppt> yet he's still able to play
A10:39:20 <Zeno> prom?
A10:39:41 <Zeno> I know for a fact that gavin and his little group cheats
A10:39:52 <Zeno> we have/had vent recordings of them talking about it
A10:39:53 <sppt> heh
A10:40:02 <sppt> good luck getting evidence though
A10:40:03 <Zeno> which we gave to rolf, but he said it wasnt enough proof
A10:40:22 <Zeno> Im pretty sure he just doesnt want to ban such a large portion of customers
A10:40:56 <Zeno> which I understand, its still amusing though because every time we bring it up gavin throws a hissy fit and whines to DM
A10:40:59 <sppt> Zeno, i told rolf i used a client mod to brighten the game due to nightblindness, but what if someone REALLY is nightblind/visually impaired and needs the client mod?
A10:41:04 <Zeno> which is ultimately why I got forum banned

A10:41:30 <akuryo> at right is middle click

A11:13:08 <El_Joe> plus, the votes were really evenly distributed over the country
A11:13:25 <El_Joe> so a lot of people are calling foul play

A11:23:02 <sppt> golden sun 3 is on it's way
A11:23:05 <sppt> i can't wait for it man
A11:23:21 <sppt> it is one of the games i've been awaiting ever since i finished GS:TLA
A11:23:39 <sppt> honestly, i hope some of the characters from the gba games are still there
A11:24:52 <sppt> but you know Parthon GS is one of the best, if not the best, gba games ever made
A11:24:59 <sppt> i think everything about the game was good
A11:25:08 <sppt> even the graphics were amazing for a handheld like the GBA
A11:25:11 <Parthon> yeah, I have it
A11:25:27 <Parthon> preaching to the chior :D
A11:25:32 <Parthon> choir?
A11:25:33 <Parthon> choir!
A11:25:33 <sppt> the music <3
A11:25:42 <sppt> the epic summons <3
A11:25:45 <sppt> the gameplay <3
A11:25:47 <sppt> the story <3
A11:25:52 <sppt> the * <3
A11:25:52 <Parthon> hmmm
A11:26:02 <Parthon> have you noticed that in games the best parts are the beginning and the end?
A11:26:13 <sppt> i disagree
A11:26:22 <sppt> GS had so many epic moments
A11:26:32 <sppt> for example, fighting the kraken on the boat to tolbi
A11:26:38 <El_Joe> video games are for children. literally
A11:26:43 <sppt> i still get shivers down my spine
A11:26:46 <El_Joe> hate to break this to you
A11:26:53 <C418> epic moments? I never had the feeling of anything being epic

A11:32:33 <akuryo> afternoon sleeping?
A11:32:37 <Parthon> yes
A11:32:39 <Parthon> a siesta
A11:33:13 <Sonict> I wish he was awake too. I have a few suggestions as well. :)
A11:33:55 <C418> if I would get paid everytime someone has a suggestion
A11:33:58 <Parthon> haha
A11:34:15 <Parthon> suggestions are good, but too many of them demanded too often and they seem like petulant whines
A11:34:51 <Parthon> or more accurately: it's harder to determine the petulant whines from the actually good suggestions
A11:35:55 <Boinciel> I believe that a means of selecting different amounts of area would be in order.
A11:36:19 <Boinciel> Q to make the cursor larger, E to make it smaller.
A11:36:26 <El_Joe> pls ad method of eating dirt
A11:36:47 <Boinciel> It'd honestly be great when I'm digging out 5x5 tunnels, then lining them with wood
A11:37:06 <Boinciel> Or getting rid of water.
A11:37:18 <El_Joe> eating dirt would be nice
A11:37:38 <Boinciel> Of course, there'd have to be a solid limit on the size; we don't want someone stripping away the entire map in a single stroke

P1:41:03 <Spazzo> You know, as much fun as this game is now as a sandbox game, I'm looking forward to some of the really cool things coming.
P1:41:15 <Spazzo> An ability to fly, perhaps?
P1:41:26 <yoshibot> city blocks
P1:41:29 <Polan> oh btw you should really make something like "trust" in it.. people can just run around and easy destroy other people work :P all server I visited were destroyed/full of spam
P1:41:33 <yoshibot> we need real roads and concrete
P1:41:39 <Spazzo> Or an option for random game events such as a flood, volcano eruption, earthquake, foggy day
P1:41:45 <mezo> i might notch
P1:41:46 <mezo> one sec
P1:41:49 <yoshibot> simcity minecraft :D
P1:41:53 <C418> do so mezo. and post me the link
P1:41:54 <Spazzo> Similar to the events that happened in City Trial from Kirby Air Ride
P1:41:56 <C418> I want to see a monkey notch
P1:42:01 <Spazzo> Polan, here's an easy idea
P1:42:02 <Polan> lol.
P1:42:21 <Spazzo> A server variable that disables destroying blocks that you did not make
P1:42:23 <undi> most important thing to think about is griefers and that "trust" Polan's speaking about. The rest comes later.
P1:42:33 <zid> There, finished
P1:42:39 <Spazzo> And then all blocks would have a specific aura or tinge around them of a certain colour that represents a user
P1:42:41 <zid> http://zid.yggdrasil.sk/bees.png
P1:42:49 <Boinciel> <Spazzo> A server variable that disables destroying blocks that you did not make <-- And everyone could destroy blocks that were there from the start
P1:42:50 <Spazzo> And if the variable is set off, you can't destroy those blocks
P1:43:03 <Spazzo> An option to start off with a 100% flat terrain would be nice, too...
P1:43:08 <Boinciel> That has its downsides, Spazzo!
P1:43:14 <Spazzo> I spent most of yesterday and today with a group of 12 friends as we cleared an entire map.
P1:43:15 <Boinciel> Someone seals in someone else
P1:43:16 <Polan> and not spawn own brick is some distance from other people brick maybe.
P1:43:17 <Spazzo> Flattened all of it.
P1:43:21 <Boinciel> The other person is unable to escape
P1:43:51 <Spazzo> Then perhaps a voteban is the best way to go
P1:43:56 <Spazzo> To eliminate griefing
P1:44:07 <zid> it won't eliminate griefing
P1:44:12 <Polan> but sometimes you might not know who is griefing :p
P1:44:23 <zid> either it's two lax and the griefers kick everybody or it's too tight and nobody ever gets kicked
P1:44:28 <Spazzo> Going back to the whole "your block" system, perhaps a way to click a button and undo the actions of one user?
P1:44:28 <zid> too*
P1:44:33 <Spazzo> By the server?
P1:44:42 <zid> nobody liked my bees?
P1:44:43 <Polan> like in blockland :)?
P1:44:50 <Spazzo> Yeah, Blockland is great to base this off of
P1:45:05 <Spazzo> Random events and flying, though....man
P1:45:08 <Spazzo> I'd be right at home there
P1:45:55 <sppt> hey polan
P1:46:08 <zid> anyone elses' server want some bee wallpaper?
P1:46:22 <Polan> hello :)

P1:57:55 <ZomBuster> when do we get custom skins
P1:58:26 <Syniphas> when you buy the game
P1:58:43 <ZomBuster> I already did
P1:58:55 <Syniphas> no you pre-ordered it
P1:59:02 <ZomBuster> argh
P1:59:45 <VitaEdo> uh, guys, how do you talk in multiplayer
P1:59:54 <zid> t
P2:00:47 <Cue> You know you have problems when you can run Crysis but not a Java game :(
P2:01:12 <Syniphas> define runing crysis
P2:01:42 <Cue> Medium at 40FPS
P2:01:46 <Cue> And that was on my old build
P2:01:50 <VitaEdo> 30fps except in the forest on max settings DX10 16x AA no strats just fightin as hard as i could
P2:01:50 <Cue> I've doubled my cores since then
P2:02:27 <zid> there, great pyramids server all beed
P2:04:21 <undi> Cue lets thank that Notch disabled mob spawning in multiplayer
P2:05:39 <Cue> Assuming we can't run it standalone?
P2:06:40 <Parthon> :D
P2:06:42 <Parthon> I love you notch :D
P2:06:49 <Notch> oh yay, thank you!
P2:07:15 <Super-Dot> Does the server require Java 1.6?
P2:07:52 <Parthon> Notch: umm .. just a quick question
P2:08:04 <Parthon> does grass cause tile update requests?
P2:08:21 <Notch> spreading grass does, yes
P2:08:32 <Parthon> crap, that explains it
P2:08:44 <Super-Dot> Because when I run "java -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer", I get http://pastebin.com/m4a6f039e
P2:08:47 <C418> one day I spent one hour to grow grass on a floating island
P2:09:13 <C418> old java version
P2:09:16 <smn> Super-Dot, invalid java
P2:09:25 <smn> needs to be sun-java6-jdk
P2:09:28 <Notch> yeah, the server uses 1.6
P2:09:29 <Super-Dot> Dang
P2:09:39 <Super-Dot> So Mac users can't run the server :(
P2:09:45 <C418> really?
P2:09:48 <smn> wut
P2:09:52 <ZomBuster> no java 1.6 for mac yet?
P2:10:00 <Super-Dot> We rely on Apple for our Java distributions
P2:10:04 <VitaEdo> ...isn't Java on like version 6 by now
P2:10:07 <Super-Dot> And Apple doesn't care about Java
P2:10:16 <C418> incredible.
P2:10:26 <C418> you are right
P2:10:31 <Super-Dot> There's a beta Java 6 for people with 64-bit processors, but I don't have that
P2:10:34 <C418> no new version for max
P2:10:35 <C418> xxxxx
P2:10:44 <Polan> java 6 and minecraft use 1.6?
P2:10:45 <Polan> :p
P2:10:50 <zid> Super-Dot: It likes to completely lock of firefox
P2:11:00 <smn> so now i spent 10 euros on minecraft, did anything change yet? :D
P2:11:05 <C418> well
P2:11:07 <Super-Dot> Firefox what?
P2:11:11 <C418> for example, theres the preorder thing
P2:11:13 <C418> it's gone
P2:11:25 <C418> no preorder sign anymore. yes. thats a start
P2:11:27 <smn> wat
P2:11:29 <Polan> yes smn
P2:11:33 <smn> i still have it
P2:11:36 <Polan> the purchase counter changed ^^
P2:11:41 <C418> you still have it?
P2:11:41 <smn> ossum
P2:11:43 <smn> yes
P2:11:45 <C418> ..uh
P2:11:46 <C418> notch?
P2:11:56 <smn> if you're hinting at that red thing in the top left corner
P2:11:59 <smn> reddish
P2:12:00 <Notch> yes?
P2:12:07 <Polan> hm.. preoder after order should dissapeard?
P2:12:09 <C418> uh, smn still has his preorder sign
P2:12:12 <C418> and he bought it
13P2:12:13 * Polan look up left
P2:12:15 <Polan> it's still there.

P2:12:32 <smn> oh also i got a new special feature: closing the minecraft page seems to crash my firefox. i wonder if i can recreate! :D
P2:12:41 <KiT_> so i herd u made custom skins
P2:12:43 <zid> not surprising
P2:12:49 <C418> maybe if you refresh the site
P2:12:53 <C418> like F5
P2:12:59 <KiT_> are these for payers only, or free?
P2:13:04 <Notch> paying only, KiT_
P2:13:04 <Spazzo> Yeah, Java does weird things with my client.
P2:13:12 <Spazzo> Really looking forward to a standalone binary.
P2:13:15 <Parthon> in theory, this should turn the floor into a giant checkerboard
P2:13:16 <smn> yeah well, it's dead again
P2:13:17 <Super-Dot> Notch: Wait, if I can't spawn mobs in multiplayer, is it possible for me to see my custom skin?
P2:13:33 <Parthon> hahahaha! it worked! :D
P2:13:35 <Notch> I'm going to make it so you can see the skin, yes
13P2:13:35 * Parthon dances
P2:13:42 <KiT_> aww. Well, not like i needed em anyway.
P2:14:00 <Notch> smn: You still have the preorder sign?
P2:14:01 <C418> everyone is now all about map hacking. which is not really hacking
P2:14:21 <Polan> hm I have same problem as smn :p
P2:14:21 <Spazzo> Maphacking?
P2:14:28 <smn> indeed, Notch
P2:14:30 <ZomBuster> editing map files
P2:14:31 <Notch> ok. Don't purchase the game again. =)
P2:14:31 <smn> also Polan
P2:14:36 <Spazzo> How exactly do you hack a map in minecraft when you can already destroy blocks?
P2:14:38 <Spazzo> Ah
P2:14:42 <Polan> is it make different if we register on one email and pay from other?
P2:14:43 <Parthon> Spazzo: writing directly to the map info
P2:14:46 <smn> as much as i'd like to pay another 10 bucks, i won't :D
P2:14:51 <Notch> no, that doesn't matter, polan
P2:14:56 <Spazzo> I didn't even bother with that
P2:15:02 <Spazzo> I flattened the terrain the hard way
P2:15:09 <KiT_> whats the purpose of maphacking in the fukken sandbox?
P2:15:55 <C418> you don't have to do things manually
P2:16:09 <Spazzo> But that's the whole fun of the game
P2:16:13 <Super-Dot> Could you reenable local mobs though?
P2:16:27 <Super-Dot> I want to see custom mobs jump around :O
P2:16:30 <smn> what format is server_level.dat in anyways
P2:16:30 <Spazzo> Assembling a team of 10 of your closest friends and working together on removing any kinks in the terrain
P2:16:43 <Spazzo> It actually felt like teamwork
P2:16:58 <C418> well, for example you can create a flat map and then work on that
P2:17:05 <Spazzo> Ssshhh
P2:17:08 <Spazzo> Don't tell me that :(

P2:18:05 <C418> er
P2:18:12 <C418> server_level.dat.zip
P2:18:14 <C418> try it out
P2:18:23 <smn> oh lol.
P2:18:34 <Parthon> Spazzo: true
P2:18:38 <zid> Awesome, just got banned outa nowhere :D
P2:18:52 <Parthon> but in only 20 minutes I managed to make a completely flat map that's exactly 16 squares high
P2:18:59 <Parthon> 16 rock, 48 sky
P2:19:00 <Spazzo> I mean, some of the games downfalls just made it more fun
P2:19:02 <KiT_> is it possible to change the map size by editing the mapfile?
P2:19:11 <Parthon> in theory, yes
P2:19:13 <Spazzo> The lack of a map to see the locations of other players, no ability to run/fly, stuff like that
P2:19:35 <Spazzo> Or the lack of the ability to increase the amount of blocks added/removed on button press
P2:19:50 <ZomBuster> parthon how do you edit the map file
P2:20:01 <Parthon> me?
P2:20:03 <KiT_> yeh, some sort of radar would be nice
P2:20:15 <Parthon> I extracted the map from the .dat file, then used a free hex editor to make changes
P2:20:32 <KiT_> good job. thats exactly how you do it
P2:20:36 <ZomBuster> oh I hoped for a better method
P2:20:42 <ZomBuster> easier
P2:21:00 <Parthon> not really
P2:21:14 <Parthon> I mean, eventually someone could make a graphical editor, but how functional it would be is another matter
P2:21:14 <KiT_> i srtill dont understand how the header data works
P2:21:15 <Cue> inb4 map editor
P2:21:41 <KiT_> the one that contains spawn ppoint position, i mean
P2:21:43 <Spazzo> Just imagine...
P2:21:46 <Polan> is there a way to "kill" mob :P?
P2:21:47 <Spazzo> Random Event: Meteor storm
P2:21:51 <Spazzo> OH NO THE WORLD IS ENDING
P2:21:53 <Polan> one just runed away.. xD
P2:21:56 <Cue> What is the point in the mob, exactly?
P2:22:00 <Spazzo> Random Event: flood
P2:22:07 <Spazzo> Everything erodes a bit and then the water level goes back down
P2:22:12 <Cue> Solar storm kthnxbai
P2:22:17 <Spazzo> Random Event: Hyperactivity
P2:22:23 <Spazzo> Every player gets a 20x increase in speed :P
P2:22:35 <Cue> Random Event: Peace and Quiet
P2:22:36 <Spazzo> Yeah, I'm totally taking these from Kirby Air Ride
P2:22:41 <Cue> Spazzo shushes. =P

P2:24:17 <Polan> ohh... :D
P2:24:19 <Polan> good idea! :3
P2:24:23 <Polan> give me 5min
P2:24:37 <ZomBuster> but
P2:24:42 <ZomBuster> you need to use the whole map
P2:24:51 <Spazzo> Yeah, with details
P2:24:55 <smn> prototype! ossum or not ossum?
P2:24:57 <Spazzo> Such as the rocky mountains actually being raised, etc.
P2:25:03 <ZomBuster> ossum?
P2:25:04 <Spazzo> Shouldn't be too hard
P2:25:10 <ZomBuster> prototype?
P2:25:19 <smn> not?
P2:25:26 <ZomBuster> you mean that game where you walk on walls and punch tanks?
P2:25:31 <smn> jes

P2:26:06 <C418> notch, you really have to make a game mode where the mobs are zombies
P2:26:15 <C418> trying to run away from them creeps me out
P2:26:16 <C418> :D
P2:26:18 <VitaEdo> Ness Ness Ness Ness Ness NessNess Ness Ness Ness Ness Ness ....

P2:26:36 <KiT_> meh
P2:26:49 <ZomBuster> he mentioned that already in the develepont thingie C418
P2:26:55 <ZomBuster> -zombie mode
P2:26:58 <Drakkar> zombie mode will be great
P2:27:00 <Polan> spazzo in wat ?:d
P2:27:08 <Spazzo> Building a world map
P2:27:12 <Parthon> that was fun, but I don't have any ideas that would be easy to impliment
P2:27:15 <Polan> I was joking I won't do it ^^
P2:27:18 <ZomBuster> they need pathfinding for that of course 
P2:27:24 <Spazzo> I can probably assemble a team to do it.
P2:27:27 <C418> really, there is nothing more creepy than 100 mobs running randomly around, trying to hurt you
P2:27:28 <Polan> pathfinding isn't that hard..
P2:27:32 <Spazzo> Make blueprints and then just go with it
P2:27:34 <Parthon> the hex editor wasn't bad, but it was missing the tools I really needed
P2:27:42 <KiT_> like what, parthon?
P2:28:04 <Polan> parthon you mean the gaaammeee? you need to know all games in early alpha look like that ^^

P2:28:30 <KiT_> pathfinding is hard on dynamic terrain
P2:28:47 <Polan> not really :3
P2:29:12 <undi> A*?
P2:29:16 <Polan> just might need a bit more time to find way :p
P2:29:24 <peerkoel> if I give someone a http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=<name>&id=0 url, can they overwrite my level?
P2:29:31 <Notch> ok, so FAST pathfinding is hard on dynamic 3d terrain. ;)
P2:29:45 <Polan> :p
P2:29:55 <undi> maybe not that much pathfinding
P2:29:58 <C418> pathfinding without getting stuck
P2:29:59 <C418> :D
P2:29:59 <undi> just doom-ish wandering
P2:30:01 <KiT_> thats what that night/day trick for, right?
P2:30:06 <Spazzo> Speaking of which
P2:30:11 <smn> no, peerkoel
P2:30:11 <Polan> so searching way to player if he is in range..
P2:30:13 <Spazzo> I recall reading something about the ability to import DooM maps
P2:30:24 <Spazzo> Does that work for all versions of DooM (specifically, doom legacy)?
P2:30:24 <C418> aiming at player direction should be easy, aiming at player direction, trying to avoid obstacles, other story
P2:30:46 <Polan> that's why as undi mention we have A* and other stuff ^^

P2:31:19 <undi> but idiotic and basic AIs can be fun
P2:31:29 <Polan> idiotic Ai.. xD
P2:31:39 <KiT_> like cortex command AI?
P2:31:43 <Polan> AI is near to always stupid :(
P2:31:56 <C418> cortex command ai? well, those bots at least can kill you fairly easily
P2:32:07 <undi> i find more interesting something like macro-AIs
P2:32:16 <undi> you "command" a mob to make a pile
P2:32:22 <undi> when he finishes, he dies
P2:32:28 <Spazzo> Hehe
P2:32:33 <Polan> ; p
P2:32:34 <Spazzo> I could use about 50 of those and make an army :)
P2:32:36 <undi> or a wall
P2:32:53 <Polan> for that we don't need mob. :p
P2:33:00 <Spazzo> macro-AIs sound like something that would work wonderfully for a strategy game
P2:33:02 <Parthon> KiT_, Polan: nah, I mean the external edit, the in game editor is fine
P2:33:43 <KiT_> so notch, whats on top of your todo list atm?
P2:33:58 <C418> SOUND
P2:34:02 <Parthon> lol
P2:34:03 <undi> you make something, recording a macro, and then create a mob that does the same til you kill it
P2:34:06 <Notch> right now it's looking into why a few people couldn't sign up
P2:34:11 <Parthon> C418: what part of space fortress should I work on next?
P2:34:15 <Notch> SOUND
P2:34:24 <C418> haha
P2:34:25 <Spazzo> Flying mode/radar/increased run speed/sound/toggleable radius for clearing/adding blocks? :)
P2:34:25 <C418> :D
P2:34:29 <KiT_> hehe
P2:34:34 <Parthon> not sound yet :P
P2:34:41 <Spazzo> If we get any of those, I'll be giddy.
P2:34:41 <undi> no music necessary, just basic sfx?
P2:34:46 <FoxBlitzz> Here's a question
P2:34:52 <FoxBlitzz> Why can't you save local copies of server maps?
P2:35:01 <C418> hm
P2:35:08 <C418> how about a bit of graphical improvements
P2:35:09 <Parthon> I think I will do subtiles
P2:35:11 <Notch> er, you can?
P2:35:17 <FoxBlitzz> Notch, I tried it twice
P2:35:25 <KiT_> ehh, how?
P2:35:29 <FoxBlitzz> When I tried loading them solo it just generated blank maps
P2:35:30 <Notch> oh, you mean from the clients!
P2:35:51 <Notch> the file format doesn't like the networkplayers. =)
P2:36:18 <KiT_> hehe, was fun when the load-save washt removed form multiplayer

P2:42:04 <C418> ah, I had that too yesterday
P2:42:11 <C418> I guess because it's a link with a swedish tag
P2:42:20 <Notch> mmhhh

P2:44:08 <Notch> purchases didn't update when I manually verified three accounts

P2:48:25 <C418> at least thats how it was with donations
P2:48:33 <Parthon> if I do this right, I'll have to model air displacement

P2:51:14 <Eagle> I don't use those Euros
P2:51:15 <KiT_> and what kinds of avatars do payers get? some set of predefined avatars, or ability to send your own texture to craftguy?
P2:51:26 <ZomBuster> I thought YOU would get paid C418
P2:51:35 <Parthon> texture uploading will be cool, but afraid it's just predefined for now
P2:51:36 <C418> haha
P2:51:42 <Polan> you can change $ to euro on paypal :)
P2:51:56 <Eagle> But what about them conversion rates.
P2:52:00 <ZomBuster> polan paypal does it automatically

P3:24:15 <Polan> you stuck :P?
P3:24:18 <Polan> ah
P3:24:22 <Drakkar> so you already have building buildings operational?
P3:24:24 <Drakkar> damn
P3:24:26 <Drakkar> you work fast
P3:24:27 <Parthon> yeah
P3:24:34 <Parthon> that was done a little while ago
P3:24:41 <Polan> well good idea, so griefer can grief couple server without needing to log off ;D
P3:24:45 <Drakkar> I assume combat isn't in though'
P3:24:56 <Parthon> no enemies yet
P3:24:58 <Parthon> nothing to fight
P3:25:00 <Drakkar> I think that should probably be held off for later
P3:25:29 <Drakkar> as it includes alot of factors(like armor and etc)
P3:25:29 <Polan> in wat ?:p
P3:26:17 <tesvann> my balls are out and they are flossin lots of clout
P3:26:27 <ZomBuster> notch said something about shooting arrows
P3:26:33 <Polan> :o
P3:26:40 <Polan> in minecraft? :}
P3:26:44 <Polan> battlesss..
P3:26:47 <ZomBuster> I would love to see a simple deathmatch test where you shoot arrows at eachother
P3:26:53 <Polan> .maybe like in Wrath on Magnagor...
P3:26:56 <Polan> or how it was called :D
P3:27:01 <ZomBuster> and then later one use it in survival mode

P3:30:42 <Drakkar> btw parthon
P3:31:03 <Cue> So, uh
P3:31:03 <Drakkar> I kind of got obsessive so now I've harassed a guy aiming for NASA for information
P3:31:09 <Cue> How can I improve my FPS? :(
P3:31:26 <Drakkar> i assume you don't want to hear upgrade your hardware
P3:31:27 <Drakkar> try f
P3:31:32 <Drakkar> I think thats the fog button
P3:31:52 <Parthon> Drakkar: what kind of info from NASA?
P3:31:54 <Cue> It's nothing to do with my hardware
P3:31:57 <Drakkar> uh
P3:32:05 <Drakkar> not from nasa
P3:32:05 <Drakkar> but
P3:32:14 <Polan> hm.. is there any way to raise water?
P3:32:15 <Parthon> aah right
P3:32:17 <Drakkar> this guy is basically one of the people trying to get a manned mission to mars going
P3:32:20 <Polan> abbove the normal lvl?
P3:32:23 <Drakkar> and he does
P3:32:24 <Drakkar> HUGE
P3:32:29 <Drakkar> amounts of terraforming research
P3:32:37 <Parthon> cool
P3:32:44 <Drakkar> <Cue> It's nothing to do with my hardware < that is why I said I assume you don't want to hear it
P3:32:46 <Drakkar> anyway
P3:33:06 <Drakkar> stuff like the bare minimum a human requires in atmosphere
P3:33:18 <Drakkar> to live that is
P3:33:31 <Drakkar> the effects of high CO2 on humans etc
P3:34:05 <Parthon> like the fact that it's more important to clean CO2 than it is to supply oxygen
P3:34:38 <Drakkar> yeah
P3:34:43 <Parthon> and things like: on a planet like mars where there's plenty of iron ore, with enough energy, you can just strip the oxygen from the iron molecules and use that for air
P3:34:54 <Cue> You'd think that I'd be able to run the game, it's not exactly tensing
P3:34:55 <Drakkar> and that using percentages for CO2 in different atmospheres comes out HORRIBLY wrong
P3:34:59 <Cue> I get 1000+ FPS sometimes
P3:35:05 <Cue> But most of the time it's 5
P3:35:06 <Parthon> oh yeah :P
P3:35:14 <Cue> IETab was pretty much the only time I got anything worthy
P3:35:14 <Drakkar> because 5% CO2 on earth is equivalent to 20% CO2 on mars
P3:35:18 <Cue> And last night using Firefox...

P3:35:25 <Parthon> due to atmospheric density?
P3:35:28 <Drakkar> yeah
P3:35:36 <Drakkar> so I intend to do everything in mbars
P3:35:39 <Parthon> aaah .. I didn't know that :P
P3:36:02 <ZomBuster> mhh how do I connect directly to an ip again?
P3:36:05 <Drakkar> I'm going for a sort of hard science setting I guess
P3:36:19 <Parthon> I'm going for fun over accuracy, but realism when I can
P3:36:24 <ZomBuster> oh got it
P3:36:27 <Drakkar> well
P3:36:32 <Drakkar> I will bend the rules for things
P3:36:38 <Drakkar> like space travel
P3:36:47 <Drakkar> and the actual number of planets that are uh
P3:36:48 <Drakkar> barren
P3:36:51 <Drakkar> vs not barren
P3:37:02 <Polan> :o
P3:37:14 <Parthon> cool
P3:37:27 <Drakkar> it'd be more interesting if beneath neptune's waves there were GIGANTIC PLANT CONTINENTS
P3:37:30 <Polan> can I ask what you talk about ?:p game or something real?
P3:37:31 <Drakkar> so yeah
P3:37:31 <Parthon> I'm doing things like allowing players to mine for oxygen :P
P3:37:36 <Drakkar> yeah
P3:37:51 <Polan> space sandbox ?:P
P3:37:54 <Drakkar> yeah
P3:37:56 <Drakkar> pretty much
P3:38:03 <Parthon> Polan: space fortress: dwarf fortress in space almost
P3:38:04 <AlMightyBob> sounds like the spacebuild gamemode from gmod
P3:38:05 <Drakkar> me and parthon had similar simultaneous ideas
P3:38:35 <Polan> oh
P3:38:38 <Drakkar> just
P3:38:40 <Drakkar> totally different
P3:38:48 <Drakkar> I'm going pretty much humans only
P3:39:21 <Drakkar> (and near-future, like 400-500 years from now near)
P3:39:39 <Parthon> yah, and mine's more like 1000 years and multiple races
P3:39:45 <Parthon> more small scale too
P3:40:05 <Drakkar> yeaaaaah
P3:40:20 <Drakkar> my hope is players will be able to run an empire in its endgame
P3:40:32 <Parthon> cool
P3:40:34 <Polan> huge project ;o
P3:40:37 <Drakkar> eh
P3:40:44 <Drakkar> the secret to it all is alot of cheesing of mechanics
P3:40:44 <Drakkar> :P
P3:40:50 <Parthon> I'm not sure whether to allow players that kind of freedom yet
P3:40:58 <Parthon> I know that there's an empire that you start off in
P3:41:02 <Drakkar> like for example
P3:41:02 <Parthon> and working for
P3:41:08 <Drakkar> when you settle a planet
P3:41:11 <Parthon> for what happens when your colony is successful?

P4:57:42 <Notch> yaaay! =D
P4:58:15 <PrinceOfFire59> I went swimming. In the rain. And the pool was 68 degrees.
P4:58:20 <PrinceOfFire59> and it was AWESOME
P4:58:48 <PrinceOfFire59> I'mma make a custom skin
P4:59:08 <PrinceOfFire59> Paint Dot Net, ACTIVATE!

P5:00:07 <Parthon> I just paid then too :P
P5:00:13 <Parthon> Notch: what happens now?
P5:00:26 <Imapanda> new website section?
P5:00:27 <Conic> I can't believe this is going to cost money. :(
P5:00:55 <Parthon> wow .. I can already access my new skin .. crazy
P5:00:59 <PrinceOfFire59> SKINS TIP: When making a skin, use the noise effect to make the colors match the texture style.
P5:02:48 <undi> are ppl who not play able to see other's skins?
P5:03:00 <Notch> you can see everyone's skin
P5:03:03 <ZomBuster> lol

P5:03:12 <Rosetta> good fun ZomBuster lol
P5:03:15 <peerkoel> Rosetta please reset :(
P5:03:17 <Rosetta> I recorded all of it :D
P5:03:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Conic, this game is totally worth paying for.
P5:03:23 <peerkoel> ooh
P5:03:35 <Rosetta> fuck 3.9GB frams
P5:03:37 <Rosetta> fraps
P5:03:37 <ZomBuster> now how did you make that
P5:03:51 <Rosetta> I made the track with wood and mud first in minecraft
P5:03:59 <Rosetta> then changed the wood and mud to water and lava
P5:04:10 <Parthon> it is hard to know what goes from the skin to the player though
P5:04:12 <ZomBuster> oooh 
P5:04:14 <Rosetta> Im really pleased how it turned out
P5:04:14 <ZomBuster> clever
P5:04:26 <Rosetta> il stick it back up

P5:05:58 <ZomBuster> all this talk about skins.. but I see nothing about it on the site?
P5:05:59 <Lukeybatman> Woot, possible donation to my business :)
P5:06:14 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: There is one!
P5:06:27 <Parthon> happy bday prince! :D
P5:06:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
P5:06:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay.
P5:06:46 <Arf> You know what'd be awesome
P5:06:48 <Notch> Parthon: The upload script checks the logged in user, and checks that the hasPaid flag is true
P5:07:03 <Arf> Block interactions, kinda like in the "falling sand" games
P5:07:12 <Lukeybatman> Buying now :D
P5:07:15 <Parthon> I mean, how does the payment link to the hasPaid flag?
P5:07:18 <Arf> That would make for some interesting cobinations
P5:07:22 <C418> you are not haspaid. you will commence suicide
P5:07:35 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: There should be an applet in /skin/
P5:07:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Do you have to pay to use the previewer?
P5:07:54 <Parthon> I have a beard :D
P5:07:57 <Notch> no, but you can't upload new skins
P5:08:08 <Notch> So you just see your current skin (ie the default one)
P5:08:11 <ZomBuster> ooh found it
P5:08:13 <vdgmprgrmr> *sigh*
P5:08:14 <C418> is the previewer already online?
P5:08:28 <ZomBuster> ill make the best skin ever
P5:08:42 <C418> I'll make the best default skin user ever
P5:09:33 <Parthon> Notch: how does the paypal payment turn into the hasPaid flag?
P5:09:49 <Notch> Via IPN (Instant Payment Notification)
P5:09:56 <Arf> Awesome
P5:09:57 <Notch> paypal contacts me on a Seeecret Uuuurl
P5:09:57 <Parthon> aaah
P5:10:00 <Parthon> cool
P5:10:01 <Arf> I'll have to pay to use the skin modifier
P5:10:04 <Notch> it connects back to paypal to verify that it was indeed them
P5:10:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, does anyone else think it would be super-awesome to see that mob's arm just punch the ever-loving shit out of someone?
P5:10:07 <Parthon> but I didn't put my username in
P5:10:10 <Arf> well, I guess I'll stay like this forever
P5:10:13 <Parthon> or do you have to be logged in to pay?
P5:10:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, block-hand meets FACE.
P5:10:19 <Notch> You have to be logged in
P5:10:26 <Notch> the username is sent via a custom parameter flag
P5:10:30 <Arf> How much does the game cost?
P5:10:33 <Notch> *parameter
P5:10:34 <Notch> not flag
P5:10:41 <Notch> 9.95 at the moment, arf

P5:10:52 <Arf> Well then

P5:10:58 <Arf> Even less likely for me to buy it :(
P5:11:06 <Notch> ack
P5:11:08 <Parthon> aaah .. cool :D
P5:11:18 <Notch> So is there anyone with a custom skin playing anywhere?
P5:11:21 <Notch> I want to test it. =D

P5:11:40 <C418> aah
P5:11:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Arf: it's 12.50-13.50 USD just-so-you-know.
P5:11:42 <C418> there it is
P5:11:48 <C418> ah, yes. I see my... default skin
P5:11:54 <Arf> Where I live we don't use dollars nor euros
P5:11:55 <C418> it's better than anyone else
P5:11:58 <C418> because it's default
P5:11:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
P5:12:00 <Arf> I live in a third world country
P5:12:12 <Arf> Which pretty much fcks me up on everything technology related
P5:12:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Well that kinda sucks, I guess. Where are you?
P5:12:17 <Arf> Argentina
P5:12:22 <Arf> Not EXACTLY third world
P5:12:22 <Parthon> C418: lets meet up on a server, which one?
P5:12:22 <C418> someone (notch) change my skin into a penis. I want to be laughed at
P5:12:23 <C418> :(
P5:12:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh! I have a friend in Argentina.
P5:12:28 <Arf> but it's economy is TERRIBLE
P5:12:30 <C418> you decide
P5:12:32 <Arf> *its
P5:12:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, it's like $20 there isn't it?
P5:12:46 <Arf> haha
P5:12:47 <Arf> even more
P5:12:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait no, wrong proportion.
P5:12:57 <Parthon> I can never decide :P
P5:12:57 <Arf> a Wii is about $2000 here

P5:13:42 <Parthon> arf: where are yuo?
P5:13:55 <Arf> They still sell Sega genesises (what's the plural for genesis) at over 100$
P5:13:57 <Arf> Argentina
P5:14:03 <Parthon> C418: skyvillage 1
P5:14:07 <Arf> Which is lolertastic
P5:14:12 <Arf> and at the same time depressing
P5:14:20 <vdgmprgrmr> That would be technically the right word for plural of genesis...
P5:14:22 <Arf> I remember when I wanted a GBA so badly :P
P5:15:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, my friend over there was like :'( when I told him the price of Minecraft...
P5:15:27 <Drakkar> the plural of the genesis is
P5:15:31 <Drakkar> BONERTOPIA
P5:15:35 <C418> ah
P5:15:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I knew a guy with two bonertopia once.

P5:16:03 <Drakkar> ROFL
P5:16:04 <Parthon> Notch: if you want to see my skin in action join skyvillage 1
P5:16:04 <C418> Parthon has a custom skin
P5:16:06 <Drakkar> shit
P5:16:07 <Arf> But well, the guy's gotta get profit, right?
P5:16:16 <Drakkar> hey Notch
P5:16:27 <Drakkar> will we be able to link maps
P5:16:30 <Drakkar> at any time
P5:16:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, you should set-it-up so like people in countries with bad exchange rates (ahemargentinaahem) can get 9.95 in THEIR currency instead of Euros.
P5:16:55 <Arf> Nah
P5:17:02 <vdgmprgrmr> It would still be nice.
P5:17:12 <Drakkar> no because then I would order everything from mexico

P5:32:15 <Dilt> :(

P5:33:57 <Imapanda> I might try again.
P5:34:16 <Dilt> did you have money on the card when you tried to assign it?
P5:34:26 <Dilt> you generally need at least a single dollar on it

P5:38:01 <C418> if you paid
P5:38:11 <Dilt> see the 'DIDN'T pay' part
P5:38:21 <Dilt> and technically, i believe now we can't pay since Notch was frozen?
P5:38:32 <Dilt> or is it just me being mentally rejected
P5:38:35 <C418> what do you mean?
P5:39:36 <Dilt> am i wrong?
P5:39:44 <C418> I don't know what you mean
P5:40:00 <Dilt> yeah
P5:40:03 <Dilt> i misread something

P5:40:08 <Dilt> ignore what i said
P5:40:09 <MisterX> if you didn't pay, you can't change your own skin, but you can see custom skins of other people who bought it. 
P5:40:09 <Arf> can we have bolcanoes in the next release?
P5:40:16 <Arf> *volcanoes
P5:40:36 <MisterX> Those would require entirely new liquid physics, I guess, Arf :)
P5:40:46 <C418> yes. thats why I asked what everyone's skins look like. if someone changed it
P5:40:50 <MisterX> if they were just high pipes of lava, then servers would be doomed
P5:40:52 <undi> can we haev real-time plant-growing?
P5:41:00 <C418> yes
P5:41:04 <C418> buy blueberry garden
P5:41:17 <undi> and a dog companion?
P5:41:21 <C418> buy fable
P5:41:22 <C418> 2
P5:41:24 <Conic> What exactly do "mobs" do?
P5:41:32 <undi> and a karma-meter that when you do bad things, youre then bad
P5:41:34 <C418> randomly running around, being a physics test
P5:41:36 <undi> and it affects the whole gameplay?
P5:41:37 <Conic> run around looking stupid?
P5:41:40 <Conic> Hm
P5:41:57 <Arf> seriously though
P5:42:05 <undi> that would add a brand new and completely exciting dimension to the game
P5:42:07 <Arf> block interactions like Falling Sand would be awesomesauce
P5:42:13 <peerkoel> ouch
P5:42:14 <Parthon> anyone want to see my mario skin? :D

P5:47:28 <kingnerd> damn
P5:47:32 <kingnerd> I'm so tempted...

P5:48:23 <kingnerd> I might buy it just to do a review
P5:48:28 <Arf> zombie plague on the other hands seems absofrikken gorgeous
P5:50:25 <kingnerd> okay, I gave in and bought the game.. I'm going to review it on my blog as new features come

P5:56:44 <Kapow> I'd buy it if that were the case

P5:57:33 <C418> well, donations helped
P5:57:34 <Parthon> it ended up costing me 15E, but money well spent
P5:57:42 <smn> <@C418> on which server are you now smn? <-- pyramid retardtown
P5:57:45 <Lmaobat> You'll find a payment fomr a Mr. Lmao Boat
P5:57:58 <Kapow> pyramid has been awful since yesterday
P5:58:08 <Arf> SENTRY DOWN
P5:58:12 <Kapow> it needs a reset
P5:58:42 <Arf> Well
P5:58:54 <Arf> the moment minecraft hits "Pay to Play" it's game over for me
P5:58:55 <ZomBuster> http://www.cubeupload.com/files/34ba00charcopy.png if you want the engineer skin =D
P5:58:57 <Arf> :P
P5:59:11 <Kapow> yeah he's going to lose a lot of userbase
P5:59:18 <Kapow> which means less word-of-mouth
P5:59:28 <Kapow> which means less people who might way to pay for extra features
P5:59:41 <MisterX> he said there's going to be a demo
P5:59:52 <Dilt> i'm fine with the current method
P5:59:53 <Kapow> a multiplayer public server demo?
P5:59:56 <Dilt> it's not a per-month payment
P5:59:59 <MisterX> if that isn't far too restrictive, maybe that will keep some people playing nonetheless
P6:00:01 <Kapow> or single-player?
P6:00:09 <Dilt> it's not micropayments "pay money for a new skin!!"
P6:00:11 <Kapow> because single-player is pretty boring
P6:00:13 <MisterX> I doubt that that's decided, yet
P6:00:15 <Dilt> "pay money for custom blocks!!"
P6:00:20 <C418> I want to make custom skins too :(
P6:00:24 <Arf> Nonon
P6:00:28 <Arf> You don't understand what I mean
P6:00:30 <Dilt> it's a simple pay-once play-forever-all-features plan
P6:00:31 <Arf> A pay once and play forever
P6:00:32 <C418> but I don't know if buying myself is wrong
P6:00:33 <Kapow> he should really leave the basics free and charge for extras
P6:00:35 <Arf> I won't be able to pay once
P6:00:39 <Arf> so therefore no game forever
P6:00:40 <Dilt> why not?
P6:00:46 <Arf> Kinda like preordering duke nukem forever

P6:01:03 <Dilt> Kapow: pretty sure
P6:01:06 <Dilt> we don't know anything yet

P6:01:15 <Dilt> not minecraft -beta-
P6:01:21 <Dilt> or minecraft -released edition-
P6:01:38 <Dilt> this is a barebones features game right now, in comparison with the final version :P
P6:01:51 <Kapow> and yet it's already fun
P6:02:36 <MisterX> I wonder if the more typical game modes are going to work, at all. Remember that Minecraft was derived from Inifiniminer only for the reason that it's actual game mode was less interesting to many than the simple free creating
P6:02:46 <MisterX> its*
P6:02:53 <tesvann> i gave my guy a penis
P6:03:25 <Lmaobat> classy
P6:03:27 <Boinciel> But yeah, you should still have access to all blocks no matter your status
P6:03:39 <Mode> Oh hey, it's Kapow.
P6:03:48 <Dilt> yeah MisterX
P6:03:54 <Dilt> there's currently a 'survival mode' planned
P6:03:58 <Parthon> goodnight everyone
P6:03:59 <Dilt> with limited bricking ability
P6:04:10 <Arf> Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release the game source code as some kind of open source. 
P6:04:11 <MisterX> yeah, I know, I find that idea interesting
P6:04:14 <Dilt> the goal isn't really decided on that

P6:04:28 <Dilt> arf: consider blockland

P6:09:51 <Kapow> and steam doesn't use paypal
P6:09:54 <Dilt> No idea what Allegro is
P6:10:05 <kingnerd> any idea why the skins arent working?
P6:10:10 <C418> SMN
P6:10:11 <Dilt> I have an awesome guide to learning to program...
P6:10:14 <Arf> Allegro is a renderer
P6:10:16 <Dilt> the only issue is that it's in Python
P6:10:20 <PrinceOfFire59> I AM TEMPLATE MAN
P6:10:26 <Dilt> Aha.
P6:10:27 <Arf> so far
P6:10:31 <Kapow> don't use C++ unless you have to
P6:10:32 <FoxBlitzz> No it isn't.
P6:10:35 <Arf> The only thing I ever did is http://arf.vactual.net/wnlb4.zip
P6:10:37 <Arf> Ok FB
P6:10:37 <kingnerd> No C++
P6:10:40 <Arf> It's a library
P6:10:41 <kingnerd> avoid C++ like the plague
P6:10:49 <Dilt> kingnerd: why's that?
P6:10:51 <vdgmprgrmr> What should a person use?
P6:10:56 <Arf> What is love?
P6:10:57 <kingnerd> Microsoft patent and trademark clusterfuck
P6:11:01 <Kapow> python is pretty good to start learning how to program
P6:11:03 <Arf> Why do fools fall in love?
P6:11:06 <FoxBlitzz> kingnerd: It is?
P6:11:07 <Kapow> ruby is also really nice
P6:11:19 <kingnerd> Yup.... .Net in general... They are trying to rape Linux with it also
P6:11:28 <Dilt> why are you associating .net with c++
P6:11:29 <FoxBlitzz> I use MinGW and GCC and I don't notice anything out of the ordinary
P6:11:31 <kingnerd> Novell has a license, but every other distro that prepackages Mono is open to lawsuits
P6:11:33 <Dilt> and hell
P6:11:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Python... I've thought of using that.
P6:11:39 <kingnerd> anyways
P6:11:39 <Dilt> why are you associating c++ with microsoft
P6:11:41 <FoxBlitzz> kingnerd, you thinking of C#?
P6:11:44 <kingnerd> back to skins
P6:11:45 <Kapow> C++ has nothing to do with microsoft
P6:11:46 <Arf> cout<<" :'(\n";
P6:11:49 <FoxBlitzz> C++ is NOT C#
P6:11:49 <Dilt> c# is what you're after
P6:11:56 <Arf> cin.get();
P6:11:57 <kingnerd> oh right... my bad
P6:12:03 <FoxBlitzz> Jesus
P6:12:04 <kingnerd> Java for me... possibly python soon
P6:12:04 <kingnerd> lol
P6:12:07 <kingnerd> sorry about that
P6:12:12 <Arf> My only real problem is that
P6:12:13 <Kapow> you shouldn't use C++ because it's a pain in the ass
P6:12:16 <Dilt> java's more of the patent clusterfuck
P6:12:20 <Arf> I don't fully understand how a computer really works
P6:12:20 <kingnerd> Skins... anyone know why skins don't work?
P6:12:23 <Arf> You know
P6:12:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I use Blitz3d, but it's slow and I hate it.
P6:12:27 <Arf> bytes, memory addresses
P6:12:28 <Arf> etc
P6:12:35 <FoxBlitzz> C++ is getting the job done for me
P6:12:37 <Arf> So when it comes to doing memory management
P6:12:37 <Arf> well
P6:12:45 <Dilt> Arf: when I find a good guide on it, I'll remember to show you to it
P6:12:48 <Dilt> i've yet to find one
P6:12:50 <vdgmprgrmr> But it's hard for me to get into anything else.
P6:12:51 <FoxBlitzz> I previously used C, and C++ fixes so many problems with the former
P6:12:52 <Dilt> and teachers are much worse
P6:12:55 <kingnerd> at least JAva is open people
P6:12:56 <kingnerd> whatever
P6:12:59 <Arf> I learned through cprogramming.com
P6:13:16 <Arf> The little I did, at least
P6:13:31 <Arf> I think the last lesson I read was typecasting
P6:13:51 <kingnerd> Guys... Nobody knows why skins don't work right now?
P6:13:58 <vdgmprgrmr> They do work!
P6:14:04 <kingnerd> Nobody sees mine

P6:18:01 <FoxBlitzz> I dislike monolithic frameworks in general. They make distribution a PITA on Windows
P6:18:12 <Drakkar> nah
P6:18:14 <Drakkar> not really
P6:18:15 <C418> when do we have version 4.18
P6:18:24 <Notch> 100!
P6:18:35 <Drakkar> there's nothing wrong with checking if the framework is installed and installing it if need be
P6:18:35 <FoxBlitzz> When you need a program installer that launches four or five separate installers, then yeah, there's a problem
P6:18:43 <Drakkar> no not really
P6:18:53 <Boinciel> <FoxBlitzz> I dislike the concept of XNA <-- I can't even download the installer package!
P6:18:59 <FoxBlitzz> It's cluttered, slow, bulky, and it isn't user-friendly in the slightest
P6:19:07 <Dilt> wait a second
P6:19:14 <Dilt> Boinciel, I know you
P6:19:18 <Boinciel> Yes, you do.
P6:19:20 <Drakkar> I disagree
P6:19:28 <Drakkar> the only issue I have with XNA is the size
P6:19:37 <Drakkar> and considering its a framework for primarily 3d games
P6:19:44 <Drakkar> the size isn't really that much of a problem
P6:19:59 <FoxBlitzz> XNA also isn't portable...
P6:20:05 <Drakkar> no it isn't
P6:20:07 <Drakkar> I never said it was
P6:20:11 <Drakkar> C# is
P6:20:14 <Drakkar> XNA is not
P6:20:24 <CheeToS> eh, a game I have installed that uses XNA didn't require any additional installers, & the XNA library file it includes is 732 KB
P6:20:28 <FoxBlitzz> I'm sure there are people who would like to develop on the 360
P6:20:42 <FoxBlitzz> I am not one of those people, and I would rather just have support for a multitude of PC operating systems
P6:20:47 <Drakkar> lawls
P6:20:59 <Dilt> good, FoxBlitzz didn't get caught in the trap
P6:21:05 <Drakkar> <CheeToS> eh, a game I have installed that uses XNA didn't require any additional installers, & the XNA library file it includes is 732 KB < yeah you can trim it pretty decently
P6:21:07 <Dilt> a windows computer is a PC
P6:21:11 <Dilt> a mac computer is ALSO a PC
P6:21:14 <FoxBlitzz> Yes
P6:21:15 <Dilt> as is a linux computer
P6:21:16 <Dilt> :D
P6:21:19 <FoxBlitzz> Exactly
P6:21:26 <FoxBlitzz> I can't stand Apple's marketing spin
P6:21:28 <Dilt> i love those commericals, shows how ignorant apple likes to think of us

P6:22:32 <Arf> so hey, they just released a teaser trailer for HL2:Ep3
P6:22:41 <CheeToS> it will surely allow XNA games, but apps is still up in the air
P6:22:45 <tesvann> so about minecraft
P6:22:45 <Drakkar> yep
P6:22:53 <Drakkar> especially considering XNA already lets you create shit for the zune

P6:23:57 <Drakkar> being loaded
P6:24:01 <Arf> Sisgh, this is why I never liked microsoft or the Xbox
P6:24:03 <Notch> I've been cleaing up paypal issues
P6:24:05 <Arf> *sigh
P6:24:10 <Dilt> yay for paypal issues
P6:24:18 <Notch> They screamed at me once I hit 1000 euros (donations + sales)
P6:24:21 <Arf> They just wanted to cash in
P6:24:27 <Eagle> They screamed at you.
P6:24:30 <Arf> into the console market
P6:24:32 <Arf> also lol
P6:24:35 <Arf> screaming over the internet
P6:24:35 <Notch> so I had to take pictures of a utility bill and a photo id and send them
P6:24:39 <Eagle> As in "DON'T EVER GET MORE MONEY AGAIN"
P6:24:40 <Eagle> Oh
P6:24:41 <FoxBlitzz> I'm really not keen on having a cellphone or music player as a digital swiss army knife
P6:24:53 <FoxBlitzz> I want something as close to a PC as possible these days
P6:24:53 <CheeToS> FoxBlitzz: I am :>
P6:25:05 <Arf> Pandora?
P6:25:09 <Notch> I've withdrawn all the money, I don't trust them yet
P6:25:11 <FoxBlitzz> Arf: Yes
P6:25:15 <Notch> but it's going to take a few days
P6:25:23 <FoxBlitzz> Pandora _is_ a bit on the expensive side
P6:25:32 <FoxBlitzz> Then again, there are UMPCs that sell for waaaaay more
P6:25:35 <Dilt> notch
P6:25:39 <Dilt> don't trust paypal one lick
P6:25:48 <FoxBlitzz> So in a sense Pandora is actually kinda cheap compared to similar products
P6:25:48 <Sonict> It also ran into the same issue that Notch is having now too
P6:25:48 <Eagle> I hate paypal, I used a lot of visa gift cards to fund my paypal account and they thought it was credit card fraud.
P6:25:49 <Dilt> all it takes is one bad customer and they'll freeze your -entire- account
P6:25:54 <Dilt> and anything linked to them in your name
P6:26:01 <Dilt> no matter if it's $10 or $100,000
P6:26:02 <Eagle> So they locked my account. >>;
P6:26:03 <CheeToS> Notch: I have learned over the years that paypal is an evil, evil company who survives on strife and misfortune
P6:26:04 <FoxBlitzz> Can't run Windows, but I don't really care since it can handle Linux
P6:26:06 <C418> oh yeah, I heard about that
P6:26:11 <Notch> :-O
P6:26:13 <FoxBlitzz> Ooooh
P6:26:14 <FoxBlitzz> Yeah
P6:26:17 <Notch> I should start looking for alternatives
P6:26:19 <FoxBlitzz> Paypal screwed over Pandora too
P6:26:23 <FoxBlitzz> Baaaad bad
P6:26:25 <ZomBuster> pff
P6:26:26 <Dilt> and they won't unfreeze until -they- want to
P6:26:27 <C418> regulary taking your money to your bank account should get rid of that problem
P6:26:28 <ZomBuster> all this bad talk
P6:26:29 <Dilt> which may be up to a year
P6:26:47 <ZomBuster> I just got my bank account linked to my paypal and it goes smooth as butter
P6:26:50 <Drakkar> though tbh
P6:26:55 <Drakkar> I would never use the zunehd for anything
P6:27:03 <ZomBuster> a bit too much actually
P6:27:06 <Drakkar> (beyond games really)
P6:27:09 <C418> you can link your bank account so everything thats on paypal automatically gets transferred?

P6:42:06 <Drakkar> the argument over BIRDS
P6:42:12 <Drakkar> scribblenauts is awesome though
P6:42:21 <C418> and you can use giant enemy headcrab to fight against keyboard cat

P6:45:44 <Arf> in those counter strike plugins in which you can place blocks
P6:45:47 <Imapanda> would help identifying griefers.

P6:49:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I wonder if he still thinks he's banned...
P6:49:49 <PrinceOfFire59> what servers you guys on?
P6:49:52 <Eagle> Like he hooked the server up to his lifeforce
P6:49:59 <Eagle> And when one dies the other does too
P6:50:08 <ZomBuster> Notch should change the character preview to a static one
P6:50:20 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I think having it animated is best.
P6:50:25 <ZomBuster> impossible to make a picture with all the arms flailing about

P6:50:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, just have a "Animation" check-box would prolly be best.

10P6:50:54 * Sal_sleep is now known as Saladan0

P6:50:58 <Eagle> Morning you.
P6:51:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I thought you were asleep, Notch.
P6:51:32 <ZomBuster> he isnt allowed to
P6:51:35 <ZomBuster> he must code more
P6:51:40 <Lukeybatman> Notch, I can't buy minecraft :'(
P6:51:41 <Eagle> We're paying him.
P6:51:56 <Eagle> He can't stop when we're /paying him/
P6:51:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Isn't it like almost 8am there?

P6:53:48 <Lukeybatman> Notch, paypal won't let me buy. Say's its a bad credit card
P6:54:15 <Lukeybatman> Irsad
P6:54:42 <Notch> bad how? evil? =D
P6:55:06 <Eagle> Nefarious villian?
P6:55:40 <Lukeybatman> Haha, thanks for cheering me up. It's bad as in, I can't use it. But, I shall continue trying to get minecraft!
P6:55:48 <Lukeybatman> Because it's just that freakin awesome
P6:56:06 <ZomBuster> mhh maybe notch should add some more payment methods
P6:56:37 <Lukeybatman> I agree.
P6:57:14 <ZomBuster> you could add that TrialPay thing
P6:57:22 <Notch> what's that?
P6:57:28 <tesvann> purchases when up alot today
P6:57:45 <ZomBuster> customer buys something from their site, get game for free , they pay you the money
P6:57:46 <Notch> skins gave it a big boost
P6:59:11 <PrinceOfFire59> skins make servers laggier :(
P6:59:38 <Notch> the servers aren't affected at all
P6:59:43 <Notch> it's all client side
P6:59:55 <Notch> when the client sees someone log in, it checks minecraft.net for their skin
P6:59:59 <PrinceOfFire59> I went on a server and someone said the lag increased since then
P7:00:01 <tesvann> (ur computer sux)
P7:00:22 <PrinceOfFire59> Oh and yeh my computah sux
P7:00:29 <Notch> well, it downloads skins in a separate thread, so there's a very slight extra cpu usage during that time
P7:00:39 <Notch> but that's like 1-2 seconds max after a player joins
P7:01:02 <PrinceOfFire59> ah.
P7:01:06 <Notch> 40 skins uploaded
P7:01:19 <Notch> i might've changed some other things, perhaps..
P7:01:43 <Notch> ah, wait, it DOES change texture between each model render now, so if you've got a VERY bad card, that could affect it
P7:02:30 <Drakkar> time to make a skin that is nothing but the grass texture
P7:02:37 <Lukeybatman> I think I'ma cry.
P7:02:53 <Drakkar> or the sky's blue
10P7:03:15 * User38692 (MrBennie@cable-180-217.zeelandnet.nl) has joined #minecraft
P7:03:37 <Eagle> How do the skins work currently? Do we edit them on the spot or can we upload skins using that old template from a while back?
P7:06:07 <Sonict> So, Notch. I dunno if you saw my idea earlier today, but it was about adding an @ to an admin's name when you use the "TAB" key and when they talk as well as a message saying something like "(Admin) Sonict has joined the game" if they join. Does that sound like a good idea?
P7:06:16 <Notch> you upload an image, Eagle
P7:06:23 <Saladan0> Man
P7:06:34 <Saladan0> the giant pyramid server got raped during last night
P7:06:35 <Notch> yes, that does sound like a good idea
P7:06:36 <Eagle> Couldn't you upload transparency as your skin?
P7:06:46 <Notch> i tested and disabled that, Eagle. =)
P7:06:52 <Eagle> XD
P7:06:57 <Notch> good thinking
P7:07:03 <Arf> hey guise

P7:07:28 <C418> oh yes
P7:07:32 <C418> and it's png as well
P7:07:33 <ZomBuster> whut
P7:07:34 <C418> so that would work

P7:07:40 <ZomBuster> my eyes
P7:07:47 <Arf> http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9783/technohill.jpg
P7:07:47 <C418> but it can get abused if someone goes completely transparent
P7:07:49 <Arf> And this too
P7:08:00 <ZomBuster> is that that guy from braid
P7:08:05 <Eagle> Tom

P7:08:30 <Drakkar> DAMN
P7:08:32 <Notch> C418: I disabled alpha testing and blending on player models. =)
P7:08:33 <Drakkar> that would be great
P7:08:34 <Drakkar> :(
P7:08:45 <Notch> if people really want it, I could turn it on
P7:08:55 <Notch> but I think it'd end up with a lot of fully transparent people
P7:09:00 <Eagle> I would make only the head transparent. ;D
P7:09:02 <ZomBuster> yeh
P7:09:08 <Arf> this is my latest!
P7:09:09 <Arf> http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/918/shadingandcoloringtobed.png
P7:09:11 <C418> headless people. oh god
P7:09:16 <Drakkar> you should probably cap it at a certain percentage of transparency
P7:09:19 <ZomBuster> maybe more models later on?
P7:09:19 <Drakkar> maybe make it an option
P7:09:21 <Eagle> Or hack a limb off and make a zombie mob.

P9:01:45 <Lukeybatman> Joat, cookies work, but you must not be on the page when you delte the cookies
P9:01:59 <Zuriki> Anyone want a custom skin?
P9:02:02 <Zuriki> I'm making them

P9:02:52 <Zuriki> In human shape?
P9:02:56 <Zuriki> Uhh
P9:02:59 <ShadowAddict> it oculd just have a walrus head

P9:04:05 <Joat> I mean, it makes sense.
P9:04:06 <Zuriki> Lol moleman
P9:04:15 <Zuriki> I'll see about that too
P9:04:22 <Zuriki> I have to do Moleman and Maulrus
P9:04:23 <Joat> Think about it. A lot of Minecraft is digging and tunneling and like.

P9:06:18 <Zuriki> Firefox
P9:06:24 <Arf> It has to be relative to the customization of the game
P9:06:25 <Joat> I'm using IE.
P9:06:31 <Arf> and has to factor in the amount of people
P9:06:44 <Lukeybatman> Joat, progress report?
P9:06:55 <Joat> I mean, I actually use Firefox for day-to-day browsing. And Minecraft is crash-prone, so I use IE, a throw-away browser.
P9:07:04 <Joat> I'll have to use another browser to log off.
P9:07:11 <Zuriki> That wouldn't work
P9:07:13 <Joat> Or rather, I shouldn't be logged on there.
P9:07:22 <Zuriki> It's stored in the BROWSER session

P9:07:25 <Zuriki> IE?
P9:07:28 <Zuriki> I mean come on
P9:07:56 <Zuriki> Surely there is alternate to IE>Firefox in the throw away department
P9:08:21 <Joat> What, IE isn't good enough to be a throwaway?
P9:09:16 <Zuriki> It's too trashy to be a throw away

P9:15:04 <Joat> You're right. You don't even do metrics.
P9:15:04 <Drakkar> XD
P9:15:10 <Joat> Oh wait, wrong kind of ruler...
P9:15:21 <Drakkar> my dwarves are all ecstatic
P9:15:31 <Drakkar> I only had one dwarf tantrum
P9:15:38 <Drakkar> and they were summarily beaten and killed
P9:15:47 <Drakkar> in fairness though they were right to tantrum
P9:15:56 <Drakkar> an arch collapsed upon their wif
P9:15:56 <Drakkar> e
P9:16:34 <ShadowAddict> >_>
P9:16:53 <Drakkar> incidentally it wasn't constructing the arch that caused the collapse
P9:16:56 <ShadowAddict> I like how dwarves don't care if their wife is eaten by elephants as long as they slept in a REALLY good bed yesterday
P9:16:58 <Drakkar> it was deconstructing it
P9:16:58 <Drakkar> >_>
P9:17:01 <Drakkar> xD
P9:17:08 <ShadowAddict> anyway
P9:17:22 <ShadowAddict> i was getting a new tantrum every minute or two
P9:17:28 <Drakkar> niice
P9:17:29 <ShadowAddict> It's really my fault
P9:17:39 <ShadowAddict> The original cause of the tantrums is gone
P9:18:02 <ShadowAddict> the only reason they're happening is because the currently tantrumming dwarves would either beat up dwarves or destroy their stuff
P9:18:04 <ShadowAddict> then stop
P9:18:11 <ShadowAddict> resulting in a wtfpwned chain
P9:18:12 <Drakkar> xD
P9:18:26 <ShadowAddict> this game was going really well, too :c
P9:18:29 <ShadowAddict> oh well
P9:18:31 <ShadowAddict> losing is fun
P9:18:35 <Drakkar> I've got an extremely nice fortress going
P9:18:40 <ShadowAddict> i'll put this save aside for a bit
P9:18:41 <Drakkar> I can't wait to attract a megabeast
P9:18:48 <Drakkar> or unlock the adamantine I have in the area
P9:18:56 <ShadowAddict> I have a magma pipe nearby, so maybe I'll pull a boatmurdered and flood the whole place with magma
P9:19:08 <Drakkar> I have one of those somewhere underground
P9:19:17 <Drakkar> so i'm totally going to accidentally find it
P9:19:21 <Drakkar> and do something hilarious
P9:19:21 <ShadowAddict> I had JUST found it before the tantrumming started
P9:19:34 <ShadowAddict> so I didn't get a chance to build my forges before my metalsmith killed himself
P9:19:35 <ShadowAddict> >_>
P9:19:44 <ShadowAddict> fucking dwarves
P9:19:47 <Drakkar> XD
P9:19:52 <Drakkar> GOTTA LOVE EM MAN
P9:20:19 <ShadowAddict> my fucking mayor was complaining
P9:20:31 <ShadowAddict> even though I gave him way better rooms then he wanted
P9:20:53 <ShadowAddict> next game i'm gonna bring a metalsmith
P9:21:01 <ShadowAddict> I waited too long this time
P9:21:11 <Drakkar> I hope the combat update adds a menu to check the health of dwarves
P9:21:18 <Drakkar> I've got a dwarf vomiting and I don't know who it is
P9:21:33 <Drakkar> with 86 dwarves its hard to check everyone

P10:10:48 <Syniphas> The guys who paid already get custom skins?
P10:10:53 <ShadowAddict> well I suck at 7zip
P10:10:54 <ShadowAddict> so there
P10:11:04 <ShadowAddict> oh my god legends mode is so awesome
P10:11:25 <ShadowAddict> "In 1, The Rim of Portents of The Persuasive Sabre founded Crewletters."

P10:11:54 <ShadowAddict> "In 1, The demon Ronux Firedoomed the Devil of Heat became the leader of The Sinful Dread."
P10:12:34 <Evil-Ville> Yeah Syniphas
P10:12:38 <Syniphas> cool..
P10:13:09 <Evil-Ville> Also it seems people seem to whine about paying because it's a "java game"
P10:13:22 <Evil-Ville> I believe most of these people think java script and java are the same thing
P10:13:25 <ShadowAddict> that always cracks me up
P10:13:27 <ShadowAddict> oh
P10:13:57 <Syniphas> No, java games themselves are pretty flimsy
P10:14:07 <Syniphas> And you can't make games in javascript.
P10:14:10 <Syniphas> They have a point.
P10:14:13 <Zuriki> It's 4am

P10:14:30 <Syniphas> I wish I could buy Minecraft
P10:14:36 <Evil-Ville> You can make games in java script
P10:14:39 <Syniphas> Or have a point in doing that
P10:14:40 <ShadowAddict> I meant that I find it funny when people discriminate it purely for the sake of it being a browswer game
P10:14:47 <ShadowAddict> not funny
P10:14:52 <Syniphas> Evil-Ville, I've never seen a pratical example
P10:14:53 <Zuriki> I could buy it, but I wont. Because I don't have PayPal
P10:14:58 <Syniphas> Care to show me one?
P10:15:05 <ShadowAddict> I plan to buy it soon
P10:15:48 <Zuriki> There should be a reward for the first person to pay full price
P10:15:49 <Evil-Ville> Well most of them are terrible and don't work

P10:17:48 <ShadowAddict> wow legends mode is detailed
P10:18:29 <ShadowAddict> In the year 2, an idiot elf tried to take on a brass colossus as it killed his home
P10:18:34 <ShadowAddict> he dies painfully
P10:18:44 <Arf> Oh god
P10:18:51 <Arf> have you played Peasant's quest

P10:18:57 <ShadowAddict> no?

P10:19:04 <Arf> You have to slain the monstruous trogdor in an epic battle
P10:19:16 <ShadowAddict> >_>
P10:19:26 <Arf> It's a pretty cool game
P10:19:28 <Arf> the ending is epic
P10:19:36 <ShadowAddict> maybe some other time
P10:19:42 <Arf> It's in the style of old adventure games

P10:20:35 <ShadowAddict> there's like three elves named Nemo that thought it'd be a good idea to take on megabeasts
P10:21:09 <ShadowAddict> there was a city called Styleraptor that got killed in the Eviscerated War
P10:21:13 <ShadowAddict> awwwwwwwwwesome
P10:21:49 <ShadowAddict> after it was destroyed, a bunch of elves fled into the Helpful Jungles
P10:21:50 <ShadowAddict> how apt
P10:22:24 <ShadowAddict> Wow
P10:22:53 <ShadowAddict> The Eviscerated War was started because the demon Snodub Swelteredthieves the Dead Urn didn't like that The Ultimate Roses worshipped rives
P10:23:15 <ShadowAddict> It lasted 21 years, during which time The Seduction of Alchemies raped The Ultimate Roses
P10:23:35 <ShadowAddict> I could read this stuff for hours

P11:25:02 <Syniphas> Yes, it does
P11:25:17 <Syniphas> The bad thing is that I have to wait more
P11:25:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, we have to wait for everything, I guess...
P11:25:37 <Syniphas> Probably a lot since sales are looking good, and will probably increase when the game is released
P11:25:45 <Syniphas> Give or take a few years
P11:25:52 <Syniphas> 3 maybe
P11:26:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, that depends on waht Notch's perception of "die" (in regards to sales) is.
P11:26:41 <vdgmprgrmr> He might just mean "when the initial boom starts to quit.
P11:26:43 <Syniphas> I just don't wanna pay R$30 (R$60 after release) for (right now) the single ability of skinning.
P11:27:06 <vdgmprgrmr> What is Poland's currency?

P11:27:16 <Syniphas> I dunno
P11:27:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Aren't you in Poland?
P11:27:28 <Syniphas> ...no.
P11:27:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I figured you were since your website thingy had a Polish extension.
P11:27:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Where are you?
P11:28:05 <vdgmprgrmr> (And what is that currency you're using?)
P11:28:09 <Syniphas> Brazil.
P11:28:12 <Syniphas> Reais (R$)
P11:28:21 <Syniphas> The polish server is my friend's.
P11:28:41 <Syniphas> He gave me some space in it as a subdomain.
P11:29:20 <ShadowAddict> well it's not exactly fair to say you're paying R$30 for the single ability of skinning when that'll also buy you updates for the rest of the game's life
P11:29:39 <ShadowAddict> survival mode and zombie siege seem pretty worth it
P11:30:31 <Syniphas> Yes, but
P11:30:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Espeicially the zombie siege part.
P11:31:48 <vdgmprgrmr> It'll probably be just R$30 for quite a while, and it'll probably be easier to convince parental figures when it gets that far.

P11:39:57 <Syniphas> R$30 is just too much for something like that
P11:40:07 <Syniphas> I really wish I could buy it
P11:41:34 <ShadowAddict> yeah I missed that
P11:41:38 <ShadowAddict> sorry
P11:46:13 <prakCurie> You aren't paying for the ability to get a custom skin or anything else stupid like that at this point.  Or at least you shouldn't be.  You are paying encourage faster development of the real game.
P11:46:28 <prakCurie> Which you will then get totally for free.
P11:49:33 <Syniphas> Uh, no. It doesn't work like that.
P11:49:38 <Syniphas> That would be donations.
P11:50:53 <prakCurie> It is how you should be thinking about it.
P11:51:57 <Syniphas> It's not how I will think about it, until the game is actually free.
P11:52:00 <Syniphas> Which is not.

P11:53:18 <Parthon> but minecraft is too fun .. I don't want to pay for it
P11:53:25 <ShadowAddict> that's not really a good way to think about it considering it won't be free until far in the future, and it becoming free will only be a consequence of a lack of payment
P11:53:29 <Syniphas> Hah, I'm not obsessed with shit.
P11:53:41 <Syniphas> I'm just saying,
P11:53:45 <ShadowAddict> so he can also think about it that, if he doesn't pay, he'll get it faster

P11:54:18 <Syniphas> For an addition which, FOR NOW features only skinning (emphasis on "for now", if you didn't notice), R$30 is too expensive.
P11:54:29 <prakCurie> He will get a less finished game faster.  Which means you have to wait even longer for someone new to come along and work on it totally for free to get something playable.
P11:54:34 <paul|notsleep> except it's only 15 USD
10P11:54:41 * paul|notsleep is now known as paul|not
P11:54:48 <Testvan> what is R$30?
P11:54:53 <ShadowAddict> Synaphis: you DO know that it includes all further updates, right?
P11:54:54 <Syniphas> 30 reais.
P11:55:00 <ShadowAddict> just making sure
P11:55:05 <Syniphas> ShadowAddict, Yes, I am entirely aware.
P11:55:13 <ShadowAddict> okay
P11:55:15 <prakCurie> And it will be free for him after he pays ten euros to speed up work.
P11:55:29 <Testvan> you either pay him or you dont, i dont see the issue
P11:55:33 <Syniphas> No, it's not like that
P11:55:47 <Syniphas> Testvan: if i don't, I don't get most of the fun
P11:55:55 <Syniphas> And am stuck with the shoddy demo.
P11:55:55 <Parthon> Testvan: me neither
P11:56:11 <ShadowAddict> oh, prakCurie: he won't get a less finished game faster. he'll get essentially the same game faster
P11:56:13 <Parthon> either: 1) you think it's worth it and you pay for it. or 2) you don't think it's worth it and you don't pay for it
P11:56:24 <ShadowAddict> or you think it's worth it but can't pay for it
P11:56:47 <Testvan> ya 
P11:56:48 <checkers> < Syniphas> And am stuck with the shoddy demo. <-- then don't pay til there are more features
P11:56:58 <checkers> if you don't understand economics, try high school rather than IRC
P11:57:03 <Testvan> if you cant pay for it you are either very young, or very poor
P11:57:05 <Syniphas> But then the price is the double
P11:57:17 <Syniphas> Testvan
P11:57:19 <checkers> yes, because there will be more content
P11:57:24 <Syniphas> Mind you that there are CURRENCY EXCHANGES
P11:57:27 <checkers> that's economics again
P11:57:29 <Testvan> so
P11:57:30 <prakCurie> Well, if we all don't pay him and he gives up in another month or so I'm assuming the free released version will suck as compared to if we keep him rolling in coke or something for the next six years.
P11:57:37 <Syniphas> and R$30 is a lot of money for something like minecraft
P11:57:39 <Testvan> currency exchanges dont change the price
P11:57:43 <Syniphas> it's not like US$30
P11:57:50 <ShadowAddict> but some money is worth less or more than others
P11:57:51 <Testvan> ya us 30 is way more
P11:58:23 <ShadowAddict> we pay 50 USD for a regular game in the US, while an Australian pays something like 80 ASD
P11:58:29 <Testvan> so
P11:58:35 <ShadowAddict> even though the currencies are similar
P11:58:37 <Testvan> its still the same value of money
P11:58:42 <ShadowAddict> so the Australian is paying more
P11:58:43 <Syniphas> ShadowAddict
P11:58:45 <ShadowAddict> dur
P11:58:47 <ShadowAddict> not ASD
P11:58:48 <ShadowAddict> AD
P11:58:49 <Syniphas> 50 for a regular game
P11:58:52 <ShadowAddict> or whatever
P11:58:57 <ShadowAddict> yes?
P11:58:57 <Testvan> its 10 euros everywhere, not more in diffent countries
P11:59:05 <Syniphas> How much is the full minecraft price in dollars
P11:59:10 <Testvan> $14
P11:59:13 <ShadowAddict> 13 dollars fro the discount
P11:59:16 <paul|not> 14.29

P11:59:22 <Syniphas> read it again
P11:59:23 <ShadowAddict> then 28
P11:59:23 <paul|not> as of yesterday when I bought it
P11:59:23 <Syniphas> See
P11:59:27 <ShadowAddict> oh sorry
P11:59:28 <paul|not> then
P11:59:29 <Syniphas> You don't even read it
