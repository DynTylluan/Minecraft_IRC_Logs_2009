A12:38:30 <mail2345|smacx> the fun thing in smacx is that the defenders weapon is not taken into account
A12:38:36 <mail2345|smacx> so you could have no weapon at all
A12:38:41 <mail2345|smacx> and still be useful as defense
A12:38:43 <AndrewPH> Are there any tower defense games with unlimited levels or at least a fucking huge amount of levels?

A11:19:39 <Marach> (which is epic btw)

A11:20:45 <bildramer> it's only testing, but yeah

A11:20:57 <bildramer> remember that anthole thingy full of glass?
A11:21:07 <bildramer> that, + lava survival + tons of lag = mine

A11:21:32 <bildramer> why not?
A11:21:46 <Quatroking> so is there any good private server up
A11:21:52 <Snowman> Zuriki's
A11:21:54 <Quatroking> zuriki's is down for some reason
13A11:21:58 * bildramer quickly makes it private
A11:21:59 <Snowman> Oh
A11:22:06 <Snowman> She needs the bandwidth to dl pr0n
A11:22:13 <Jat> lol she

A11:22:36 <08Notch> it'd be very easy to bind a key to emit a command
A11:22:42 <Ten_Tacles> NOTCH add underwater plants
A11:22:57 <Snowman> And add the santa hats to the default character already :P
A11:22:59 <Quatroking> Hmm
A11:23:04 <Lmaoboat> What about servers with custom comands, like /paint or / box?
A11:23:04 <bildramer> hmm?
A11:23:13 <C418> oh dear god
A11:23:22 <C418> you know when we germans get the fantastic mr fox?
A11:23:26 <C418> may
A11:23:28 <C418> next year
A11:23:29 <Snowman> Lol
A11:23:30 <08Notch> wow
A11:23:38 <08Notch> Lmaoboat: It'd support all commands

A11:25:15 <C418> usually names don't get translated
A11:25:25 <08Notch> really? haha
A11:25:26 <Lmaoboat> I didn't like the trailers for that movie, it felt like the were using voice actors that didn't really seem to fit the medium

A11:25:34 <JoeyJo0> Snow
A11:25:38 <JoeyJo0> I recorded my piece

13A11:25:50 * bildramer is the only one who has watched lava burn stuff
A11:25:54 <JoeyJo0> And I always really hate my own voice, even though most people like it >.<
A11:25:57 <Quatroking> Notch, how much cpu usage does the minecraft server require?
A11:25:58 <bildramer> IMC
A11:26:00 <08Notch> Lmaoboat: I didn't like Clooney in it, but the rest were good.
A11:26:09 <08Notch> Quatroking: 589.

A11:26:31 <08Notch> it depends on your cpu speed, ram speed, number of players, and everything else
A11:26:35 <Lmaoboat> It reminded me too much for that commercial where the cleaning products are talk jealously of that superior one as it's cleaning stuff
A11:26:46 <Quatroking> via C3 550mhz, 256mb ram
A11:26:46 <Jat> so if hes named mr fox what is the last name of all of the other foxes in the world?
A11:26:49 <bildramer> lol, it's pretty fast
A11:26:58 <C418> it's not meant to make sense
A11:27:05 <C418> don't think into the story that deep
10A11:27:15 * Snowman is now known as Snowmafk
A11:27:19 <Ten_Tacles> :(
A11:27:25 <Jat> is he the only fox?
A11:27:25 <Ten_Tacles> i dont want to get ignored
A11:27:28 <08Notch> it's a children's story by Roald Dahl
A11:27:29 <Jat> i mean in the movie
A11:27:35 <Adam01> Notch, is it my java, or does the client really hog the cpu when it disconects from a server?
A11:27:57 <08Notch> I thinnk there's a bug where it goes into a really tight loop
A11:28:06 <Adam01> ok
A11:28:10 <C418> films like where the wild things are and mr fox have kids logic but use it in a mature way
A11:28:13 <C418> if that makes sense
A11:28:21 <Ten_Tacles> :`(
A11:28:25 <bildramer> perhaps the wrong for int iteration direction one?
A11:28:27 <Jat> i was just wondering if there asre other foxes in the movie
A11:28:33 <storage> notch, would it be possible for the server to stream the level from disk or use some sort of sql type database?
A11:28:34 <laCour> Notch, does this shirt make me look fat?
A11:28:36 <bildramer> for (int i=0;i<5;i--) {}
A11:28:39 <08Notch> there are other foxes
A11:28:44 <Jat> oh ok
A11:28:52 <08Notch> no, storage, that'd be much slower
A11:29:00 <08Notch> since the entire map gets polled all the time
13A11:29:07 * bildramer waits for lava to flood pretty quickly
A11:29:09 <Ten_Tacles> notch make underwater plants
A11:29:10 <laCour> Notch, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie-pop?
A11:29:13 <08Notch> if the game was designed for huge worlds, sure, but that's not what I'm doing
A11:29:13 <storage> ah that's a shame
A11:29:22 <08Notch> laCour: 589
A11:29:23 <bildramer> not?
A11:29:24 <Quatroking> lacour I know the answer to that

P12:10:04 <Quatroking> wasn't it faggotry or something
P12:10:08 <akury0> because i said i didn't like java, and the way he does is wrong
P12:10:14 <bildramer> :/
P12:10:14 <akury0> without insulting or w/e
P12:10:17 <akury0> this was random.

P1:24:47 <Quatroking> when its not in the door people fuck up when trying to open the door
P1:24:56 <Quatroking> but when its on everything is alright
P1:24:59 <mloc> Lan servers
P1:25:04 <08Notch> yeah, lan play
P1:25:20 <08Notch> i should make it "LAN SERVER" like most games do
P1:25:27 <08Notch> then not let it accept people who aren't on the lan
P1:25:37 <Quatroking> sounds alright
P1:25:41 <mloc> I agree
P1:25:51 <Quatroking> that way namechanges get disabled too, right?
P1:26:04 <08Notch> name changes aren't possible in the official server..
P1:26:35 <Quatroking> yeah but apparently custom servers are able to do that or something
P1:26:39 <mloc> Unless you have verify names off
P1:26:44 <Quatroking> *custom clients
P1:26:45 <mloc> Custom title
P1:26:58 <08Notch> the client can't change the name ingame
P1:27:04 <mloc> Only with the verify-names off
P1:27:05 <08Notch> it only gets sent once, at login
P1:27:37 <Quatroking> if you'd block internet access andthen make it run on lan only, it'd prevent more hax too!
P1:27:39 <mloc> I think he means before logon
P1:27:40 <Quatroking> Hooray!

P1:28:27 <Quatroking> he's banned on mcchatter too

P1:28:43 <Drakkar> notch banned his ass PERMANENTLY
P1:28:44 <Quatroking> for that
P1:28:46 <mloc> Notchsong was removed ='(
P1:28:49 <Drakkar> notch doesn't permaban

P1:32:24 <PickYerPoison> Snowman: Alright, sure. Why not? :D
P1:32:30 <PickYerPoison> Unless it's via webcam.
P1:32:30 <08Notch> I don't want that, NeatNit

P1:32:41 <NeatNit> why not?
P1:32:47 <08Notch> i will probably make anything not on www.minecraft.net to redirect to minecraft.net
P1:32:51 <08Notch> because it makes no sense

P1:32:58 <08Notch> oh yeah
P1:32:59 <PickYerPoison> Aaaaaaaaaaaaah
P1:33:03 <clone1018> :D
P1:33:04 <PickYerPoison> I see now.
P1:33:04 <NeatNit> but you can have different mods
P1:33:05 <PickYerPoison> Thanks! :D
P1:33:06 <Snowman> Notch, I can have multiple mods with that
P1:33:18 <08Notch> yes, I know, i'm sorry.. I will break that. :-\
P1:33:21 <Snowman> Cause I have my snowmod on www.minecraft.net and normal on mincecraft.net
P1:33:24 <NeatNit> NNOOOO
P1:33:27 <NeatNit> I NEEEED IT
P1:33:28 <Snowman> Can you wait till after christmas?
P1:33:31 <08Notch> sure
P1:33:37 <Drakkar> hmm
P1:33:37 <Snowman> Cause I need it to film ;)
P1:33:40 <Drakkar> you know what
P1:33:47 <Drakkar> someone just needs to make a modloader for minecraft
P1:33:54 <Drakkar> like oblivion/morrowind's deal
P1:34:04 <clone1018> omg Donald Duck is a nazi!
P1:34:11 <08Notch> that would be better than to rely on broken web configuration =)
P1:34:15 <Drakkar> yeah
P1:34:16 <Drakkar> definitely
P1:34:19 <clone1018> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iumEGAUceDg skip to about 1:40
P1:34:30 <NeatNit> it wasn't broken it was GENIUS
P1:34:38 <Drakkar> it would also make mods more uh
P1:34:40 <Drakkar> whats the word
P1:34:43 <Drakkar> regulated I guess
P1:34:50 <Drakkar> because it'd need a single format

P1:40:15 <Quatroking> Depends on the engine

P1:44:57 <Quatroking> his blood is just liquid ham
P1:45:01 <Snowman> Yeah, mine sucked
P1:45:01 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I can't wait for new level format. Maps bigger than 1mb would rock.
P1:45:26 <Quatroking> also thats too chicken-ish
P1:45:28 <clone1018> Wouldn't that lag like ass?
P1:45:35 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Not really.
P1:45:41 <Snowman> It isn't easy to make 16px ham you know?
P1:45:44 <Snowman> 2d
P1:45:49 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I used to do maps 512x512x256 and no one complained of lag
P1:46:00 <Lmaoboat> I've already seen absurdly huge maps
P1:46:09 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> problem was, we ALWAYS hit the size limit in less than 12 hours
P1:46:21 <mloc> Water should work like this: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4331
P1:46:25 <mloc> 7 layers
P1:46:31 <mloc> 7 types of water
P1:46:45 <08Notch> i'm not sure I want to support maps that huge. They WILL cause the clients to run out of memory once they get complex
P1:46:46 <clone1018> dammit Drakkar you got me addicted
P1:46:47 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> 7 types of water?
P1:46:50 <mloc> Yes
P1:46:57 <mloc> Diff heights
P1:46:58 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I already have to worry about being flooded by one type.
P1:47:06 <mloc> For finite
P1:47:13 <08Notch> yeah, the DF way?
P1:47:16 <mloc> Yup

P1:47:39 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> 512x512x256 complex?
P1:47:42 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> that isnt bad
P1:48:00 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> the problem was we hit the limit of 1mb all the time
P1:48:18 <08Notch> each visible face takes up (3+2+3)*4*4 bytes of video ram
P1:48:19 <Drakkar> <clone1018> dammit Drakkar you got me addicted
P1:48:19 <Lmaoboat> Water should at least not explode outward
P1:48:20 <Drakkar> to what
P1:48:26 <Drakkar> oh magical trevor
P1:48:27 <Drakkar> np
P1:48:29 <clone1018> magical trevor
P1:48:34 <clone1018> lol
P1:48:35 <Drakkar> I do it all the time
P1:48:39 <mloc> Now I'm confused.
P1:48:39 <08Notch> (coords, uv, color)*four corners * four bytes per float
P1:48:40 <mloc> Will the new m3d thing change map tiles?
P1:48:40 <clone1018> 5 min into it
P1:48:41 <Drakkar> someone says trevor and Im gone
P1:48:42 <Quatroking> so...
P1:48:42 <Drakkar> I'm*
P1:48:47 <clone1018> I realise its repeating
P1:48:50 <Lmaoboat> Have you seen the magical breadfish?
P1:48:55 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> How about supporting LZMA compression then?
P1:49:00 <Quatroking> I have 1GB of VRAM
P1:49:01 <Lmaoboat> or marvalous
P1:49:04 <Quatroking> how many faces is that
P1:49:19 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Notch, I dont mean Dimensions
P1:49:31 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Once you hit 1mb compressed size, map is screwed.
P1:49:40 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> you can do that with almost any size
P1:49:49 <Lmaoboat> http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/breadfish/
13P1:49:59 * mloc gets back to diagnosing GFX problem
P1:50:12 <08Notch> yes, I know. I'm just saying the game isn't designed for maps that huge in the first place
P1:50:25 <clone1018> #2 isn't that good
P1:50:26 <08Notch> hitting 1mb with standard size maps is much harder
P1:50:37 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> but you have 512x512x64 support, we hit 1mb even on that size
P1:50:43 <mloc> Will the md3 renderer change anything?
P1:50:59 <bildramer> server back up :D
P1:51:07 <08Notch> yes, I will remove the 1mb limit.
P1:51:10 <bildramer> ^
P1:51:12 <bildramer> DOITNAOW
P1:51:16 <08Notch> but I might impose a max map size limit anyway
P1:51:17 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Thank you.
P1:51:21 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> TYhank you so much.
P1:51:22 <bildramer> why?
P1:51:27 <08Notch> not to be mean, but because I want the game to run on older hardware
P1:51:36 <clone1018> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4652 lol I love when people this stupid try and make a minecraft server
P1:51:40 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> What would the new limit be?
P1:51:52 <bildramer> !!lol my server!! +hardcorepcs +hax
P1:51:54 <08Notch> I don't know, I need to do the math. It's quite possible I might just add a warning to the user
P1:51:54 <bildramer> maybe
P1:51:56 <bildramer> ?
P1:52:08 <08Notch> "you don't have enough vram to play on this server! Play anyway? [lol | kthx]"
P1:52:17 <clone1018> lol
P1:52:19 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> That would be great
P1:52:32 <08Notch> but please remember that the game is NOT designed for maps that big. ;)
P1:52:40 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I've been playing with World machine and Omen
P1:52:50 <mloc> ^ fun
P1:52:51 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> and your game renders map really well.
P1:52:54 <08Notch> i will try to keep support for it, but it won't be the primary focus of my development
P1:53:03 <mloc> OMEN?
P1:53:15 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Yes Omen
P1:53:19 <mloc> Oh
P1:53:20 <mloc> K
P1:53:28 <bildramer> Notch, for how many seconds does the chat text stay on screen in Minecraft?
P1:53:29 <clone1018> "Where is the cow hidden right now"
P1:53:59 <Miclee> Notch, can you add a "No fog" option in the fog options?
P1:54:13 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> So as soon as fix gets implemented, I'll be using 512x512x256 maps again
P1:54:21 <Quatroking> Is it possible to have Minecraft look at the mapfile and show the dimensions to the user before joining?
P1:54:32 <Quatroking> Then again we'd need a server browser then
P1:54:53 <clone1018> I for one want to have more then 5 servers per IP :D
P1:54:57 <clone1018> 4*
P1:55:15 <Quatroking> oh no you le didn't
P1:55:17 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Why for the love of god would you need that many servers?
P1:55:23 <clone1018> :D
P1:55:48 <mloc> How long does it take for a block of lava to move, EXACTLY
P1:55:59 <mloc> I want to make a EXACT timer
P1:56:12 <clone1018> I host like 2 peoples servers
P1:56:13 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> that actually depends, that can be modified i believe
P1:56:33 <08Notch> bildramer: I don't remember. Seven?
P1:56:38 <clone1018> And I would like to run 3 of my own
P1:56:39 <bildramer> :/
P1:56:41 <bildramer> well, anyawys
P1:56:43 <bildramer> *ways
P1:56:52 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> hey bildramer, make it 3 seconds
P1:56:57 <mloc> For the vanilla?
P1:57:09 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> no, for his opencraft server
P1:57:13 <mloc> ..
P1:57:20 <mloc> I meant lava speeds
P1:57:25 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> so did i
P1:57:38 <Quatroking> suggestion for a new liquid: Diarrhea
P1:57:42 <clone1018> :|
P1:57:47 <clone1018> :( no
P1:57:51 <clone1018> That would be gross
P1:58:06 <gea1> that would be awesome
P1:58:13 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> just place a brown dirt block in water for floaters
P1:58:18 <Quatroking> Diarrhea volcanoes!!!

13P1:58:41 * bildramer tests fire
P1:58:43 <Quatroking> if only it was possible to change water and lava texture
P1:58:59 <Lmaoboat> Notch, I hope lots of the construction in Survival has a practical function. I remember how building the structures in infiniminer felt like I was making a remote outpost, and not a huge red cube because that base served a function
P1:59:04 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> IMHO I wish the tileset was controlled by the server
P1:59:09 <Quatroking> GODDAMNIT

P3:27:22 <ZomBuster> I think there is an error with certain map sizes or something

P3:27:46 <Marach> lol

P3:31:06 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I think the problem is people wants underground streams of ore, but they don't allocate enough caves to do it.
P3:31:10 <ZomBuster> all problems will be gone when there will be a new fancy map format
P3:31:32 <Marach> dreams.
P3:32:10 <Marach> i wonder if Notch will ever set the livestream again so he can show he is ACTUALLY working.
P3:32:23 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> XD
P3:32:30 <ZomBuster> but then people will steal the minecraft code :o
P3:32:39 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I'd love to see him code the new level format.

P3:34:27 <08Notch> OH MY GOD, that's a lot of dimensions!

P3:36:19 <JoeyJo0> ZomBuster
P3:36:21 <Marach> ?
P3:36:25 <bildramer> your game has great potential?
P3:36:32 <bildramer> we got bored?
P3:36:38 <JoeyJo0> when people talk about the fourth dimension, they mean the SPATIAL dimension.
P3:36:38 <08Notch> It does, yes. I want to be the one who realizes it
P3:36:42 <bildramer> people are impatient?
P3:36:52 <ZomBuster> why would time not be a spatial dimension
P3:36:55 <ZomBuster> ha
P3:36:56 <08Notch> it kinda sucks, cause this means I'm much less likely to make my next game have an open development period
P3:36:59 <Snowman> People are just impatient
P3:37:06 <JoeyJo0> Why would it?
P3:37:07 <08Notch> yeah, they are. And I'm not going to try to stop it
P3:37:15 <08Notch> JoeyJo0: Because it's demoralizing
P3:37:20 <Marach> Notch: dont make me find anoter creative glitch :P

P3:39:24 <bildramer> :D D:
P3:39:32 <Snowman> FIGHT!
P3:39:36 <ZomBuster> angry = manly
P3:39:36 <08Notch> I love level editors and the visualization tools like the isometric stuff
13P3:39:49 * bildramer too
P3:39:54 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I figured as much, it's what I find the most useful.
P3:39:55 <Snowman> Yeah the extra tools like that are cool
P3:39:56 <bildramer> and you "dislike"?
P3:40:09 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> He hates other servers than his own.
P3:40:10 <Snowman> But the stuff that really is your task isn't
P3:40:15 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Which I understand.
P3:40:23 <JoeyJo0> What about bots?
P3:40:23 <08Notch> I'm less happy with stuff that alter how the game is played. I hate the stuff that has potential to give premium content to unpaid customers, as I'm trying to do this for a living
P3:40:24 <serp> Notch: you make valid points
P3:40:33 <bildramer> Actually, I have a pretty strong feeling of deja vu.
P3:40:34 <PuyoDead> And to make it worse, a hell of a lot of discussion in here is people trying to get help with the 3rd party server stuff.
P3:41:08 <bildramer> I won't do such stuff...
P3:41:10 <ZomBuster> bildramer whe have been over this before I'm sure
P3:41:12 <08Notch> I'm not going to try to stop custom servers. I strongly believe it's in their right to do that, as long as they're not "stealing" my code
P3:41:19 <08Notch> but that doesn't mean I LIKE it
P3:41:21 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> The only help I ever ask for is on the level editors.
P3:41:28 <08Notch> it's like free speech. You can call me a dick, but I won't like it.
P3:41:32 <Snowman> Put Angry faces all over their code
P3:41:33 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> or 3rd party utilities like World Machine
P3:41:33 <Snowman> :D
P3:41:37 <SMP> "potential to give premium content to unpaid customers," Like what? the only thing so far is skins...
P3:41:48 <Jat> in the future i think
P3:41:48 <08Notch> yes, but the game won't be free when it's done
P3:41:57 <bildramer> if anything I made enables premium features to non-premium people, I'll remove it instantly
P3:42:00 <bildramer> *make

13P3:42:22 * PuyoDead shoves a space in there
P3:42:23 <bildramer> what's World Machine?
P3:42:32 <Snowman> It's a heightmap generator or something

13P3:43:46 * bildramer wonders if running a VM multiple times will solve this
P3:43:57 <bildramer> Notch: bots?
P3:44:00 <08Notch> well, that depends what they're used for. If it isn't for griefing, i think it sounds awesome
P3:44:04 <bildramer> :D
P3:44:05 <JoeyJo0> ;D
P3:44:12 <Jat> i have seen griefing bots
13P3:44:18 * bildramer thinks how one could be implemented
P3:44:19 <08Notch> that's exactly how I feel about flying and noclip and so, btw
P3:44:19 <Jat> wiping out half the map systematically
P3:44:27 <vede> Notch, I think you should add some more commands to the server console.
P3:44:31 <08Notch> so I will make the client support those "hacks" instead of forcing people to use custom wrappers
P3:44:32 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I think you need a new tutorial ZomBuster, one written by me.
P3:44:57 <08Notch> vede: I know. I agree.
P3:45:00 <vede> In particular, I think you should implement a way to send a message to a single player only.
P3:45:01 <chariot> notch, private messaging for ops or from the console?
P3:45:08 <vede> Oh dang.
P3:45:10 <bildramer> ninja'd

P3:45:31 <clone1018> Notch you should add in tab complete
P3:45:31 <chariot> can non-op player commands show in the console?

P3:45:37 <bildramer> Notch, custom clients are boo boo? :|
P3:45:41 <08Notch> I wouldn't be totally against opensourcing the server if there was some way for me to ensure that I still get paid
P3:45:43 <bildramer> like bots
P3:45:47 <clone1018> That would be so helpful for banning members with 48sd8fsduy32 names

P3:45:59 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> close108
P3:45:59 <PuyoDead> (just tossing something different in there)
P3:46:01 <08Notch> yes, modified clients are totally a huge nono in every way
P3:46:04 <byte[]> i could need a helping hand
P3:46:05 <Jat> allow ops to include an optional kick message when they kick someone that shows up on the red screen instead of "you have been kicked"
P3:46:05 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> ttab complete is already in there
P3:46:06 <vede> I know that a console private-message function would be GREAT for things like join messages or custom commands that don't need to have their output all public and stuff.
P3:46:08 <08Notch> wrappers are borderline, but legal
P3:46:11 <clone1018> It is?
P3:46:14 <chariot> vede, yes
P3:46:14 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> yes
P3:46:16 <vede> Notch, modified textures?
P3:46:19 <clone1018> Since when??
P3:46:20 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> type in /kick and hold tab
P3:46:21 <Snowman> Also, show the Server name too when you press Tab.

13P3:46:53 * PuyoDead heads back to Photoshop
P3:46:55 <bildramer> no messages to the others
P3:47:00 <bildramer> hmm...
P3:47:03 <ZomBuster> uh that reminds me I made a caveman themed skin
13P3:47:05 * bildramer imagines hidden ops
P3:47:10 <serp> I think the timer reset
P3:47:11 <ZomBuster> replaced the gold with bone blocks :P
P3:47:18 <serp> eh... the counter I mean... for purchases
P3:47:19 <vede> So, if I made a program to automatically replace the graphics in the standard .jar files, and distributed that with a tex-mod, that'd be okay, right?
P3:47:20 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Beward the Thought Police.
P3:47:23 <Snowman> Notch, we should have a easier way to install them though
P3:47:25 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> *Beware
P3:47:36 <08Notch> yes, I could do that
P3:47:52 <08Notch> vede: If it didn't include the client in any way, yes
P3:47:56 <vede> Okay.
P3:47:57 <Jat> anyway yeah per-kick custom kick messages would be very helpful for telling someone why they were kicked
P3:48:00 <Snowman> Like add it to the preferences tab
P3:48:05 <vede> It would only include a bunch of images.
P3:48:08 <ZomBuster> talking about textures, is there anyway to replace the animated textures?
P3:48:10 <Snowman> You could put in textures you'd want to replace
P3:48:11 <08Notch> and if it downloads it, it really should be from the official minecraft.net server
P3:48:13 <ZomBuster> like lava
P3:48:18 <08Notch> not yet
P3:48:29 <08Notch> but I will make them manually animated instead of procedural
P3:48:34 <08Notch> and then you will be able to
P3:48:34 <ZomBuster> ah ok
P3:48:48 <Snowman> Good
P3:48:55 <Jat> oh the animated textures are procedural?
P3:49:00 <08Notch> yeah
P3:49:03 <Jat> cool
P3:49:04 <Snowman> Cause a lot of mods don't look that good with the default water :P
P3:49:17 <08Notch> yeah, I've noticed =)
P3:49:39 <bildramer> Notch: so totally custom clients are bad?
P3:49:46 <08Notch> I don't like them
P3:49:49 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I just can't wait for the size limit to be removed and/or increased
13P3:49:51 * bildramer has thought of building bots, but anyway
P3:49:56 <08Notch> but it's not illegal if it's made from scratch
P3:50:11 <08Notch> if you make a BOT from scratch, that's less evil

P3:51:49 <JoeyJo0> Notch: I made a bot from scratch, so that means I'm not evil!? :D
P3:51:50 <Drakkar> spleef is great
P3:51:52 <Super-Dot> Spleef is fun
P3:51:56 <Jat> its fun when its done right
P3:51:59 <Drakkar> you guys must suck at spleef
P3:52:02 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> wow, even Super-Dot spoke
P3:52:04 <vede> Spleef is meh.
P3:52:05 <Super-Dot> Rebuilding an arena is eh though
P3:52:11 <Drakkar> oh yeah
P3:52:14 <Drakkar> thats why there's a bot!
P3:52:14 <vede> I like the arena-rebuilding.
P3:52:20 <Super-Dot> That's astonishing
10P3:52:21 * Ticki is now known as Ticki_afk
P3:52:25 <Super-Dot> Super-Dot NEVER speaks
P3:52:26 <vede> I would prefer the manual way to a bot-assisted rebuild.
P3:52:37 <Jat> then well play spleef and you can rebuild
P3:52:37 <Drakkar> being able to declare that a spleef round is over by an op
P3:52:41 <Drakkar> then having the arena rebuild
P3:52:43 <Drakkar> would be lovely
P3:52:48 <08Notch> yeah, server scripting would be nice
P3:53:15 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I'd like everyone to be kicked the moment no admins are on, thatd be great
P3:53:26 <Jat> ...
P3:53:31 <vede> Or have the server go private if the last op leaves.
P3:53:36 <vede> Oh yeah!
P3:53:37 <JoeyJo0> So yeah
P3:53:38 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> that too vede
P3:53:40 <Super-Dot> Or go into read-only mode
P3:53:45 <JoeyJo0> I'm making an Open-Source map generator :D
P3:53:47 <Drakkar> or
P3:53:49 <Drakkar> save a backup
P3:53:52 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> even better Super-Dot
P3:53:59 <vede> Notch! We need to be able to change the motd or server name without resetting the server!
P3:54:04 <Drakkar> read only isn't that necessary
P3:54:09 <08Notch> yes!
P3:54:12 <Drakkar> autobackups are superior imo
P3:54:16 <vede> Go do that!
P3:54:19 <vede> Do it now!
P3:54:21 <Drakkar> also
P3:54:31 <Jat> custom kick messages :|
P3:54:34 <vede> ^^^
P3:54:35 <Super-Dot> autobackups are nice
P3:54:36 <Drakkar> to warn everyone: I'm actually not that big a fan of creative mode
P3:54:39 <Drakkar> so if you take offense
P3:54:40 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Actually vede, he might be coding right now for all we know.
P3:54:41 <vede> Kick and ban reasons.
P3:54:42 <Drakkar> don't worry about it
P3:54:48 <Jat> yeah ban reasons too
P3:55:02 <ZomBuster> autobackups are already done by other scripts/programs
P3:55:05 <08Notch> i'm considering writing a tool that converts the old models into md3 models
P3:55:06 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I know Drakkar, earlier you said you prefer survival
P3:55:09 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> i remember
P3:55:15 <ZomBuster> not really necessary to have it inside the server imo
P3:55:16 <Drakkar> yeah but I should explain why now
P3:55:16 <Drakkar> :P
P3:55:19 <Super-Dot> In addition to creative mode, Drakkar also hates Christmas and kittens
P3:55:22 <08Notch> lol
P3:55:34 <Drakkar> because TBH
P3:55:34 <JoeyJo0> ;3
P3:55:36 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I hate Christmas and kittens too though
P3:55:44 <Drakkar> well
P3:55:46 <JoeyJo0> Notch
P3:55:48 <fenixfurion> so, what about MP survival?
P3:55:51 <Drakkar> I see creative as really a cheaper version of legos
P3:55:52 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Kittens are just too darn kickable.
P3:55:52 <ZomBuster> yeh can we talk about survival now
P3:55:59 <vede> Legos are fun.
P3:56:02 <Drakkar> yeah but
P3:56:05 <JoeyJo0> Do you mind if a bot is made open-source?
P3:56:07 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> speaking of Survival
P3:56:07 <ZomBuster> this is a cool idea >> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4622
P3:56:11 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> SPAWN BLOCKS
P3:56:21 <Drakkar> I'm the kind of guy who likes to build huge
P3:56:22 <Super-Dot> I see creative as full-sized LEGO that you can jump on

P3:56:50 <Snowman> You can hardly be the worst
P3:56:51 <vede> Seriously.
P3:56:51 <JoeyJo0> No, no Auto-Tune
P3:56:53 <Drakkar> but autotune doesn't perform well enough
P3:56:55 <08Notch> lol
P3:56:56 <vede> All your fears will melt away.
P3:56:57 <JoeyJo0> Auto-Tune is for morons.

P3:57:19 <ZomBuster> you mean my entry :D?
P3:57:21 <C418> if autotune is for morons
P3:57:23 <vede> Blurk, I should really record myself doing that.
P3:57:24 <C418> what is melodyne?
P3:57:25 <Jocasta> I can only get it on WMA, is that ok?
P3:57:27 <Snowman> vede, madk is pretty good in comparision to other people :D
P3:57:28 <Drakkar> this is all because I'm actually working on my own lego game
P3:57:31 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> hey Jocasta
P3:57:31 <Drakkar> thats a proper lego game
P3:57:32 <Snowman> Good Jocasta
P3:57:37 <Drakkar> BUT ITS NOT GOING TO BE CALLED LEGO ANYTHING
P3:57:41 <Drakkar> BECAUSE THEY'D FUCK ME UP SO BAD
P3:57:44 <JoeyJo0> OGEL? :D
P3:57:49 <Snowman> Jocasta, I prefer if you don't do WMA
P3:57:52 <bildramer> Notch, get a vocoder :D
P3:57:52 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> oogling sounds good
P3:57:53 <Drakkar> but I mean tis just going to be pure legos
P3:57:53 <vede> But my parents would be a bit confused to hear my singing such a song in my room.
P3:57:56 <Drakkar> period
P3:58:06 <Drakkar> if it is a lego part
P3:58:10 <Snowman> Either WAV or Mp3, if you REALLY can't get it, you can do WMA

P3:58:59 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> wow, Usually I end up talking to myself in here, now everyone is talking.
P3:59:12 <Drakkar> let people request blocks

P3:59:34 <Jocasta> Yeah, I used windows sound recorder and Audacity, but still couldnt get the right format...
P3:59:38 <Super-Dot> So you're going to support all the cool connection types?
P3:59:42 <Drakkar> yess
P3:59:45 <Jocasta> I'm usually good with technology xD:L
P3:59:47 <Super-Dot> Neat
P3:59:50 <Drakkar> I want it to just be PLAYING WITH LEGOS
P3:59:53 <Snowman> Drakkar, old school lego is the best
P3:59:53 <vede> Also, Notch. You seem to be more supportive of texture mods nowadays.
P3:59:55 <NeatNit> yeS?
P3:59:58 <NeatNit> :P
P3:59:59 <vede> Could that mean...
P4:00:04 <vede> >.>
P4:00:05 <08Notch> For CLIENTS, yes
P4:00:06 <Snowman> Nowadays every set has like 5 unique new blocks
P4:00:08 <vede> You might think abou--
P4:00:10 <Super-Dot> Is it going to be first-person you-are-a-small-person, like Minecraft?
P4:00:10 <vede> DAMMIT
P4:00:12 <08Notch> I don't want to make the server autodistribute them
P4:00:12 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Will it be 3d so we can walk around and view our creations?
P4:00:14 <08Notch> sorry. ;)
P4:00:28 <ZomBuster> no Koitenshin it will be a text based game
P4:00:29 <Drakkar> it'll be 3d but there'll be no physical presence
P4:00:31 <vede> But whyyyyyyyy *sobsob*
P4:00:33 <Drakkar> it'll be noclipping with flying

P4:00:57 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> cool Drakkar
P4:01:04 <NeatNit> the server should still have a 'force default skins' option
P4:01:08 <C418> I wonder if the textures of minecraft change to winter for two days or so
P4:01:12 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> You gotta add the trains in then
P4:01:14 <C418> would be possible x)
P4:01:18 <Drakkar> that being said
P4:01:19 <NeatNit> so no one tries any invisible stuff :P
P4:01:19 <Snowman> He COULD use my ChristmasMod :D
P4:01:21 <Drakkar> vehicles and people and etc
P4:01:26 <C418> you and your mods
P4:01:30 <Drakkar> will be movable like an rts
P4:01:36 <Drakkar> (or just dragged)
P4:01:41 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> What about Lego technic, and Bionicle?
P4:01:41 <Snowman> But NeatNit, Notch has already confirmed my Santa hat will be on the default characters
P4:01:53 <08Notch> I said if I had time to add it, I would. ;)
P4:01:56 <Drakkar> bionicle would definitely be a no for uh
P4:02:02 <NeatNit> what does that have to do with me? :o
P4:02:02 <Drakkar> some obvious reasons
P4:02:06 <Snowman> It's just a simple file replacement!
P4:02:07 <Drakkar> (its too distinctive)
P4:02:09 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> how about technic?
P4:02:20 <ZomBuster> too complicated probably
P4:02:22 <Super-Dot> What about Galidor :P
P4:02:24 <Drakkar> but technic is really just gears and stuff like that isn't it?
P4:02:27 <Drakkar> so it'd be doable
P4:02:31 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> yes it is drakkar
P4:02:38 <Snowman> It needs physics though
P4:02:42 <Drakkar> I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I'D DO IT
P4:02:46 <Drakkar> but it'd be doable
P4:02:47 <ZomBuster> a lot of it is build to rotate around pivots etc
P4:02:52 <Snowman> Drakkar
P4:02:56 <Snowman> import lego_technic
P4:02:57 <Drakkar> I'm aware
P4:02:59 <Drakkar> lmao
P4:03:06 <clone1018> god dammit html
P4:03:11 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Notch....are you coding right now? Or watching youtube vids
P4:03:16 <clone1018> you and your white spaces
P4:03:28 <Drakkar> well there's -some- physics involved
P4:03:34 <Snowman> Jumping
P4:03:41 <Drakkar> the only thing that floats = the boards
P4:03:56 <vede> Notch, so regarding the texture mods, even if it's just clients, since you seem to be more okay with them, do you think you'll at least make the possibilities a bit more... robust? Like, make it so EVERY block has six different tiles (so we're not forced to sacrifice the few blocks with non-identical sides for new blocks like that), and we can make any block we like to have transparency?
P4:03:57 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> speaking of boards
P4:04:05 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> what about the plates for city set?
P4:04:13 <Drakkar> yeah the plates
P4:04:15 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> they had actual plates meant to look like streets
P4:04:15 <Drakkar> thats what I meant
P4:04:16 <Drakkar> xD
P4:04:18 <Drakkar> oh
P4:04:19 <Drakkar> yeah
P4:04:21 <Snowman> vede, every block can already have transparancy
P4:04:26 <08Notch> no, I don't intend to make it more flexible, at least not in the short term

P4:04:32 <vede> Snowman, but it's broken.
P4:04:36 <Snowman> How so?
P4:04:38 <Drakkar> I'm really slowly working on the game
P4:04:38 <ZomBuster> vede it would take 6 times the memory if you would do that
P4:04:45 <Drakkar> its not really a priority

P4:05:01 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> well my test worked

P4:05:03 <vede> Snowman, go do it.
P4:05:06 <08Notch> Best interface ever:
P4:05:07 <Toadbert> f yeah notch is here
P4:05:10 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> zombuster completed caves
P4:05:11 <Snowman> vede, cba :P
P4:05:14 <vede> You can use it to check out the whole level.

P4:05:17 <08Notch> public interface EntityRenderer { public void render(Entity e); }
P4:05:21 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> so now to test the level
P4:05:23 <Drakkar> rofl
P4:05:26 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> i might have found the problem
P4:05:45 <vede> Like, go underground, make a casing around you of full-transparent blocks, and you can see through the ground, to look for caves or lava.
P4:05:48 <Snowman> Can anyone translate that for me?
P4:05:49 <serp> Notch: I can report that the sound is likely messed up on my ubuntu linux system
P4:05:54 <NeatNit> I still don't understand why anything.minecraft.net doesn't work
P4:05:56 <Snowman> My java is a bit... dated...

P4:06:06 <JoeyJo0> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=50347
P4:06:18 <Super-Dot> Drakkar: Have you seen that unofficial LEGO game?
P4:06:23 <vede> And Zombuster, it wouldn't take more memory to do that. The terrain.png would have more stuff, but that's pretty much all.
P4:06:45 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> holy fuck, the level blew up.
P4:06:49 <bildramer> ?
P4:06:56 <Snowman> Made a level out of TNT?
P4:06:57 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> 783kb instead of the usual under 100kb
P4:07:02 <Snowman> Good idea, generate random level
P4:07:07 <Snowman> Replace all blocks with TNT
P4:07:09 <Drakkar> Super-Dot: which?
P4:07:17 <vede> I was asking if we could have every block so that they can be retextured with different images on each side, like the tree trunk or the gold blocks.
P4:07:36 <ZomBuster> of course when it is a complex level instead of just 0000(...)000 it compresses less effecient
P4:07:43 <Snowman> Vede, like TNT
P4:07:47 <vede> Yeah.

P4:08:24 <ZomBuster> wait let me check what things I use for that compared to the rest

P4:09:00 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> maybe he's coding.
P4:09:01 <Snowman> Oh and Notch, we need a big arrow pointing towards the iron block saying: THIS IS IRON NOT SILVER YOU DUMB***

P4:09:39 <Toadbert> iron is the black or brown stuff

P4:09:44 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Silver and Gold
P4:09:46 <vede> Pretty sure Notch even said it was silver.
P4:09:46 <Snowman> Black is coal
P4:09:52 <Snowman> Brown is iron
P4:09:56 <Snowman> Yellow is gold
P4:09:57 <08Notch> it's irooon!
P4:09:58 <vede> The iron ore blocks give you silver blocks.
P4:09:58 <NeatNit> IT'S SILVER
P4:10:04 <Snowman> Coal makes half blocks
P4:10:08 <vede> Is this not true, Notch?
P4:10:08 <Snowman> Iron makes iron blocks
P4:10:12 <NeatNit> you said yourself that it's silver
P4:10:12 <Super-Dot> Drakkar: I'm having trouble finding itall I remember is that it looked fairly Minecraft-like
P4:10:13 <ZomBuster> iron isnt that shiny tough :o it's more steel like
P4:10:14 <NeatNit> I know it!!
P4:10:16 <Snowman> Gold makes gold blocks
P4:10:20 <08Notch> no, iron
P4:10:21 <Drakkar> oh
P4:10:22 <Snowman> Notch has said so himself
P4:10:23 <Drakkar> blockland

P4:10:40 <Drakkar> sort of
P4:10:42 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> The looks like some Enchanted Iron then
P4:10:46 <Drakkar> they use the torque engine
P4:10:54 <Snowman> Notch is just bad at making metal
P4:10:54 <Drakkar> which means the performance is godawful
P4:10:55 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I shall call it silver in name of the magic it carries
P4:10:56 <Drakkar> and scales really bad
P4:10:58 <Snowman> :P
P4:11:08 <vede> I'll still call it silver.

P4:11:23 <Super-Dot> Yeah Blockland!
P4:11:26 <Super-Dot> Ew, I didn't realize that it cost $20
P4:11:30 <vede> It will be silver until the texture is change.
P4:11:37 <Drakkar> yeah
P4:11:42 <Drakkar> and he doesn't even update it regularly
P4:11:44 <08Notch> is steel!
P4:11:46 <Super-Dot> I thought it was open-source or something
P4:11:59 <vede> Since it looks most like silver (especially since it's a recolor of GOLD), and as yet, the ores just don't make sense at all.

P4:12:13 <Toadbert> neat
P4:12:27 <Toadbert> notch can you make more monsters soon
P4:12:30 <ZomBuster> gold golems extra tough
P4:12:33 <08Notch> "but why", people would go, "does the iron golem spit out silver blocks?"
P4:12:35 <vede> But Notch! You can't just GET steel like that.
P4:12:36 <Toadbert> the ones we have are getting old :(
P4:12:38 <Snowman> Notch shouldn't have made the metals until after crafting :p
P4:12:45 <08Notch> i meant iron, not steel. :D
P4:12:51 <Snowman> Vede, and you CAN get solid gold from just some gold ore?
P4:12:59 <08Notch> lol
P4:13:01 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Too late Notch, you called it Steel
P4:13:02 <vede> Snowman, hey, at least it's the same material.

P4:13:07 <08Notch> dangit!

P4:13:17 <08Notch> lol
P4:13:18 <NeatNit> just like you called it silver

P4:15:11 <bildramer> Hello, Mr. Silver!
P4:15:12 <08Notch> also if "glass" and "crap" are in the same sentence, I'll replace "crap" with "awesome"

P4:17:59 <Snowman> That's what she said.
P4:18:02 <Toadbert> yeah right
P4:18:02 <vede> I know, but it would just be so funneh.
P4:18:03 <bildramer> :P
P4:18:07 <Toadbert> trying to cover up now notch
P4:18:13 <byte[]> Notch: what about the idea where the client sends the side he clicked, still remember it? :D
P4:18:13 <Snowman> :D
P4:18:23 <NeatNit> <Notch>: she's completely penisfree
P4:18:24 <08Notch> yes, I'll add it when it's needed. :D
P4:18:29 <NeatNit> this should be in someone's sig
P4:18:35 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> too late Notch
P4:18:36 <byte[]> :DD
P4:18:41 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> I saved your quote for future quoting
P4:18:42 <bildramer> :D :D :D
P4:18:47 <ZomBuster> add to topic
P4:18:47 <Snowman> Notch doesn't like penises
P4:19:08 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Still makes a good quote Snowman ;)
P4:19:13 <Lmaoboat> Notch, do you think you could add an option for map generation that removes the skybox and makes the map a floating island? And would doing so make the map theoretically infinite?
P4:19:30 <vede> YES
P4:19:33 <Toadbert> :U
P4:19:34 <NeatNit> NO
P4:19:36 <NeatNit> MAYBE
P4:19:36 <08Notch> infinite maps would use up a lot of ram.
P4:19:39 <NeatNit> I DON'T KNOW
P4:19:39 <vede> I want the floating-island Minecraft back!
P4:19:43 <vede> :(
P4:19:43 <08Notch> several MEGS, probably
P4:19:45 <NeatNit> CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION?
P4:19:46 <Toadbert> minecraft uses up a lot of ram normally
P4:19:50 <Toadbert> my comp doesnt like it
P4:19:55 <08Notch> yeah, floating island will be a map template. =)
P4:19:56 <Toadbert> so it bitches and crashes minecraft
P4:19:57 <Toadbert> :(
P4:20:07 <Snowman> Yeah, Rain of mobs was awesome
P4:20:22 <Vis{SLEEP}> Holy shet
P4:20:23 <vede> Also Notch, you should make it so that the edges of the map aren't walls.
10P4:20:24 * Vis{SLEEP} is now known as Visiiri
P4:20:27 <NeatNit> Notch, I have a feeling your to-do list is getting too big for you to stay on IRX
P4:20:28 <Toadbert> we need random pigs and sheep to appear out of nowhere in freeform mode
P4:20:29 <NeatNit> IRC*
P4:20:33 <vede> Even in island-in-the-ocean Minecraft.
P4:20:38 <08Notch> i used to have it so you could walk out on a large grass field
P4:20:40 <Toadbert> thatd be so cool
P4:20:43 <08Notch> but that was kinda unplayable, hehe
P4:20:43 <Visiiri> Another student was arrested in Alex's school today
P4:20:45 <Toadbert> you jjust make a floating island
P4:20:51 <Toadbert> then all of a sudden pigs knock you off
10P4:20:53 * fenixfurion (fenixfurio@74-140-206-154.dhcp.insightbb.com) has joined #minecraft

P4:21:04 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> Those damn dirty pigs
P4:21:09 <08Notch> i meant it was BAD for gameplay
P4:21:12 <Snowman> Michael Jackson?
P4:21:14 <vede> Oh, why?
P4:21:21 <08Notch> either monsters follow you out there, or you'd run out there to avoid them
P4:21:21 <Snowman> What part? His nose?
P4:21:26 <08Notch> and if mobs run out there, well..
P4:21:30 <Super-Dot> NeatNit: But if he doesn't use IRC, he'll get depressed
P4:21:37 <Snowman> And go emo
P4:21:41 <vede> Oh.
P4:21:41 <08Notch> it's like there's a huge area of the map that you can't change, which goes against the basic game
P4:21:42 <clone1018> Because he needs us :D
P4:21:43 <Super-Dot> And then he'll just sit around in his underwear and play video games all day
P4:21:47 <clone1018> and our money
P4:21:49 <Toadbert> hahaha
P4:21:50 <vede> Well, you should at least make the infinite ocean swimmable.
P4:21:54 <Visiiri> >.< Notch is here, so I'll have to tell my stories later.
P4:21:55 <Toadbert> i think i had a dream like that once
P4:21:59 <Toadbert> i was in like survival mode
P4:22:01 <08Notch> Super-Dot: Oh, wow, you just described my entire night last night. :D
P4:22:02 <Snowman> Super-Dot coding in your underwear is one of the best things there is
P4:22:03 <vede> Since we can't edit water!
P4:22:07 <Toadbert> and i was on a cliff and pigs knocked me off
P4:22:13 <NeatNit> Notch, I still haven't received the $50,000,000
P4:22:15 <Visiiri> Notch plays GAMES?
P4:22:16 <NeatNit> are you sure you sent it?
P4:22:16 <Visiiri> WHOAH.
P4:22:23 <Snowman> NeatNit, it's Zimbabwean dollars
P4:22:30 <ZomBuster> make the map cointained in a giant petri dish
P4:22:40 <Visiiri> Notchzomg
P4:22:43 <NeatNit> whatever, I still didn't receive it
P4:22:43 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> thats pretty much what 64 depth is
P4:22:47 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> one big petri dish
P4:22:47 <Visiiri> you should play Combat Arms with me :>
P4:22:49 <Snowman> vede
P4:22:56 <Snowman> you can edit the ocean's texture
P4:23:04 <vede> Snowman, I meant blocks.
P4:23:07 <vede> srsly read
P4:23:09 <ZomBuster> and you can see a lab outside the dish
P4:23:23 <Visiiri> Well
P4:23:25 <Snowman> <vede> Well, you should at least make the infinite ocean swimmable.
P4:23:25 <Snowman> <vede> Since we can't edit water!
P4:23:26 <Visiiri> You can change fog and sky
P4:23:29 <clone1018> I for one
P4:23:29 <Visiiri> so you can change water
P4:23:30 <Visiiri> no?
P4:23:32 <clone1018> Want waterfalls
P4:23:32 <NeatNit> how come I've seen no mods with a different water texture? I mean water inside the map, not outside
P4:23:34 <Snowman> Pretty much points to the ocean
P4:23:35 <vede> That was not the whole conversation, Snowman.
P4:23:37 <NeatNit> it doesn't make sense
P4:23:44 <Snowman> NeatNit, you can't edit the texture
13P4:23:46 * Visiiri ftw.
13P4:23:49 * Visiiri is going to go now.
13P4:23:56 * Visiiri has a job to do.
P4:23:57 <Toadbert> lies
P4:24:02 <NeatNit> why? is it hidden or something?
13P4:24:04 * Visiiri IS doing a job.
P4:24:06 <NeatNit> THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
P4:24:08 <vede>  <vede> Well, you should at least make the infinite ocean swimmable.
P4:24:11 <bildramer> aaw
P4:24:14 <bildramer> back
P4:24:16 <Visiiri> Notch
P4:24:20 <Visiiri> err
P4:24:21 <Visiiri> hmm
P4:24:25 <vede> Wait.
P4:24:26 <Toadbert> yknow guys
P4:24:28 <Toadbert> if you use hacks
P4:24:29 <Visiiri> I didn't even mean to press tab.
P4:24:33 <Toadbert> and run way out into the ocean
P4:24:35 <vede>  <Notch> it's like there's a huge area of the map that you can't change, which goes against the basic game
P4:24:36 <Toadbert> you can reach the end of it
P4:24:40 <Toadbert> its just a white abyss
P4:24:43 <vede> That's what I was replying to.
P4:24:43 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> >_>
P4:24:50 <Koitenshin|ZOMG> brb, trying it now
P4:25:01 <NeatNit> I am sorry to inform you that after an attempt to go without IRC for 5 minutes, Notch could not take it anymore and suicided.
P4:25:03 <Toadbert> ok cool
P4:25:03 <Visiiri> The infintite ocean swimability would be a good idea
P4:25:07 <Visiiri> In theory
P4:25:08 <08Notch> yeah, an infinite swimmable ocean could work, perhaps combined with it pushing you back towards land
P4:25:08 <NeatNit> Will all the fans take it?
P4:25:15 <NeatNit> Will anyone continue work on Minecraft?
P4:25:15 <08Notch> the further out you go, the faster you get pushed back
P4:25:16 <Visiiri> you could have an invisible wall
P4:25:18 <ZomBuster> or a giant fish eating you
P4:25:23 <bildramer> :D
P4:25:26 <Toadbert> giant fish eating people ftw
P4:25:27 <NeatNit> Join us next week and find an answer to these questions and more!
P4:25:27 <Visiiri> after the island is out of view
P4:25:32 <Toadbert> we need fish in minecraft
P4:25:35 <bildramer> Jaws music pl0x
P4:25:39 <Drakkar> oh god
P4:25:40 <08Notch> pushing back is better than invisible wall
P4:25:41 <vede> Hah! I like the idea of a large sea monster out at sea.
P4:25:46 <Lmaoboat> A borderless map would  be cool for a space themed build
P4:25:50 <bildramer> hmm...
P4:25:52 <Drakkar> anyone play psychonauts?
P4:25:53 <NeatNit> agreed
P4:25:54 <bildramer> make it be loopins

P4:25:57 <08Notch> i used to, drakkar
P4:25:58 <Visiiri> I need you, here with me, don't take this, too far now.. you're eyes seem, so lonely, inside you, feel like you've lost your mind...
P4:25:58 <vede> So if you go too far out, you have to do combat with, say, a kraken or something.
P4:26:01 <ZomBuster> sure I did
P4:26:06 <clone1018> Well
P4:26:06 <Visiiri> Coulda been the champagne....

P4:26:47 <NeatNit> ?
P4:26:50 <NeatNit> fails*
P4:26:51 <Drakkar> Notch regardless of what you do it'd be nice if there was like a distance measurement of how fare you are from land
P4:26:51 <bildramer> 1
P4:26:51 <ZomBuster> 1 is too small
P4:26:52 <clone1018> Becausse
P4:26:53 <Visiiri> he could have the ocean end
P4:26:55 <Visiiri> in a waterfall
P4:26:57 <ZomBuster> cant go below 8
P4:26:57 <Super-Dot> Notch: I really like the idea of pushing-water
P4:27:00 <Visiiri> around the map >:D
13P4:27:01 * Snowman 's desk is full of cardboard boxes, bubblewrap, bills, papers and a ring binder
P4:27:02 <Toadbert> crap i forgot what i was saying
P4:27:02 <Visiiri> when you fall
P4:27:04 <clone1018> It has to be multipules of 16 right
P4:27:05 <Drakkar> that way we could make servers oriented around catapaulting
P4:27:05 <Drakkar> >:D
P4:27:06 <vede> NeatNit, the minimum is sixteen blocks in any direction.
P4:27:06 <Visiiri> you respawn
P4:27:08 <ZomBuster> or 16..
P4:27:14 <Visiiri> Clone, powers of 2
P4:27:17 <08Notch> brb, phone
P4:27:17 <clone1018> Oh
P4:27:18 <clone1018> Ya
P4:27:19 <clone1018> :D
P4:27:23 <NeatNit> not true, it wouldn't DISPLAY properly but it would still work
P4:27:28 <Snowman> A map has to be a minimum of 16
P4:27:34 <vede> Visiiri, not powers of two, necessarily.
P4:27:35 <Snowman> For it to be supported
P4:27:43 <Visiiri> I've seen smaller ones though..
P4:27:45 <Snowman> And a max of 2048
P4:27:48 <Visiiri> is that by client or server?
P4:27:52 <Visiiri> and I've also had bigger maps than that.
P4:27:52 <ZomBuster> nah max isnt 2048
P4:27:52 <vede> You only need powers of two if you wan't functional plants and grass.
P4:27:54 <Snowman> Both
P4:27:54 <Visiiri> ...
P4:28:02 <Snowman> And water and sand and gravel
P4:28:02 <ZomBuster> I made a 32x32x32768 map :3

P5:26:50 <Koitenshin> fine, neatnit i pick the left middile box
P5:26:51 <NeatNit> ok I'll go first

P5:27:55 <Koitenshin> nvm, i see how its a draw
P5:27:56 <bildramer> so...?
P5:28:02 <bildramer> :P
P5:28:04 <bildramer> well
P5:28:11 <NeatNit> THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
P5:28:11 <Koitenshin> we both know the strategy
P5:28:13 <bildramer> using the right strategy it's always a draw
P5:28:22 <NeatNit> you don't take into account that one might FUCK UP
P5:28:24 <Koitenshin> and how to counteract it
P5:28:25 <bildramer> also, there's no real "strategy"
P5:28:34 <Koitenshin> bildramer there is
P5:28:36 <bildramer> predicting 2 moves is enough
P5:28:41 <Koitenshin> it works mainly on idiots
P5:28:55 <bildramer> no need to memorize it, I can just do it real-time
P5:28:57 <NeatNit> ooh, you know
P5:28:58 <bildramer> :P
P5:29:13 <bildramer> I consider people who lose this game idiots.
P5:29:13 <NeatNit> there's a really good game that works with a group of people
P5:29:17 <NeatNit> in turns
P5:29:20 <Koitenshin> yes NeatNit, I was hoping you didnt know the strategy and the counteract as well
P5:29:24 <NeatNit> but it needs total concentration
P5:29:28 <bildramer> so...
P5:29:32 <ZomBuster> and that is?

P5:30:16 <NeatNit> there's a 3x3x3 box

P5:31:37 <Jat> wtf is the point of the game?
P5:31:40 <NeatNit> the goal is that someone else moves the fly out of the box because he got confused
P5:31:40 <ZomBuster> no wait I dont know
P5:31:48 <ZomBuster> it just.. stops at one point

P6:00:00 <Koitenshin> I understood it perfectly.

P6:03:12 <bildramer> and that's what Omen reads

P6:03:40 <bildramer> the same size?

P6:04:02 <bildramer> ask osici
P6:04:07 <Koitenshin> Like I said, an Omen problem.
P6:04:14 <bildramer> it's got nothing to do with heightmaps, yes

P6:04:33 <Koitenshin> They can.
P6:04:38 <bildramer> well, how?
P6:04:50 <Koitenshin> All a heightmap is is echolocation
P6:04:52 <AndrewPH> It magically knows? It is a mystery.
P6:05:05 <bildramer> a heightmap is a 2D image which defines at what height stuff are
P6:05:11 <bildramer> so, Omen reads it
P6:05:22 <bildramer> and the landscape is the "stuff"
P6:05:28 <Koitenshin> water is also stuff
P6:05:41 <bildramer> look under the water, there are lakes
P6:05:51 <bildramer> the water is added lastly
P6:06:06 <Koitenshin> nope
P6:06:14 <bildramer> if you floodfill it away, it's just the heightmap you got at the start
P6:06:14 <Koitenshin> water is EXACTLY where I put it
P6:06:24 <bildramer> wait, what do you mean?
P6:06:36 <AndrewPH> Koitenshin, did you put it on the map waterline?
P6:06:40 <bildramer> did you try changing the water level with World Machine and it worked?

P6:08:59 <Koitenshin> But I always liked my water at half height
P6:09:19 <Koitenshin> The maps I generate in World Machine are 1:1 copies
P6:10:07 <bildramer> try 2D floodfill, then 1 layer down (real direction, not Omen's), then 3D floodfill
P6:10:27 <Koitenshin> Here, I'll upload the same heightmap

P6:12:33 <Koitenshin> there, png and bmp of same file
P6:12:45 <Koitenshin> bmp displays correctly in Omen while the PNG does not.
P6:12:55 <Koitenshin> the ONLY difference being the bit depth
P6:13:03 <bildramer> and the format.
P6:13:05 <bildramer> duh.
P6:13:17 <Koitenshin> but other 24 bit depth pngs i come across work
P6:13:29 <Koitenshin> while the 32 bit ones do not
P6:13:32 <AndrewPH> Could anybody tell me why .bmp images load from the bottom up?
P6:13:38 <bildramer> try 32-bit BMP, 32-bit PNG, 24-bit BMP, 24-bit PNG

P6:14:04 <AndrewPH> If you load a bmp image, it loads from the bottom instead of the top.
P6:14:13 <bildramer> or the people who thought it up were drunk.
P6:15:10 <Koitenshin> these are the only formats I have access to

P7:29:08 <Visiiri> rev
P7:29:11 <Visiiri> before you go
P7:29:16 <revenant> I'm staying here
P7:29:21 <Koitenshin> ZomBuster is hiding on me.
P7:29:45 <Visiiri> How do I extract an .exe?
P7:29:56 <Visiiri> I would like to get the code from my autoclicker
P7:30:01 <revenant> um... > >
P7:30:07 <revenant> Exe's are compiled code dood.
P7:30:16 <Visiiri> There's no way to reverse that?
P7:30:27 <revenant> You could try to decompile, but it wil only be a rough approximation.
P7:30:43 <Visiiri> Eww
P7:30:47 <Visiiri> that means I have to work and make another one
P7:30:56 <Visiiri> Then I'm getting it to work with my menus
P7:31:03 <revenant> Make it in openGL > >
P7:31:07 <revenant> Its not hard.
P7:31:19 <revenant> Just switch into Orthographic and draw in 2D
P7:32:32 <Visiiri> Uhm
P7:32:33 <Visiiri> Sure
P7:32:43 <Koitenshin> A looping script is even easier.
P7:33:04 <Visiiri> Koitenshin, do you know what we're talking about?
P7:33:08 <Koitenshin> press this button to start, this one to stop
P7:33:22 <Koitenshin> you said an atuoclicker
P7:33:26 <Koitenshin> typo
P7:33:30 <Visiiri> Yes, and that is what I will be making.
P7:33:37 <Visiiri> But he was referring to my menu
P7:33:39 <revenant> It's just a while loop > >
P7:33:42 <Visiiri> I was going to do D3D
P7:33:44 <Koitenshin> yeah a simple auto looping script would do it nicely
P7:33:45 <revenant> Give it coordinates and let it fly.
P7:34:00 <Visiiri> Hmm
P7:34:01 <Visiiri> alrighty
P7:34:09 <Koitenshin> or you could just have it click the mouse button.
P7:34:36 <Koitenshin> sometimes being old is helpful
P7:34:46 <revenant> Hehe.
P7:34:50 <revenant> Thats old school koiten.
P7:34:52 <Visiiri> Well
P7:34:52 <rcfighter> For some reason, whenever I see the word revenant, my hands make the exact movements to make me backpedal and shoot in Doom 2
P7:34:57 <Visiiri> I'm trying to code one now
P7:34:58 <revenant> rofl.

P7:38:41 <Visiiri> you see, this doesn't help me.
P7:38:59 <Koitenshin> what language do you use?
P7:40:14 <Visiiri> Well, it would depend on the more easy stuff. I would like a fast and multi-OS autoclicker.
P7:40:24 <Visiiri> Except this will be toggled by a menu, hopefully in D3D
P7:40:25 <Koitenshin> Or you could just use this. http://www.shockingsoft.com/AutoClicker.html
P7:41:53 <Visiiri> I don't like you very much.
P7:41:54 <Koitenshin> I have once again stunned the world into silence with my audacity.
P7:42:04 <Koitenshin> Everyone says that.
P7:42:11 <Koitenshin> I don't know why.
P7:42:12 <Visiiri> Maybe you should try being less of a jackass?
P7:42:28 <Koitenshin> I tried helping, you didn't like my solution.
P7:42:35 <Koitenshin> Even if mine was the simplest.
P7:42:49 <Koitenshin> If you coded it in Java it would be multi platform.
P7:43:08 <clone1018> Billie Jean is not my lover
P7:43:18 <Koitenshin> It's a simple script, I don't see where your problem lies.
P7:43:52 <revenant> Um Visiiri.
P7:44:02 <revenant> You're trying to say "multiplatform" with D3D
P7:44:04 <revenant> are you kdiding me?
P7:44:15 <Koitenshin> Yeah I wanted to point that out but let it lie.
P7:44:22 <revenant> Also, mouse input is dependent on the windowing library.
P7:44:25 <Koitenshin> Hackintosh
P7:44:39 <revenant> Minecraft uses... swing I believe?
P7:44:46 <revenant> probably swing.
P7:44:55 <revenant> But yeah.
P7:44:58 <revenant> Realistically Vis
P7:45:00 <Koitenshin> well i'll let you know, gonna test the one i suggested
P7:45:04 <revenant> Vis.
P7:45:15 <revenant> Just make it move MC to a certain position on screen
P7:45:26 <revenant> and use relative SCREEN coords instead of window ones maybe.
P7:45:42 <revenant> You should be able to find CP libraries for that.
P7:47:16 <Koitenshin> One I suggested works perfectly in MC

P7:52:46 <AndrewPH> Mandriva is just oddly slow

P11:20:47 <vede> I was about to be like, I guess I'm just thinking about chocolate.

P11:21:11 <vede> But still.
P11:21:16 <Jat> im thinking of melted chocolate
P11:21:20 <vede> I think it's the shading that does it.
P11:21:32 <Shun_Koitenshin> no, because you can ignore that
P11:21:59 <vede> Well if I ignore the shading it doesn't look much like chocolate, I guess.
P11:22:21 <Shun_Koitenshin> it doesnt look like chocolate period
13P11:22:55 * Shun_Koitenshin calls the eye doctor for vede
P11:23:01 <Jat> i know
P11:23:03 <vede> srsly, the shading makes it looks like a damn chocolate bar.
P11:23:08 <Jat> i was thinking of a certain type of melted chocolate
