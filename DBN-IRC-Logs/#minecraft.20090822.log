A12:46:03 <Matt_> Hey, me and my friend have been exploring tunnels for hours. Plenty of water, but no lava. How do we get lava?
A12:47:18 <Xeros> I guess more exploring! I usually find it in tunnels.
A12:48:29 <Matt_> Xeros, could it have not been generated in the map? Perhaps it tends to be about 20 blocks deep or something?
A12:49:52 <Xeros> I'm not sure, I only just started playing today but I've found lava 3 times and both were in caves similar to how I find water in caves. It's not like a flat grassland map is it? Because I have only been on default randomly generated maps.
A12:49:59 <Xeros> 2 times*
A12:50:13 <Dudebro> There's usually no lava on flatgrass.
A12:50:18 <Matt_> Nah, it's default randomly generated.
A12:50:25 <FlyZ> Anyone know how to make a existing map larger
A12:50:32 <FlyZ> Currently my map is 256x256x256
A12:50:40 <FlyZ> I need to be 512x512x256

A1:04:36 <Bobo> guys
A1:04:38 <Bobo> i feeell shit
A1:04:46 <Bobo> what should i do
A1:04:55 <Bobo> need to do something to keep my mind occupied
A1:05:58 <Xeros> Minecraft! :D lol
A1:06:09 <Bobo> but it got boring ages ago
A1:06:10 <Bobo> lol
A1:06:14 <Bobo> need new features i'm afraid
A1:06:46 <Xeros> Make a movie with 3D Movie Maker... aka my favorite application ever(despite its graphics and oldness lol)
A1:06:52 <Bobo> lol
A1:06:56 <Bobo> i'm making an animation
A1:06:58 <Bobo> in flash
A1:07:37 <Xeros> or...watch movies... hey I have an idea. I'll find a youtube version of a 3DMM movie that you can watch, and then you'll see.
A1:08:21 <Xeros> omg flash is impossible for me haha.. maybe someday I'll get into it. that's why I love 3DMM cause it was originally made for 8+ ages, but in the hands of anyone else.. you can make anything ^.^
A1:08:31 <Bobo> lol
A1:08:42 <Bobo> well i've written up a story
A1:08:48 <Bobo> i'm just making an animatic
A1:09:55 <gordenfreechmen> theone
A1:09:58 <gordenfreechmen> oh nm he left
A1:11:05 <Xeros> I still demand that you check out what I find :P I guess mainly because the 3DMM community is dying, and it doesn't deserve it. I don't know why I'm so interested in keeping it alive, it's just that when you have a program that makes animating, adding music, sounds and etc without knowing so much knowledge, it lets people create amazing things..

A2:16:28 <LG_Legacy> Xeros
A2:16:31 <Xeros> Yees?
A2:16:44 <LG_Legacy> PRoblem = Firewall, or another program blocking connectivity to the website/host.
A2:17:01 <LG_Legacy> Or your java is just fucked beyond belief
A2:17:54 <Xeros> Well I finally found a firewall section in this silly Mac... but basically nothing is checked in the boxes for protection or however this works and it doesn't give me information whatsoever on the existence of a firewall in the first place.
A2:19:11 <LG_Legacy> Then try this: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=6b6d59a6df40bf4477590b4ded4053e7

A2:19:44 <LG_Legacy> Try logging in first
A2:19:50 <Xeros> I'm logged in lol
A2:19:54 <LG_Legacy> Wrong
A2:19:59 <LG_Legacy> Well
A2:20:00 <LG_Legacy> Someone is
A2:20:03 <LG_Legacy> Isn't
A2:20:10 <LG_Legacy> Make sure your logged in, refresh it.
A2:20:32 <LG_Legacy> Thats your ip
A2:20:35 <Xeros> I will, although I've refreshed many times on others with 2-10 second intervals hehe
A2:20:42 <LG_Legacy> It keeps saying you're not logged in
A2:20:51 <LG_Legacy> This aint a connection problem, it's a java/browser problem
A2:20:59 <LG_Legacy> Clear ALL cache/private data on your browser, and re-try.
A2:21:19 <Xeros> Ah that's a new one, I'll try that
A2:22:21 <LG_Legacy> Huh you know..
A2:22:25 <LG_Legacy> I just got a crazy idea
A2:22:40 <LG_Legacy> So crazy, it might actually work.
A2:23:13 <LG_Legacy> But let's try the private dala/clearing first
A2:24:24 <Xeros> I'm feeling good about this... I did that and now I don't get the red screen telling me it failed to connect.. but instead a pretty long error pop up message! It makes me feel better lol

A2:24:42 <Super-Dot> There we go
A2:24:55 <Super-Dot> It was spelled "registred" before
A2:25:07 <Xeros> lol
A2:25:42 <LG_Legacy> What does it say?
A2:26:18 <Xeros> I'll try to type out part of the error.... but I think it has something to do with it thinking there is another Minecraft being used? It showed this before when that happened. And it shows this error when I refresh it and.. I guess it loads so fast that..idk lol let me type it out a bit
A2:26:53 <Super-Dot> Oh, I think I know the error you're talking about
A2:27:00 <Super-Dot> Restarting the browser fixes it for me
A2:27:46 <Super-Dot> The "current context" one?
A2:27:49 <Xeros> java.lang.illegalStateException?
A2:28:15 <Super-Dot> I didn't memorize the exception name =/
A2:28:57 <LG_Legacy> Huh...

A2:29:21 <Super-Dot> Yeah, I think restarting the browser will fix that
A2:29:22 <LG_Legacy> Macs were always a pain
A2:29:22 <Xeros> It's hard to type out because I can't type anywhere with the error up of course
A2:29:38 <Super-Dot> Macs suck at Java
A2:29:47 <Super-Dot> They're otherwise quite nice
A2:29:48 <Xeros> Alright.. I'll try that definitely. I'm using a browser based IRC thing so I'll cya until then

A2:43:31 <LG_Legacy> Sure
A2:43:36 <LG_Legacy> Ey mate
A2:44:11 <k1rk-> How do I work out what port my pc is using for a minecraft server?
A2:45:17 <LG_Legacy> Uploading
A2:45:18 <Super-Dot> It says it somewhere in the server's text files
A2:45:20 <Gnarly> kk
A2:45:22 <LG_Legacy> Minecraft shows:
A2:45:24 <LG_Legacy> 25655
A2:46:53 <LG_Legacy> http://www.mediafire.com/?cmafginiymi
A2:46:59 <k1rk-> Hmm... I'm using the link it generates and it is saying the server is down. I try with using my ip and the port of 25655 in the readme for the server but then I get a single player game.
A2:47:06 <Gnarly> thanks
A2:47:17 <LG_Legacy> Firewall

A2:48:26 <k1rk-> Firewall is off. So it my be bad porting.
A2:49:46 <LG_Legacy> Let me ask
A2:49:51 <Xeros> I'd like to add that I once clicked a link to a multiplayer server that was really old, and I thought it was working (the url was the same in the address bar and everything) but it must have been single player, I couldn't even chat and it generated a map.
A2:49:56 <LG_Legacy> Do you know how to figure out your internal ip? Do you know what router you have?
A2:50:14 <LG_Legacy> And generate = SP
A2:50:51 <k1rk-> Yes. For router I have, I believe I know my internal ip - you mean Lan ip? 
A2:51:12 <k1rk-> Generate = SP, no idea.
A2:51:36 <LG_Legacy> Internal/lan
A2:51:39 <LG_Legacy> And what is your router?
A2:51:45 <k1rk-> Yea, I know that.
A2:52:03 <k1rk-> D-Link DSL G604t Gen 2.

A5:24:55 <Morgranth> as promised : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqrzTlYNF64
A5:25:08 <Morgranth> thats the finished version
A5:26:53 <Morgranth> and a question, where did u get the insperation to make a game like this, played a lot of lego as a kid?
A5:27:51 <08Notch> I did, yes. The game idea came when playing Infiniminer, though
A5:28:04 <LG_Legacy> Notch is on? Cool
A5:28:05 <08Notch> I kept coming up with ideas on how to make a cool game I'd love out of it
A5:28:19 <LG_Legacy> Oh
A5:28:20 <08Notch> so I decided to make my own game in the same style
A5:28:24 <LG_Legacy> Now i remember what questioned i was going to ask
A5:28:31 <LG_Legacy> Say Notch, are you going to invent a Combat System?
A5:28:36 <LG_Legacy> Melee?
A5:28:40 <08Notch> yes, I am. =)
A5:28:52 <Morgranth> u already had experience making games?
A5:28:54 <LG_Legacy> Care to spill a little details?
A5:29:00 <08Notch> Morgranth: Nice. It's the same vid as last time, isn't it? =D
A5:29:14 <08Notch> I mean with some effects
A5:29:17 <08Notch> no, wait, it's just similar. =D
A5:29:24 <Morgranth> nah, its diffrent, better quality and shows the whole inside aswell
A5:29:28 <Morgranth> nvm :P
A5:29:36 <08Notch> oh wow the bridge =D
A5:29:51 <Morgranth> gotta have a bridge in a starship!
A5:30:14 <Morgranth> had the sceen looking outward at first, but that looked silly when u were outside
A5:31:01 <Peerko> is the ship hand built or imported from a model?
A5:31:14 <LG_Legacy> Say Notch, you want to give us a little insight on how the Combat System? Or is it all hush hush?
A5:31:17 <Morgranth> hand build
A5:31:44 <08Notch> LG_Legacy: Not until it works ok
A5:31:50 <08Notch> right now you can't attack at all
A5:31:54 <08Notch> so I'd say it sucks. ;)
A5:31:58 <LG_Legacy> :P
A5:32:01 <LG_Legacy> I meant
A5:32:04 <LG_Legacy> Possible your future idea?
A5:32:39 <08Notch> Well, I was planning on just having a click be a swing, and have that attack anything in front of you

A5:33:30 <Morgranth> are creatures beeing selected liek blocks are now?
A5:33:34 <LG_Legacy> So will the enemies be having hitpoints as-well? And how will the damage work?
A5:33:38 <08Notch> no, Morgranth

A5:37:00 <LG_Legacy> I hope that armor will play a good role, and that items will be scattered in survival. How will items be gained in survival anyways?
A5:37:18 <flyboy> NOTCH!!!
A5:37:22 <flyboy> YAY!!!
A5:37:31 <flyboy> FINALLY!!!
A5:37:48 <08Notch> crafting, LG_Legacy
A5:38:11 <LG_Legacy> Oh so in survival we gotta build the guns/weapons/whatever ourself huh?
A5:38:15 <flyboy> It's hard to obsessively stalk someone when their timezone in 12 hours behind yours
A5:38:29 <08Notch> haha flyboy
A5:38:35 <Elwebbaro> Notch: I saw the pigs on the blog, are they already useful?
A5:38:38 <08Notch> yes, LG_Legacy.
A5:38:42 <08Notch> Elwebbaro: No, not yet
A5:38:47 <Elwebbaro> Okay
A5:38:48 <08Notch> once fighting is in, they'll drop food when killed
A5:39:30 <LG_Legacy> I gotta ask about the skin, why that as the default skin? Will you ever implant a feature for a few 'Pre-skins' which users can select even if they haven't paid?
A5:39:45 <Elwebbaro> Notch: Is the dropped food edible, or will we have to cook it on a fireplace?
A5:40:22 <Siiseli> Notch: what is the meaning of life
A5:40:28 <08Notch> it'll be edible
A5:40:34 <08Notch> cooked food might be better
A5:40:41 <Elwebbaro> Cooking would be awesome
A5:40:44 <08Notch> Siiseli: There is no meaning, just enjoy it. =)
A5:41:24 <LG_Legacy> And of the skins Notch? :D

A5:42:26 <Elwebbaro> True.
A5:42:29 <LG_Legacy> Perhaps one day you'll hold a event for people to submit skins. LEt's hope.
A5:43:00 <Elwebbaro> My lederhosen skin has to be default :p

I seen somewhere that you will implant a method to convert doom maps into Minecraft Levels. Will this really be possible in the very far future with some kind of custom texture implant and .wad to .dat conversion?
A5:44:57 <Siiseli> ... doom maps?
A5:45:10 <Siiseli> why would you.. oh well

A5:47:34 <08Notch> there's no textue importing, but the basic doom level converter is already done. =)
A5:47:55 <LG_Legacy> Oh that seems awesome, so it will be using Minecraft textures instead?

A6:40:42 <FlyZ> Notch, can't you verify with IPs?
A6:41:30 <citricsquid> IPs change...
A6:41:38 <FlyZ> umm?
A6:41:47 <FlyZ> You can't change your IP to someone elses.
A6:42:06 <citricsquid> Yes you can, it's entirely possible. Also they change, I have a new IP every few hours :)
A6:42:18 <FlyZ> I have a static IP.
A6:42:30 <citricsquid> Most people don't...
A6:42:34 <FlyZ> Youobviously have a dynamic IP, which is always in the same IP range.

A7:40:24 <citricsquid> minecraft works because of freedom, to stop griefers would require reducing the freedom we have.
A7:40:30 <Minotour> that's true
A7:40:36 <citricsquid> and that would suck :( Just play on well OPed servers :D
A7:40:40 <Minotour> anyways, survival mode will make minecraft more fun to me

A9:28:00 <Quatroking> hey citricsquid, isn't this something for you: http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/93ad/
A9:28:21 <citricsquid> haha
A9:28:27 <citricsquid> also PuyoDead!
A9:31:34 <PuyoDead> so, over 10 hours into this damn psp game, and I've only had it 2 days
A9:31:45 <Quatroking> pfft
A9:31:54 <Quatroking> when i got prototype I finished it the same day
A9:32:04 <C418> what psp game?
A9:32:10 <C418> hopefully not one of those boring dinosaur games
A9:32:24 <Quatroking> THE SIMS 3
A9:32:27 <Quatroking> FUCK YEAH
A9:32:28 <PuyoDead> dissidia final fantasy
A9:33:05 <C418> aah. isn't that the first psp games that installs stuff on the memory stick?
A9:33:14 <C418> how is it?
A9:33:28 <PuyoDead> hmm, y'know, it must be. I noticed that option, and I've never seen any other game do that
A9:33:46 <PuyoDead> it's surprisingly good. for a fighting game, it's detailed as hell
A9:34:14 <PuyoDead> so long as you know that final fantasy stories are dreck, you'll be ok
A9:34:27 <C418> next month is the release of gran turismo. I think that will make me turn on my psp again
A9:34:34 <C418> I have to check out dissidia too

A11:13:16 <Bobo> so does anyone know exactly how survival mode will work?
A11:13:18 <Bobo> like
A11:13:27 <Siretu> Survival mode isn't out yet, right?
A11:13:33 <Siretu> No modes are out?
A11:13:36 <citricsquid> Siretu: nope, singleplayer beta sept 1st!
A11:13:39 <Bobo> will it just be... people in one spot, zombies being generated from predefined spawn points
A11:13:42 <citricsquid> Siretu: Nope, not yet :)
A11:13:52 <Bobo> or... like, zombies pre-placed in the map
A11:13:58 <Bobo> and people trek through the level
A11:14:05 <Bobo> killing
A11:14:43 <PuyoDead> also, citric, that map looks awesome, I wants
A11:15:08 <citricsquid> http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?t=8909 I'm tempted to play it
A11:15:12 <citricsquid> I get bored easily though :|
A11:16:05 <Bobo> anyone got a link to the latest minecraft map generator/editor
A11:16:05 <Bobo> ?
A11:16:25 <citricsquid> Bobo: Omen is still the best; http://omened.tumblr.com/
A11:16:49 <Bobo> sweet thanks
A11:16:54 <Bobo> the one i had was minecrap
A11:16:55 <Bobo> lol
A11:18:29 <Bobo> any idea of the max map size?
A11:18:57 <PuyoDead> wow, minecrap is ancient
A11:19:05 <PuyoDead> and max size really depends on your ram
A11:19:25 <Not_Famous> PuyoDead: What do you mean?
A11:19:43 <citricsquid> Playing with last.fm API is fun :D
A11:19:51 <PuyoDead> if it's too large, your computer will simply fail to load it
A11:20:01 <PuyoDead> I kind of hate last.fm
A11:20:26 <Not_Famous> in the generator or in the server?
A11:20:33 <PuyoDead> both
A11:20:47 <PuyoDead> no scrobbling from ipod? = worthless service
A11:20:52 <Not_Famous> hah. Thanks.
A11:21:05 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: No idea why, but I'm making some mass compare thing, can enter any number of usernames and it compares them all at the same time. http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/8/23317203082-orig.jpg :D
A11:21:19 <PuyoDead> hmm, neat
A11:21:59 <citricsquid> Making it so people can register as a "group", so like we could have a minecraft group and they just input their username and instantly get compared to all members of the group. (I'd use last.fm groups, but most people don'y join them :|)
A11:22:42 <Siretu> How much does minecraft cost?
A11:22:52 <citricsquid> Siretu: 9.95 Euros, about $17
A11:23:05 <citricsquid> when it moves into beta it'll go up to 15 euros, then 20 at final release :)
A11:23:06 <Siretu> Can you pay with paypal?
A11:23:10 <citricsquid> yep!
A11:23:14 <citricsquid> currently the only supported method.
A11:23:18 <Siretu> Gdgd, I might be able to buy it
A11:23:42 <Siretu> Any special features for paid customers yet?
A11:23:47 <citricsquid> oh wow, ~1500 purchases, didn't realise there were that many.
A11:23:53 <Bobo> you can use custom skins
A11:23:54 <citricsquid> Siretu: You'll get to play survival on sept 1st.
A11:23:55 <Siretu> Except participating in the beta on the 1st sept
A11:23:58 <citricsquid> and custom skins :)
A11:24:00 <Siretu> Okay
A11:24:01 <citricsquid> Bobo: >:(
A11:24:16 <Bobo> citricsquid >>>>>>>>:D
A11:24:20 <citricsquid> Siretu: The final game will be, as far as I'm aware, paid only. So free players will only get sandbox mode :)
A11:24:30 <citricsquid> so survival will be for paid. I think.
A11:24:47 <Siretu> I gtg now

P3:50:19 <Daroh> maybe its java and not your browser?
P3:50:33 <Daroh> if its occuring in both browsers its probably the case
P3:50:48 <Xeros> But Java isn't the problem right now... it's just the little pop-up message that isn't letting me select "trust" or "don't trust"
P3:51:06 <Daroh> and isnt that popup message usually handled by java itself?
P3:51:08 <Xeros> it's just a blank pop-up... is there a way to get around the trust thing?
P3:51:42 <Daroh> you could try modifying javas config to allow all java applets, bit risky but still...

P5:58:35 <Snowman> Cant wait til Notch fixes it
P5:58:43 <mail2345> anyway, thank wom for mass hack distribution
P5:58:48 <mail2345> THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOM
P5:59:07 <Snowman> Everyone already had hacks even before WOM existed
P5:59:22 <mail2345> naw, they got worse after wom
P5:59:37 <Meizlizard> I have successfully gotten hacks running on a mac :)
P5:59:39 <Snowman> Yeah but like 75% already had them before WOm
P5:59:48 <mail2345> and those seemed to mostly be flying hacks
P5:59:54 <Snowman> The only good hack I have seen is the minimap one
P6:00:00 <Meizlizard> The minimap is incredibly useful for server administration..
P6:00:14 <Snowman> But if you have that, you also have all the other hacks
P6:00:16 <Snowman> which is a pain
P6:00:26 <Meizlizard> I try to avoid using them
P6:00:33 <Meizlizard> otherwise I'll get used to it
P6:00:33 <Snowman> same
P6:00:33 <mail2345> not full on noclip speed flying mega multi platform hacks
P6:00:58 <Snowman> If my Java was better, I would edit the script to remove the hacks but keep the minimap
P6:01:07 <Snowman> but when I tried compiling it had 93 errors >.>
P6:01:22 <Meizlizard> I find flying is good for following suspected griefers
P6:01:39 <Meizlizard> They tend not to look up
P6:01:42 <Snowman> Just ask suspected griefers what they are doing
P6:01:51 <Snowman> 9 out of 10 times theyll quit the server
P6:01:51 <Meizlizard> though if they have minimap it's pointless

P6:50:10 <Snowman> Yes
P6:50:16 <Snowman> Silly Americans
P6:50:22 <liq3> potato: gems would be cool. could have like magic, and you need a gem to make a staff. :D
P6:50:30 <potato> eh
P6:50:31 <Snowman> Though, I'm the only one from Antarctica
P6:50:37 <potato> i don't want magic
P6:50:45 <vede> liq3, have you heard my idea for a detailed magic implementation in Minecraft?
P6:50:53 <liq3> nope. link?
P6:51:03 <vede> You have to arrange blocks or objects in certain ways to cast spells.
P6:51:10 <vede> (no link, it was in the forums)
P6:51:23 <mail2345> that's possible
P6:51:33 <vede> Not only possible, but not even that hard to code.
P6:51:39 <vede> I believe.
P6:51:43 <mail2345> yep
P6:51:44 <liq3> mmmm
P6:51:45 <liq3> maybe.
P6:51:57 <liq3> what do you mean by "arrange"?
P6:52:08 <vede> Like, you have to make a circle of stone, or something.
P6:52:15 <mail2345> it has to be in an order
P6:52:16 <vede> Or make a pentagram with candles.
P6:52:19 <mail2345> to make it less laggy
P6:52:35 <vede> In order to actually cast spells.
P6:52:36 <mail2345> eg, check if the placed block is at a position from the last block
P6:52:43 <vede> Instead of the standard mana-pool system.
P6:53:09 <vede> mail: couldn't you just check the area around the character when they press a button or something?
P6:53:11 <liq3> mail2345: no, it's very easy to code. :p
P6:53:13 <Snowman> How about you have to collect magic stones and use those to cast magic
P6:53:23 <mail2345> ugh
P6:53:29 <mail2345> Lua is server side
P6:53:30 <liq3> Snowman: That's kinda like what I said.
P6:53:38 <vede> ...
P6:53:42 <mail2345> you can't check when a player pushes a button
P6:53:46 <Snowman> oh w/e
P6:53:50 <liq3> Like, you need gems to make staffs, and you need those to do magic.
P6:53:53 <vede> You should be able to do Client-side LUA as well.
P6:53:54 <liq3> Could combine it with vede's idea. :P
P6:53:58 <vede> So people can make SP mods too.
P6:54:01 <mail2345> It's Lua
P6:54:03 <mail2345> Lua
P6:54:04 <charrr> So, will signs be in MP with the survival beta test? 
P6:54:05 <mail2345> Lua
P6:54:08 <vede> WHATEVER
P6:54:36 <Snowman> I just LIKE to capitalize RANDOM words in SENTANCES like saying LUA in CAPS
P6:55:12 <Snowman> I know THAT it IS actually Lua but I sometimes SAY LUA because of THIS speach IMPEDIMENT
P6:55:45 <vede> Have you ever tried to read a full article or book where the author seems to italicise random words?
P6:55:58 <vede> I makes you feel like you're gonna throw up.
P6:56:08 <Snowman> Well, to be honest, no.
P6:56:10 <liq3> nope.
P6:56:34 <vede> I know that (at least) the early Hellblazer comics were written like that.

P7:03:18 <potato> i think i might make a tileset with more types of rock instead of the colours
P7:06:51 <Veronika> I wish there were more interesting tiles than just a bunch of colors.
P7:07:02 <potato> that is the point of my tileset
P7:07:03 <Veronika> Made a few, but Notch doesn't like outside contributions.
P7:07:17 <Snowman> Lua will not include custom textures :/
P7:07:22 <potato> oh well
P7:07:43 <Veronika> I think each server should be able to have it's own tileset.
P7:08:20 <Xeros> Hey, I have an idea for Minecraft that I think would be really useful...
13P7:08:30 * Xeros is front

P7:09:02 <Snowman> What idea?
P7:09:26 <Veronika> Yes? What's the idea? I'm quite familiar with coding, so...?

P7:10:36 <potato> lol
P7:10:46 <Xeros> The ability to sculpt a single block. You could take away square by square and create things like furniture-ish things, or for use in architechture. But it would still take the same area as a regular block (like plants)
P7:10:52 <Snowman> He joins, whines about the forums and leaves
P7:11:04 <Snowman> Xeros, no
P7:11:19 <Xeros> I require explanationz
P7:11:28 <Snowman> Has been suggested over and over
P7:11:32 <Xeros> Really?
P7:11:42 <Snowman> takes up too much room in the map script
P7:12:31 <Xeros> not even by taking a 1x1x1 block into a 2x2x2 block? That alone would do a lot
P7:12:31 <Veronika> Actually, it wouldn't be that hard. You'd probably have to limit the number of custom sculpts, though, per map.
P7:12:44 <Magnulus> Also, they're voxels, which is basically 3D pixels. Subdividing a single voxel so you can chip away smaller pieces would multiply the amount of voxels by insane amounts.
10P7:12:47 * Amatsu (amatsudark@142.47.134.2) has joined #minecraft
P7:13:11 <Snowman> Yes but then 1 person could make 25 penises and noone else can use the sculpture tool
P7:13:13 <Veronika> Magnulus: So what? Just download the level on demand, rather then on connection. You could have a giant world that way.
P7:13:20 <Magnulus> 1x1x1 is one voxel. Turning it into 2x2x2 turns it into... 8.
P7:13:26 <Veronika> Snowman: Well, that's up to the server admin.
P7:13:40 <Xeros> I thought it was 4?
P7:13:48 <Xeros> 4 sections of 1 block
P7:14:00 <Magnulus> How much is 2x2x2?
P7:14:33 <Magnulus> 8.
P7:14:36 <Xeros> there would be two blocks in the X direction... 2 in the Y direction, and 2 in the Z direction
P7:14:42 <Magnulus> Yeah.
P7:14:48 <Magnulus> eight in all.
P7:14:59 <Snowman> Maybe when objects come notch will make a basic object set
P7:15:14 <Snowman> like tables chairs fences etc
P7:15:19 <ChJees> Furniture :D
P7:15:21 <Magnulus> could be, could be.
P7:15:26 <Magnulus> I'd love some furniture.
P7:15:32 <ChJees> Maybe some stairs too
P7:15:40 <Snowman> So far theres only 1 object
P7:15:42 <Veronika> I'd kill for some stairs. It's all I want. :(
P7:15:45 <ChJees> For smooth ascend and descent
P7:16:04 <Magnulus> Well, he wants to get sloped voxels into the game, but has trouble with it.
P7:16:15 <ChJees> Basically a Triangular block are stairs :p
10P7:16:19 * KatamariManatee (Mibbit@ip98-179-180-215.ri.ri.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
P7:16:26 <Magnulus> Because voxels, while great, tend to be finicky about those kinds of things.
P7:16:29 <ChJees> Seen from the side
P7:16:29 <Veronika> I don't care if they're sloped or not. I just want smooth stairs.
P7:16:42 <Xeros> noo because if you take 1 quadrant of a block and expand it with another quadrant towards X... that would make 2 quad-blocks... if you took that same original peice of block expanded it towards Y it would so far have 3 blocks..... and.....wait...hmm...maybe it is 8 ^.^
P7:16:59 <Veronika> (basic geometry FTW)
P7:17:07 <ChJees> Let's terror Notch about stairs tomorrow :3
P7:17:14 <Veronika> I terror him about it every time I see him on.
P7:17:17 <Magnulus> If it's a 2x2x2 block, you just do the math to find out how many there are.
P7:17:36 <Snowman> 2x2 = 4 x2 = 8
P7:17:40 <Magnulus> If it's a 3x3x3 block, it's 3x3= 9 x 3 = 27
P7:17:42 <ChJees> Stairs and Ladders would be OMGLOEV
P7:17:56 <yoshibot> 3^3
P7:17:59 <Veronika> Stairs, Ladders, Accelerators, and Jump Pads.

P7:18:43 <Xeros> wow that's weird... for some rason my mind was thinking of turning a block into 4 mini-blocks but..... I must be being confused with squares haha
P7:18:43 <Magnulus> I think what's more important is for rendering to be optimised. Seems like it's rendering all voxels no matter how many you can see at any one time.

P7:19:36 <Magnulus> So if you're in a tiny room, you still get the same FPS as when you're seeing the whole level from a high perch.
P7:19:49 <Magnulus> Which is kind of wasteful.
P7:19:59 <Xeros> I've noticed that as I flood water 100 blocks high
P7:20:16 <Magnulus> selective rendering and LOD would be great.
P7:20:29 <Xeros> what's LOD stand for?
P7:20:34 <Magnulus> Level of Detail.
P7:20:37 <Veronika> For the sub-blocks, you could just stop drawing them after a certain distance.
P7:20:43 <chrstfer> there is that, asnt there?
P7:20:50 <chrstfer> LOD
P7:20:54 <Magnulus> Meaning that if you move far away, it renders less detail.
P7:21:00 <chrstfer> the fog distance is that basically?
P7:21:02 <Magnulus> I doubt there is, chrstfer.
P7:21:06 <Magnulus> Well, no.
P7:21:07 <Magnulus> Not really.
P7:21:12 <Magnulus> To some degree.
P7:21:13 <Xeros> Oh okay... I thought you were saying like... "It should have better graphics" and... I would be sad lol
P7:22:29 <Snowman> tbh, the entire game should be spheres :D

P7:24:05 <Meizlizard> Are there too few?
P7:24:12 <Magnulus> I don't know how easy it is to actually do geometry-based level of detail on voxels...
P7:24:28 <Snowman> Veronika, hacks will never be in the game
P7:24:28 <Magnulus> But some form of selective rendering would be good.
P7:24:34 <Snowman> minimap, maybe, but hacks, no
P7:24:41 <Magnulus> Minimap would be nice.
P7:24:52 <Snowman> Notch has said so himself
P7:24:52 <Veronika> "Hacks" could be server controlled.
P7:24:59 <charrr> use hax, get minimap
P7:25:18 <Xeros> as for the stairs and ladders and etc... I wonder if it would work like... you could select a block or a face of a block and have it become.. something... like climbable... or maybe... oh well not slippery because there are no slopes... maybe flat slipperyness would be good too
P7:25:51 <Xeros> Imagine Spleef on slippery ground :o
P7:27:16 <Magnulus> Another great thing would be zones, kind of like how Elder Scrolls games work. Would enable some pretty huge levels.
P7:27:31 <Snowman> suggested before
P7:27:40 <Xeros> Yeah that'd be nice
P7:27:44 <Veronika> I would like "deeds". Allocate a player a certain area to build in.
P7:27:46 <Snowman> geesh do you guys ever read the forums?
P7:27:47 <Magnulus> What was the response back then?
P7:28:00 <Magnulus> Eh, no. I don't read the nonexistent forums.
P7:28:00 <Snowman> idk
P7:28:14 <Snowman> magnulus, when did you start playing mc?
P7:28:19 <Magnulus> Three days ago.
P7:28:23 <Snowman> oh ok
P7:28:25 <Xeros> I know "owning blocks" has been suggested.. but I have my own version... in more of an anti-griefer way
P7:28:26 <Magnulus> So the forums were already down.
P7:28:28 <Snowman> says enough
P7:28:43 <Snowman> Well Xeros...
P7:28:46 <Snowman> tell me
P7:29:00 <Xeros> Say you could claim blocks... and anyone could delete them... but if they delete a certain amount, the owner has the ability to stop them from deleting them.
P7:29:26 <Magnulus> I would have checked ideas threads and all that if I had access to them.
P7:29:30 <Snowman> Nah aint gonna work
P7:30:57 <Xeros> Yeah I was thinking that... even if we had a huge minecraft "world", some people would put in the effort to create a huge wall from the max low and max high all the way around whatever they want
P7:31:47 <Veronika> That's what the designated building cubes would control.
P7:32:05 <Snowman> The only solution is a good opped, private server
P7:32:06 <potato> working on that tileset
P7:32:14 <potato> looking good
P7:32:16 <potato> so far
P7:32:24 <potato> i replaced coal ore with gems
P7:32:41 <potato> and some of the colours with sandstone, limestone, basalt, and marble

P7:32:54 <potato> already got marble
P7:33:04 <potato> show me the brick, though
P7:33:21 <Magnulus> Will you be able to use these tilesets on private servers?
P7:33:40 <potato> no, it's for your custom client
P7:33:46 <Magnulus> I wonder what it is about a lot of indie devs and that whole Lone Ranger thing.
P7:34:04 <Veronika> http://img.waffleimages.com/4946cb50cfae48c5878369f270c10a8b61845e50/terrain.png Only a few extra tiles.
P7:34:25 <potato> looks good
P7:34:32 <Magnulus> Yeah, I like it.
P7:34:33 <Snowman> So red bricks, grey bricks, red cobblestone and obsidian?
P7:34:35 <Xeros> lol
P7:34:37 <potato> prob. not gonna use it though
P7:34:49 <Veronika> I just wanted the brick tiles, really.
P7:35:11 <Eagle> They look amazing, too bad that Notch specifically said that he doesn't want people making new blocks or graphics

P7:55:00 <Meizlizard> I wonder if it'll ever get more efficient
P7:55:05 <Meizlizard> Like culling and the like
P7:55:24 <Meizlizard> I get terrible framerates on the massive maps people with good computers make.
P7:55:27 <yoshibot> assuming you can avoid drowning and can build underwater
P7:55:30 <yoshibot> and sponges
P7:55:49 <vede> Meizlizard, I feel your pain.
P7:56:20 <Real> so i know about 977music and last.fm ... what other online streaming free music radio type sites do you guys use?
P7:56:21 <vede> I try not to do too many big giant maps, since I had to stick to small maps once, too. :(
P7:56:28 <Meizlizard> It's also a ton more efficient on PCs it seems.
P7:56:33 <vede> Not being able to play people's stuff SUCKS.
P7:56:41 <Meizlizard> That's just Java though.
P7:56:46 <Meizlizard> Yeah.
10P7:56:56 * mail2345|zombie is now known as mail2345
P7:57:05 <Meizlizard> I tend to build on the outskirts of cities.
P7:57:13 <Meizlizard> Better framerates there.
P7:57:18 <yoshibot> i get that on this laptop :(
P7:57:18 <vede> Heh.
P7:57:23 <Meizlizard> Except when I look at the city.
P7:57:24 <vede> That sounds so weird...
P7:57:26 <yoshibot> intel integrated is </3

P7:59:14 <Meizlizard> The cities are always foggy and polluted

P8:00:04 <potato> http://www.vulomedia.com/images/75413terrain.png this is the tileset i made

P8:00:38 <vede>  ;O
P8:00:44 <Meizlizard> Maybe there are colors minecraft doesn't support
P8:01:01 <vede> potato, what are you doing to change terrain.png?
P8:01:09 <vede> You're not extracting it, are you?
P8:01:19 <potato> i extract it then replace it
P8:01:22 <vede> That is, not extracting minecraft.jar.
P8:01:41 <potato> i extract it but i put it bak

P8:01:48 <vede> Don't extract.
P8:01:52 <potato> uh
P8:01:54 <vede> Just open it.
P8:01:59 <potato> how do i get it out without extracting

P8:04:18 <Meizlizard> Will zip it again
P8:04:22 <potato> i know that
P8:04:32 <potato> but that is apparently what is making it not work
P8:04:37 <vede> You should not compress it.
P8:04:47 <vede> It should remain compressed through the whole process.
P8:05:46 <vede> Try using 7-zip.
P8:06:04 <vede> Open minecraft.jar with 7-zip (no renaming required) and you can edit terrain.png directly.
P8:06:39 <potato> is there a 7zip on mac

P8:51:33 <chrstfer> but doesnt the client keep the tilesets, to reduce the andwidth required to play the game
P8:51:38 <chrstfer> and to host a server
P8:51:58 <chrstfer> if you had to send all the tilesets it would destroy bandwidth

P8:52:14 <mail2345> actuall
P8:52:19 <mail2345> vede mentioned that
P8:52:25 <mail2345> the map is bigger than the tileset file
P8:53:04 <chrstfer> well yes, but sending both would take almost double, would it not?
P8:53:05 <vede> Tileset file: 18kb
P8:53:12 <vede> Map file: 180kb
P8:53:16 <vede> (approx.)
P8:53:21 <chrstfer> i dont understand what you mean?
P8:54:10 <vede> I'm saying that sending the tileset file would be negligible to any standard map.
P8:54:27 <vede> And with so many larger-than-normal maps on servers, it's just MORE negligible.
P8:54:37 <vede> You could send one, then the other, no problem.
P8:55:04 <chrstfer> ok
P8:55:54 <chrstfer> so what is the tileset we are talking about here? isnt that what stores what all the tiles look like?
P8:56:02 <vede> Yep.
P8:56:06 <vede> It's just a png.
P8:56:07 <chrstfer> ok
P8:56:13 <chrstfer> the server sends that?
P8:56:17 <vede> No.
P8:56:19 <chrstfer> ok
P8:56:29 <chrstfer> i get it then
P8:56:30 <potato_> it's stored in the minecraft.jar file
P8:56:33 <vede> Currently, the client has terrain.png in his local minecraft.jar.
P8:56:37 <chrstfer> ok
P8:57:00 <chrstfer> so thats why editing my client works on multiplayer?
P8:57:31 <vede> *I* think that as the game progresses, it become possible to set your server to be able to send a terrain.png to your clients.
P8:57:37 <vede> And yes, that's why it works in MP.
P8:57:44 <vede> *should become possible
P8:58:13 <vede> So servers can have custom tiles, for the custom game modes and tile behaviors that they have.
P8:58:42 <vede> Instead of everyone being FORCED to use Notch's tileset.
P8:58:50 <vede> (In their server.)

Here's the number. /b/, my personal army, do your worst.  (305) 451-3662
P10:29:14 <Cyanide> .....
P10:29:16 <Sean2009> thats trolling
P10:29:27 <Sean2009> you sir, are an idiot :(
P10:29:29 <vede> Right, so obviously you should be kicked by someone.
P10:29:40 <Sean2009> right o niggers

P10:38:35 <citricsquid> if($talking == true){ /ban *}
P10:38:36 <Griskard> my own feces, which I have eaten, regurgitated, then stomped on>andrew2009>sean2009
P10:38:46 <vede> ...
P10:39:10 <vede> DO you really need the "== true" bit?
P10:39:11 <andrew2009> oh yea, sean says hi
P10:39:21 <citricsquid> vede: YES, YOU MUST.
P10:39:30 <vede>  ._.
P10:39:35 <ONI> why not?
P10:39:57 <Veronika> Without the "== true" bit, you're only testing for existance of $talking, not just it's trueness.
P10:40:15 <vede> No...
P10:40:24 <chrstfer> citricsquid hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe talking == false, im TYPING
P10:40:56 <chrstfer> it should be if($typing == true) {/ban *}
P10:41:14 <vede> I assume that talking would be boolean (since it can be "true") so you only have to test for $talking.
P10:41:39 <chrstfer> a boolean can be either true or false
P10:41:43 <vede> Exactly.
P10:41:50 <chrstfer> $talking == false
P10:41:52 <Veronika> Is this PHP or some other shitty language? Why is it prefixed with $, anyways?
P10:41:54 <chrstfer> therefore no ban
P10:42:05 <chrstfer> but it IS there
P10:42:12 <vede> I assume C++, but that's just because if statistics.
P10:42:17 <vede> *of
P10:42:20 <chrstfer> therefor if($talking) {ban *}
P10:42:22 <Xeros> Oh wow this surprised me, almost gave me chills lol http://www.vimeo.com/1796206 oh and this is 3dmm btw.
P10:42:23 <Veronika> C++ doesn't prefix variables with the $ sign.
P10:42:24 <chrstfer> were all banned
P10:42:37 <vede> Well, still.
P10:42:41 <ONI> I blame Canada
P10:42:53 <Xeros> I love Canada, and I'm in America.
P10:43:13 <vede> If talking is boolean, you shouldn't need to test for the value of it, you can just test for IT.
P10:43:31 <vede> That seems to be true of a very large amount of languages.
P10:43:35 <Xeros> Is Minecraft purely Java or.. is there something else in there?
P10:43:53 <vede> It's Java, using the Lightweight Java Game Library.
P10:44:17 <chrstfer> what is flying.exe?
P10:44:26 <flyboy> it's a flyhack
P10:44:30 <flyboy> why?
P10:44:41 <chrstfer> just wonderin
P10:44:45 <chrstfer> were is it?
P10:44:53 <flyboy> tinyurl.com/flymod
P10:44:54 <chrstfer> were can i get
P10:45:01 <citricsquid> so uh, you know it's time for bed when the white part of your eye is red
P10:45:08 <chrstfer> lol
P10:45:27 <Xeros> Do you think Minecraft could be just as good on another language(besides the fact of it being in a browser)? I hope to be a Game Programmer someday and I just don't know what to study first.

P10:45:43 <flyboy> So far?
P10:45:51 <Veronika> Do you want to be a programmer, or do you just want to make shit? :)
P10:46:08 <chrstfer> xeros it depends on what you want to do
P10:46:15 <flyboy> Because I recommend starting with GML or Actionscript then moving onto a real language.
P10:46:25 <Xeros> Well mainly programmer, because I could care less about graphics... I prefer functionality and etc.
P10:46:29 <Veronika> Disregard everything flyboy says. That is stupid.
P10:46:29 <flyboy> GML = Basic but nicer
P10:46:30 <chrstfer> java, from what ive seen, seems to be 2d and 3d browser based game design
P10:46:42 <flyboy> It's called having an opinion
P10:46:44 <Veronika> Learn C++ if you want a real job as a programmer. Learn Python if you want to do cool shit quickly.
P10:46:47 <citricsquid> start with something that teaches good practice.
P10:46:56 <citricsquid> and don't trust shitty online tutorials
P10:46:57 <mail2345> python is a good starter

P11:09:01 <mail2345> i prefer the bash bomb
P11:09:17 <mail2345> :(){ :|:& };:
P11:09:21 <mail2345> looks so innocent
P11:09:25 <chrstfer> hehe yes it does
P11:09:28 <chrstfer> #include <unistd.h>

P11:09:41 <chrstfer> thats the c++ bt thats not wut u ment right?
P11:10:07 <mail2345> oh right, directly fork
P11:10:21 <chrstfer> include unix standard.h int main (void) { for (;;) fork();
P11:10:33 <chrstfer> wut is the fork();
P11:10:43 <chrstfer> wen there is not a fork()
P11:10:49 <chrstfer> in the source
P11:11:01 <chrstfer> doesnt it need to be declarded?

P11:12:25 <chrstfer> hello?
P11:12:36 <mail2345> oh wait
P11:12:45 <mail2345> that's for posix
P11:12:47 <mail2345> not windows
P11:12:52 <mail2345> you need to use cygwin
P11:13:15 <mail2345> or MinGW
P11:13:54 <chrstfer> huh? cygwin?
P11:14:04 <chrstfer> minGW?
P11:14:08 <liq3> lol...
P11:14:11 <mail2345> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin
P11:14:15 <mail2345> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW
P11:14:18 <chrstfer> ive already explained that i fail
P11:14:25 <chrstfer> no need to rub it in
P11:14:34 <mail2345> oh wait
P11:14:41 <Xeros> What were the codes above for? I heard "looks so innocent" lol what are they?
P11:14:51 <vede> fdisk c:
P11:14:56 <vede> Looks not innocent at all.
P11:14:58 <mail2345> well
P11:15:01 <mail2345> actually
P11:15:13 <chrstfer> they blow up ur computer
P11:15:17 <mail2345> MinGW lacks fork() Cygwin, btw is a compatability layer
P11:15:22 <mail2345> for POSIX
P11:15:25 <liq3> vede: what's fun is putting that in a batch file called "freeporn.bat"
P11:15:25 <chrstfer> by stealinz ur processer
P11:15:29 <vede> You could easily trick someone into running a batch with fdisk c: in it though.
P11:15:36 <chrstfer> ok
P11:15:56 <liq3> vede: easiest way to stop that, don't use C as default. :D

P11:16:21 <Xeros> so it formats it or something?
P11:16:30 <vede> Make a little game, put it on a forum, be like "hey guys can you give me feedback on my game i admit its crap but w/e" and have the game execute the batch, which is hidden somewhere in the game's unnecessarily bloated (not big filesize, just lots of files) resource folder.
P11:16:48 <chrstfer> lol
P11:16:52 <chrstfer> ive done that
P11:16:58 <chrstfer> on a retarded forum
P11:17:02 <chrstfer> wen i was like 11
P11:17:11 <vede> Have you also had the game execute a batch file containing fdisk c: ?
P11:17:15 <chrstfer> i got hit on the head with a bannhammer
P11:17:20 <vede> Ooh.
P11:17:21 <chrstfer> not fdisk
P11:17:30 <chrstfer> it was a c++ virus
P11:17:38 <chrstfer> that changes registry setting and shit
P11:17:49 <chrstfer> with some batch and stuff
P11:17:54 <Xeros> what kind of virus would this be called? if there is a name
P11:17:56 <mail2345> hmm.
P11:17:58 <mail2345> how about
P11:17:59 <chrstfer> i made it
P11:18:02 <chrstfer> no name.
P11:18:06 <chrstfer> it wasnt rlly a virus
P11:18:08 <mail2345> you go collect some fun stuff from p2p networks
P11:18:12 <mail2345> and email attachments
P11:18:18 <chrstfer> more like a malicious script
P11:18:25 <mail2345> ask darkebrz if he has a copy of his nasty rootkit

P11:33:47 <chrstfer> played
P11:33:55 <mail2345> legality is questionable
P11:34:03 <chrstfer> but nao it is dectectable
