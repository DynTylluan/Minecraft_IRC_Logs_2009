A12:00:07 <Animator> When I said Demodock or Republicraft, I was joking...
A12:00:46 <Shadaez> That's your thread?
A12:00:49 <frogger> Your not actually animator?
A12:00:57 <Shadaez> you're
A12:00:58 <Shadaez> *
A12:01:26 <frogger> Anyways shadaez
A12:01:53 <frogger> Your impaired if you don't see my reasoning behind removing a swastika
A12:03:01 <Shadaez> I don't believe in censorship, thanks.
A12:03:23 <Shadaez> If you're offended you can gtfo, don't grief things.
A12:04:25 <frogger> I'm not gonna talk with someone so stubborn.
A12:04:47 <AotC> :| swastikas where used a long time before it was taken as the nazi party emblem :|
A12:05:07 <frogger> That is true
A12:05:18 <AotC> (double face for more emphasis)
A12:05:20 <Shadaez> He prob. just learned about WW2 and stuff, so he's super cool and thinks they r super bad o noes :c.
A12:05:48 <frogger> But thats not what people represent it with today AotC

A12:05:58 <frogger> Saddly
A12:05:59 <AotC> also its still used in some religions
A12:06:01 <PuyoDead> Holy... is it the fabled "swastikas are bad/good" argument?
A12:06:06 <AotC> hinduism, buddhism, jainism
13A12:06:06 * PuyoDead gets the popcorn
A12:06:11 <frogger> Sadlt*
A12:06:16 <frogger> sadly*
A12:06:23 <Shadaez> No, puyo
A12:06:34 <Shadaez> this guy's a tard, and is saying they're racist and stuff.
A12:06:35 <AotC> frogger, people may represent it as something bad but they're retarded and need to learn the world outside of their own country

A12:09:30 <AotC> the answer is obvious: you don't win
A12:09:37 <AotC> so by not winning you win

10A12:31:45 * fenixfurion|idle is now known as fenixfurion|AC2
A12:32:57 <vede> I hate the retards who try to say the people who plaster swastikas all over the place are just showing their religious affiliation or whatever.
A12:33:31 <fenixfurion|AC2> ^
10A12:33:56 * fenixfurion|AC2 (fenixfurio@74-140-206-154.dhcp.insightbb.com) has left #minecraft (assassin's creed II)
A12:34:59 <AotC> vede, me too
A12:35:23 <Aeomin> I don't see the point of why they want to show off their religion anyways
A12:35:27 <vede> They're made for shock value. Swastikas have gained an international meaning as a representative of nazism. Symbols can change in perceived meaning over time, and if you don't understand that, you're a dumbass.
A12:35:35 <AotC> i agree with it being removed from where ever it was
A12:35:48 <AotC> i was only arguing that the taboo around them is retarded
A12:35:54 <vede> Not really.
A12:36:13 <AotC> when used to promote hate or something similar maybe
A12:36:23 <AotC> but the majority of the people who see them go "OH NOES EVIL REMOVE!" instantly
A12:36:26 <vede> What's the most recent major world event that had anything to do with swastikas?
12A12:36:38 * Annihilator|sleep (Annihilato@bas1-toronto48-1242462142.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: see you in a week)
A12:36:44 <AotC> :|
A12:36:46 <vede> I remove them because I know the dipshits who made them were just trying to attract attention.
12A12:36:48 * jonnyabc (Gian@c-69-142-216-55.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: they caught up)
A12:36:54 <AotC> then that is a good thing to do
A12:37:49 <vede> And EVEN IF a Hindu made one as a symbol of server-wide peace, I'd remove it, because the overall reaction to it will still be thoughts about nazis.
A12:38:48 <AotC> and that is where i am arguing that people can over react to symbols such as those
A12:39:05 <vede> It's not even an overreaction.
A12:39:11 <vede> Swastikas -> nazis
A12:39:19 <vede> Nazis are kind of not cool.
A12:39:34 <vede> It's a basic chain of thought.
A12:39:48 <vede> It's practically reflexive to think about nazis when confronted with a swastika.
A12:40:16 <vede> And then it's practically reflexive to think about the holocaust when you think about nazis.
A12:40:19 <AotC> are we still talking about this? can i go back to audiosurf yet -_-
A12:40:23 <vede> Which leads to "icky"

A12:49:01 <Shadaez> That's interactive fiction, right?
A12:49:09 <Roadcrosser> text adventure
A12:49:18 <Shadaez> Oh.
10A12:49:19 * mail2345|offline is now known as mail2345

A12:51:20 <Aeomin> like creepers shown in client 1 but not 2?
A12:51:24 <Shadaez> Yeah.
A12:51:34 <Shadaez> All the monsters are clientside.
A12:51:37 <PuyoDead> It's pretty much client side only. Whatever you see, only you see. So people will be fighting "invisible" stuff.
A12:52:03 <Aeomin> well.. it looks good for RP server then

A12:54:24 <frogger> With my homework
A12:55:19 <Aeomin> well.. if server was able to send those data..
A12:55:27 <vede> Aeomin, it's not server side.
A12:55:30 <vede> It's client side.
A12:55:51 <mail2345> umm
A12:55:53 <mail2345> people
A12:56:00 <Aeomin> force client to not load from server's map eh..
A12:56:01 <mail2345> THE PROTOCOL DOES NOT SPECIFICY MOBS
A12:56:03 <mail2345> we need
A12:56:04 <mail2345> that
A12:56:09 <mail2345> to be sticked somewhere
A12:56:10 <Aeomin> yeah mail..

A12:56:20 <gm|lap> mail2345: it specifies players though
A12:56:23 <mail2345> right
A12:56:24 <AotC> couldn't you do some pseudo playermobs
A12:56:25 <mail2345> players
A12:56:26 <vede> Aeomin, it still loads the server's map.
A12:56:33 <vede> You still play with people.
A12:56:40 <vede> But they can't see your mobs or anything.
A12:56:52 <mail2345> the only way to get survival MP atm
A12:57:02 <mail2345> is to write a custom wrapper that does weird stuff
A12:57:08 <mail2345> and communicates with a custom server
A12:57:10 <Aeomin> pseudo playermobs!
A12:57:11 <PuyoDead> Or wait like the rest of us.
A12:57:15 <vede> ^^
A12:57:20 <vede> Imma just do that.
A12:57:20 <mail2345> ^^
A12:57:25 <mail2345> i'm sure the time to code that
A12:57:31 <mail2345> is longer than what notch would take
A12:57:57 <Aeomin> custom wrapper is not easy to make..
A12:58:01 <Aeomin> at least for me
A12:58:20 <mail2345> is it just me
A12:58:29 <mail2345> or do the fourms look pinkish?
A12:58:37 <mail2345> actually
A12:58:45 <Aeomin> looks gray here
A12:58:46 <mail2345> mIRC is also looking pinkish
A12:58:57 <mail2345> mehhh

A1:00:32 <mail2345> I TOTALLY EXPECT THAT TO BE POSITIVE FEEDBACK
A1:01:27 <PuyoDead> Ugh. I'm really sick of that guy.

A1:07:07 <PuyoDead> Choose Your Own Adventure books.
A1:08:40 <PixelScrooge> lost pig is pretty good
A1:08:58 <vede> PuyoDead, ban him.
A1:09:00 <PixelScrooge> er
A1:09:00 <vede> Just do it.
A1:09:01 <PixelScrooge> specifically
A1:09:02 <PixelScrooge> Lost Pig (And Place Under Ground)
A1:09:09 <vede> Take him out.
A1:13:08 <PuyoDead> I'm giving him a warning for now.
A1:13:23 <PuyoDead> He's got to the point of simply being rude and disruptive.

A1:16:02 <mail2345> question
A1:16:13 <Douche_gunner> ?
A1:16:13 <mail2345> does this statement "If a person presents an argument in a irritating way, everyone else presenting that argument will also present it in an irritating manner." contain a logical fallacy?
A1:16:21 <mail2345> it totally doesn't, right
A1:16:35 <mail2345> it's completely valid reasoning
A1:16:38 <Douche_gunner> No it dosent

A3:17:07 <vede> So.
A3:17:10 <vede> I had an idea.
A3:17:36 <vede> Notch and Dock, just to spite all the dickheads in the community, should keep Rana as an optional player model.
A3:18:51 <vede> Visiiri, you don't really need to know anything about Minecraft.
A3:19:15 <vede> Just gotta be able to read console output.
A3:19:47 <AotC> pretty much how all the scripts for mc work..
A3:19:52 <AotC> which is sad :(
A3:21:14 <Akai> what's Rana?
A3:21:51 <vede> Akai, the test model that's currently causing all the controversy.
A3:21:56 <vede> Froghatgirl == Rana

A3:55:18 <mail2345> get here
A3:55:24 <mail2345> so as i was saying
A3:55:30 <mail2345> hamachi has a gateway feature
A3:55:39 <mail2345> or other VPNS
A3:55:41 <mail2345> the point is
10A3:55:50 * Koitenshin1 (Mibbit@99.144.113.175) has joined #minecraft
A3:55:51 <mail2345> a VPN service that would let people host servers
A3:55:52 <Koitenshin1> much better
A3:55:56 <mail2345> without needing to foward ports
A3:56:05 <mail2345> sure, setting up a VPN might be harder than fowarding a port
A3:56:06 <Shadaez> or you could learn to forward ports because it's very simple.
A3:56:06 <Koitenshin1> Now try this one
A3:56:07 <Koitenshin1> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=2e74c3e07be269665070abd8cdc4bfb4
A3:56:11 <mail2345> but if you lack access to the router
A3:56:16 <mail2345> it's an awesome solution
10A3:56:43 * Koitenshin1 is now known as Koitenshin
A3:57:03 <Shadaez> then use a upnp app; or don't host a server at all because you shoudn't if you don't have access.
A3:57:05 <Koitenshin> It should be working now.
A3:57:18 <mail2345> umm shadez
A3:57:28 <mail2345> did you read what i said?
A3:57:29 <Koitenshin> I had to shut disable my roommates wifi card
A3:57:39 <Koitenshin> and reboot my router
A3:57:41 <Shadaez> yeah? and?
A3:57:50 <mail2345> " don't host a server at all because you shoudn't if you don't have access."
A3:57:54 <mail2345> that doesn't make sense
A3:57:58 <Shadaez> yes it does
A3:58:04 <mail2345> how does it make sense?
A3:58:08 <Shadaez> If you don't have access then you really shouldn't host a server.
A3:58:12 <Koitenshin> It'd be excellent if the MC server was a uPNP app.
A3:58:20 <mail2345> i already made that suggestion
A3:58:23 <mail2345> nobody replied D:
A3:58:29 <mail2345> @shadez ...
A3:58:29 <Koitenshin> Did you?
A3:58:32 <mail2345> yea
A3:58:32 <Koitenshin> I'd reply
A3:58:36 <mail2345> along with NAT-PMP
A3:58:37 <mail2345> STUN
A3:58:41 <mail2345> and other protocols
A3:58:46 <Koitenshin> uPNP is better.
A3:58:49 <mail2345> i know
A3:58:53 <mail2345> but the more protocol
A3:58:57 <mail2345> protcols*
A3:59:00 <Koitenshin> My router actually supports uPNP

A4:03:06 <mail2345> lets say the person cannot access the router, uPNP STUN and NAT-PMP are off
A4:03:16 <mail2345> the admin is okay with them hosting and is letting VPN though
A4:03:30 <Shadaez> Then they should have access, physically, to the router. And they can do a reset.
A4:03:49 <mail2345> and that would delete the settings

A4:45:58 <serp> was it just very very high?
A4:46:08 <Koitenshin> no
A4:46:16 <Koitenshin> that was a real mountain
A4:46:26 <Koitenshin> the map was 256x256x256
A4:46:29 <Koitenshin> whoops
A4:46:35 <Koitenshin> 256x256x512
A4:46:52 <serp> I'm really confused
A4:47:06 <serp> so it was a map with a model of a real mountain in it?
A4:47:06 <emgmod> Me too.
A4:47:11 <Koitenshin> Basically it was 256 from water level to sky
A4:47:15 <emgmod> k
A4:47:21 <emgmod> I understand it.
A4:47:25 <serp> but we just went like 20 blocks up
A4:47:30 <Koitenshin> and from 256 from bottom of level to ocean level
A4:47:41 <Koitenshin> 512 height total
A4:50:22 <Koitenshin> I must not be very good at explaining things.
A4:51:04 <Shadaez> whats the L and W?
A4:51:21 <Marach> ocean level is always in middle
A4:51:38 <Koitenshin> It's a 256x256x512 map
A4:51:59 <Shadaez> pff boring
A4:52:14 <Koitenshin> It's better than a flatgrass
A4:52:18 <Koitenshin> Those are boring
A4:52:27 <Shadaez> I don't like verticle build
A4:52:32 <serp> is a flatgrass just a map that is flat?
A4:52:38 <emgmod> Hey, I tried building tract housing on a flatgrass.
A4:52:38 <Koitenshin> This wasn't vertical build.
A4:52:43 <emgmod> Boring on boring.

A4:54:37 <emgmod> This was my save slot for a recent project.
A4:54:39 <emgmod> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=emgmod&id=0
A4:54:51 <emgmod> It generates a map.
A4:55:04 <Koitenshin> >_>
A4:55:12 <Koitenshin> I noticed.
A4:55:15 <emgmod> Same for this one.
A4:55:18 <emgmod> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=emgmod&id=4
A4:55:21 <Koitenshin> maybe you shut browser off before it was done saving?
A4:55:36 <emgmod> Nope.
A4:55:37 <Koitenshin> try using www instead
A4:55:41 <Koitenshin> i never use the regular
A4:55:42 <Marach> borken!
A4:55:49 <emgmod> I'll try.
A4:55:57 <Koitenshin> www generates a new file too
A4:56:06 <Koitenshin> but next time you do a project, use the www site
A4:56:10 <Marach> i saved my biggest projects using LevelManager
A4:56:19 <emgmod> What about a fakeout url?
A4:56:24 <Koitenshin> or dump your files using the WoM client
A4:56:24 <Marach> but since then Notch changed level format :/
A4:56:36 <Quatroking> koitenshin stfu about wom plz
A4:56:43 <emgmod> I think I should try dumping files.
A4:56:52 <Marach> before, there was no other way to save server dat levels
A4:56:54 <Koitenshin> he's talking about making sure his projects get saved
A4:56:58 <Koitenshin> I'm trying to help.
A4:57:13 <emgmod> Wait, I can save to hd from the default client.
A4:57:23 <Quatroking> - Distribute hacks
A4:57:23 <Quatroking> The post should not contain download links, links to sites containing downloads, or references to sites containing downloads of Minecraft hacks. This is frowned upon and action may be taken against you.
A4:57:31 <Koitenshin> I can too but sometimes it breaks the levels on me.
A4:57:32 <Marach> haha
A4:57:35 <emgmod> "May"
A4:57:36 <Quatroking> Pretty sure those rules go around on the irc too
A4:57:37 <Marach> minecraft.net itself has a mention
A4:57:44 <Koitenshin> I'm not making any posts. I'm chatting
A4:57:53 <Marach> Notch, take it against yourself
A4:57:59 <Marach> XD
A4:58:14 <Quatroking> puyodead are people allowed to reference to wom on the irc
A4:58:23 <Koitenshin> Then they need a specific thing for IRC Rules.
A4:58:29 <Marach> "in doubt, ask op"?
A4:58:35 <Quatroking> Super-Dot, vede, PixelScrooge
A4:58:58 <emgmod> Or we can ignore it.
A4:59:13 <Shadaez> why wouldn't they be, quatro
A4:59:31 <Quatroking> well, its not allowed on the forums either?
A5:00:11 <Quatroking> oh by the way, I changed my forum avatar

A5:01:44 <Koitenshin> I have never met someone who likes to backseat mod so much.
A5:02:15 <Quatroking> I'm not backseat modding I just hate everyone who uses hacks or references to them
A5:02:24 <Koitenshin> I don't use them.
A5:02:28 <emgmod> Let's just IGNORE the problem.
A5:02:32 <Shadaez> world of MINECRAFT
A5:02:32 <emgmod> That always works.
A5:02:33 <Koitenshin> I just like to save levels
A5:02:33 <Marach> i use them when necessary
A5:02:40 <Quatroking> if I could I would burn wom
A5:02:45 <Quatroking> with thermite
A5:02:48 <Quatroking> to hell
A5:02:52 <Marach> if Notch would make them unnecessary, i would use them.

A5:02:57 <Marach> wouldnt*
A5:02:59 <Koitenshin> I only find one thing even remotely useful in the client.
A5:03:05 <Koitenshin> Level dumping and screenshots
A5:03:17 <emgmod> Screenshots? Printscreen.
A5:03:18 <mail2345> honestly
A5:03:22 <Quatroking> durrrr
A5:03:24 <mail2345> we need a minimal client
A5:03:25 <Shadaez> printscreen too hard for you?
A5:03:35 <mail2345> for the people who fucked up thier browser plugins
A5:03:39 <Koitenshin> No, but having to edit the stuff I dont want is a waste of time.
A5:03:44 <mail2345> as i said
A5:03:47 <mail2345> hackless client
A5:04:02 <Quatroking> stand-alone client that isn't based on java
A5:04:20 <emgmod> Minimal client...
A5:04:38 <emgmod> Who here has the knowledge and is not lazy enough to make one?
A5:04:45 <AndrewPH> just remove hacks from wom

A5:05:17 <Koitenshin> too many numbers, I cant dial
A5:05:19 <Koitenshin> :P
A5:05:25 <Quatroking> if wom is so "friendly" then why didn't they just have servers add +hax if they want hacks on their servers
A5:05:31 <Koitenshin> It'd have to be 1-80-MAIL-2345
A5:05:43 <Quatroking> instead of having hack-free servers spam their own motd with a stupid tag
A5:05:49 <Quatroking> that doesn't make sense at all
A5:05:50 <Marach> how to replace letters with numbers? @_@
A5:05:50 <Koitenshin> I use -hax on my server all the time.

A5:06:15 <mail2345> I'M A PYTHON CODER

A5:06:28 <Koitenshin> okay then mail is out,
A5:06:37 <Koitenshin> citric only does websites.
A5:06:39 <Marach> i think Notch can code in Java
A5:06:57 <Koitenshin> yeah but he's only doing the client through the browser
A5:07:00 <AndrewPH> give me an hour and I'll have a client without hax
A5:07:05 <AndrewPH> or less
A5:07:07 <AndrewPH> it shouldn't take long
A5:07:10 <Marach> who would use it?
A5:07:11 <AndrewPH> if I'm right, anyway.
A5:07:15 <Koitenshin> but will it have screenshotting and level dumping?
A5:07:19 <emgmod> Okay then.
A5:07:22 <AndrewPH> yeah sure why not
A5:07:28 <Quatroking> is a cheathappens account worth it?
A5:07:28 <Koitenshin> cool.
A5:07:30 <emgmod> No screenshotting.

A5:07:53 <Quatroking> I'm sick of having to search the entire web to find that one steam trainer that isn't by CH
A5:07:55 <Koitenshin> I prefer the screenshotting through the client
A5:08:21 <emgmod> I prefer sending my images through Gimp.
A5:08:34 <emgmod> That way, I could remove stuff I don't like.
A5:08:37 <AndrewPH> all done
A5:08:38 <Marach> i like instasaving
A5:08:46 <AndrewPH> it still has the enable hax button but it doesn't do anything

A5:43:51 <Wirtualnosc> Hi.
A5:43:52 <mail2345> so basically area was creating the archives
A5:43:55 <mail2345> and i was hosting my server
A5:44:02 <mail2345> i thought i backed up the map
A5:44:11 <mail2345> and before the reboot
A5:44:20 <mail2345> the bot came and archived it
A5:44:30 <mail2345> then i had a grief party on the map before loading the new map
A5:44:33 <mail2345> guess what happend
A5:44:40 <mail2345> i forgot to setup permissions :S
A5:44:51 <mail2345> but then turns out the clean map was on the archives
A5:44:53 <mail2345> heh
A5:45:07 <mail2345> there was alot of begging from my users to get area to conver tthem map
A5:45:19 <gdude2002> Shadaez, your floating islands zip file is invalid.
A5:45:40 <Shadaez> yeah, i know :(
A5:45:45 <Shadaez> i broked it
A5:45:53 <Shadaez> it sucks, that map was hand made and took hours.

A7:41:44 <Wirtualnosc> Hey Notch :)
A7:41:47 <Wirtualnosc> I have a suggestion
A7:41:53 <MonkeyDKS> I like that people feel the need to post things like "We should stop responding to him..." by responding to him
A7:41:57 <08Notch> hi =)
A7:41:58 <Wirtualnosc> About the block selection screen
A7:42:03 <08Notch> oh? =)
A7:42:06 <Iguana> Merry Christmas Notch!
A7:42:14 <Iguana> And now I am off to open presents.
A7:42:14 <08Notch> you too! =D
A7:42:23 <MonkeyDKS> Yes, Merry Christmas!
A7:42:24 <08Notch> I got the first episode of the Akira series. =D (the manga)
A7:42:27 <Wirtualnosc> Maybe make three tabs: One for Normal blocks, one for special (or more normal blocks), and one for cloth ones?
A7:42:36 <Wirtualnosc> Oh, yes, merry christmas :D
A7:42:37 <08Notch> tabs.. good idea
A7:42:58 <MonkeyDKS> I was thinking about numbering them too, so you could hotkey to a block type maybe?
A7:43:16 <MonkeyDKS> Aaand I'm off to family stuff!  Hope everyone has a great day!
A7:43:46 <MonkeyDKS> Keep up the great work Notch! (After taking a much deserved break for Christmas of course...)
A7:43:55 <Wirtualnosc> Monkey, actually number keys are used to select one of nine blocks from bottom :P
A7:44:17 <MonkeyDKS> So you wouldn't want to confuse people by having them numbered in the "b" screen too?
A7:44:30 <Wirtualnosc> Hmmm... What about CTRL+number?
A7:44:34 <MonkeyDKS> And then you'd have to figure out how to do double-digit numbers too...

A8:02:36 <08Notch> no, can't say I am.. I can understand why people don't want large changes in style

A8:03:23 <Vis{SHLEEP}> Ohey, Notch.
A8:03:28 <Wirtualnosc> ...hmm, so what you will do, Notch? Keep the old style, or go with new one?

A8:03:47 <08Notch> I'm going with the new one, but I'm going to ask him to turn down the cute a bit. ;)
A8:04:01 <08Notch> and I will insist on pixelated textures on them, that you can customize
A8:04:18 <08Notch> 2 hours of sleep = too little!
A8:04:36 <Visiiri> Hah. I've not gotten that much in about three days.
A8:04:42 <08Notch> :-o
A8:04:49 <Visiiri> :P
A8:04:56 <Visiiri> Of course, I don't sleep often or well.
A8:05:02 <Visiiri> Right now I'm just awaiting my parents.
A8:05:24 <Visiiri> I'll make sure to share everything I've gotten for Christmas with you.
A8:05:27 <Visiiri> :>
A8:05:37 <08Notch> lol
A8:06:28 <Super-Dot> Notch: Are 3D pixels made from textures technically feasible?
A8:06:46 <08Notch> voxels? well.... Not really
A8:06:47 <Super-Dot> Like the extra head layer, but with cubes instead of planes
A8:07:07 <Super-Dot> Dang
A8:07:09 <08Notch> it can be done, but I want to keep the game fast. ;D
A8:07:26 <Super-Dot> Yeah, it does seem like the kind of thing that could get slow
A8:07:30 <Visiiri> Actually, I was surprised. All I asked for was some NX, L4D2, a few albums, and a monitor. Maybe about $150. There were loads of presents for me though. One's larger then a monitor. I wonder what could be in it.
A8:07:58 <Super-Dot> It seemed like md3s were a zillion times faster, so I was curious whether it was a big enough zillion for that
A8:08:21 <Visiiri> :P Super-Dot, don't interview Notch on Christmas! I assure you, he might suicide.
A8:08:39 <Super-Dot> Oh you're right :O
A8:08:46 <Visiiri> Yesh.
A8:08:55 <Super-Dot> We should outlaw question marks for the next 24 hours
A8:09:01 <Visiiri> Sounds good.
A8:09:01 <Wirtualnosc> Don't worry, Visiiri, I have all of TNT blocks. :)
A8:09:05 <VurtualRuler98> It's a wardrobe that leads to an infinite sandbox plane.
A8:09:11 <Visiiri> Hehehehe
A8:09:37 <VurtualRuler98> Where literally anything you can imagine is yours.
A8:09:46 <VurtualRuler98> The only previous owner had no imagination.
A8:10:02 <Visiiri> >.< I want to suicide right now.
A8:10:06 <Wirtualnosc> Everyone has imagination, but not everyone uses it in 100%.
A8:10:08 <Visiiri> I slept with the door closed.
A8:10:16 <Visiiri> It's sooo hot in here.

A8:15:05 <Visiiri> Instead of going to your modem, it goes super fast to other servers
A8:15:17 <Visiiri> Or, or or, get "GameBooster"

A8:30:24 <Quatroking> also, notch, burn for having volume 1 of akira >:(
A8:30:33 <08Notch> Ideally, the player should be able to choose how cute they want their char to be
A8:30:39 <08Notch> the default should be, imo, less cute. =)

A8:31:35 <08Notch> but other people will have whatever they've chosen
A8:31:51 <Quatroking> then people should just buy the damn game instead of whining

A8:32:02 <Wirtualnosc> I bought the game.
A8:32:04 <Quatroking> people wanted reasons to buy the game, here they have them
A8:32:18 <Quatroking> oh so people who don't get the game early can't switch to old mode?
A8:32:22 <08Notch> I'm soo happy I finally added the /indev/ thing as well
A8:32:33 <Wirtualnosc> Early = alpha?
A8:32:33 <08Notch> there will be no old mode

A8:34:06 <C418> thats the problem with the film
A8:34:11 <Wirtualnosc> My sister loves anime and manga.
A8:34:16 <C418> it wants to have a story that was once over 1000 pages
A8:34:19 <C418> doesn't work well
A8:34:19 <Wirtualnosc> And I... dislike them a bit. :P
A8:34:24 <08Notch> She would've gotten me all five (six?) volumes, she said, but the new printing only has book 1 so far
A8:34:39 <08Notch> The movie didn't cover the entire story either
A8:34:47 <08Notch> it's just the first 1.5 books or so, iirc
A8:35:00 <Quatroking> everyone look at my link it shows how sexy i am
A8:35:17 <C418> hm, yeah, but it isn't a well made story I think
A8:35:23 <08Notch> I got very hooked on the Full Metal Alchemist manga.. I've got the first 21 issues, avaiting the next one in January
A8:35:36 <C418> the visuals are too amazing to notice it, but it's not really well done
A8:35:44 <Quatroking> I have the original printing of Azumanga Daioh
A8:35:50 <08Notch> I loved the Akira movie. =D
A8:36:02 <08Notch> "Keneeedaaaa!!" "Tetsuoooooo!!" "Keneeedaaaa!!" "Tetsuoooooo!!" "Keneeedaaaa!!" "Tetsuoooooo!!"
A8:36:16 <Quatroking> I should watch it again
A8:36:21 <C418> I have issues with the story, but I don't want to say it because it's deep spoilers
A8:36:25 <Quatroking> It reminded me a bit of BASS
A8:36:40 <08Notch> I don't remember the plot in detail, to be honest. That's probably a bad sign
A8:36:58 <Quatroking> but noooootch, look look look: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Photos/P1040031.JPG
A8:36:59 <08Notch> I desperately want them to make a live action version of it. :D
A8:36:59 <C418> as I said, amazing visuals. thats what everyone remembers
A8:37:05 <C418> but they do already
A8:37:06 <Wirtualnosc> My sister has twenty japanese episodes of Shakugan no Shana, with English subtitles

A8:41:48 <Quatroking> Notch: http://hacksess.com/public/images/current/goddess-wallscroll.jpg
A8:41:50 <Quatroking> for example
13A8:41:58 * Notch gives Iguana|Depression a manly hug
A8:42:04 <Iguana|Depression> D:
A8:42:11 <08Notch> oh cool
A8:42:13 <08Notch> no hug?
13A8:42:17 * Iguana|Depression hugs back
A8:42:18 <08Notch> too soon?
A8:42:21 <08Notch> oh yay! =D
A8:42:25 <VurtualRuler98> Quatroking, that is creepier than anything I've ever seen.
A8:42:30 <08Notch> lol
A8:42:38 <Evilgrim> How? :3
A8:42:46 <Quatroking> VurtualRuler98, let me dig up some photo's of my bedroom
A8:42:50 <Quatroking> its sexy.
A8:42:56 <Wirtualnosc> Hentai...?
A8:43:03 <VurtualRuler98> I'm never leaving my house just to be sure nah I'm just kidding, you're just boring.
A8:43:32 <Evilgrim> Wirtual. >_> Palcomix make hentai on a lot of things. Doesn't mean it was decent BEFORE they.. Corrupted it.. Bleh.

A8:45:43 <VurtualRuler98> Pff.
A8:45:47 <Quatroking> and the other three are my figure collection and stuff
A8:45:56 <08Notch> anyone have Spotify and want to listen to some swedish prog?
A8:46:02 <Evilgrim> Quatroking. You are epic.
A8:46:02 <Quatroking> noooootch
A8:46:04 <VurtualRuler98> Your scrolls have nothing against my WALL OF TVs.
A8:46:05 <Wirtualnosc> Yay! :D
A8:46:05 <Quatroking> look at theeeem
A8:46:09 <Quatroking> Evilgrim, yes.
A8:46:21 <Wirtualnosc> New Super Mario Bros.! :DE
A8:46:23 <Wirtualnosc> :D
A8:46:31 <Quatroking> wii?
A8:46:34 <Wirtualnosc> DS.
A8:46:34 <Iguana|Depression> Quatro, don't you live in an attic or something...
A8:46:38 <Quatroking> I do.
A8:46:48 <Quatroking> Best possible bedroom there is
A8:46:49 <08Notch> ok that does it..
A8:47:05 <08Notch> when Ez and I move in together, I get my own room (officially an "office")
A8:47:13 <Quatroking> haha
A8:47:15 <08Notch> I'm going to cram it full with nedy crap :D
A8:47:17 <08Notch> *nerdy
A8:47:17 <Quatroking> Take the attic
A8:47:23 <Wirtualnosc> And this will be Mojang HQ?
A8:47:26 <08Notch> yeah
A8:47:38 <08Notch> I'll take pics for you when it's somewhat set up. :D
A8:47:40 <Quatroking> Its huge, provides enough power (most attics have their own electricity group)
A8:47:47 <Quatroking> and its just cool.
A8:47:50 <08Notch> actually, I shouldn't jinx this.. the apartment swap deal isn't final yet
A8:48:06 <08Notch> it's an apartment, there is no attic
A8:48:08 <C418> that totoro plush doesn't look really cute
A8:48:09 <Iguana|Depression> Notch, you should totally make mob plushies.
A8:48:11 <Iguana|Depression> I'd buy one.
A8:48:18 <08Notch> yes, I should. :D
A8:48:25 <Quatroking> the pics are outdated tho...
A8:48:25 <Iguana|Depression> Sheep plushies.
A8:48:27 <08Notch> the papercraft ones from a while back were awesome though
A8:48:32 <Quatroking> should I take some of the new stuff I have?
A8:48:33 <Iguana|Depression> Indeed they were.
A8:48:47 <08Notch> someone should sell high quality versions of those
A8:48:54 <Quatroking> I have a HUGE totoro tree
A8:49:05 <Quatroking> and explosm
A8:49:09 <08Notch> Quatroking: yes, but please done spam links again. ;)
A8:49:20 <Quatroking> Its two links this time, probably
A8:49:30 <Quatroking> will cram them in one message
A8:49:38 <08Notch> great, thanks =)
A8:49:39 <Quatroking> should i include my desktop too
A8:49:45 <08Notch> yes you should
A8:51:51 <Wirtualnosc> I'm curious about reason, why mobs were deleted from creative, singleplayer? I think I know, these were only experimentations, but many people liked them a lot, and... Well, it was optional to add them, wasn't it? :)
A8:52:15 <C418> to be honest
A8:52:22 <C418> those mobs didn't look professional
A8:52:27 <C418> and I think they never were
A8:52:41 <08Notch> I agree. The mobs had some charm, but they were the weakest part of the game
A8:52:54 <Wirtualnosc> Oh.
A8:53:10 <08Notch> but.. the reason they never got into creative was that the first version where they were in was just a quick test
A8:53:22 <08Notch> when I implemented them for real, I never added them to creative
A8:53:44 <08Notch> I'm probably going to let you spawn stationary mobs or harmless mobs in creative mode so you can decorate your levels with them
A8:54:05 <08Notch> and it's going to be needed for when you can load maps made in creative and play them in survival or dungeon mode
A8:54:12 <Iguana|Depression> Notch, make a mob holding a torch.
A8:54:14 <C418> sounds a bit like garrys mod
A8:54:19 <Quatroking> uploading..
A8:54:24 <Iguana|Depression> So I can make stupid people inside my dungeons as guards.
A8:54:24 <08Notch> i guess..
A8:54:34 <08Notch> hehe
A8:54:39 <Wirtualnosc> Dungeon mode?
A8:54:40 <08Notch> moving lightsources is a bit of a problem
A8:54:42 <Wirtualnosc> What will it be?
A8:54:51 <Wirtualnosc> Never heard about it.
A8:54:52 <08Notch> dungeon mode is like survival mode, except you can't build
A8:54:58 <Iguana|Depression> Notch, make them stationary. I just want dudes standing in place with torches.
A8:55:07 <Iguana|Depression> You can break blocks though?
A8:55:17 <Quatroking> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Room/P1050034.JPG - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Room/P1050033.JPG - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Room/P1050032.JPG - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Room/P1050031.JPG - http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Room/P1050031%20%282%29.JPG
A8:55:19 <08Notch> only some
A8:55:20 <Evilgrim> What was I thinking of? The one with switches that send out pulses or something.. Bleh.. Old blog post..
A8:55:21 <08Notch> like wood
A8:55:29 <08Notch> yes, that's what I mean, Evilgrim. =)
A8:55:34 <Wirtualnosc> Dirt too?
A8:55:35 <08Notch> the dungeon mode is planned for that expansion
A8:55:36 <Iguana|Depression> SPEAKING OF DUNGEON MODE. When'd you think you would be able to release some sort of playable demo?
A8:55:40 <08Notch> no, Wirtualnosc
A8:55:50 <Quatroking> that includes the head of my bowser cosplay and my recently acquired Alone in the Dark figurine
A8:55:51 <08Notch> of dungeon mode? that's after the game is done
A8:56:02 <08Notch> I need to finish up the inventory system for survival mode now, before the end of the year
A8:56:03 <Iguana|Depression> Oh.
A8:56:09 <Quatroking> notch look look look
A8:56:12 <08Notch> then add crafting.. then I can start doing the multiplayer code
A8:56:13 <Iguana|Depression> 70 more builds to go through.
A8:56:14 <Iguana|Depression> :D
A8:56:28 <Iguana|Depression> Carl, let me feel your wood. :/

A8:57:15 <Quatroking> oh
A8:57:27 <08Notch> my desk is really messy atm
A8:57:29 <Quatroking> just noticed I have this old cup of soup standing here
A8:57:42 <Quatroking> curry soup... last monday
A8:57:46 <08Notch> You know what? I still feel inspired, I will go implement some inventory code now
10A8:57:48 * Iguana|Depression is now known as Iguana|SAD
A8:57:50 <Quatroking> I should probably clean that up
A8:57:52 <Iguana|SAD> Shorter name now.
A8:57:53 <08Notch> I promised myself I'd take today off, but.. :D
A8:58:04 <Iguana|SAD> And that's why we love you.
A8:58:11 <Evilgrim> Yay! Best of luck Notch¨
A8:58:14 <08Notch> it's much easier to get inspired when there's no pressure, I guess
A8:58:24 <KatamariManatee> Notch, if people still don't like Docks designs... Can I help you with character designs?
13A8:58:26 * Evilgrim thwaks her new keyboard.
A8:58:27 <08Notch> i'll upload it to indev when I've got something. It'll be a few hours
A8:58:28 <Iguana|SAD> It's Christmas, so I wouldn't want you working today either.
A8:58:36 <Iguana|SAD> YOU HAVE DONE GOOD. Enjoy yourself. :d
A8:58:43 <08Notch> KatamariManatee: Well, *I* like his designs. :D
A8:58:45 <Evilgrim> Iguana, the fact is some sad people HAVE to work on Christmas. >_<
13A8:58:48 * Quatroking should get rid of this lame world map
A8:58:58 <Quatroking> does anyone know a good replacement
A8:59:02 <Iguana|SAD> Evilgrim, has a job, what.
A8:59:04 <08Notch> actually, the xmas holiday thingie was yesterday in sweden. We celebrate the 24'th
A8:59:10 <Iguana|SAD> :o
A8:59:16 <08Notch> we get the 25'th off too, though
A8:59:26 <Wirtualnosc> In polish, we celebrate 25'th and 26'th.
A8:59:34 <Iguana|SAD> In Canada we celebrate today.
A8:59:36 <Iguana|SAD> :o
A8:59:37 <C418> we celebrate on the 24th and have christmas till 26th
A8:59:46 <08Notch> yeah, I guess it's the same here, C418
A8:59:51 <Iguana|SAD> And Viet Nam though, we don't celebrate anything. :/
A9:00:03 <KatamariManatee> Notch: I dunno, you like 'em, but there is lots of people who don't... One person is going out of his way to try and stop you.
13A9:00:03 * Quatroking is the true anime king of the community
13A9:00:12 * Iguana|SAD steals all of Quatro's stuff
A9:00:18 <08Notch> There's Julafon (yesterday), with the food and the gifts. Juldagen (today) with leftovers and doing nothing, then Annandag Jul tomorrow, which is just boring and lots of closed stores
A9:00:20 <Iguana|SAD> Oh cool, my mum is calling me.
A9:00:22 <Quatroking> too bad you're an emo today, iguana
A9:00:31 <Iguana|SAD> D:
A9:00:38 <Quatroking> and you know what they say about emo's

A9:00:57 <Iguana|SAD> You would like that. :D
A9:01:00 <08Notch> KatamariManatee: Yes, I'm going to try to tone down whatever I feel can be and should be toned down, as long as Dock agrees. Just because of the feedback
A9:01:26 <08Notch> but I love his strong sense of characters, and he has some really interesting ideas on what we can do with customization and so. I think he kinda gets what I'm trying to do.
A9:01:39 <Iguana|SAD> How old is Dock?
A9:01:39 <Quatroking> He's looking into a suggestion I made
12A9:01:46 * softnux (softnux@h-129-237.A193.priv.bahnhof.se) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
10A9:01:46 * softnux_ is now known as softnux
A9:01:55 <08Notch> 29 or 30
A9:01:57 <08Notch> or 31?
A9:02:18 <Quatroking> I suggested him to use slightly curved corners instead of full curves and he thought it was an okay idea
A9:02:19 <08Notch> no, he's probably 30. He was born 79, I think, same as me
A9:02:35 <C418> what dock uses is to pump up a cube
A9:02:37 <08Notch> I think that sounds like a good idea, Quatroking
A9:02:41 <C418> it looks round-ish and has no sharp edges
A9:02:45 <Iguana|SAD> Sweeeet. My mum says she'll pay for my next 4 months of ninjutsu, and she's paying from all the way in the US.
A9:02:46 <Iguana|SAD> Yay.
A9:02:49 <PixelScrooge> sup notch
A9:02:51 <Iguana|SAD> I am not AS sad now.
A9:02:59 <08Notch> lol Iguana
A9:03:04 <Quatroking> Notch: Yeah, it keeps the blocky part and makes it look nicer
A9:03:06 <08Notch> xmas is supposed to be happytime!
A9:03:15 <Iguana|SAD> Kayakujutsu next month, so I am pumped.
A9:03:18 <Evilgrim> "Not for Iguana"?
A9:03:20 <08Notch> some blockiness needs to go to get nicer graphics
A9:03:22 <Iguana|SAD> Playin' with explosives and fire! >:D
10A9:03:26 * Wirtualnosc is now known as Wirtualnosc|HAPPY
A9:03:43 <KatamariManatee> I like blocky-ness, though...
A9:03:45 <Wirtualnosc|HAPPY> See, Iguana? I'm happy!
A9:03:56 <08Notch> I sold 38 copies the day before yesterday..
A9:04:04 <KatamariManatee> How do you change your name?
A9:04:07 <08Notch> that's just crazy much compared to normal
A9:04:30 <Iguana|SAD> Hey Notch, figured out my server freezing problem yet? :P
A9:04:41 <08Notch> and that was right after we announced Dock. So it's either people who want to keep their old models, or people who like dock's graphics, or a little bit of both. ;)
A9:04:49 <Iguana|SAD> How all my browsers freeze for a second or 2 before loadin' a servaaarrr.
A9:05:06 <08Notch> I don't know what causes that yet..
A9:05:17 <Iguana|SAD> Alright, fine by me. :D
A9:05:17 <08Notch> It works for me, haha. :D But I guess that's not helpful at all
A9:05:38 <C418> I can't use chrome for minecraft
A9:05:44 <C418> chrome has the habit of freezing sometimes
A9:05:48 <08Notch> i haven't tried chrome
A9:05:52 <C418> at least with minecraft
A9:06:02 <08Notch> I've had it crash several times just browsing
A9:06:14 <C418> that shouldn't happen
A9:06:14 <08Notch> it's pretty painless to restart it, though. But I still prefer FF
A9:06:21 <Wirtualnosc|HAPPY> I prefer Opera 10.
A9:06:23 <KatamariManatee> I think when minecraft is done, there should be...
A9:06:26 <08Notch> that was on my last computer, I haven't tried it on this computer
A9:06:27 <KatamariManatee> A PSP PORT
10A9:06:27 * Wirtualnosc|HAPPY is now known as Wirtualnosc
A9:06:31 <C418> well, it probably doesn't happen anymore
A9:06:36 <08Notch> oh, ok =)
A9:06:38 <Iguana|SAD> Katamari, I think DS is better.
A9:06:47 <Iguana|SAD> But I hate Nintendo anyways, no offense.
A9:06:49 <KatamariManatee> What? HOW DARE YOU, SIR
A9:06:53 <Wirtualnosc> All nintendo consoles are really good :D
A9:07:01 <KatamariManatee> DS doesn't even compare.

A9:07:15 <Wirtualnosc> What? DS is very good |:(
A9:07:44 <KatamariManatee> For very little. All I like on there is Hotel Dusk and Phoenix Wright.

A9:07:59 <Wirtualnosc> I'm trying to buy either DS or Wii
A9:08:06 <Wirtualnosc> but I don't have much money...
A9:08:15 <KatamariManatee> Get the wii. IT'll have Cave story
A9:08:21 <Wirtualnosc> Yeah, Wii is better.
A9:08:24 <Wirtualnosc> But DS is cheaper.
A9:08:32 <DragoonEnRegalia> Cave Story's fine where it is...for me.
A9:08:33 <Wirtualnosc> And I don't have money for both of them.
A9:08:38 <Iguana|SAD> Wtf.
A9:08:42 <Iguana|SAD> My guitar string snapper.
A9:08:46 <Iguana|SAD> snapped*
A9:08:48 <DragoonEnRegalia> Ow.
A9:08:53 <Quatroking> If you have to choose between a Wii and DS, think of what you want
A9:09:04 <Iguana|SAD> I JUST GOT NEW STRINGS LAST WEEK THOUGH.
13A9:09:10 * Iguana|SAD rages and crys more
A9:09:11 <Wirtualnosc> Wii for awesomeness, DS for price.
A9:09:26 <KatamariManatee> Wii has much better titles on WiiWare than DS has on DSiWare
A9:09:32 <Wirtualnosc> I know.
A9:09:45 <Quatroking> A system thats great with homebrew and can run wonderful old games, emulated perfectly or a handheld that can be pirated real quick
A9:09:46 <Wirtualnosc> But I don't earn really much pocket money :|
A9:09:52 <KatamariManatee> I have a Dsi...
A9:09:59 <Quatroking> I myself have a Wii and my little brother has a DS
A9:10:06 <KatamariManatee> I don't really play much on it...
A9:10:09 <Quatroking> I prefer the Wii because oh the homebrew
A9:10:14 <Quatroking> of*
A9:10:16 <Wirtualnosc> Only 10 PLN/month, which is about 2,5 EUR/month
A9:10:20 <Iguana|SAD> Oh cool, I hve a pile of broken guitar strings.
A9:10:22 <Iguana|SAD> I count 9.
A9:10:49 <DragoonEnRegalia> So, seems like the aftermath of the Mochi Debacle is over
A9:10:55 <KatamariManatee> Get a PSP, it has some good games! (Not a pspgo, though. Those are terrible)
A9:10:57 <DragoonEnRegalia> I...
A9:11:00 <DragoonEnRegalia> Hate....
A9:11:03 <DragoonEnRegalia> Trolls...
A9:11:06 <DragoonEnRegalia> Meh.

A9:14:43 <08Notch> then I will dev
A9:14:50 <Iguana|SAD> He said something about inventory dev today.
A9:14:52 <Evilgrim> What's that game.. Where the guy gets the sword.. And the sword is a evil immortal.. And you go insane?
A9:14:55 <Koitenshin> Wow, will you stream it again?
A9:14:59 <Iguana|SAD> And something released at the end of the day, or something.
A9:15:12 <Koitenshin> For some reason, I like watching people dev. =3

A9:17:31 <Skillkills95> Modern Warfare 2 is awesome
A9:17:48 <08Notch> it's a bit short
A9:17:56 <serp> you could just use a 1d array and do some clever math when indexing it

A9:18:06 <Koitenshin> Since his review
A9:18:11 <08Notch> 3d arrays are slower (sometimes) and use more ram (always)
A9:18:15 <Icenisse> ohai notch
A9:18:18 <serp> it will make it easier to compress it for instance
A9:18:29 <08Notch> hi icenisse
A9:18:32 <Icenisse> :D
A9:19:05 <Icenisse> Notch is it true that you joined ANNZZ server of DOOM?
A9:19:07 <Koitenshin> So I've been told I have to think of a present to be gifted.
A9:19:13 <Koitenshin> Problem is I don't know.
A9:19:20 <08Notch> I don't know, Icenisse
A9:19:27 <Icenisse> ok
A9:19:35 <08Notch> I went on some servers recently, yes. But that was through links in here
A9:19:36 <Iguana|SAD> Icenisse, maybe verify names is false?
A9:19:42 <08Notch> so I don't know what the servers were called
A9:19:46 <Icenisse> It was on true
A9:19:53 <Iguana|SAD> Hmmm.
A9:19:56 <Icenisse> there was a guy there named Notch
A9:20:04 <Icenisse> and he said like I AM NOTCH
A9:20:09 <Iguana|SAD> Lol.
A9:20:12 <08Notch> I don't say that. =)
A9:20:12 <Koitenshin> Then it was a fake.

A9:26:29 <Icenisse> is it fast?
A9:26:29 <VurtualRuler98> Around here 1200 gets you an overpowered laptop that won't run anything because you put Ubuntu on it.
A9:26:34 <Iguana|SAD> And then I must learn Java by myself. o.o
A9:26:47 <08Notch> it's fairly fast. I think 600 mhz, but it's a really fast mhz per mhz

A9:30:24 <Koitenshin> every time my maps hit 1mb on my server they break
A9:30:26 <VurtualRuler98> Whee, we can have bigger than 2048x2048x24

A9:33:57 <Icenisse> Great!
A9:34:02 <Koitenshin> asie, will it be able to do all 4 sides instead of just one?
A9:34:15 <leBMD> now I just have to learn to make skins that are better than 3 color mudkips. XD
A9:34:23 <VurtualRuler98> #minecraft's unban procedure appears to be "proxy in and act cool until people like you, hope they don't notice." apparently.
A9:34:31 <PuyoDead> Evidently.
A9:34:34 <asiekierka> Nooo
A9:34:37 <asiekierka> I wasn't here for like, 2 months now
A9:34:38 <08Notch> no, he asked me privately
A9:34:58 <asiekierka> and my other computer is still banned
A9:34:59 <08Notch> and I figured it might be time to give him a twelfth chance
A9:35:04 <Iguana> 12th? Looool.
A9:35:09 <08Notch> or 16th?
A9:35:13 <08Notch> i forget

A9:44:59 <Marach_> lmao, interesting ads
A9:45:00 <Icenisse> nice
A9:45:01 <08Notch> but I think ads should ideally be relevant
A9:45:03 <Marach_> XD
A9:45:06 <Bah_Humbug> Now you just need to be able to render all 4 sides
A9:45:08 <PixelScrooge> I always thought you basically bought the adspace
A9:45:12 <08Notch> if you only click relevant ads, that gets reinforced

A9:45:44 <Iguana> I'll celebrate it when I get nunchukas and tabi boots.
A9:45:44 <08Notch> what's that?
A9:45:57 <Merry-Dot> It's basically a bidding-based ad system
A9:46:05 <asiekierka> Bah_Humbug: well it's easy, but i'm not doing that at the very moment.
A9:46:05 <Merry-Dot> The ad goes to the highest bidder, per-site

A10:04:53 <Koitenshin> a self portrait
A10:05:05 <AlexVMiner> of me?
A10:05:08 <AlexVMiner> aw shucks
A10:05:14 <Koitenshin> thats generally what a self portrait is
A10:05:20 <AlexVMiner> well
A10:05:25 <AlexVMiner> you could have meant you
A10:05:35 <Koitenshin> only if I was drawing it
A10:05:43 <AlexVMiner> shaddup
A10:05:56 <Dziubek> hey how i can create survival server?
A10:05:59 <Koitenshin> so a self portrait, go
A10:06:05 <AlexVMiner> ya can't
A10:06:12 <Koitenshin> you can.
A10:06:16 <Koitenshin> it's just weird
A10:06:37 <VurtualRuler98> Dude, my friend has two internets.
A10:06:37 <Dziubek> can you tell how?
A10:06:46 <VurtualRuler98> He has two connections, maybe 3, going to his house.
A10:06:47 <Koitenshin> i think the only thing that could make survival better is placeable blocks that spawn mobs
A10:07:01 <vede> Dziubek, you can't. Koitenshin is just spewing nonsense.
A10:07:17 <Koitenshin> No I'm not.
A10:07:29 <Koitenshin> And no I can't tell you how.
A10:08:42 <Koitenshin> Your best bet is to get read the forums
A10:08:45 <VurtualRuler98> You technically can.
A10:08:54 <Koitenshin> *go read
A10:08:58 <VurtualRuler98> But that's just making a server, and kicking people if they don't die from a fall.
A10:09:11 <VurtualRuler98> Minecraft creative trials.
A10:09:57 <AlexVMiner> okay koitenshin
A10:09:59 <asiekierka> i've sped up file loading from 50 seconds to 42 seconds
A10:10:00 <Dziubek> i saw images that someone was playing on MP survival

A10:10:48 <Koitenshin> perfect fior my dart board, thank you
A10:10:51 <asiekierka> as in you can flip it in X and in Z
A10:10:52 <PuyoDead> Dziubek, it's only client side. Nobody else sees the mobs you do, and you don't see the ones other people do.
A10:10:54 <VurtualRuler98> You have silly glasses.
A10:11:00 <AlexVMiner> lol koiten
A10:11:03 <AlexVMiner> vurtual
A10:11:09 <AlexVMiner> they are actually dark blue
A10:11:19 <AlexVMiner> those glasses took all of 5 seconds
A10:11:24 <Koitenshin> But I figured a self portrait would improve your drawing and it has
A10:11:32 <AlexVMiner> yes
A10:11:33 <AlexVMiner> it has
A10:11:39 <AlexVMiner> i draw better on paper
A10:11:46 <AlexVMiner> i need to practice with this tablet
A10:12:10 <VurtualRuler98> Can't we just staple him directly on the dartboard?
A10:12:22 <VurtualRuler98> I mean, who needs a drawing?
A10:12:23 <AlexVMiner> i love having a league of haters
A10:12:24 <Koitenshin> I may be an asshole at times but I fight for what i blieve in and try to help people.
A10:12:44 <AlexVMiner> do my bidding

A10:25:24 <asiekierka> you can do this already
A10:25:27 <asiekierka> if you have the binary
A10:25:31 <asiekierka> but you don't
A10:25:33 <asiekierka> so you fail
A10:25:36 <PixelScrooge> my point is an implication of distribution
A10:25:45 <asiekierka> Who banned implications? :P
A10:25:52 <PixelScrooge> and that doesn't even change the fact he distributed it to you
A10:26:01 <asiekierka> but we're both developing it
A10:26:08 <PixelScrooge> distribution!
A10:26:21 <HAL9000> did someone say bootleg?
A10:26:23 <asiekierka> but we do not use it
A10:26:24 <PixelScrooge> "the act of distributing or spreading or apportioning"
A10:26:47 <PixelScrooge> anyway don't take me too seriously
A10:26:55 <asiekierka> good idea =)
A10:27:05 <PixelScrooge> unless I'm actually giving you a proper warning
A10:27:10 <PixelScrooge> there's not going to be anything happening
A10:27:11 <asiekierka> better idea =)
A10:27:12 <PixelScrooge> lololol
A10:27:22 <asiekierka> now give me the best idea
A10:27:26 <PixelScrooge> robots
A10:27:34 <HAL9000> did someone ask for me?
A10:27:54 <asiekierka> that's a very cliche idea, pixelezer scrooge =(
10A10:28:01 * SMP (SMP@68-114-62-5.dhcp.davl.vt.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
A10:28:11 <PixelScrooge> yes but robots is also a flexible one
A10:28:17 <PixelScrooge> oh man
A10:28:20 <PixelScrooge> I  just had a fun idea
A10:28:24 <HAL9000> >_>
A10:28:27 <asiekierka> but good ^= cliche
A10:28:28 <PixelScrooge> when we can properly import our models
A10:28:32 <asiekierka> as in only one of them is true
A10:28:37 <PixelScrooge> incorrect
A10:28:46 <FontPeg> Notch: ETA on Dynamic Lighting in creative update?
A10:28:48 <PixelScrooge> cliche can be perfectly fine
A10:28:53 <HAL9000> If something is good it is obviously repeated
A10:28:54 <08Notch> no eta yet
A10:28:55 <HAL9000> thus cliche
A10:28:56 <PixelScrooge> you just need to know how to DO cliche
A10:28:58 <DragoonEnRegalia> K.
A10:28:58 <FontPeg> k
A10:29:04 <DragoonEnRegalia> KK Slider.
A10:29:13 <asiekierka> No
A10:29:13 <asiekierka> when something is repeated, Hal
A10:29:13 <asiekierka> it becomes cliche
A10:29:16 <asiekierka> and stops being good
A10:29:20 <asiekierka> being good implies uniqueness
A10:29:21 <HAL9000> Not always
A10:29:25 <asiekierka> a lot of times
A10:29:27 <vede> No it doesn't.
A10:29:32 <vede> It just implies that it's good.
A10:29:35 <DragoonEnRegalia> Then explain what a convention is.
A10:29:45 <vede> You can be good and cliche at the same time.
A10:29:50 <HAL9000> like Elves
A10:29:56 <HAL9000> and robots
A10:29:57 <DragoonEnRegalia> It's called a convention.
A10:29:58 <asiekierka> Elves are real
A10:30:02 <asiekierka> Robots are in development
A10:30:09 <HAL9000> 7 year ear surgery doesnt count
A10:30:14 <asiekierka> i know
A10:30:17 <vede> Zombies are cliche, but Left 4 Dead is apparently an extremely good game.
A10:30:20 <asiekierka> i mean not ear surgery
A10:30:21 <DragoonEnRegalia> Yes.

A10:30:49 <DragoonEnRegalia> That's why I play Minecraft.
A10:30:55 <HAL9000> Well.....you could have done a lot better in that amount of time.

A10:34:33 <AlexVMiner> i ain't on nospace ship
A10:34:33 <asiekierka> let's just pretend the question never happened
A10:34:43 <PixelScrooge> <@vede> Zombies are cliche, but Left 4 Dead is apparently an extremely good game.
A10:34:48 <PixelScrooge> think of it this way
A10:34:50 <AlexVMiner> what question?
A10:34:52 <PixelScrooge> evil dead is cliche as FUCK
A10:34:59 <HAL9000> But still good.
A10:35:01 <PixelScrooge> evil dead is the greatest shit to ever grace the earth
A10:35:08 <asiekierka> swear words are cliche and not good
A10:35:10 <AlexVMiner> by L4D2 question was a joke
A10:35:13 <asiekierka> nice comparision, ebenezer
A10:35:19 <AlexVMiner> >:D
A10:35:24 <AlexVMiner> ba humbug
A10:35:26 <PixelScrooge> my point is basically this
A10:35:33 <PixelScrooge> if you are deliberately being cliche
A10:35:41 <PixelScrooge> there isn't a problem as long as you know what you're doing
13A10:35:52 * asiekierka is deliberately cliche. =0
A10:36:03 <vede> If you do something cliche and try to say it's new or innovative, you're just being stupid.
A10:36:12 <PixelScrooge> yes
A10:36:14 <PixelScrooge> or uncreative
A10:36:31 <HAL9000> James Cameron anyone?
A10:36:45 <vede> :( I like James Cameron

A10:36:57 <asiekierka> this will decide which line of my code for the renderer is leaked

A10:37:02 <asiekierka> 53 it is then

A10:37:25 <asiekierka> here you go
A10:37:34 <vede> Why not just make it open source?
A10:37:38 <asiekierka> not yet
A10:37:48 <vede> All the cool people are doing open source.
A10:37:51 <asiekierka> i know
A10:37:54 <asiekierka> i said "not yet"
A10:37:59 <HAL9000> She's one of those dang close-minded people.
A10:38:03 <asiekierka> i am a he
A10:38:10 <asiekierka> by "not yet" i mean "you need jte's to make any use of it"
A10:38:11 <HAL9000> whoops
A10:38:20 <HAL9000> All you humans look alike to me.
A10:38:24 <asiekierka> "therefore it's useless for everyone except like... 9... people"
A10:38:53 <asiekierka> "i want to code it so it can parse java class data"
10A10:39:31 * Gyllen is now known as Gyllenb
A10:39:40 <asiekierka> "or at least make an app that runs a .jar to convert it"
A10:40:13 <vede> I should make a Minecraft isometric level renderer.
A10:40:24 <vede> As far as I know, the only one we have right now is Windows only.
A10:40:33 <DragoonEnRegalia> We need one for Linux and Mac.
A10:40:38 <asiekierka> i made one, vede
A10:40:42 <asiekierka> and it's multiplatform
A10:40:47 <asiekierka> you don
A10:40:54 <asiekierka> you don't even need a platform (when it goes online)
A10:41:02 <HAL9000> Yeah except yours is't useable yet
A10:41:12 <asiekierka> yes it is, the code i need to add is not that much
13A10:41:15 * HAL9000 cheers for vede.
A10:41:32 <vede> And you said it's JTE only.
A10:41:36 <asiekierka> uh
A10:41:44 <asiekierka> JTE supplied an app to convert server_level.dat's to JTE format
A10:41:59 <HAL9000> I am definitely malfunctioning, cheering for a human.
A10:42:06 <vede> ... So... why not just use the standard server_level.dat?
A10:42:13 <vede> You know, so normal people can use it.
A10:42:37 <HAL9000> It sounds incredibly closed minded to me.
A10:42:47 <asiekierka> vede
A10:42:54 <asiekierka> server_level.dat = learning java serialized class format
A10:43:00 <asiekierka> jte's = learning the exec command
A10:43:03 <vede> Not really.
A10:43:09 <asiekierka> yes
A10:43:12 <asiekierka> there's an app
A10:43:14 <asiekierka> mapconv.jar
A10:43:18 <asiekierka> that takes the server_level.dat
A10:43:21 <vede> Dude.
A10:43:22 <asiekierka> turns it into converted_level.gz
A10:43:30 <vede> I meant server_level.dat is NOT hard to use.
A10:43:35 <asiekierka> in Java
A10:43:39 <asiekierka> i dont know the least bit of it
A10:43:48 <vede> I don't know Java at all.
A10:43:57 <asiekierka> so how do you use it
A10:43:58 <vede> But server_level.dat is still easy as pie.
A10:44:19 <asiekierka> my friend RE'd the serialized class format, rotfl
A10:44:20 <vede> There's a header, a huge-ass block of data (gee, wonder what that is) and then a footer.
A10:44:33 <vede> So guess what you need to do?
A10:44:41 <asiekierka> read X Y Z from header
A10:44:43 <asiekierka> find the block
A10:44:45 <asiekierka> read the block
A10:44:49 <asiekierka> kill myself
A10:44:50 <asiekierka> output
A10:45:00 <vede> asiekierka, you obviously have no business coding.
A10:45:14 <asiekierka> why
A10:45:16 <asiekierka> what's YOUR way
A10:45:22 <AlexVMiner> well

A10:45:54 <asiekierka> That's what I did! :O
A10:46:09 <vede> So you know how to read server_level.dat!
A10:46:31 <vede> It's easy!
A10:47:36 <asiekierka> yes

A11:25:10 <citricsquid> yeah, as soon as I don't need them they start appearing
A11:25:19 <revenant> vede, you could just check the players.txt
A11:25:20 <revenant> > >
A11:25:23 <asiekierka> actually the reading does not work as well anymore
A11:25:32 <revenant> asie, how are you reading it?
A11:25:38 <vede> revenant, my server isn't up, and players.txt has sixteen lines.
A11:25:41 <revenant> I imagine its not overly complex. 
A11:25:49 <vede> The max player count is EIGHT.
A11:25:54 <revenant> ?
A11:25:59 <revenant> ooo k?
A11:26:05 <revenant> anyhow asie, sounds cool.
A11:26:08 <revenant> Where are you hosting it?
A11:26:09 <vede> So... players.txt is broken.
A11:26:22 <revenant> it should keep track of players. :|
A11:26:30 <vede> I host in my desktop, but still.
A11:26:34 <Aeomin> players.txt was never accurate for me
A11:26:39 <mloc> Or me
A11:26:42 <asiekierka> well, revenant
A11:26:46 <vede> Max players is eight, so having more than eight in players.txt should be technically impossible.
A11:26:47 <asiekierka> the app?
A11:26:49 <revenant> Yeah.
A11:26:51 <asiekierka> it'll be up to use online soon
A11:26:57 <revenant> So its in php?
A11:26:59 <asiekierka> yes
A11:27:03 <asiekierka> so youll be able to like
A11:27:06 <asiekierka> send it a .dat or a .mine
A11:27:06 <revenant> How are you gunzipping it?
A11:27:10 <asiekierka> ...
A11:27:11 <asiekierka> i'm not
A11:27:15 <revenant> :|
A11:27:17 <asiekierka> php provides functions to read from gz files directly
A11:27:20 <revenant> Ah okay.
A11:27:24 <asiekierka> like gzopen instead of fopen
A11:27:25 <revenant> A gz stream, like javas.
A11:27:29 <asiekierka> and gzgets instead of fgets
A11:27:34 <revenant> ah okay.
A11:27:45 <revenant> I imagine those have some overhead though.

A11:28:01 <revenant> Wouldnt it be easier to gunzip it, do what you will, and then erase the files?
A11:28:01 <asiekierka> yes
A11:28:07 <revenant> backticks and such.
A11:28:10 <asiekierka> but gunzipping would be slower IMHO
A11:28:15 <revenant> hm
A11:28:43 <revenant> Well I've never written php :|
A11:29:02 <revenant> Just make sure it can do a 256 relatively quick
A11:29:10 <asiekierka> haha
A11:29:16 <asiekierka> it takes it 50 seconds to do a 128
A11:29:20 <revenant> thats not bad.
A11:29:28 <revenant> I mean, I don't know how that compares,
A11:29:32 <revenant> but it doesnt sound unreasonably.
A11:29:33 <revenant> e*

A11:30:45 <asiekierka> rendering is not so promising

A11:30:50 <asiekierka> PHP
A11:30:50 <asiekierka> and gd
A11:30:54 <revenant> tga would be my first choice.
A11:30:58 <asiekierka> png
A11:31:12 <revenant> png is a great format but I've never liked loading/writing it.
A11:31:16 <revenant> tga is so easy > > 
A11:31:18 <asiekierka> rendering - 1 minute for a very block-full image
A11:31:26 <revenant> But its a bigger file I guess...
A11:31:31 <revenant> Well how could you optimize it?
A11:31:35 <asiekierka> png conversion - 10 seconds or so
A11:31:36 <asiekierka> WELL
A11:31:38 <asiekierka> i am optimizing it
A11:31:44 <revenant> But how?
A11:31:46 <asiekierka> by not rendering hidden blocks
A11:31:50 <revenant> culling
A11:31:57 <asiekierka> yes
A11:31:59 <revenant> that would save you a lot of time heh.

A11:34:45 <asiekierka> how
A11:34:49 <asiekierka> well mine is
A11:34:52 <revenant> It's just adjusting the camera and taking a picture.
A11:34:55 <asiekierka> it takes a blockmap
A11:34:59 <asiekierka> a color palette
A11:35:04 <asiekierka> and combines them by copying and recolouring
A11:35:07 <asiekierka> to create this

A11:35:43 <mail2345> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4983
A11:35:43 <asiekierka> Notch: would you use this quick isometric renderer to generate map snapshots when you load your maps in the "Load map..." menu?
A11:35:51 <vede> revenant, it is a renderer.
A11:36:01 <asiekierka> vede, i think it's a snapshotter
A11:36:01 <revenant> I mean, it doesnt rerender.
A11:36:04 <revenant> Its a snapshotter.
A11:36:06 <revenant> Without a doubt.
A11:36:09 <PixelScrooge> oh man
A11:36:13 <vede> Which means it RENDERS something.
A11:36:18 <revenant> Yeah yeah
A11:36:20 <revenant> terminology.
A11:36:26 <asiekierka> if rendering is "change camera angle, take a snapshot, output a PNG file"
A11:36:39 <revenant> well, changing the camera angle requires rerendering.
A11:36:44 <asiekierka> also mine is quite flexible
A11:36:49 <revenant> Rendering is just drawing to the screen.
A11:36:50 <asiekierka> i could make it work with other formats
A11:36:58 <revenant> Do it asie! do it!
A11:36:59 <PuyoDead> Well, off to the parent's place for xmas-ness.
