A12:00:41 <Visiiri> You know what, vede
A12:00:55 <Visiiri> You make me remember what happened to my head.
A12:00:59 <Visiiri> I appreciate that.
A12:01:00 <vede> ?
A12:01:05 <vede> Huh?
12A12:01:18 * Daidoji (hurf@208-114-32-77.dyn.hsi.pldi.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
13A12:01:32 * vede still can't tell if that's good or bad.
A12:01:33 <Visiiri> Well, it was a while ago and is irrelevent, but an injury caused me to loose my sense of touch in my left arm
A12:01:37 <Visiiri> Electric shock.
A12:01:41 <Visiiri> >.<
A12:01:51 <vede> That... sucks.
A12:01:54 <Visiiri> It wore off about three months later
A12:01:57 <Visiiri> but I could've died.
A12:01:58 <fenixfurion> o.o
A12:02:02 <vede> O_O
A12:02:09 <Visiiri> Would you like to hear the story, or should I tell my point first?
13A12:02:13 * vede really can't tell if this is good or bad.
A12:02:17 <fenixfurion> story!
A12:02:18 <fenixfurion> :D
A12:02:20 <Visiiri> Vede, it's great.
A12:02:21 <Visiiri> Alright
A12:02:21 <fenixfurion> and pain
A12:02:21 <TestDummy> Remember kids, electricity isn't your friend.
A12:02:24 <Visiiri> lol
A12:02:25 <vede> Go ahead with the story.
A12:02:32 <TestDummy> Well okay, yes it is. It is if you play nice.
A12:02:33 <Visiiri> It was in DownTown Boise
A12:02:38 <TestDummy> lol boise
A12:02:39 <Visiiri> Febuary 2007, I think
A12:02:42 <Visiiri> maybe 2008
A12:02:42 <TestDummy> NOTHING there.
A12:02:46 <Visiiri> sthu
A12:02:47 <Visiiri> i live there
A12:02:48 <Visiiri> :D
A12:02:54 <TestDummy> Look
A12:02:58 <TestDummy> Thanks for the potatos.
A12:03:00 <Visiiri> We have green electrical boxes lining the streets
A12:03:01 <TestDummy> But Idaho's a bore.
A12:03:11 <Visiiri> A minivan had hit one earlier
A12:03:14 <Visiiri> i was skating in the area
A12:03:20 <Visiiri> SkateBoarding, i should say
A12:03:24 <fenixfurion> mm
A12:03:29 <Visiiri> This particular box was between two long rails
A12:03:33 <Visiiri> downhill
A12:03:35 <Siiseli> what is this my eyes pray, non-idiotic conversation?
A12:03:45 <vede> Siiseli, of course!
A12:03:48 <Siiseli> madness.
A12:03:50 <Visiiri> Outside some sort of office building, i think.
A12:03:50 <fenixfurion> shhh, he's telling a story.
A12:03:58 <vede> Oh yeah and Super-Dot made a couple ops.
A12:04:03 <Siiseli> I notice.
A12:04:05 <vede> But let Vis finish the story first!
A12:04:11 <Siiseli> jah
A12:04:20 <Visiiri> I had no idea the electric box was damaged, so I decided- "Hey, this would be an epic spot!"
A12:04:22 <Visiiri> I was wrong.
A12:04:25 <fenixfurion> whoever hasn't seen these
A12:04:27 <fenixfurion> this*
A12:04:29 <fenixfurion> http://filesmelt.com/downloader/HPBar.gif
A12:04:31 <fenixfurion> o.o
A12:04:35 <fenixfurion> pain for visiiri
A12:04:37 <Visiiri> I cleared the box the first time.
A12:04:45 <Visiiri> Then I decided to 360 it.
A12:04:47 <fenixfurion> you got electrocuted the 2nd?
A12:05:00 <Visiiri> I would've made it, but some dumbass in a white suit ran in between the rails
A12:05:10 <Visiiri> I clipped his head with my trucks, and I fell.
A12:05:14 <Visiiri> On the box.
A12:05:26 <Visiiri> It was damaged from that minivan, and too many things touched when I hit.
A12:05:27 <Siiseli> nice
A12:05:36 <fenixfurion> o.o
A12:05:37 <Visiiri> My left shoulder drilled into it, then the shock drilled into my brain.
A12:05:41 <fenixfurion> :O
A12:05:45 <Siiseli> delightful
A12:05:56 <Visiiri> I was unconsious. My friend kept the camera on me in the ambulence :D 
A12:06:01 <fenixfurion> lolz
A12:06:14 <Visiiri> CPR the whole way there.
A12:06:24 <Visiiri> I woke up in my hospital bed.
A12:06:31 <Visiiri> I couldn't move my left arm at all
A12:06:34 <Siiseli> your friend knows what matters.
A12:06:42 <Visiiri> I thought it was broken or something.
A12:06:49 <Siiseli> hoho, yeah
A12:06:55 <Siiseli> sounds like a delightful experience
A12:06:59 <fenixfurion> well
A12:07:01 <fenixfurion> off to sleep
A12:07:05 <Visiiri> I couldn't move it for a while
A12:07:06 <fenixfurion> and time to lose the +v
A12:07:08 <fenixfurion> :P
A12:07:12 <fenixfurion> i lost the contest
10A12:07:22 * fenixfurion is now known as fenixfurion|zzzz
A12:07:28 <vede> (Siiseli, I would have appreciated it. I HATE not knowing what I look like when I'm undergoing medical treatment. I even asked my foot surgeons to remove the cover so I could see them do everything.)
A12:07:32 <Visiiri> in that time, when I saw the video, the doctor told me that if I had been wearing a coat with the metal zipper, it could've killed me.
A12:07:48 <fenixfurion|zzzz> o.o
A12:07:50 <Siiseli> vede, you're a weird person
A12:07:50 <fenixfurion|zzzz> !
A12:08:02 <Siiseli> though I would've wanted to see what I looked like when Ihad a seizure once
A12:08:11 <fenixfurion|zzzz> o.o
A12:08:11 <Siiseli> hit my head on the corner of the desk when coming down
A12:08:14 <fenixfurion|zzzz> !
A12:08:15 <Visiiri> My mortality sent me into shock, I guess, then depression.
A12:08:23 <fenixfurion|zzzz> =\
A12:08:27 <Visiiri> I didn't kill myself though :D
A12:08:29 <Siiseli> blood everywhere
A12:08:35 <vede> (I figured you had.)
A12:08:37 <fenixfurion|zzzz> whose heard of shingles
A12:08:40 <Siiseli> Visiiri, isn't it wonderful to realize you're mortal
A12:08:41 <fenixfurion|zzzz> the disease
A12:08:57 <Siiseli> nope
A12:09:00 <fenixfurion|zzzz> \=
A12:09:09 <Visiiri> It's really not
A12:09:14 <vede> So Vis, what happened next?
12A12:09:19 * Cial (chatzilla@dialup-4.88.13.133.Dial1.Atlanta1.Level3.net) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5.2/20090729225027])
A12:09:26 <Visiiri> Well, I spent a few months learning how to control my arm
A12:09:36 <Siiseli> he became afraid of going out and came to irc?
A12:09:36 <Visiiri> and I grew.
A12:09:37 <Siiseli> oh
A12:09:51 <vede> (Grew, physically?)
A12:09:58 <Visiiri> As childish as I may act now, it was different then
A12:09:59 <fenixfurion|zzzz> mentally
A12:10:10 <Visiiri> Everything had substance, no matter how small
A12:10:21 <Visiiri> I tied my shoes for the first time in... 4 years I think.
A12:10:25 <Visiiri> It took me a few tries, lol
A12:10:27 <fenixfurion|zzzz> goodbye +v
A12:10:29 <Siiseli> nice :3
10A12:10:30 * fenixfurion|zzzz (chatzilla@74-140-206-154.dhcp.insightbb.com) has left #minecraft
A12:10:42 <Visiiri> Well, I became more of what I am today
A12:10:45 <Visiiri> from what I wass
A12:10:55 <Siiseli> I suppose you just learn to appreciate your body more after that, e
A12:10:56 <Siiseli> eh
A12:11:09 <Siiseli> I'd suppose
A12:11:12 <Visiiri> It was a huge step up from the smartass, rebel, punk, asshole that I was
A12:11:17 <Siiseli> :D hehe
A12:11:19 <Visiiri> ...Strange
A12:11:24 <Siiseli> rebeling against nothing, right?
A12:11:29 <Visiiri> I guess so.
A12:11:37 <Siiseli> being different - just like everyone else.
12A12:11:42 * LG_Legacy_The_sarcastic (Slizard@66-227-202-118.dhcp.bycy.mi.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:11:46 <Visiiri> Amazing how that works out.
A12:12:15 <Visiiri> Our differences are judged by the way we go about them
A12:12:21 <Visiiri> Cockieness can be a good thing.
A12:12:28 <Visiiri> It can also make you a jackass.
A12:12:32 <Siiseli> depends
A12:12:42 <Visiiri> Yes, exactly.
A12:12:49 <Siiseli> cockyness is usually assholery
A12:12:57 <Visiiri> Anyway- I think I will try to... greater myself now.
A12:13:04 <Siiseli> I mean a good self esteem is different from cockyness
A12:13:21 <vede> So Vis, I made you think of all that?
A12:13:21 <Siiseli> Visiiri, try reading "Awareness" by Anthony da mello
A12:13:26 <Siiseli> or was it de mello
A12:13:39 <Siiseli> Visiiri, for mental growth. Have fun
A12:13:46 <Visiiri> ..Alllright
A12:13:52 <Visiiri> But I
A12:13:53 <Visiiri> err
A12:14:00 <Siiseli> it's a short little booklet
A12:14:02 <Visiiri> But I'm saying, I get to lax when I'm around people I know
A12:14:05 <Siiseli> like 160 pages.
A12:14:15 <Visiiri> I become a douche or a child.
A12:14:22 <Siiseli> ;p
A12:14:29 <Visiiri> lol you've seen it.
A12:14:36 <Siiseli> how bout.. don't?
A12:14:42 <vede> ^^
A12:14:49 <vede> >.>
A12:14:54 <Siiseli> tadaa, problem solved. Next patient

A12:15:43 <Siiseli> hoho
A12:15:57 <Siiseli> but yeah, read awareness. No, really, read it
A12:16:03 <Visiiri> Hmmkay
A12:16:18 <Visiiri> Author?
A12:16:19 <Siiseli> don't say you will and forget it, go to your local library and make a reservation or pick it up as soon as ye can
A12:16:21 <vede> I never had the problem of being a douche or a child or a retard or anything. Unless you count the first 12 or so years of my life, but I don't count those. >.>
A12:16:25 <Siiseli> Anthony Da mello
A12:16:27 <Siiseli> or de mello
A12:16:48 <Siiseli> vede, well that is when everyone's a douche, child and a retard
A12:17:00 <vede> Yeah...
A12:17:12 <Siiseli> my class at school is a bunch of retards'
A12:17:22 <Siiseli> and they're like 19
A12:17:27 <vede> Up till about... five-ish, I'm okay with. Because I was a toddler and all that.
A12:17:41 <Siiseli> it's all cockjokes and retarded /b/ stuff
A12:17:52 <Visiiri> Eww. 4chan.
A12:17:58 <vede> 6-8-ish is a gray zone. 10 and up I feel awful about.
A12:18:03 <Super-Dot> I don't think anyone would argue that I'm still a child
A12:18:10 <Siiseli> but Awareness taught me that I don't have to look for bad things in others when I can just improve myself in such ways that my surroundings will not disturb me ;P
A12:18:13 <vede> 13 and past I'm proud of myself.
A12:18:29 <Siiseli> I'm proud of what I've become, looking at people around me
A12:18:33 <Visiiri> Perhaps...
A12:18:42 <Siiseli> it seems I turned out ok
A12:18:49 <Visiiri> Would me saying that I'm not sixteen; i'm really, say, 13, change anything?
A12:19:08 <Siiseli> well, people would treat you differently. that's the way it goes
A12:19:12 <Super-Dot> You would seem like an unusually mature 13-year-old
A12:19:16 <Siiseli> yeah
A12:19:19 <vede> Honestly, I don't care much about age.
A12:19:25 <Visiiri> I like that about you.
A12:19:30 <Visiiri> Does everyone know Injex?
A12:19:42 <vede> When I reference age, if I ever do, I'm referencing level of maturity.
A12:19:53 <Siiseli> yeah
A12:19:54 <vede> I've seen Injex around here.
A12:20:03 <Siiseli> me too
10A12:20:09 * oredds (oredds@student-3.networking.otago.ac.nz) has left #minecraft
A12:20:13 <Visiiri> Unfortunate you don't know him.
A12:20:19 <Visiiri> He can be a bit annoying, but he's brilliant.
A12:20:27 <Visiiri> And I think he's eleven D:
A12:20:45 <Visiiri> _I_ look up to this kid.
A12:21:06 <DarkCybrid> im 4
A12:21:08 <Visiiri> ...Although I don't know why that's relevant.
A12:21:09 <DarkCybrid> what the fuck is this
A12:21:14 <Parthon> Siiseli: what's awareness about?
A12:21:20 <Visiiri> I have to "powder my nose"
A12:21:59 <Misterangry> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=30648#p30648
A12:22:12 <vede> I'd say I'm just hitting that particularly rebellious stage now.
A12:23:52 <Super-Dot> Haha, Misterangry, that's brilliant
A12:24:08 <Misterangry> :3
A12:24:12 <Siiseli> Parthon, it's a collection of lectures.
A12:24:38 <Siiseli> basically about mental/spiritual growth(not some new age crap, nothing like that)
A12:25:05 <Siiseli> a really good read
A12:25:36 <Visiiri> I've always found the most relevant quote possible would be "There will always be people that get under your skin."
A12:25:57 <vede> "... and you are free to murder those people."
A12:26:00 <vede> Wait.
A12:26:03 <Visiiri> No.
A12:26:03 <Siiseli> now I'll bugger off to school
A12:26:06 <vede> Yeah, that sounds right.
A12:26:10 <Siiseli> you keep it classy.
A12:26:14 <vede> Wait Siiseli!
A12:26:15 <Visiiri> Later, Siiseli.
A12:26:23 <Siiseli> vede, yes?
A12:26:25 <vede> You need to make a ruling on my ops.
A12:26:28 <vede> Please!
A12:26:36 <vede> I hate this! I'm so off-and-on!
13A12:26:36 * Visiiri shoves a pillowcase over vede's head and hits him with a bat.
A12:26:52 <Super-Dot> On! On!
A12:26:58 <Visiiri> And me?
A12:26:59 <Visiiri> :D:D
10A12:27:05 * Super-Dot sets mode: +v Visiiri
A12:27:08 <Visiiri> eww no
A12:27:10 <Visiiri> wait yes
A12:27:12 <vede> Super-Dot and LG both think I should be op.
A12:27:23 <vede> (Wait. LG isn't op anymore. Nevermind that.)
A12:27:33 <Super-Dot> LG isn't op anymore? :O
A12:27:38 <vede> Super and Dot both think I should be op.
A12:27:47 <Siiseli> there.
A12:27:52 <Visiiri> I like LG. I just don't like how blunt he is.
A12:27:54 <Siiseli> I'm off
A12:27:59 <Visiiri> Later, mate.
A12:28:04 <vede> :( Goodbye...

A12:29:51 <Visiiri> see look

A12:30:00 <Visiiri> Now you do :D
A12:30:01 <stupinator> :3
A12:30:20 <stupinator> ooh, family guy's on :>
A12:30:52 <Visiiri> It's too bad you only got to meet my brother briefly.
A12:31:07 <vede> Who's your brother?
A12:31:07 <stupinator> but what a meeting it was
A12:31:21 <Visiiri> Espionage is what he goes by
A12:31:24 <Visiiri> his name is Alex though
A12:31:33 <vede> Never met this Espionage character.
A12:31:40 <Visiiri> Hmmm
A12:31:55 <Visiiri> Well, he goes to an "away school" 
A12:32:04 <Visiiri> So he doesn't get internets.
A12:32:24 <Visiiri> But, somehow, they caught him with cigarettes.
A12:32:36 <stupinator> wish I had a cig :/
A12:32:36 <Visiiri> For once I wasn't the bad influence :D
A12:32:44 <stupinator> o/
A12:32:53 <Visiiri> lol
A12:32:59 <Visiiri> I don't smoke in front of family.
A12:33:40 <vede> I never understood smoking.
10A12:34:00 * Super-Dot sets mode: +v AlLnAtuRalX
A12:34:04 <Visiiri> I didn't either.
A12:34:04 <Super-Dot> Dang
A12:34:07 <Visiiri> Then I tried it.
A12:34:19 <vede> As far as I know, cigarettes don't have any sort of high attached to them.

A12:34:51 <Visiiri> Are you using mIRC?
A12:34:58 <Super-Dot> Nope, Colloquy
A12:34:59 <stupinator> vede: minor head rush, but nicotene is a stimulant
A12:35:03 <Visiiri> Eh
A12:35:08 <Visiiri> I'd write you a script
A12:35:10 <DarkCybrid> WHOA
A12:35:14 <stupinator> if you want to try it without the harmful shit, try an e-cig
A12:35:16 <Visiiri> but I'm low on SoBe and Pepsi
A12:35:30 <DarkCybrid> I was just going to steal one of my bro's cigarettes this weekend and try it
A12:35:31 <vede> stimulant of what?
A12:35:33 <DarkCybrid> weird
A12:35:35 <Super-Dot> I don't suppose there's a Chanserv command to +v everyone or anything?
A12:35:51 <stupinator> er... mood, awakeness, idk
A12:35:52 <Visiiri> I don't believe so
A12:35:53 <vede> Super-Dot, why would you do that?
A12:35:55 <Visiiri> but I could make one
A12:35:58 <stupinator> I just know it's a stimulant
A12:36:01 <stupinator> like cocain
A12:36:02 <stupinator> :>
A12:36:11 <Visiiri> Fuck you druggy.
A12:36:15 <Super-Dot> Nah, Visiiri, don't bother
A12:36:18 <gm|lap> Super-Dot: +vvv
A12:36:19 <Visiiri> You remind me of TestVan :D
A12:36:21 <stupinator> I actually don't do any drugs
A12:36:27 <vede> Are you sure it's a stimulant, chemically, or a stimulat due to the taboos connected with it?

A12:36:44 <stupinator> no, it's chemically

A12:36:56 <vede> Because mood and awakeness sound like the same things that come from doing something that's been demonized so harshly like cigarettes.

A12:45:48 <Visiiri> What else will I do?
A12:45:52 <Meizlizard> You're going to kill yourself!
A12:45:54 <vede> Math and English class, then an hour-and-a-half bus ride, then a few hours later, another hour-long bus ride.
A12:46:10 <vede> Half my day every day is spent on a bus.
A12:46:28 <Visiiri> Exciting.

A12:48:29 <emgmod> That's what I'm doing.
A12:48:32 <Visiiri> I like the line- "You look bored."
A12:48:35 <Meizlizard> Print out a transcript of this chat and sneak it to her.
A12:48:40 <Visiiri> But it only works sometimes
A12:48:59 <Visiiri> Vede- age? You and her..
A12:48:59 <emgmod> I'll try it if I give up.
A12:49:00 <vede> "You look bored" is actually a great conversation-starter, in my experience.
A12:49:06 <vede> Me, 16, her, 17.
A12:49:13 <Visiiri> ahh
A12:49:32 <vede> I hadn't though of "you look bored" though.
A12:49:38 <Meizlizard> Do you have a bunch of ROP courses vede?
A12:49:40 <emgmod> Move both ages down one year and that's what I'm planning.
A12:49:45 <emgmod> What's ROP?
A12:49:45 <vede> I start most every conversation with that.
A12:50:08 <vede> Meizlizard, we spend ~2.5 hours every single day on a bus.
A12:50:10 <Visiiri> Or ask to borrow her cellphone
A12:50:11 <Meizlizard> They're classes you take outside of your school
A12:50:19 <vede> And yeah.
A12:50:21 <Visiiri> Hey, I forgot my phone, can I make a quick call?
A12:50:24 <Meizlizard> Ah.
A12:50:26 <Visiiri> "sure"
A12:50:32 <vede> I go to another city and take networking classes.
A12:50:45 <Meizlizard> That's pretty sweet.
A12:50:59 <emgmod> I hate living on an island.
A12:51:03 <Meizlizard> I'm thinking of doing ROP game design next year.
A12:51:06 <vede> By the end of high school, assuming I don't drop out or anything, I'll have my CCNP.

A12:51:11 <emgmod> Yes?
A12:51:17 <vede> Average salary = 90k a year.
A12:51:26 <emgmod> I hate living on a *small* island.
A12:51:29 <vede> emgmod lives on a particularly small island.
A12:51:33 <Visiiri> Where?
A12:51:37 <Visiiri> NewZealand isn't small

P3:04:16 <stupinator> I didn't type it in time unfortunetally
P3:04:27 <Injex> Anyone need somewhere to advertise your server?
P3:04:29 <bildramer> that would be cool - an IP banlist
P3:05:02 <Darkebrz> No it wouldn't
P3:05:07 <Darkebrz> Ban lists are all horrible ideas
P3:05:24 <bildramer> why?

P3:05:57 <gm|lap> you could theorerically do something that WoM does, but without requiring registration
P3:06:04 <Darkebrz> They all end with people getting banned unfairly (people that are known to be good players). They get banned from a server without doing anything.

P3:07:28 <Animator> All bans have different reasons.
P3:07:29 <bildramer> then, ok.
P3:07:42 <Animator> You see, bildramer, a server is like a country.
P3:08:01 <Animator> They all have different variations of the rules, some more loose than others.
P3:08:28 <Animator> A person could theoritcally grief one server and become friends with another.

P3:10:02 <bildramer> :D
P3:10:26 <Animator> The only way banlists could ever be remotely effective is if every single server had the same carbon copy rules, all enforced by one supreme ruler.
P3:10:31 <Animator> And that isn't happening.
P3:10:41 <Animator> And it would -still- be flawed.

P4:07:26 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: even worse
P4:07:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's based on Ubuntu but it's nice and sugarcoated with some utilities
P4:07:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Schoko, not for noobs it ain't
P4:07:44 <Snowman> Sounds like a type of mint candy
P4:07:50 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: I like the own stuff they did... but the rest is just uhm.. I dunno
P4:08:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's the best looking distro (in aesthetics) out there ATM
P4:08:09 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: With all the codecs and stuff
P4:08:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Unless you count the Enlightenment crap, which I don't like
P4:08:16 <Siiseli> I wonder what distro would be good for a web server.. :p
P4:08:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, Debian Stable, CentOS, RHEL
P4:08:32 <Schoko> Debian - Arch - Gentoo -CentOS or go for FreeBSD
P4:08:34 <Siiseli> nyeah, debian sounds good.
P4:08:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> no arch
P4:08:40 <Quatroking> knoppix ftw
P4:08:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> You don't want rolling release on a server
P4:08:45 <Quatroking> best livecd ever
P4:08:47 <Schoko> well
P4:08:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> You want something with a long release cycle that will just sit there and never break
P4:08:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's *not* Arch
P4:08:59 <Schoko> you can fix it :)
P4:09:04 <Marach> i just like to know what i have, so im against 699mb iso images packing everything it could... maybe thats just my HD managing ideology
P4:09:16 <Schoko> you don't have to upgrade stuff you know.
P4:09:18 <Marach> which is a bit different
P4:09:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, you do Schoko 
P4:09:27 <Schoko> also: There are situations you want that.
P4:09:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> But only for security issues, etc
P4:09:32 <Evil-Ville> Heh "HD managing ideology"
P4:09:33 <lobster> anyone know what firing arrows in adventure is in Mac OSX? Tab doesn't work here for me
P4:09:39 <Schoko> Like a testing server.
P4:09:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't think there's anybody advocating Arch on the server for production :P
P4:09:49 <Marach> Evil-Ville: you know what i mean 8D
P4:09:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's a great distro, but it has no place on the server
P4:09:57 <Schoko> no one said something about a production server
P4:10:00 <Super-Dot> lobster: Option-Tab
P4:10:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also, Gentoo is awful on the server IMO
10P4:10:09 * calzoneman (Mibbit@user-0c6smkg.cable.mindspring.com) has joined #minecraft
P4:10:12 <Super-Dot> Notch is aware that it's like that
P4:10:29 <Siiseli> I'll go for Debian.
P4:10:29 <Super-Dot> Eventually arrows will be fired from a bow item, and the problem will go away
P4:10:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think you're best off with RHEL, CentOS, or Debian
P4:10:32 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: Go for your beloved Ubuntu :P
P4:10:34 <lobster> aye, thanks
P4:10:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Debian Stable though
P4:10:42 <Siiseli> yes,.
P4:10:45 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: Don't forget FreeBSD :D
P4:10:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I do use Ubuntu on the server (and Fedora/Ubuntu/Arch on the desktop), but I prefer those 3
P4:10:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> FreeBSD ain't a Linux distro
P4:10:58 <Siiseli> I currently use mah windows machine for my possible server needs
P4:11:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which is what he asked for
P4:11:08 <Schoko> well, still a good hint
P4:11:08 <citricsquid> centos4life
P4:11:11 <Siiseli> and I'm sick of the level of control I have over this darned machine
P4:11:21 <Siiseli> from outside.
P4:11:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Windows on the server is 100% the dumbest thing IMO
P4:11:43 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, it's not really a server.
P4:11:43 <Schoko> No.
P4:11:50 <Siiseli> I mean I just set up apache for web dev purposes
P4:11:54 <Siiseli> so I could test websites quick
P4:11:57 <Siiseli> without uploading
P4:12:05 <Siiseli> then I installed ftp for remotely adding stuff
P4:12:07 <Marach> i consider ubuntu overcomplicated and hdfilling
P4:12:13 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: A good Windows Server Admin can do the same stuff on the same level as a Linux admin
P4:12:15 <citricsquid> never used windows as a server, fancy trying it some time but not right now :D
P4:12:21 <calzoneman> I prefer fedora
P4:12:22 <Siiseli> then I made my music dir public for myself
P4:12:26 <Marach> i prefer to know what i have on my drive
P4:12:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Schoko, nooobody serious uses Windows on the server
P4:12:30 <Siiseli> so I can access it from other places.
P4:12:37 <Marach> especially when i have 15 gb
P4:12:37 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: Microsoft does
P4:12:40 <Siiseli> then I set up some game servers for school
P4:12:42 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: lol?
P4:12:48 <citricsquid> There are many companies using it
P4:12:53 <Siiseli> but if I REALLY had a server for any real/heavy use
P4:12:53 <Schoko> AlLnAtuRalX: They use ISS and apache2 :D
P4:12:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, and they're full of problems
P4:12:55 <Marach> sadly
P4:12:56 <Siiseli> I'd just set up a linux
P4:12:59 <Siiseli> which is why I'm getting one
P4:13:15 <Siiseli> at some point
P4:13:19 <Super-Dot> StackOverflow uses Windows on their servers
P4:13:28 <Schoko> Siiseli: train at home
P4:13:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, my dad works at a bank, so I correspond via mail with people from Google, Goldman Sachs (whatever's left of it, etc)... basically one of these companies decided to migrate to Exchange for e-mail (from an OSS solution)
P4:13:46 <Siiseli> Schoko, excuse me?
P4:13:48 <Siiseli> train what at home
P4:13:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> They went from 5 servers to 60, the mail is always down, and people are using the phones for the first time, and they have the balls to call it a success 
P4:14:02 <BoirG> wut?
P4:14:06 <Schoko> Siiseli: I thought you were talking about linux server stuff :o
P4:14:23 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: so? That doesn't mean there aren't companies using it succesfully
P4:14:29 <Siiseli> uuuh I was talking bout what I have on my win7 home computer
P4:14:36 <citricsquid> I used linux and it fucked up once, does that mean linux sucks?
P4:14:41 <Schoko> Siiseli: Oh nvm.
P4:14:46 <Siiseli> Schoko, yeah
P4:14:47 <Schoko> citricsquid: yes
P4:14:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, by company I mean one where one second of downtime costs them millions of dollars, because that's pretty much what it is over here
P4:14:52 <Siiseli> I can use a linux :P
P4:15:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> All the banks just can't afford to use Windows on the machines that run the trading
P4:15:15 <vede> I am using Linux right now. :D
P4:15:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've seen em, it's about 50/50 between Solaris and other Unixes and Linux
P4:15:19 <Siiseli> we had a course at school about linux basics we had to attend
P4:15:20 <Schoko> Hooray!
P4:15:29 <Siiseli> we had some fun cos' we knew each others ips
P4:15:35 <Siiseli> and everyone had the same root password
P4:15:39 <Schoko> Well I gave a project week about Linux :D
P4:15:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> They used to use Solaris on all the desktops too, but they switched to a mix of Linux, OS X, and windows
P4:15:57 <Siiseli> some people who didn't know no nothing bout linuxes were a bit confused when their cd trays started going in and out
P4:16:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Apparently there's a Solaris machine in one of those datacenters with 6 years of uptime
P4:16:06 <Schoko> lol
P4:16:07 <vede> I can't really say it's much better or worse than Windows, but open-source makes me warm inside, so I'd rather use Linux.
P4:16:08 <ZomBuster|Away> I've never used or even seen solaris
P4:16:12 <Siiseli> some were wondering why their graphical system shut
P4:16:12 <Marach> a distro that would be perfect for me: nothing but things that are really needed (i mean really) and gnome or xfce
10P4:16:13 * ZomBuster|Away is now known as ZomBuster

P4:16:34 <Siiseli> or why some goatse had downloaded itself on their desktop..
P4:16:34 <Siiseli> :p
P4:16:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because you don't work in the enterprise world?  :P I've seen it only there (I don't work there, just see it)
P4:16:36 <vede> :D
P4:16:44 <BoirG> vede wen did u get op?
P4:16:46 <Siiseli> so yeah, fun class.
P4:16:48 <ZomBuster> yeh that's probably it :P
P4:16:51 <vede> BoirG, last night.
P4:16:58 <Marach> i dont like kde but i wouldnt mind using it if i had to
P4:17:13 <Schoko> Marach: What version of KDE?
P4:17:22 <Marach> older
P4:17:29 <vede> I tried KDE a couple weeks ago.
P4:17:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> There's a myth going around about an old solaris box doing some load balancing that's been up for 11 years :O
P4:17:31 <Schoko> Marach: signed
P4:17:33 <vede> Hated it.

P5:43:22 <Annihilator> it doesn't look ugly, but it looks out of place when placed with the others
P5:43:25 <Kratospie> New glass? lol wut?
P5:43:28 <Annihilator> especially stacked on top of each other
P5:43:48 <Kratospie> example A: my golden castle looked like rust

P5:49:26 <Kratospie> Texture edits wouldnt work with changing new gold to old though
11P5:49:27 <DBN> partial transparency would be better for the glass

P7:27:39 <PuyoDead> yea, not quite the right word for that situation

P7:28:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or I'm very gay during lunch, I love to eat faggots
P7:28:53 <vede> You're taking alternative meanings of a word.
P7:28:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food)
P7:29:00 <vede> I'm talking alternative objects to a word.
P7:29:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> The word lenient means not punishing, it simply doesn't work because kicks are punishment
P7:29:20 <Snowman> Faggots are also known as "ducks" in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, often as "savoury ducks"
P7:29:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> So you can't say "I want to punish less with my punishment"

P7:29:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P*
P7:30:02 <vede> No, I'm more lenient with my kicks, because I will let myself kick more.
P7:30:12 <eveo> man
P7:30:13 <PuyoDead> lenient is like saying "forgiving"
P7:30:15 <eveo> know what would be epic
P7:30:18 <vede> I would be being LESS lenient to the people I would be forgiving.
P7:30:21 <eveo> if you can shoot and kill in minecraft

P8:05:09 <Darke> Aw Iguana, thats mean :(
P8:05:09 <Visiiri> I advocate Iguana

P8:05:13 <Iguana> <3
P8:05:22 <vede> Vis, I really haven't seen Darke OR Dilt ever do much to make me think they'd make such awful ops...
P8:05:28 <Visiiri> lol
P8:05:32 <Visiiri> darke would't be a bad op
P8:05:36 <Visiiri> i'm just bein a douche there ;D
P8:05:41 <Visiiri> but I don't like dilt.
P8:05:41 <Iguana> And that's why they shouldn't have OP

P8:07:35 <vede> Visiiri, he might use it for other things.
P8:07:35 <SuperDot_iPod> If Darke hadn't changed his password
P8:07:35 <Visiiri> If you spend thirty seconds tryin to find my password you'll get it.

P8:08:07 <Darke> Mee!
P8:08:09 <Visiiri> other than +visiiri, ofc 
P8:08:37 <SuperDot_iPod> It's generally wise to have a safe password
P8:08:44 <vede> I believe Darke knows one of my usual passwords, and Parthon knows the other.
P8:08:58 <Darke> vede, I thought that was a password that you only used once? :P

P8:20:40 <Visiiri> You kick me for something he did?

P8:20:43 <Animator> And a semi-joke in the mix.

P9:15:04 <SuperDot_iPod> Maybe they assume that Minecrafters are 13-year-olds unlikely to contribute much to the discussion

P9:16:47 <TestDummy> Well, as #help tried to tell you guys before whoever was from here left there.
P9:16:57 <TestDummy> "Not only that, the channel operators can do as they wish"
P9:17:00 <Darkebrz> TestDummy, we know, Visiiri just doesn't know\
P9:17:01 <PuyoDead> I wish I was as cool as someone that was sexually attracted to animals
P9:17:06 <TestDummy> "We have no control over who they choose to allow in their channels"
P9:17:15 <PuyoDead> sorry, wrong statement there
P9:17:17 <Visiiri> unterstuud
P9:17:18 <Animator> I agree with TestDummy.
P9:17:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Technically, you do TestDummy 
P9:17:24 <TestDummy> I should note that applies to the network as a whole.
P9:17:27 <PuyoDead> -people dressed as- animals
P9:17:28 <Darkebrz> I think like, 3 of the ops/administrators of Esper are furries >_>
P9:17:38 <Visiiri> I assumed that the motd meant serve affiliation- then I realized
P9:17:40 <TestDummy> Meaning I could ban any one of you for any reason, or none at all.
P9:17:50 <TestDummy> But that's a really bad thing to do, despite the fact we do say that.
P9:18:17 <citricsquid> #furry ops suck, banned me and I didn't even speak
P9:18:17 <Zuriki> What's happening.

P9:19:26 <citricsquid> oh god americans
P9:19:27 <Darkebrz> * Rask sets ban on *!*Mibbit@96.18.163.*

P9:19:37 <citricsquid> he believed me
P9:19:39 <Darkebrz> So, whats with all this #furry spam?
P9:19:46 <TestDummy> Rask isn't an oper, FYI.
P9:19:49 <Darkebrz> citricsquid, you do? That sucks
P9:19:50 <Visiiri> I have an idea!

P9:22:27 <StarFucker> We hate the lot of you.
P9:22:30 <Darke> You guys are all childish little fucks :)
P9:22:31 <Visiiri> Want to cyber?
P9:22:33 <StarFucker> If there is a hell, I'll see you there.

P9:22:39 <Visiiri> hahahahaha
P9:22:40 <Visiiri> this is fun
P9:22:47 <Animator> Hey guys. Stop harassing the other channel.
P9:22:47 <Visiiri> But I should grow up.
P9:22:49 <Visiiri> So i'm done.
P9:22:53 <Animator> TestDummy is getting pissed.
P9:23:02 <Visiiri> ...I only did once.
P9:23:05 <Visiiri> Don'tbanmeh
P9:23:11 <Darke> AlLnAtuRalX did it like 3 times
P9:23:15 <Animator> If I hear complaints again, I will ban.
P9:23:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> twice*
P9:23:16 <Darke> citricsquid, at least twice
P9:23:19 <Zuriki> I did it first
P9:23:29 <PuyoDead> <StarFucker> If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
P9:23:29 <Zuriki> And all I asked was "What we does here?"
P9:23:29 <Animator> Doesn't matter.
10P9:23:30 * SuperDot_iPod sets mode: -o Animator
P9:23:38 <PuyoDead> I take it this guy is a NIN fan?

P9:24:17 <Animator> You can't be serious! We were getting complaints from TestDummy, it had to be done!
P9:24:20 <Darke> <Zeromus> Also, if they stop _acting_ like jackasses, then we will stop _assuming_ they are. And start believing they are all troubled 12 to 43 year olds in their parent's basements shouting at their mothers because the pizza is late
P9:24:41 <mclogsDOTtk> * Your connection has been muted for Trolling. You may only speak with network operations staff. Please /join #DragonWeyr for more information.

P9:24:53 <Darke> Good job mclogsDOTtk
P9:24:56 <Animator> No, I don't.

P9:25:50 <DarkCybrid> Lol, Zuriki is a girl XD
P9:25:56 <SuperDot_iPod> Are people still bombarding #furry?
P9:25:58 <Baroch> lol?
P9:26:08 <Darke> SuperDot_iPod, no. I should get op now for being a good boy
P9:26:14 <Animator> SuperDot, why did you deop me?
P9:26:23 <Darke> Really SuperDot_iPod, why deop Animator?
P9:26:34 <Baroch> reall?
P9:26:37 <Animator> I was only doing the job an op should do.
P9:26:43 <Darke> <Darke> Just to check TestDummy, they also got citricsquid, right?

P9:27:07 <Baroch> hey Zuriki
P9:27:13 <Zuriki> Hey.. you.
P9:27:21 <Darke> This channel is shit. 2 respected members knocked down a big notch
P9:27:30 <SuperDot_iPod> I dunno, I got the impression that he was jumping to disciplinary action too soon
P9:27:30 <Baroch> what?
P9:27:43 <Animator> You can't be serious, SuperDot.
P9:27:44 <Mizuho-chan> Darke, was that a pun?
P9:27:49 <PuyoDead> Super, wow.
P9:27:51 <Animator> TestDummy was -threatening- us.
