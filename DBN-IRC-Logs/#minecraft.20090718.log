A12:00:05 <pl0x> Im not reading 9 pages
A12:00:12 <liq3> 9 pages is nothnig...
A12:00:13 <pl0x> Ill only read it
A12:00:18 <Adura> Alright, read 9 pages of IRC. ;)
A12:00:19 <pl0x> if thats the only thing left
A12:00:28 <pl0x> now...
A12:00:49 <JTE> 9 pages to run Linux on Windows in order to run a Java virtual machine on Linux on Windows on the Internet ... @.@;
A12:01:03 <JTE> Geeze, you're screwed either way. :(
A12:01:14 <pl0x> >.>
A12:01:18 <Adura> Doesn't take that many pages, no pages if you just use you intuition.
A12:01:20 <pl0x> It worked ok
A12:01:23 <pl0x> then i restarted it
A12:01:25 <pl0x> and bam
A12:01:26 <pl0x> error
A12:01:29 <pl0x> so fuck me
A12:01:31 <pl0x> sideways
A12:01:44 <pl0x> >.>
A12:01:44 <JTE> Try renaming server_level.dat ..?
A12:01:57 <pl0x> na it worked first
A12:02:05 <pl0x> with that server_level.dat
A12:02:14 <JTE> Check server.properties, since it gets overwritten every time too?
A12:02:44 <pl0x> i've checked them
A12:02:49 <pl0x> they are what i set them as
10A12:02:56 * liq4 (liquidman3@58.175.121.48) has joined #minecraft
A12:03:00 <pl0x> k ill try a complete default server
A12:03:04 <pl0x> see if that goes
A12:03:07 <liq4> oh great.
A12:03:11 <liq4> liq3 has to time out :(
A12:03:23 <Kinhoshi> Ghost it if it's registered.
A12:03:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> kill it
A12:03:30 <liq4> lol it's not, i'm lazy xD
A12:03:35 <Kinhoshi> Heh
12A12:04:51 * liq3 (liquidman3@58.175.121.48) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:04:58 <liq4> awww VB steals RAM...
A12:05:05 <liq4> I guess I'll only use it when I'm not doing stuff. :/
10A12:05:05 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:05:27 <Adura> You can set the amount of RAM the VM uses.
A12:05:33 <Adura> But, don't set it too low.
A12:05:43 <liq4> Yeh, I'll do like 1.5gb
A12:05:48 <liq4> or maybe 2gb.
A12:05:55 <pl0x> k
A12:06:02 <Adura> Well, hmm... Guess you'd need that much for a big MC server.
A12:06:09 <pl0x> anyone wanna try now?
10A12:06:18 * liq4 is now known as liq3
A12:06:26 <liq3> adura: I'm just doing it to mess with linux without having to duel boot xD
A12:06:31 <pl0x> iHELLO

12A12:09:20 * pl0x (Mibbit@124-197-8-206.callplus.net.nz) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
A12:09:27 <JTE> Thank you, and goodbye~
10A12:09:59 * pl0x (Mibbit@124-197-8-206.callplus.net.nz) has joined #minecraft
A12:10:02 <pl0x> ok
A12:10:06 <pl0x> now i gotta edit it
A12:10:10 <pl0x> so i can join
A12:10:11 <pl0x> D:
A12:10:20 <JTE> Edit what to join what?
A12:10:23 <liq3> awwwwwww
A12:10:36 <pl0x> the verifey names
A12:10:43 <liq3> oh
A12:10:44 <liq3> ...
A12:10:47 <liq3> *giggles*
A12:10:53 <JTE> You should ... leave htat on ...
A12:11:00 <liq3> yes, you should... >.>
A12:11:05 <pl0x> but i cannot join :D
A12:11:08 <pl0x> D;
A12:11:13 <liq3> Don't want anyone impersonating people... <.<
A12:11:15 <JTE> Then use the external URL instead?
A12:11:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> don't work that way
A12:11:37 <liq3> pl0x: you know, I could make you aprogram to join it without cheating...
A12:11:45 <liq3> like, leave verify names on
A12:11:46 <liq3> it sHOULD work.
A12:11:50 <pl0x> erm
A12:11:52 <pl0x> no thank you
A12:11:57 <Kinhoshi> How do people manage to impersonate people anyways?
A12:12:00 <pl0x> also
A12:12:03 <pl0x> yea
A12:12:04 <liq3> Kinhoshi: Edit joining packet. :P
A12:12:09 <Kinhoshi> Ah.
A12:12:13 <pl0x> k
A12:12:16 <liq3> Only works on servers with verify names off.
A12:12:16 <liq3> :P
A12:12:18 <pl0x> so i wanna use my custom map
A12:12:26 <pl0x> also
A12:12:31 <liq3> when it's on it uses a hash to stop impersonating.
A12:12:38 <JTE> You wanna use your custom map and what?...
A12:12:39 <pl0x> could putting a url in the motd cause problems
A12:12:47 <liq3> No.
A12:12:56 <pl0x> or long sentences
A12:12:57 <liq3> Well maybe, but probabbly not.
A12:13:04 <liq3> max legnth is 64 i think...
A12:13:11 <liq3> or something to thaht effect.
A12:13:18 <JTE> What else?
A12:13:26 <JTE> Why do you need verify names off .....
A12:13:33 <liq3> JTE: to join his own server.
A12:13:40 <liq3> Notch's server sucks like that? xD
A12:13:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> hosted on his own computer
A12:13:49 <pl0x> or what about the type of font you use to edit it?
A12:13:51 <JTE> You don't need to use the ip connect to join your own server hosted on your own computer.
A12:13:58 <pl0x> yes i do
A12:13:59 <liq3> pl0x: It doesn't care.
A12:14:02 <JTE> Why do you?
A12:14:03 <pl0x> if i use
A12:14:05 <pl0x> link
A12:14:07 <pl0x> it says
A12:14:10 <pl0x> server is down
A12:14:11 <liq3> JTE: You don't, becasue you have 1337 server. He does.
12A12:14:21 * dinosaurdemon (matt@c-71-227-132-82.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A12:14:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> ahe
A12:14:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> m
A12:14:37 <pl0x> ok
A12:14:38 <liq3> JTE: does your server verify names?
A12:14:41 <pl0x> ill replace the level
A12:14:46 <pl0x> and see what happens
A12:15:05 <pl0x> try to join?
A12:15:18 <JTE> liq3: Yes.
A12:15:31 <pl0x> do i have to yell around here?
A12:15:46 <pl0x> peoplz
A12:15:50 <pl0x> join the servers
A12:15:52 <JTE> pl0x: Yes.
A12:15:53 <liq3> pl0x: no go
A12:15:55 <pl0x> ahh
A12:16:00 <pl0x> i think i know the problem
A12:16:05 <liq3> the map file is corrupt?
A12:16:09 <pl0x> Yes
A12:16:17 <pl0x> hit it on the head
A12:16:25 <pl0x> can i edit map in single player?
A12:16:26 <JTE> I called that one too.
A12:16:30 <JTE> Specifically..
A12:16:43 <pl0x> Let alone
A12:16:45 <liq3> pl0x: Not that i know of.
A12:16:45 <pl0x> Ok.
A12:16:45 <Kinhoshi> Failed to connect.
A12:16:49 <pl0x> Yes
A12:16:52 <pl0x> it's done atm
A12:16:56 <Kinhoshi> Oh.
A12:16:58 <pl0x> coz i've got the problem
A12:17:03 <pl0x> How do you make maps?
A12:17:15 <pl0x> anything to download?
A12:17:24 <JTE> The server auto-generates one if one isn't found.
A12:17:30 <JTE> Otherwise, OME for editing.
A12:17:36 <pl0x> OME?
A12:17:42 <liq3> forums.
A12:17:47 <pl0x> no.
A12:17:49 <pl0x> tell me
A12:17:58 <Kinhoshi> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=80 -- OME.
A12:18:02 <JTE> Map editor.
A12:18:03 <pl0x> Fine
A12:18:10 <JTE> >_>;
A12:18:15 <pl0x> ahh
A12:18:16 <pl0x> ty
A12:18:17 <pl0x> :)
A12:18:28 <pl0x> I will rebuild 
A12:19:57 <liq3> JTE: When you disable building/deleting for people, do they know clientside?
A12:20:35 <JTE> liq3: No. Clients only know when they can or can't break admin blocks, based on the login packet the server sends, which the official server only sends once. x_x;
A12:20:51 <liq3> lol...
A12:21:07 <liq3> So they don't have to wait for the packet that says what happened to the block? :/
A12:21:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> nah
A12:21:23 <JTE> They don't wait for it either way.
A12:21:28 <liq3> Hrm.
A12:21:33 <liq3> Then how do you do stuff like Watervator?
A12:21:38 <JTE> Which is why when my server hangs, you can keep playing and not even notice. :/
A12:21:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> they could break those blocks if they want, but nothing is changed serverside
A12:21:54 <JTE> liq3, that's why stuff like watervator first appears as normal stone and then suddenly changes into water.
A12:22:03 <liq3> I get that, but how do you do it ?XD
A12:22:11 <JTE> AnnihilatorBeta: My server kicks you for that.
A12:22:11 <liq3> Send a packet with the block changing?
A12:22:23 <Kinhoshi> [01:23:15 AM] <JTE> Which is why when my server hangs, you can keep playing and not even notice. :/ -- Which happens to me often.
A12:22:31 <JTE> Yes. :<
A12:22:40 <liq3> Kinhoshi: Everyone does stop moving... It's rather obviou.s
A12:22:41 <JTE> That's what packet 6 is for.
A12:22:46 <Kinhoshi> (the not noticing part)
A12:22:47 <liq3> JTE: kk.
A12:22:54 <JTE> Kinhoshi is usually busy building something
A12:22:58 <Kinhoshi> liq3: I know, but I focus on what I'm doing. :P
A12:23:15 <liq3> JTE: You know what'd be cool? A spleef command that creatse a spleef arena anywhere, then when you're done restores whatever it replaced <3.
A12:24:42 <Kinhoshi> I was building someone by myself in JTE's server recently and didn't notice the server went down until paint stopped working.
A12:24:43 <Adura> That'd be a massive chunk update.
A12:24:43 <JTE> liq3: Too many block change messages sent to too many people. x_x;
A12:24:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> sounds complicated
A12:24:52 <liq3> JTE: Awww really?
A12:25:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> or you could do it by chunks
A12:25:05 <liq3> 10x10x10... that's only 1000 blocks... xD
A12:25:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> like literally
A12:25:16 <liq3> Yeh, could have delayed creating and destroying.
A12:25:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> build it up slowly
A12:25:33 <liq3> Like make it take like 10 seconds or something. o.O
A12:26:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> but first you'd want to know being able to place blocks remotely
A12:26:17 <liq3> Eh?
A12:26:44 <liq3> JTE: Also if the script is smart, and you find an open area, it'd be a lot less since you could skip blocks already in place.
A12:26:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> like creating a block at x,y,z remotely without user interaction with the actual world
A12:27:06 <liq3> Annihilator: I meant a serverside command.
A12:27:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
A12:27:21 <liq3> so you'd be like /spleef create
A12:27:28 <JTE> Obviously.
A12:27:28 <liq3> and it'd create an arena based on where you're standing.
A12:27:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> the server needs the ability to create blocks!
A12:27:40 <liq3> Annihilator: It does....
A12:27:44 <liq3> It already can. lol. :P
A12:27:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> awesome
13A12:27:53 * JTE mews...
A12:28:01 <liq3> What's really evil is that you can pick who sees what... >.>
A12:28:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> then the next step would obviously be creating a data file of some sort
A12:28:02 <Adura> Wait for the Lua support?
A12:28:04 <Kinhoshi> Or just play on JTE's spleef server? *shrug*
13A12:28:06 * Adura pets Jetty
A12:28:09 <liq3> Adura: no, custom server.
A12:28:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> with the blueprints for the arena
A12:28:20 <Adura> Alright, make your own custom server.
A12:28:28 <liq3> Annihilator: Probably just hardcode it into the server.
A12:28:36 <JTE> People are so impatient
A12:28:38 <liq3> That or use Lua or XML or something.
A12:28:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> like data files
A12:28:44 <JTE> They just want to use JTE because JTE does it faster.
A12:28:46 <liq3> Adura: I am >..
A12:28:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> you know how the advanced duplicator for gmod worked, right?
A12:28:53 <Adura> Aw lawds.
A12:28:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> something like that, serversided
A12:29:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> all the blocks stored in a txt file
A12:29:10 <JTE> liq3: You can send players to entirely different maps.
A12:29:16 <liq3> JTE: I know. :D
A12:29:23 <liq3> I already get how you're MMO idea would work. xD
A12:29:32 <Adura> So much resource use, though. D:
A12:29:39 <liq3> Adura: for what?
A12:29:44 <JTE> It'll be better for liq3, surely.
A12:29:48 <Adura> Multiple maps.
A12:29:50 <JTE> liq3 isn't making it in Perl.
A12:29:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> minecraft needs youtube support huhuhuh
A12:29:52 <liq3> mmmm...
A12:30:10 <pl0x> ok guys
A12:30:15 <pl0x> care to test again>
A12:30:29 <liq3> JTE: Not really, I'd stil use one byte per block.
A12:30:46 <Adura> You could make the server software use a temp file or something instead of a lot of RAM.
A12:31:00 <pl0x> Erm
A12:31:07 <pl0x> can like people join or something
A12:31:11 <liq3> Adura: Not really, it'd just result in a lot of HDD I/O.
A12:31:16 <pl0x> GUYS
A12:31:17 <Adura> You'd have to predict what needed to be loaded in to RAM.
A12:31:24 <Adura> *what'd
A12:31:25 <Kinhoshi> sure, pl0x.
A12:31:28 <Adura> *+be
A12:31:30 <pl0x> ty
A12:31:40 <Kinhoshi> disconnected
A12:31:41 <pl0x> fuck it
10A12:31:44 * Superbest (x@85.101.4.20) has joined #minecraft
A12:31:46 <liq3> Adura: though, a 256*256*64 map is only 4mb.
A12:31:48 <pl0x> Im keeping the other thing
A12:31:49 <Superbest> hello
10A12:31:58 * Colain (Lukey_batm@125-239-66-209.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) has joined #minecraft
A12:32:00 <liq3> So you could easily store 1000x that in RAM. <3
A12:32:04 <Superbest> so I want to try out minecraft but it keeps freezing up
A12:32:04 <Kinhoshi> Hiya, Colain.
A12:32:19 <Colain> Pl0x, portforward.com
A12:32:20 <pl0x> kinhoshi care to try again?
A12:32:21 <liq3> Adura: so, yes, maps stored on HDD, only load maps when someone goes in a 'sector'.
A12:32:22 <Adura> I guess, but VPS' put a premium on RAM.
A12:32:23 <pl0x> colain no.
A12:32:27 <pl0x> it's the map file
A12:32:43 <Colain> I'm pretty sure it's port forward.
A12:32:45 <liq3> Adura: so you could easily have a map that's like 4,000,000x4,000,000x500,000
A12:32:46 <liq3> :D
A12:32:52 <liq3> Assuming you have enough HDD space.
A12:32:57 <pl0x> Kinhoshi?
A12:32:57 <Kinhoshi> Colain: He already got it working, it is the map
A12:33:02 <Adura> Wouldn't that kill the client?
A12:33:05 <Kinhoshi> Sorry FF crashed, restarting it
A12:33:09 <pl0x> try again?
A12:33:11 <pl0x> oh
A12:33:17 <liq3> Adura: no, you only feed 256x256x256 sections of it at a time. 
A12:33:29 <Kinhoshi> Disconnected again.
A12:33:29 <liq3> When they reach like, 16 blocks within a border, it loads a new section.
A12:33:34 <liq3> or something.
A12:33:35 <Adura> And, when you hit the edge of a map, load... yeah.
A12:33:36 <pl0x> Ok then
A12:33:44 <pl0x> it's the server properitise
A12:33:49 <liq3> Adura: the really cool part is can give everyone connected different amps. <3
A12:33:55 <pl0x> How do i change them without it screwing up?
A12:34:00 <Adura> Alright, I guess bandwidth would be a concern then. :P
A12:34:12 <liq3> So with like 16gb of RAM and enough upload, you could have this HUGE map with like 1000 people connected. xD
A12:34:25 <pl0x> lol 16gbs
13A12:34:31 * Kinhoshi wouldn't know
A12:34:41 <Adura> Go find a price for such a VPS, ror.
A12:34:45 <liq3> pl0x: Only really need 8gb for 1000 people. :P
A12:34:52 <pl0x> lol
A12:34:55 <pl0x> no 16
A12:35:01 <liq3> Nah, map is 4mb.
A12:35:06 <JTE> liq3: Plus you only need to have maps loaded which players are on, so you can store 10000000x that on harddrive.
A12:35:07 <pl0x> 1000 people drivide by 2
A12:35:08 <liq3> 1000x4mb = 4gb.
A12:35:15 <liq3> JTE: I know. :D
A12:35:20 <JTE> X3
A12:35:20 <pl0x> 500 dride by 4
A12:35:25 <pl0x> all 
A12:35:34 <JTE> MATH.
A12:35:38 <Adura> Good luck coding all this crap.
A12:35:39 <pl0x> OK
A12:35:40 <pl0x> GUYS
A12:35:42 <pl0x> LISTEN UP
A12:35:55 <pl0x> I want to change the server propertises
A12:36:00 <pl0x> but everytime i do it
13A12:36:02 * Kinhoshi doesn't know
A12:36:03 <pl0x> screws up
A12:36:06 <pl0x> why's that
13A12:36:11 * Kinhoshi has never hosted a server before
A12:36:13 <JTE> Might be your regional settings.
A12:36:15 <liq3> Adura: It's actually probably not possible while Minecraft uses TCP :(
A12:36:24 <Kinhoshi> On Minecraft*
A12:36:30 <Colain> What exactly is the problem with the map?
A12:36:34 <liq3> Becuause it'd probably bottleneck on the network. :(
A12:37:07 <Adura> You'd be buying many a server to accomplish this goal, it seems.
A12:37:08 <JTE> Minecraft's use of TCP is regrettable, but it made understanding easier.
A12:37:17 <liq3> JTE: Yeh.
A12:37:24 <liq3> It seems to send packets about once every 200ms.

A12:40:16 <liq3> Why'd he go and do that? :/

A2:22:27 <JTE> Just get a copy of activeperl installed, and run "perl core.pl" and it goes. :3
A2:22:32 <Super-Dot> Oh neat

A7:09:17 <Quatroking> I like one song from devvo
A7:09:25 <Quatroking> it's pretty funny.
A7:09:54 <Quatroking> actually i have no idea what he's saying because his chav accent is overload but i like the melody
A7:10:28 <Quatroking> also I sometimes listen to Librera from Hell - Fight the power because of one single line
A7:10:31 <Snowman> This is cool rap: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWRyj5cHIQA
A7:10:33 <Quatroking> all the other lyrics are SHIT
A7:10:45 <Quatroking> but one line is awesome
A7:10:56 <Quatroking> ROW ROW, FIGHT THE POWER!
A7:11:05 <Quatroking> and thats just it.
A7:11:16 <Quatroking> all the other lyrics in the song sound shitty

A8:50:06 <potato> i can give you a short tutorial
A8:50:12 <gsdfgg> i used mapjack to increase map height which worked but it increased it outside of multiples of 2, so i gotta undo that
A8:50:14 <potato> 1. open it up
A8:50:14 <Cue> [14:51:04] <@citricsquid> cue; you needed work experience to find that out? :D <- No, but it's proof ;)

A8:50:40 <potato> anyway
A8:50:48 <citricsquid> fraterboty: No idea, might be out of date Java
A8:50:59 <potato> 2. go to brushes and select 3d flood fiil
A8:51:02 <potato> er
A8:51:09 <potato> flood fills
A8:51:16 <gsdfgg> just wondering, will these methods keep the stuff on the map?
A8:51:17 <potato> not brushes
A8:51:21 <potato> oh, definitely
A8:51:29 <gsdfgg> good good
A8:52:13 <potato> then you select the air block, scroll through the layers till you find some lava, then click on it

A8:58:44 <fraterboty> like crater;frater

A8:59:02 <citricsquid> new line for each name, can't change admins.txt while the server is running.

A9:00:07 <potato> this is to generate a flatgrass
A9:01:04 <gsdfgg> well i just didn't see any other directions in the readme other than generating flatgrass oceanworld etc
A9:01:13 <potato> look for heightadd
A9:01:43 <gsdfgg> hmm ok, is there a way to change it to a certain number though? because like i said it was doubled to... something
A9:01:48 <gsdfgg> and grass isn't growing because it isn't in 2s
A9:02:02 <potato> yeah, look for heightadd

A11:44:57 <Zuriki> I am

A11:45:45 <Zuriki> And I am trying to find out how to decript the external urls into their original string
A11:45:50 <Zuriki> decrypt*
A11:46:05 <Snowman> depends on the way he encrypted it
A11:46:06 <Adura> You're going to make a rainbow table for MC?
A11:46:07 <Snowman> MD5?
A11:46:22 <Zuriki> Problem is
A11:46:33 <Zuriki> I need the hash
A11:46:40 <Zuriki> Which I think is...
A11:46:52 <citricsquid> well
A11:46:57 <chrstfer> i want to hack the client!
A11:46:58 <chrstfer> jk
A11:46:58 <citricsquid> minecraft-server.jar generates the urls
A11:47:08 <Zuriki> Yeah I know
A11:47:09 <citricsquid> so decompile? (can you decompile .jar?)
A11:47:10 <Snowman> citric why arent you op here anymore?
A11:47:12 <chrstfer> yeh, hack server.jar
A11:47:13 <Zuriki> I have the hash
10A11:47:18 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
A11:47:22 <Zuriki> 791617604
A11:47:31 <Zuriki> BUUUUUT
A11:47:42 <Zuriki> I don't know if it's right
A11:47:52 <Zuriki> Cause I can't recompile the jar anymore
A11:47:56 <citricsquid> can't be hard to test can it?
A11:48:01 <citricsquid> generate a server
A11:48:05 <citricsquid> work out your IP and port
A11:48:08 <citricsquid> and compare with that hash?
A11:48:20 <Snowman> You gonna use it for that client resizer of yours?
A11:48:20 <Zuriki> I haven't messed with hashes
A11:48:31 <Zuriki> Probably.
A11:48:38 <Snowman> hold on
A11:48:39 <Zuriki> Mostly just messing about though
A11:48:47 <Zuriki> Since I have nothing better to do
A11:49:03 <citricsquid> http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/253910 :)
A11:49:22 <Snowman> You can find the ip and port in the page source
A11:49:25 <chrstfer> who here thinks memory editing, paired with editing of the client files themselves, could allow me to change my name, or even become an op?
A11:49:37 <citricsquid> chrstfer: You don't even need to do that =\
A11:49:42 <Zuriki> Yeah I know snowman
A11:49:45 <chrstfer> i wouldnt, but is it possible?
A11:49:49 <Snowman> <param name="server" value="24.115.50.144">    
A11:49:51 <Snowman> 	    	<param name="port" value="25785">    
A11:49:52 <Zuriki> But if you just input the IP and Port
A11:49:52 <Snowman> 	    	<param name="mppass" value="7f22e56a0126926689915fb27460b5e1">
A11:49:57 <Zuriki> It doesn't connect
A11:49:58 <Snowman> cant you make something that reads it from there?
A11:49:59 <citricsquid> Names are based upon the password hash afaik, just change that.
A11:50:04 <Snowman> oh
A11:50:18 <citricsquid> (that was at chrstfer)
A11:50:26 <Zuriki> So what I need to do now
A11:50:45 <Zuriki> Is is make it decrypt the IP and Port from the hashed string
A11:50:58 <Snowman> Isn't dehashing a bit hard?
A11:51:09 <Zuriki> Mm
A11:51:11 <Zuriki> No shit
A11:51:13 <Zuriki> XD
A11:51:24 <Snowman> SO why do you want to do it?
A11:51:29 <Zuriki> Boredoms
A11:51:39 <Snowman> ...
A11:51:41 <Zuriki> I don't expect to achieve it
A11:51:44 <Zuriki> I never do
A11:51:47 <chrstfer> ahh
A11:51:51 <chrstfer> but password
A11:51:56 <Zuriki> But it keeps my mind occupied in the time being
A11:51:56 <chrstfer> is another story
A11:52:00 <Snowman> You wanna try and crack extremely secure hashing methods
A11:52:11 <Snowman> that even protect banks and stuff >.>
A11:52:12 <citricsquid> chrstfer: can easily spoof if the server has verify-names to false, you can be notch :P
A11:52:20 <Snowman> Yeah, right zuriki?
A11:52:22 <Snowman> :D
A11:52:47 <Snowman> and now she's silent :p
A11:52:56 <Zuriki> I wouldn't put my bank details into a java based security.
A11:53:17 <Zuriki> I wouldn't ever use Internet Banking for that matter.
A11:53:24 <Snowman> If it's MD5 hashed
A11:53:28 <Snowman> why not?
A11:53:31 <Snowman> easy to use
A11:53:41 <citricsquid> BUT THE HACKERS ON STEROIDS CAN READ IN MY PIPES
A11:53:49 <citricsquid> internet banking is secure.
A11:54:01 <Zuriki> I just don't trust the internet :P
A11:54:05 <potato> secure except between the screen and your eyes
A11:54:13 <Snowman> THE INTERWEBS WILLZ RAPEZ U
A11:54:35 <Zuriki> Probably.
A11:54:42 <Snowman> Quote that if you'd like.
A11:54:43 <Zuriki> It's the likely outcome.
A11:54:49 <Zuriki> No
A11:54:53 <Snowman> :p
A11:54:58 <Zuriki> I think I'll leave this to the the IRC
A11:55:04 <Zuriki> This is annoying
A11:55:13 <Zuriki> There is mini gay porn on my screen
A11:55:19 <Snowman> o.O
A11:55:25 <chrstfer> i know
A11:55:28 <Snowman> YOU watch gay porn?
A11:55:30 <Zuriki> In the form of a 40x40 picture

P12:08:45 <Snowman> We have grades from 1-10
P12:08:47 <citricsquid> I have like, 3 GCSE's @ A - C :)
P12:08:57 <Zuriki> Only 3
P12:08:59 <Zuriki> :\
P12:09:01 <citricsquid> :D
P12:09:02 <crazyboy11> oh dear :/
P12:09:08 <citricsquid> I didn't do any work for the entire course.
P12:09:16 <Zuriki> I'm going for at least 6
P12:09:18 <citricsquid> y10 and y11 I did nothing, so 3 is awsm :D
13P12:09:19 * Snowman is confused about a different school system.
P12:09:20 <Zuriki> Minimum
P12:09:31 <crazyboy11> I got 10, all A-C
P12:09:36 <citricsquid> getting less than the maximum you can get with effort makes you stupid.
P12:09:55 <Zuriki> No it doesn't...
P12:10:04 <Zuriki> I mean you might put effort in one
P12:10:08 <citricsquid> what GCSE's are you doing? They're eassyyyy, just require effort.
P12:10:09 <Zuriki> And not another.
P12:10:32 <Zuriki> Uh obviously the standard English, Math, Science
P12:10:35 <citricsquid> If you put effort in and don't manage to get at least a C you're silly, all GCSE's require are effort. I'm god awful at maths and still managed a C =\
P12:10:54 <Zuriki> Yeah I hope to get a B in Math.
P12:10:58 <citricsquid> and that was with no effort or work :D
P12:10:58 <Zuriki> I was good at it
P12:11:03 <Zuriki> But then started failing
P12:11:11 <Zuriki> Then gave up around the end of year 9
P12:11:18 <crazyboy11> I wanted an A* in maths, but only got an A :'(
P12:11:25 <citricsquid> :(
P12:11:26 <Zuriki> I don't think I even completed a single lesson by Year 11
P12:11:37 <crazyboy11> lol, really?
P12:11:50 <crazyboy11> I thought lessons in yr 11 were a joke
P12:11:57 <Zuriki> I think if we got about 6 questions I did 1
P12:12:00 <Zuriki> Then slept
P12:12:03 <citricsquid> Haha, I went to college, god that was awful. Teachers couldn't teach anything. they sucked.
P12:12:28 <crazyboy11> for our english GCSE, we had some coursework on the book pride an prejudice
P12:12:31 <citricsquid> I did a web development course, some kid got top marks for stealing his code from some framework example.
P12:12:31 <DrTirD> AAAAAAARGH
P12:12:32 <crazyboy11> no-one bothered to read the book :P
P12:12:38 <DrTirD> I HATE MY XBOX
P12:12:49 <Zuriki> I think despite it not being my first course option for college I'm most looking forward to it, psychology.
P12:12:58 <Zuriki> The other is CS
P12:13:05 <crazyboy11> CS?
P12:13:10 <Zuriki> A-level Math
P12:13:11 <Testvan> cock suckin
P12:13:14 <Zuriki> And Physics
P12:13:24 <Snowman> lol @ testvan
P12:13:32 <crazyboy11> I've just done A level maths and physics
P12:13:36 <Zuriki> That as well testvan
P12:13:38 <crazyboy11> physics was good, maths was tricky
P12:13:51 <Zuriki> That's my reserve though
P12:14:15 <crazyboy11> the physics exams can be real bastards though
P12:14:20 <Zuriki> I got talked into doing Psychology and Physics
P12:14:25 <Zuriki> And forced into Math
P12:14:29 <crazyboy11> forced?
P12:14:37 <Zuriki> It was a requirement to do CS in that college
P12:14:38 <Zuriki> -.-
P12:14:46 <crazyboy11> :/
P12:15:13 <Zuriki> Oh well.
P12:15:39 <crazyboy11> what optional topic are you doing with the maths?
P12:16:03 <Zuriki> What
P12:16:07 <Zuriki> None?
P12:16:56 <citricsquid> I'm cooler than you all, I failed a BTEC! Autographs for $1 each.
P12:17:08 <crazyboy11> lol
P12:17:23 <Snowman> What is BTEC?
P12:17:32 <Zuriki> Vocational course
P12:17:44 <Zuriki> Or something
P12:17:46 <citricsquid> I have no idea what it stands for, but it's a worthless qualification that a half dead fish could get.

P2:34:26 <Azjherben2> O...
P2:34:35 <Azjherben2> Well, winsock can't send files good
P2:34:38 <Azjherben2> So I'm using perl
P2:34:44 <Azjherben2> Now I just have to learn perl
P2:34:47 <Azjherben2> :D
P2:35:06 <JTE> Why would you need to send files, again?
P2:35:12 <JTE> And ...
P2:35:17 <JTE> Why would it be dependant on winsock?
P2:35:18 <Azjherben2> The Gz
P2:35:25 <Azjherben2> C++ on windows
P2:35:30 <Azjherben2> Uses winsock
P2:35:36 <JTE> Yes... And why does that MATTER?
P2:35:45 <Azjherben2> Winsock isn't good with files
P2:36:49 <Azjherben2> Or binary
P2:36:51 <Azjherben2> in general

P2:36:54 <JTE> Winsock doesn't handle files at all. :|
P2:37:16 <Azjherben2> It is very bad for what I want to do
P2:37:20 <Azjherben2> So I'm learning perl now
P2:37:29 <Azjherben2> Gotta start from scratch though.....
P2:37:31 <Azjherben2> :(
P2:37:32 <JTE> If C++ is bad for what you want to do,
P2:37:35 <mib_mj24mi> This question seems dumb, but I cannot make myself admin on my own server. How do i do it?
P2:37:36 <JTE> Perl is completely terrible for it.
P2:37:45 <Azjherben2> Why?
P2:37:46 <JTE> mib_mj24mi: Add your account name to admins.txt
P2:37:49 <Azjherben2> You did yours\
P2:37:53 <Azjherben2> with perl
P2:37:56 <Azjherben2> So it's possible
P2:38:03 <JTE> Azjherben2: Because Perl in general is terrible with binary,
P2:38:09 <mib_mj24mi> i tired, i typed it in exactly and saved it there
P2:38:12 <JTE> and it's possible in C++ too, so that argument is invalid.
P2:38:13 <Azjherben2> That what IS good with binary
P2:38:13 <mib_mj24mi> tried*
P2:38:20 <Azjherben2> Mib... it's Case sensitive
P2:38:26 <Azjherben2> That was my problem
P2:38:33 <Azjherben2> I put in "azjherben" not "Azjherben"
P2:38:44 <mib_mj24mi> okay ill try that
13P2:38:50 * JTE 's admins.txt isn't case sensitive, hehe... o.o Everything gets lowercased.

P6:27:31 <Azjherben2> Hi
P6:27:40 <Azjherben2> I didn't know you knew C, JTE?
P6:27:50 <JTE> I know C, yes.
P6:29:25 <JTE> But this is Perl, encrypted and compiled into a standalone interpreter which is hopefully reasonably secure, and I'm new to the whole thing so I only know how to make Windows binaries with it at the moment. Might need a VM just to compile a Linux one. X_x;

P9:06:34 <liq3> at least on paid-only servers anyway :]
P9:06:47 <Spadge> yeah
P9:06:49 <Spadge> thats true
P9:06:56 <vdgmprgrmr> You don't think griefers will pay for the game?

P9:07:43 <Spadge> a majority of them will go
P9:07:56 <vdgmprgrmr> It might not even be a majority of them.
P9:08:10 <liq3> Paid-only means that nick bans are perm, and they aren't getting abck on the server without buying a new account.
P9:08:30 <liq3> Also i doubt most griefers have even bought the game
P9:08:37 <Animator> Exactly.
P9:08:40 <Spadge> i seen one or 2
P9:08:47 <Animator> It's a community of 30,000.
P9:08:56 <Animator> But the registered consist of 1,000.
P9:09:00 <liq3> yeh
P9:09:05 <liq3> might be 10 griefers in that
P9:09:15 <liq3> ecause griefers know they'll get banned PERMANTENTLY if they grief
P9:09:18 <liq3> which is pointless...

P9:45:19 <Animator> Because I like mob hunting.
P9:45:23 <Eagle> :O
P9:45:34 <Eagle> Let loose a bunch of mobs and then kill them?
P9:45:40 <Animator> Trap 'em.
P9:45:45 <Animator> And then maybe kill them.
P9:45:47 <Eagle> You're a horrible man.

P9:45:52 <Animator> Maybe. If I'm in the mood.
P9:46:07 <Animator> But mobs don't respond to water at all.
P9:46:09 <liq3> lol animator
P9:46:09 <Eagle> What will you tell their widowed wives?
P9:46:10 <liq3> i gotta try that
P9:46:23 <Animator> I'll tell them they went to war.
P9:46:30 <Animator> And they fought bravely.
P9:46:30 <Eagle> What war?
P9:46:35 <yoshibot> Too bad you can't actually kill 'em.
P9:46:37 <Animator> And then maybe some pity sex.
P9:46:43 <Eagle> Terrible man.
P9:46:48 <Animator> Muahahahahaha.
P9:46:52 <Eagle> And then kill them?
P9:46:57 <Eagle> In the afterglow?
P9:47:01 <liq3> hehe loosed some mobs... now to give them a bit of a headstart.
P9:47:02 <Animator> Maybe.
P9:47:07 <Animator> Depends how good the sex was.
P9:47:17 <Eagle> Terrible terrible man.
P9:47:36 <liq3> grr the mobs can jump
P9:47:36 <Eagle> What about their children?
P9:47:40 <Eagle> Slavery?
P9:47:41 <Animator> One way ticket to the orphanage.
P9:48:06 <Animator> They're too young to understand.
P9:48:12 <Eagle> D:

P9:48:18 <Animator> And once they've fully grown...
P9:48:26 <Animator> ...INTO THE MOB HUNT AGAIN!
P9:48:30 <Animator> MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
P9:48:37 <Eagle> What about /their/ children?
P9:48:44 <Animator> It's a vicious cycle.
P9:48:51 <Eagle> Horrible man.
P9:49:20 <Animator> Kill mob, sex/kill wife, send kids to orphanage, wait until they found out what really happened, come to me for vengence, trap 'em and death.
P9:49:28 <Animator> It circles on and on.
P9:49:39 <Eagle> What if they're gay?
P9:49:40 <yoshibot> Until you die of old age/lucky shot or get bored.
P9:50:10 <Animator> Unless my prodigy continues the circle.
P9:50:24 <Animator> And we know it's you, Eagle.
P9:50:29 <Animator> You're next in line.
P9:50:30 <Eagle> What?
P9:50:35 <Eagle> I'm not a mob. O.o
P9:50:41 <Animator> And you can't stop the fate of being THE NEXT BOUNTY HUNTER.
P9:50:57 <Eagle> Wait
P9:51:11 <Eagle> Does that mean I'm your prodigy?
P9:51:15 <Eagle> D-Dad?
P9:51:21 <Animator> Yes, son.
P9:51:24 <Animator> Join me.
P9:51:44 <Eagle> No! That's impossible!
P9:51:47 <Animator> And together we can rule and kill the mobs of Minecraft as father and son...

P10:01:29 <Animator> There's more. They're somewhere.
