A12:13:18 <VurtualRuler98> I'll probably end up getting some lame(read: incredibly awesome compact zombie killer) tiny rifle, random Wii games I don't care about(again), and maybe an original game boy/game boy color.
A12:13:34 <mail2345|smacx> mehhh

A12:14:14 <VurtualRuler98> Chop off his back?
A12:14:22 <VurtualRuler98> That's the only thing you can murder by chopping off.
A12:14:26 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> VurtualRuler98, it rhymes with walls.
A12:14:34 <VurtualRuler98> You wouldn't die probably.
A12:14:43 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> If I do other things after that you would
A12:15:00 <mail2345|smacx> well
A12:15:07 <mail2345|smacx> if the blade was poisioned
A12:15:14 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> It's poisoned and made of lead
A12:15:16 <VurtualRuler98> In Japan, years ago, some groups in power chopped theirs off with a sharp sword and a chair with a hole.
A12:15:59 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> :|
A12:16:07 <VurtualRuler98> Actually having a backslit game boy color would be awesome. Then I could trade between pokemons-wait, that was a dream
A12:16:10 <VurtualRuler98> Ehh, still got red.
A12:16:10 <Shun_Koitenshin> Poor chair, I wouldnt want any cocks in me.
A12:16:29 <VurtualRuler98> Shun_Koitenshin, it's more like the chair getting teabagged.

A12:16:43 <VurtualRuler98> Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame.

A12:17:08 <VurtualRuler98> Red/Gold can trade.
A12:17:09 <Shun_Koitenshin> You dont want the remake of gold?

A12:17:21 <mail2345|smacx> i managed to negoiate peace
A12:17:22 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> I played the japanese one, it's pretty fun.
A12:17:26 <VurtualRuler98> It has lame 4th gen pokemon! It's changed!
A12:17:35 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> waiting for the engrish one before I get too far.
A12:17:37 <VurtualRuler98> I don't have my tried and true level 87 meganium.
A12:17:48 <VurtualRuler98> Plus, blaziken would be one-way traded.
A12:17:58 <VurtualRuler98> I can borrow my starter from Red and put 'em in Gold to battle whatever I need.
A12:18:08 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> no just no
A12:18:12 <clone1018|afk> :)
A12:18:17 <Shun_Koitenshin> I started with Mewtwo in Red. :3
A12:18:27 <VurtualRuler98> Shun_Koitenshin, you can't start with mewtwo.
A12:18:31 <Shun_Koitenshin> Yes you can
A12:18:33 <VurtualRuler98> You can't even feasably catch him.
A12:18:34 <clone1018|afk> Sure you can
A12:18:37 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> trade
A12:18:39 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> glitches
A12:18:40 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> etc
A12:18:41 <Shun_Koitenshin> wrong
A12:18:47 <Shun_Koitenshin> I said STARTING WITH
A12:18:52 <Shun_Koitenshin> as in right off
A12:18:55 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> I said ETC
A12:18:59 <VurtualRuler98> Shun_Koitenshin, how'd you get him?
A12:19:01 <AndrewPH|RAGING_AT_PHP_FFASDAS> as in other things
A12:19:04 <Shun_Koitenshin> Gameshark

A12:19:46 <VurtualRuler98> Anyways, yeah.
A12:19:50 <Shun_Koitenshin> You can change the pokemon that show up when you select your starter
A12:20:04 <Shun_Koitenshin> thats how I did it, by fidning the value
A12:20:11 <Shun_Koitenshin> and then changing it to 151
A12:20:14 <Shun_Koitenshin> *150
A12:20:18 <Shun_Koitenshin> darn number pad
A12:20:20 <VurtualRuler98> I can put my Charizard into Gold temporarily, give him the EXP share, and then continue normally.
10A12:20:35 * PYP|AFK is now known as PickYerPoison
A12:20:35 <VurtualRuler98> He'll level up much higher, and I can put in him in Red to do... random stuff.
10A12:20:46 * laCour|ItsAlwaysSunnyinPhilly is now known as laCour
A12:20:58 <VurtualRuler98> Gamesharks modify memory, right?
A12:21:03 <Shun_Koitenshin> yes
A12:22:40 <VurtualRuler98> Then we could make a whole new game by externally redoing pokemon appearance chances, recoloring the screen, and changing dialog!
A12:22:53 <Shun_Koitenshin> or just use game maker
A12:23:01 <VurtualRuler98> Game maker sucks.
A12:23:08 <Shun_Koitenshin> rpg maker then
A12:23:12 <VurtualRuler98> hahahah
A12:23:21 <VurtualRuler98> It'd be a better idea to just write it in a proper language.
A12:23:28 <Shun_Koitenshin> or you could do a romhack
A12:23:29 <VurtualRuler98> Don't even think about RPG-makering around.
A12:23:43 <VurtualRuler98> Pretty sure that's the idea, except for memory.
A12:23:57 <Shun_Koitenshin> Anything in a ROM can be hacked.

A12:29:37 <clone1018|afk> Tizen?
A12:29:43 <mail2345|smacx> though i'm wondering as it is hugely based off JTE
A12:29:52 <mail2345|smacx> if there might be some legal issues

A12:44:44 <PuyoDead> This one is particularly bad.
A12:45:23 <Koitenshin> I dont understand why Valve can't leave it alone if it isn't broken.

A7:19:04 <Roadcrosser> then /trade <player> <amount> <type> (if more, repeat with <amount> <type>)
A7:19:06 <Spadge> the /give is easy to do
A7:19:08 <Koitenshin> Both players be on, and have a /agree trade command
A7:19:16 <Spadge> ...
A7:19:29 <Roadcrosser> then on player
A7:19:43 <Koitenshin> i think it should be /trade player type amount

A7:19:48 <Spadge> you do realise that that is alot more complicated than you make it out to be
A7:20:02 <Koitenshin> probably
A7:20:09 <Roadcrosser> ./agree <player> <type> <amount>

A7:20:50 <Spadge> by using /give
A7:20:55 <Roadcrosser> but...

A9:36:52 <AlexVMiner> anyone can take over the server

A9:37:09 <AlexVMiner> and no banning people
A9:37:20 <VurtualRuler98> Also, it'll fail quickly.
A9:37:20 <Koitenshin> Actually that would be easier with bytes server program

A9:37:34 <AlexVMiner> SIGNUP
A9:37:38 <VurtualRuler98> 2. Stupid people are very stupid

A9:37:49 <Koitenshin> hey byte[] how many maps can run at the same time?

A10:39:11 <VurtualRuler98> Hay kids, storeh time.
A10:39:56 <VurtualRuler98> I was playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 on the nintendah gamecube, I was Jango Fett and used the rocket jumpjet move repeatedly with low gravity. The map got far away.
A10:40:13 <Quatroking> and then you imploded
A10:40:22 <VurtualRuler98> Then I did many special moves, and flew up again. I had 200x multiplier and my score was in the billions.
A10:40:24 <Quatroking> devided by zero
A10:40:25 <VurtualRuler98> Then it froze!
A10:40:36 <Quatroking> buffer overflow?
A10:40:47 <VurtualRuler98> I dunno.
A10:40:51 <VurtualRuler98> My score was huge.
A10:40:56 <VurtualRuler98> Had it multiplied....
A10:42:03 <VurtualRuler98> 1,999,999,999,800
A10:42:07 <VurtualRuler98> Give or take a billion.
A10:42:19 <Quatroking> yeah probably buffer overflow
A10:43:09 <VurtualRuler98> But the score was only set to multiply a ten digit figure.
A10:43:11 <VurtualRuler98> maybe nine
A10:43:15 <Quatroking> did you know that if you would run windows 98 for 49.7 days the system would freeze due a buffer overflow
A10:43:25 <VurtualRuler98> heh
A10:43:30 <VurtualRuler98> Actually no, the score was higher.
A10:43:41 <VurtualRuler98> The number was huge.
A10:43:44 <VurtualRuler98> I never landed.
A10:43:49 <Quatroking> it causes the uptime to be above 32bits, thus, unable for windows 98 to compute
A10:43:51 <VurtualRuler98> I think I just got too many points per second from my multiplier.
