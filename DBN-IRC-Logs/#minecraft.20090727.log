Session Ident: #minecraft
A12:00:15 <PuyoDead> DSIRC is surprising nice
A12:00:15 <Nalok> Anyone know enough about java to tell why it's crashing?
A12:00:38 <sKadoodle> what's minecrafts port omg
A12:00:50 <sKadoodle> i can't find minecraft at portforwarding.com
A12:01:25 <Bbzx> ?
A12:01:27 <Bbzx> what?
A12:01:35 <sKadoodle> like i go to the website, like it tells me.
A12:01:37 <Bbzx> [00:42] <sKadoodle> well i got my server up, and like i connected to http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
A12:01:38 <PuyoDead> 25565
A12:01:40 <Bbzx> you said it yourself
A12:01:41 <Bbzx> rofl
A12:01:41 <sKadoodle> and i cannot find Minecraft anywhere!@#!@
A12:01:42 <PrinceOfFire59> Port forwarding makes me do this:
A12:01:47 <sKadoodle> that's my own server
A12:01:49 <sKadoodle> with my own ip
A12:01:56 <Bbzx> all servers use the same port
A12:02:02 <Nalok> I have an idea on how to make a type of CTF :D
A12:02:02 <Bbzx> unless you specift to use a different one
A12:02:03 <PrinceOfFire59> é5ïóãýîèñ9âóïôñôîóñôú¡€ýççï€éôíûñïóîîèôâîüè9þ8â£ùþè£èèèã€îï
A12:02:06 <sKadoodle> but like
A12:02:09 <sKadoodle> mmm
A12:02:12 <Bbzx> but like wat?
A12:02:28 <Bbzx> ctf minecraft nalok?
A12:03:00 <PrinceOfFire59> ñò?
A12:03:29 <Bbzx> i wonder if theres some kind of IRC exploit for DSIRC
A12:03:38 <PuyoDead> minecraft default port is 25565, so if you don't change it, well, there ya go
A12:03:57 <Bbzx> where i can take control of your DS and make it show you random anime videos to rot your brain

10A12:04:21 * ONI] is now known as ONI
A12:04:26 <ONI> allo
A12:04:28 <mail2345> hello
A12:04:37 <mail2345> too lazy to dl a client :P
A12:04:45 <Nalok> Well, of course there would be two teams, and atleast a 40 block wide radius between each base, there would be a flag displaying the color of the team, and if the enemy gets into the other team's base and gets to the flag room, you destroy the flag akin to picking it up, and then you have to run back to your flag room
A12:04:55 <Nalok> And then you score a point
A12:05:09 <Bbzx> and you build blocks in the way to stop the other team?
A12:05:18 <Bbzx> imo Minecraft = build stuff
A12:05:19 <Nalok> Also you can set up defenses (Walls made of gravel/sand)
A12:05:23 <Bbzx> if you move away from that idea
A12:05:28 <Bbzx> you lose the concept of the game
A12:05:38 <PrinceOfFire59> Ï HÆT ÞÕRT FÖRWÁRÐÏÑG¡!¡!¡
A12:05:52 <Bbzx> im surprised my IRC is showing me these characters
A12:05:55 <Nalok> Also you can stop the flag carrier by setting up walls to slow him down
A12:05:56 <Bbzx> they usually turn out as ???????
A12:06:10 <mail2345> you can thank your ISP for not
A12:06:16 <mail2345> adopting Ipv6
A12:06:27 <mail2345> and your router for NAT and fudged DMZ
A12:06:41 <Nalok> and the team leader can use unbreakable blocks to encase the opposing carrier in a box
A12:07:03 <Bbzx> ...
A12:07:06 <PrinceOfFire59> DS ïs mägîç 
A12:07:06 <Bbzx> that ruined it
A12:07:12 <Bbzx> unbreakable blocks?
A12:07:17 <Bbzx> ill just put them around the flag
A12:07:19 <Bbzx> game over
A12:07:19 <Nalok> But the other team leader can break him out
A12:07:30 <Bbzx> doesnt matter, you do that and the game is ruined
A12:07:38 <Bbzx> good idea, bad game for it
A12:08:15 <Nalok> Oi, I'm just thinking of ideas while trying to figure out why Java crashes whenever I generate a level

A3:32:46 <JTE> I made Radd and Gnarl because I know nobody else would bother.
A3:33:02 <Super-Dot> Cool, my reference skin has gotten 43 downloads :D
A3:33:21 <JTE> and I still think 404notfound's Quote and Curly skins are better than those ones. =o.o=
A3:33:22 <|404notfound> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=404notfound
A3:33:23 <Super-Dot> This means that I'm helping people :3
A3:33:32 <|404notfound> does that look more like Altair from Assassin's Creed or Kratos from God of War?
A3:33:48 <Super-Dot> Whoa, 404, nice
A3:33:54 <Super-Dot> Definitely Altair
A3:34:08 <|404notfound> I guess the overall white body and the red sash makes people think Kratos
A3:34:23 <|404notfound> I wish I could make the sash smaller, but since both legs use the same skinning, it's not possible
A3:34:32 <|404notfound> not without looking weird
A3:34:36 <|404notfound> well, weirder than it is
A3:34:52 <Super-Dot> The same-leg and same-arm skinning gets annoying
A3:35:13 <Super-Dot> I'm working on an NES Samus skin and she can't have an arm cannon :(
A3:35:24 <do0han> Give her two.

A3:37:05 <JTE> But he has none, too.
A3:37:33 <Super-Dot> I find it weird that the chest and back are mirrored, but the arms and legs aren't
A3:37:44 <Super-Dot> Er, other way around
A3:37:59 <Super-Dot> Since most of the chests and backs are mirrored anyway
A3:38:00 <|404notfound> yeah
A3:38:08 <|404notfound> if you have to have only one leg skin and one arm skin, they could at least be mirrored
A3:38:12 <JTE> That's because they're one object.
A3:38:37 <JTE> The chest, I mean.
A3:39:04 <|404notfound> well, but is there some reason that the right and left sides of the legs and arms have to be the same?
A3:39:05 <Super-Dot> Yeah, it makes sense from a technical standpoint
A3:39:10 <|404notfound> as opposed to the right of one being the left of the other
A3:39:34 <Super-Dot> So Notch still hasn't fixed the mirroring? D:
A3:39:34 <JTE> Nah, that's just because Notch is crazy. :3
A3:39:43 <JTE> Heh.
A3:39:59 <Super-Dot> He said it's on his to-do list, but apparently it isn't very high priority
A3:40:44 <|404notfound> I'd imagine not
A3:41:00 <|404notfound> making the game into what it's supposed to be and not just a building environment is probably more important
A3:41:16 <|404notfound> I like making skins though
A3:42:34 <Super-Dot> I like making skins with flat colors, but they generally look bad
A3:42:44 <Super-Dot> And shading well is a lot of work
A3:42:55 <|404notfound> my first few skins were solid colors, but Altair was the first skin where I started experimenting with shading
A3:43:12 <|404notfound> I usually just take the main color and raise or lower the brightness by about 4 or 5 to get a shading color
A3:43:21 <Super-Dot> It was a terrific success, I think :D
A3:43:47 <|404notfound> thanks

A6:15:37 <Quatroking> I drink straight out of the bottle
A6:15:50 <Quatroking> because that's hardcore
A6:15:53 <citricsquid> yeah and then the bottom 20% is the regurgitation from your mouth
A6:16:17 <Quatroking> I don't constantly throw up while I'm drinking citricsquid
A6:17:02 <citricsquid> unless you hold the bottle above your mouth, liquid will always re-enter
A6:17:08 <Quatroking> also I have one thing that you don't have

A8:26:12 <PuyoDead> haha
A8:26:19 <PuyoDead> well, nobody here thinks that
A8:26:33 <citricsquid> :(

A8:28:22 <citricsquid> If money was irrelevant, what job would you try and get? :D
A8:29:32 <PuyoDead> well, first choice is obviously to work in video games, heh. but I'd want to work on the electronics design end
A8:30:30 <UnknownX> im going to go play a game for maybe 4 hours
A8:30:40 <UnknownX> bye
A8:30:49 <Ausfriend> Puyo, i know you probably don't care, but i have a mate who has finished his 3 year gamedesign/multimedia course, and he's been unemployed for about a year and a half

A8:31:07 <Ausfriend> its hard stuff on the gamedesign field
A8:31:49 <citricsquid> I wonder how many people try and apply for places like VALVe and EA.
A8:32:04 <citricsquid> I know google gets thousands of job apps every day, but not sure about game companys =o
A8:34:05 <Super-Dot> PuyoDead: What do you mean by electronics design?
A8:34:24 <Super-Dot> The design of the physical thing itself?
A8:34:36 <PuyoDead> as in, the design of the actual systems/circuitry
A8:34:43 <Super-Dot> Ah, neato
A8:35:03 <Super-Dot> I expect there are many more jobs available there than in game design :P
A8:35:04 <PuyoDead> I have an electrnics engineering degree, and it's doing me just squat
A8:35:11 <Super-Dot> Aw jang
A8:35:19 <PuyoDead> at this point, I'd take a line cook job
A8:35:44 <PuyoDead> (which I've applied to multiple times, and nothing, even though I have 5 years cooking experience)

A8:36:46 <citricsquid> I wonder why it's so hard for you, my 16 year old sister decided she wanted a job so she went into some new bar and was offered one instantly, earns about $7/hour which isn't much, but still got a job pretty much instantly and does 30 hours/week. silly US, uk ftw ;D

A8:37:25 <PuyoDead> whe nyou're young, you can still be considered a new worker, and they can pay them pretty much whatever they want
A8:37:39 <PuyoDead> but as you get older, you're assumed to know more, and have more qualifications
A8:37:52 <PuyoDead> hence, the typical "over qualified" excuse
A8:38:18 <PuyoDead> which is just a fancy way of saying "we'd have to pay you too much"
A8:38:20 <citricsquid> Yeah, I've been told that, places don't like to employ well educated people because they're quite likely to get a better job offer and leave so the training is wasted,.
A8:38:30 <PuyoDead> exactly
A8:39:07 <Super-Dot> You could tell them that you haven't been able to get a job in 8 months?
A8:39:19 <PuyoDead> that wouldn't matter
A8:39:25 <Super-Dot> I think they would be less afraid of you suddenly leaving, at least
A8:39:42 <PuyoDead> if that were the case, all of us would be getting jobs right quick

A11:49:32 <Parthon> "Caverns: 289  Tunnels: 1249"
A11:50:23 <ZomBuster> nice
A11:50:34 <ZomBuster> does that even fit without intersecting
A11:51:00 <Parthon> in theory, yes
A11:51:20 <ZomBuster> would be tiny caverns and tunnels then
A11:51:39 <Parthon> they are huge
A11:53:08 <Parthon> tunnels are 3x3 and rooms are 20x20x8 or bigger
A11:53:13 <ZomBuster> ah
A11:53:24 <ZomBuster> and the tunnel lenght is variable too
A11:53:33 <Parthon> from 8-16 squares, yeah
A11:53:54 <ZomBuster> yeh I can see that working
A11:54:11 <Parthon> oh
A11:54:30 <Parthon> and that's only 1/3 of the underground portion of the map generated
A11:55:54 <ZomBuster> do some stuff with spheres, looks good
A11:56:08 <Parthon> hmm?
A11:56:25 <ZomBuster> you know round tunnels and shut

P2:24:33 <bombadil> one click = revert and reboot server
P2:24:53 <ChJees> Do Java has access to kill other applications?

P2:49:43 <bombadil_> you're the one who butted your nose in, started playing judge jury and executioner, with authority you do not wield
P2:49:50 <AlexVMiner> um, I calmly explained exactly what happened to citric

P2:52:57 <citricsquid> well
P2:53:00 <citricsquid> they must remove it manually
P2:53:04 <mib_27yxth> oh
P2:53:04 <citricsquid> because it doesn't do it automatically
P2:53:06 <Perogi> notch better add different op levels
P2:53:06 <citricsquid> it never has.
P2:53:08 <mib_27yxth> you sure?

P3:02:27 <bombadil> the garden which AlexVMiner was accusing me of destroying

P3:02:46 <Redshift> did you forward ports correctly?
P3:02:48 <bombadil> iirc i pwned you @ spleefing too, snowman ;)

P10:22:33 <PuyoDead> no no, not the raid
P10:22:35 <PuyoDead> his server
P10:22:44 <PuyoDead> *raids
P10:22:45 <LG_Legacy> Oh, what has his topic set to involve trolling?
P10:23:29 <PuyoDead> basically, he made a server that was said to be "free from censorship", but was in essence filled with the kind of the things most griefers/trolls make
P10:23:43 <PuyoDead> nazi camps, 9/11 celebrations, etc
P10:23:57 <mail2345> penises

P10:24:10 <LG_Legacy> And?
P10:24:10 <mail2345> oh, wait, didn't notcie the etx
P10:24:12 <LG_Legacy> It is actually free
P10:24:13 <PuyoDead> "free from censorship", but if he didn't like/agree with you, he banned
P10:24:14 <mail2345> etc*
P10:24:14 <Akai> you know what the dumbest trick griefers pull is?
P10:24:24 <Akai> spawning away when they get reported
P10:24:29 <Real> so what if he banned people he didn't want on his server?
P10:24:36 <Akai> if they're not fast enough, or say... if they're lagging
P10:24:39 <PuyoDead> naturally, people complained (on both sides)
P10:24:41 <LG_Legacy> He's a person that believes in all things as an 'art' So what if there is nazism? Free belief/artist taste
P10:24:54 <LG_Legacy> However
P10:24:55 <PuyoDead> you folks seem to be missing the point
P10:25:07 <LG_Legacy> Hearing  this so called 'banning on sight of disbelief of freedom'
P10:25:16 <LG_Legacy> Is beginning to worry me of my
P10:25:20 <LG_Legacy> 'owner'
P10:25:22 <PuyoDead> nobody cares about "free speech" or censorship or any of that
P10:25:46 <Akai> in the online world, free speech is often willingly given up, as one agrees to various Terms of Service
P10:25:56 <PuyoDead> that was never the issue. that crap is everywhere. people make things they want, big deal
P10:26:06 <mail2345> actually, peroggi is missing the point of censorship. censorship is done against things that
P10:26:10 <Akai> though, I don't think Minecraft has such rules...
P10:26:13 <LG_Legacy> His beliefs were his own, and his server is free to operate is his own, why should anyone complain? If they get banned, make an appeal. If they have a problem in how the server runs? So what, make a small suggestion.
P10:26:18 <mail2345> you disagree with, not absolutly retarded crap
P10:26:34 <PuyoDead> Legacy... you're smarter than this, c'mon
P10:26:42 <mail2345> if someone were to spam the word penis in this chat channel
P10:26:43 <LG_Legacy> I realize this
P10:26:49 <LG_Legacy> But either way..
P10:26:54 <LG_Legacy> I believe you don't see what i see.
P10:26:55 <mail2345> right now, and they got muted it wouln't be censorship
P10:26:57 <PuyoDead> the content of his server is not the issue
P10:27:00 <LG_Legacy> Ah?
P10:27:10 <PuyoDead> I know exactly what you're saying, I'm just saying that's besides the point
P10:27:25 <LG_Legacy> So remind me, what is the point?
P10:27:39 <PuyoDead> he basically invited people in, only to "stir the pot" so to speak
P10:28:07 <PuyoDead> naturally, people are going to be upset about some of the things there. that happens, non-issue
P10:28:35 <LG_Legacy> Very interesting
P10:28:42 <LG_Legacy> But what if you only believe this out of theory?
P10:28:53 <PuyoDead> in essence, he would call them idiots for thinking that way. again, this happens
P10:29:25 <PuyoDead> problem is, that topic was a damn firestorm, and he was trolling damn near everyone
P10:29:50 <PuyoDead> add to that the grief raids (and his frequent admittence to griefing on multiple servers)
P10:30:34 <PuyoDead> so to come full circle: Troll.

P10:31:34 <LG_Legacy> Interesting ... very.
P10:31:45 <LG_Legacy> And topping it off with a cherry
P10:31:50 <Real> quite the interesting story there
P10:31:57 <Real> sounds like a super troll
P10:32:22 <PuyoDead> he can run his server all he wants, nobody really cares. just don't try to pull the whole damn community (IRC and forums) into your troll attempt
P10:32:35 <PuyoDead> but hey, that's just my opinion. I'm not staff or anything
P10:32:36 <LG_Legacy> Sneaky.
P10:32:57 <LG_Legacy> Seems as if he's going to have to change his ways.
P10:33:23 <PuyoDead> ehh, doubtful. he'll probably just try a few more times with alts
P10:33:53 <Real> that is likely
P10:34:13 <LG_Legacy> Unlikely
P10:34:21 <LG_Legacy> I speak through him, attempting to fix the problem at hand.
P10:35:36 <Real> what?
P10:35:44 <PuyoDead> only thing I think could "fix" it, is a few more years of maturity. but again, that's just my opinion
P10:36:11 <LG_Legacy> Mainly from what i hear, he's just wanting to have al ittle fun but he realizes he went over the line and is wanting a second chance to prove himself.
P10:36:28 <LG_Legacy> He means no harm or... 'drama' to occur between the people of the community.
P10:36:47 <PuyoDead> while that would be nice (to see someone change for the better), but I highly doubt that
P10:37:02 <PuyoDead> -but
P10:37:05 <LG_Legacy> Simply put, i'm still going to try to do something about it.
P10:37:25 <PuyoDead> feel free, and good luck
