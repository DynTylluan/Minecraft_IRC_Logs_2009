A8:46:36 <liq3> MMOs are scum.
A8:46:38 <Xeros> luckily Runescape was my main MMO since it worked on crappy computers
A8:46:41 <Shotz> Liq3 suck it!
A8:46:46 <Shotz> :[
A8:46:51 <Shotz> Gear
A8:46:53 <gear|work> black prophecy plz be released already
A8:46:55 <liq3> They're as bad as jobs.
A8:46:55 <Xeros> Never have or will play WoW though
A8:46:55 <liq3> :P
A8:46:56 <Shotz> Are you getting Aion? :>
A8:46:59 <gear|work> no
A8:47:03 <Mercyfire> Meh i play wow
A8:47:06 <Shotz> Whai
A8:47:07 <Shotz> Heh
A8:47:07 <Shotz> Wow
A8:47:08 <gear|work> i also play wow
A8:47:09 <Shotz> FAIL.
13A8:47:10 * LG_Legacy wastes his life waiting
A8:47:12 <Mercyfire> not nearly as much as i used too
A8:47:14 <Shotz> failllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
A8:47:17 <gear|work> same here mercy
A8:47:19 <LG_Legacy> I'm waiting 5 minutes :D
A8:47:20 <liq3> LG_Legacy: Waiting is awesome.
A8:47:24 <Shotz> Wow sucks. 
A8:47:32 <Shotz> Like, giant epic monkey ass. 
A8:47:35 <gear|work> i just pvp with a few of my friends or the occasional raid
A8:47:36 <Shotz> That's what it sucks
A8:47:36 <LG_Legacy> Then i'l go on a rampage and scream and yell at a Fake Notch.
A8:47:38 <Mercyfire> I imagine its better than Aion though :P
A8:47:39 <liq3> LG_Legacy: I've spent most of today juts dwalding for the hell of it (and for Survival).
A8:47:41 <Xeros> We should all just learn programming and build our own MMO worlds for teh lazy non-programmers to play
A8:47:44 <gear|work> so tell us shotz
A8:47:46 <gear|work> why it sucks
A8:47:57 <Shotz> Its been out for 5 years?
A8:48:00 <Shotz> Its got boring
A8:48:02 <Mercyfire> And?
A8:48:02 <Shotz> content got shit
A8:48:06 <Xeros> *preaches programming to public*
A8:48:07 <Mercyfire> Its updated quite a bit
A8:48:12 <liq3> Shotz: Most MMOs have very little actual gameplay.
A8:48:16 <Shotz> Next december?
A8:48:21 <Shotz> :I
A8:48:25 <Shotz> Google > Aion 
A8:48:27 <Shotz> Something new.
A8:48:29 <Shotz> Looks good.
A8:48:30 <Xeros> I want an MMO of a very old game called WASTELAND
A8:48:34 <gear|work> cant wait for cataclysm
A8:48:35 <Shotz> Might comp wow, or it might flop. 
A8:48:36 <Xeros> kinda similar to the old fallout games
A8:48:36 <gear|work> mmmmmmmmm
A8:48:49 <bobo> i want a harvest moon MMO
A8:48:51 <bobo> :D
A8:48:56 <liq3> Aion = Flashy GFX, but otherwise gonna be another WoW clone.
A8:48:56 <gear|work> nothing is going to kill WoW atm
A8:49:03 <Mercyfire> I want a space invaders mmo :D :S
A8:49:06 <gear|work> as much as people wish

A8:49:23 <citricsquid> lol @ how she says "parkour"
A8:49:24 <Xeros> WoW just needs to use it's money to make an awesome Diablo game.. I hope Diablo 3 is good
A8:49:33 <Mercyfire> Same
A8:49:34 <Xeros> oh and Starcraft 2 already looks awesome
A8:49:45 <gear|work> d3 looks kick ass
A8:49:45 <Mercyfire> Wont be a while till Diablo 3 comes out though
A8:49:52 <gear|work> 2011 supposedly
A8:49:53 <PuyoDead> "<mnx> they couldn't just, y'know, give money to charity."
A8:49:58 <PuyoDead> "<mnx> "you're starving?  you want a sammich?  woah there, not so fast.  click here first.""
A8:50:01 <doohan> They should forget about sc2 and just work on diablo 3
A8:50:08 <liq3> citricsquid: What about how she says parkour?
A8:50:12 <gear|work> sc2 is basically a cash cow
A8:50:19 <gear|work> lol
A8:50:21 <gear|work> nah
A8:50:23 <gear|work> itll be good
A8:50:27 <Mercyfire> it will
A8:50:28 <doohan> It'll be more of the same.
A8:50:29 <gear|work> and itll make them tons and tons of money
A8:50:35 <Mercyfire> if its nearly as good as the first it will be awesome
A8:50:50 <Xeros> Did someone say PARKOUR!?!? I love parkour, I am very interested in parkour, out of my many interests like programming, post-apocalyptic survival, etc.
A8:50:59 <gear|work> do parkour programming
A8:51:10 <Mercyfire> ah
A8:51:26 <LG_Legacy> Parkour is fun
A8:51:33 <LG_Legacy> Mincraft Parkour
A8:51:36 <LG_Legacy> o_O
A8:51:38 <gear|work> lol..
A8:51:46 <Xeros> Parkour is something I'd love to master someday.
A8:51:52 <gear|work> could work in 3rd person
A8:51:53 <AcidMan> Me too
A8:51:54 <AcidMan> :D
A8:51:59 <gear|work> wall flips 'n shit
A8:52:09 <Mercyfire> Lol in minecraft? 
A8:52:12 <gear|work> yes
A8:52:14 <Mercyfire> Wow
A8:52:16 <Xeros> wall flips? D:< lol that's Free-Running
A8:52:22 <AcidMan> Parkour is da shiz
A8:52:22 <AcidMan> :D
A8:52:30 <Mercyfire> you could like build while your flipping
A8:52:30 <gear|work> hey man, parkour has wall flips too
A8:52:33 <Xeros> although I wouldn't mind some free-running too
A8:53:22 <Xeros> oh yeah ok.. yeah... sometimes I don't entirely agree with parkour or free-running perfectly....
A8:53:25 <liq3> Xeros: I'd avoid free-running.
A8:53:34 <liq3> Free-running is artsy. >.<
A8:53:44 <gear|work> you dont want to be artsy, do you?
A8:53:49 <liq3> I don't.
A8:53:56 <Xeros> Although I prefer the "word" FreeRunning.. I like using the word free-running instead of parkour.
A8:54:00 <liq3> Parkour is all about effiecency and speed.

A8:54:49 <Xeros> Indeed.. I always agree with efficiency... It's why I'm not much of a "decoration" person.. if I had a house I wouldn't fill it with decoration and shiz.. unless it had some psychological effect of whatever or could be used

A10:04:09 <liq3> And thus the reason I hate DotA: So you end up in a sort of pansy game of slaps, tentatively taking out their troops, all the while desperately looking for an opening to exploit – but, even if you do find one, the instant you start hurting them they run away as fast as they can. You do the same, and so the game becomes all about seeing who can run away fastest, until one of them sneaks around behind you and you get killed.

A10:19:35 <oldage> ?
A10:19:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> what beta
A10:19:53 <Smashing> goodnight
A10:20:02 <Dilt> i don't think this survival test is in any way a 'beta'
A10:20:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's a beta gamemode for an alpha stage game
A10:20:20 <08Notch> it isn't. It was supposed to be more, but MY GOD, these things takes ages to implement right.
A10:20:41 <asiekierka> Notch

A10:20:56 <citricsquid> haha, shooting arrows from nothing?

A10:21:00 <Dilt> i suppose we'll find out but how will we share arrows?
A10:21:09 <Dilt> do we build arrow blocks?
A10:21:14 <doohan> Thanks notch, that's all I wanted!

A10:21:49 <oldage> I was told that the test phase was open to everyone, and when it's finished only the people that bhought Minecraft  can acces it
A10:21:52 <oldage> is that right?
A10:21:52 <Dilt> honestly i don't see arrows being in inventory until we get crafting and stuff, and that's beyond the scope of this update
A10:22:00 <gear|work> haha
A10:22:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> not really
A10:22:03 <gear|work> the creepers

A10:22:36 <asiekierka> well
A10:22:44 <asiekierka> I heard creative mode will be free until release of 1.0

A10:22:52 <asiekierka> free AND paid

A10:25:48 <Mercyfire> Notch the new enemies are awesome ^_^
A10:25:49 <Dilt> maybe not as much as from smashing single blocks at a time, but yeah
A10:25:54 <SHAD0Wdump> Notch... Would it be alright to ask that in the future you could add a function to turn off creepers(and any other creatures with block destroying abilities you would have in mind) off?
A10:26:00 <Dilt> there should be SOME chaos in these explosions
A10:26:05 <Dilt> they ARE explosions after all
A10:26:15 <Doctor_Ololo> notch, will minecraft still cost 10 euros after survival beta comes out?
A10:26:18 <asiekierka> Notch: Please readd the old wood texture as a separate block
A10:26:21 <Darkebrz> I think the explosions are already pretty chaotic
A10:26:30 <asiekierka> or was it the old plank texture
A10:26:31 <Darkebrz> And yeah, I loved the old wood texture
A10:26:35 <Darkebrz> It was plank

A11:21:39 <Marach> that is a step
A11:21:42 <Quatroking> Notch, seriously, add a third leg to those creepers
A11:21:42 <Marach> not a goal
A11:21:45 <Darkebrz> Notch is probably fighting a coworker with his sword
A11:21:48 <Quatroking> they look like flying zombie dicks
A11:21:49 <Darkebrz> While his code is compiling
A11:21:52 <Marach> xkcd?
A11:21:52 <liq3> Marach: I'd assume the long term goal would be score based.
A11:21:57 <Maart3h> agree qautro :P
A11:21:58 <Xzalander> they do dont they Quatro.
A11:22:04 <Marach> "My code is compiling!"
A11:22:04 <Quatroking> They do.
A11:22:06 <flyboy> Notch has co-workers?
A11:22:12 <AcidMan> <Quatroking> they look like flying zombie dicks that is what I thought
A11:22:13 <AcidMan> xD

A11:22:33 <Xzalander> I think they need 0 legs and act like snakes
A11:22:34 <flyboy> That's not very nice

A11:22:50 <Quatroking> does the explosion also harms other enemies?

A11:23:20 <Quatroking> because in that case I'm going to lure some of those creepers into a hole and let them explode
A11:23:24 <Darkebrz> Notch, I request that you stop fighting with your sword and answer our questions

A11:23:31 <flyboy> Shhhh

P1:39:53 <Marach> but you can get water here!
P1:39:58 <Jakkarra> the Creepers are a nice addition
P1:40:17 <Drakim> the lack of a good method to get rid of water makes cave building hard
