A1:09:11 <Ylle> well the preview works so...
A1:09:56 <Ylle> what could I possibly be doing wrong? Is there some kind of settings menu somewhere? And where does the thing store the settings, if there's a video settings file....
A1:10:18 <Syndlig> Question:  How the hell do I run a server?

A1:11:32 <Evil-Ville> jfadkljfdka
A1:11:37 <Evil-Ville> I forgot how it was fixed

A1:15:08 <paul|not> k sent you a private message
A1:15:15 <Syndlig> Nobody knows?
A1:15:16 <paul|not> if you're in mirc it should be along the top
A1:15:34 <paul|not> Syndlig: I run into that error on a laptop w/ integrated gfx card but I doubt it's the same reason
A1:16:07 <Syndlig> I can play the game fine, just won't let me host, not sure why.  :\
A1:16:09 <Suran> grif PM me too
A1:16:28 <paul|not> Syndlig: how are you connecting to your server?
A1:16:32 <Syndlig> I'm not.
A1:16:38 <Syndlig> It's not letting me HOST the server.
A1:16:41 <paul|not> it does that when you start the .exe?
A1:16:44 <Syndlig> I just get the error and the program closes.
A1:16:45 <paul|not> did you run the .bat
A1:16:50 <Syndlig> Yeah, I run the .bat
A1:16:54 <paul|not> no clue
A1:17:57 <Parthon> which error?
A1:18:13 <Parthon> the pixels error?
A1:18:24 <Syndlig> No

A1:20:06 <Syndlig> Also on an unrelated note, are map saves from singleplayer stored on my computer?
A1:20:08 <Syndlig> If so, where at?
A1:21:18 <Parthon> I'm pretty sure they are stored on the server
A1:21:23 <Parthon> because that's how they are share
A1:21:30 <paul|not> yeah
A1:21:37 <paul|not> singleplayer can't be saved/edited
A1:21:39 <paul|not> shame
A1:21:48 <Lmaoboat> Would you eat this if you died after a heart attack afterword? http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t162/brittonlin/BaconWeave4.jpg
A1:22:09 <Evil-Ville> I already did
A1:22:13 <Parthon> haha .. awesome
A1:23:05 <Evil-Ville> I think single player saves should be saved locally and you could then upload them later if you wanted to
A1:23:11 <Evil-Ville> Well that's probably how it's going to work
A1:23:27 <Syndlig> Hm.
A1:23:31 <Syndlig> So... we can't host Huge maps?
A1:23:34 <Parthon> I see your bacon weave and raise you a rubaconducken!
A1:23:35 <Parthon> http://bacontoday.com/turbaconducken-turducken-wrapped-in-bacon/
A1:23:35 <Syndlig> Bummer.
A1:23:49 <Evil-Ville> Yeah not yet
A1:23:51 <Parthon> a turbaconducken even
A1:23:59 <Lmaoboat> That's actually kind of ccreepy
A1:24:11 <Parthon> it is, but it looks pretty good cooked :P
A1:24:20 <Lmaoboat> Looks like something you'd find in a serial kikkler's basement
A1:25:09 <Evil-Ville> I'd totally eat turbaconducken
A1:26:20 <Parthon> same :D
A1:33:30 <Parthon> what's wrong with us? :P
A1:34:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Why would there be?
A1:38:20 <Syndlig> Okay
A1:38:28 <Syndlig> Server's up but now we get this... fucked up problem.
A1:38:30 <Syndlig> "left the game"
A1:38:35 <Syndlig> x a billion

A5:58:53 <Parthon> well, all water that is sourced from the top of the map, so pools would remain, but the largest parts of water/lava would be deleted

A6:15:25 <Quatroking> Hi there
A6:16:47 <Wingboy> hi
A6:17:46 <Parthon> I could make the buildings shorter, and raise the whole level up to level 32
A6:17:50 <Parthon> which is ocean level
A6:17:54 <Parthon> that way, noone could flood it
A6:18:04 <citricsquid> floods = cool
A6:18:09 <Parthon> after this though, I plan on making a city generator that just uses the natural terrain
A6:18:14 <citricsquid> Someone needs to build noahs ark and flood a city with it in :D
A6:18:15 <Parthon> or modifying it to work with
A6:18:32 <Parthon> so you generate a map, run the city placer and it puts a city on the generated terrain
A6:18:46 <Parthon> but for now, ciao

A6:22:20 <Quatroking> Parthon, did you release your map editor on the interwebs already?
A6:22:25 <Quatroking> Because I WANT it.
A6:22:41 <Quatroking> I'd kill babies and set a child hospital on fire for it
A6:24:27 <vdgmprgrmr> You sir, are a sick, sick person.
A6:25:56 <Quatroking> I am.
A6:27:11 <citricsquid> What sort of game is minecraft? Adventure, platform?
A6:27:56 <vdgmprgrmr> It's kinda like GTA.
A6:28:41 <Wingboy> sandbox i would call it
A6:28:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I think GTA ripoff is a pretty good label.
A6:29:22 <citricsquid> There isn't a category for sandbox :( Adventure & RPG, Puzzle and simulation seem to be the only vaguely relevant categories
A6:29:27 <citricsquid> gone for RPG and adventure, haha.
A6:29:31 <Quatroking> Sandbox is a genre...
A6:29:44 <Quatroking> It's just not used that much
A6:29:48 <citricsquid> Not listed as an option on this site :(
A6:29:52 <Quatroking> What site?
A6:30:00 <citricsquid> http://wakoopa.com
A6:30:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Honestly, "sandbox" is the only real word that can be applied to Minecraft, because that is literally what it is.
A6:30:21 <vdgmprgrmr> It is a box, filled with stuff.
A6:30:25 <vdgmprgrmr> And you build with it.
A6:30:27 <citricsquid> I put sandbox in the description :)

A7:11:44 <citricsquid> You can specify port, but notch said that you can only have 4 servers per IP address communicating with the main server. So if you set up 5 servers, each on a different port from the same machine the last one won't work.

P1:38:29 <Notch> possibly
P1:38:33 <Boinciel> If only water and lava tiles didn't just spawn more water/lava, and actually flowed
P1:38:34 <citricsquid> Notch; does deleting a sponge release the water or delete it?
P1:38:34 <liq3> I certainly hope not lava >.>
P1:38:38 <Vetle> does it have a function yet?
P1:38:43 <Notch> delete
P1:38:43 <Vetle> or just texture?

P1:38:52 <Parthon> yes we do
P1:38:54 <Notch> it DOES work, but.. well
P1:38:56 <citricsquid> Lava makes it fun, lava is preventable.
P1:38:59 <liq3> We just flood the lava with water to turn it into rock, then mine the rock, then sponge the water up!

P1:43:51 <liq3> Eh, be kinda nice if it hanged around.
P1:43:59 <citricsquid> I maintain that sponge should suck up players and make them unable to play.
P1:44:00 <liq3> so if it gets flooded again it starts sucking rigth away.
P1:44:06 <Vetle> right

P1:46:03 <citricsquid> silly me

P2:10:08 <Syniphas> Not
P2:10:11 <Syniphas> not 20 euros

P2:10:13 <liq3> Syniphas: make one and ask for donations. xD

P2:10:18 <Syniphas> I will
P2:10:19 <citricsquid> liq: best idea
P2:10:24 <doohan> Even then I wouldn't.
P2:10:31 <liq3> Yeh, most ppl won't.
P2:10:32 <Syniphas> Do I need a credit card to make a paypal account?
P2:10:35 <Jay_> no
P2:10:35 <citricsquid> No
P2:10:37 <liq3> Nope.
P2:10:41 <Syniphas> OK
P2:10:42 <liq3> You can use your bank account.
P2:10:48 <Quatroking> or nothing
P2:10:50 <citricsquid> There we go, now I own MINECRAFTFORUM.NET
P2:10:51 <Syniphas> Yeah, I don't have that either
P2:10:52 <Quatroking> and spend your money online
P2:10:53 <liq3> Nothing is kinda silly. :/l
P2:11:00 <Quatroking> I do it :P
P2:11:03 <liq3> Although I guess he could use the money to buy stuff onlinee
P2:11:04 <Syniphas> Quatroking, cool
P2:11:05 <Syniphas> thanks
P2:11:09 <Syniphas> I'll do that

P2:13:24 <Jay|WURM|> Notch: do you plan on allowing admins to spawn water and lava?  :D
P2:13:24 <Arzock> this one guy: bInk182 thought we would believe he hacked the server xD
P2:13:25 <Celdur> it would be great if you could see someones name from afar
P2:13:35 <Celdur> looking at someone to reveal their name would be usefull
P2:13:48 <Celdur> i had a few times i saw someone griefing and i had no idea who it was

P2:15:53 <Notch> i just see random bits of the chat. =)
P2:15:55 <bokonon> I was wondering if the game will ever get its own client or always be browser based
P2:15:56 <Zumbuster> you know I was the first person to beat it 
P2:15:57 <Notch> it's nothing personal
P2:16:00 <Zumbuster> after rosseta
P2:16:10 <Jay|WURM|> I'll repeat my question then
P2:16:19 <Jay|WURM|> Notch: do you plan on allowing admins to spawn water and lava?  :D
P2:16:23 <Parthon> yes
P2:16:36 <Notch> not before finite water

P2:17:23 <MANIA> Celdur
P2:17:29 <Vetle> to stop griefers: add "Notch" to banned file

P2:17:31 <kingnerd> Notch we are outside the boundaries of the map
P2:17:34 <MANIA> not too
P2:17:38 <kingnerd> the guy doing it set the spawn there
P2:17:39 <MANIA> I have a screenshot
P2:17:40 <kingnerd> and it works fine
P2:17:44 <MANIA> where he actually told me he wrecked yoshi

P2:18:55 <Celdur> i dunno man that was pretty stupid
P2:18:56 <Celdur> >.>
P2:18:59 <MANIA> i got really MAD
P2:19:02 <MANIA> being banned 3 times
P2:19:05 <MANIA> while trying to explain
P2:19:10 <MANIA> let that happen to you ;)
P2:19:24 <Celdur> well you should have thought about it from my perspective
P2:19:30 <Celdur> ip ban coming back is never a good thing
P2:19:37 <MANIA> sry
P2:19:38 <Mikesword221> Firefox crashed AGAIN.
P2:19:45 <MANIA> but admins banning on "OMG MANIA BUSTED"
P2:19:46 <Fuglebukk> minecraft crashes my java!! :(
P2:19:50 <MANIA> is never a good thing
P2:19:54 <MANIA> because he tricked me
P2:19:55 <Celdur> i busted you
P2:19:56 <Celdur> :P
P2:20:12 <MANIA> you didn't because I did not wreck anything :)
P2:20:20 <Vetle> java crashed my  firefox
P2:20:27 <Celdur> i was following you digging a water tunnel
P2:20:42 <Celdur> and then i came into the test chamber through that tunnel
P2:20:42 <Fuglebukk> but i want to play minecraft...
P2:20:45 <Celdur> and it was flooded
P2:20:45 <kingnerd> we're still outside the map :O
P2:20:55 <MANIA> it was flooded before i even came there
P2:21:05 <MANIA> was my name "mania"?
P2:21:10 <Celdur> yes
P2:21:10 <liq3> Fuglebukk: Try a different browser?
P2:21:15 <Celdur> anyway if i did wrong im sorry
P2:21:21 <MANIA> then it def. was not on purpose
P2:21:23 <Awol10> someone needs to /setspawn inside the map
P2:21:24 <Parthon> I hate working on case statements
P2:21:27 <Celdur> but still doesnt give you the right to do that anti ipban stuff

P2:21:46 <MANIA> please
P2:22:01 <kingnerd> this is a cool bug though
P2:22:13 <Fuglebukk> liq3: I've tried chrome, opera and IE8. updated java. it just dumps an error report that makes no sense to me on my desktop. :(
P2:22:18 <Quatroking> holy shit, I have 9 players right now
P2:22:18 <MANIA> I was swimming in water outside the moment I got banned
P2:22:19 <Jay|WURM|> If it's moving all your spawn points, wouldn't that mean it was a server admin doing it?
P2:22:22 <MANIA> doing nothing -.-
P2:22:36 <kingnerd> Jay|WURM|, I gave him op to set the spawn outside the map
P2:22:38 <liq3> Fuglebukk: Dunno. Try asking Notch for help.
P2:22:43 <kingnerd> so I could see if I could replicate the bug for others
P2:22:44 <MANIA> after that I tried to explain that, but it was useless
P2:22:48 <Jay|WURM|> I see
P2:22:50 <kingnerd> He's as confused as we are
P2:22:54 <kingnerd> it's not a hack it's a glitch
P2:23:34 <Celdur> notch: may i suggest that if you look at a player that you see his name in the corner or something...so that you can see who is who in the distance
P2:23:48 <Jay|WURM|> has the /teleport client update come in?  >.>
P2:23:56 <liq3> Celdur: Another way is non-scaling nametags... although that could be annoying.
P2:24:17 <liq3> Maybe if you look at them their name draws in front of everything else and removes scaling?
P2:24:32 <Celdur> it would
P2:24:43 <Jay|WURM|> could just have it pop up by the crosshair, similar to how a lot of FPS's do it
P2:25:09 <liq3> Jay: Yeh, but those don't have permenant floating nametags. :p
P2:25:24 <Jay|WURM|> true
P2:26:01 <paul|not> I think a minimap of sorts would be good
P2:26:04 <Nalok> Notch, again, will we get switches, levers, buttons, etc?

P2:34:51 <doohan> Nalok, what server are you on/
P2:34:51 <Celdur> cause its gonna be finite

P2:37:59 <Celdur> SNAKE EATER
P2:38:00 <kingnerd> Will sponges and water require a server update?
P2:38:03 <MANIA> its kind of hard to get the right color
P2:38:05 <Jay|WURM|> seems useless to take the time out to fix hacks when there's no objectives..  be like fixing hacks on a Garry's Mod build server, why bother?
P2:38:05 <kingnerd> glass*
P2:38:09 <Mikesword221> Some one do the doomguy! I would but I don't have the game right now.
P2:38:23 <Jay|WURM|> kingnerd yes
P2:38:25 <MANIA> funny would be a skin with everything on the back
P2:38:33 <MANIA> the face and stuff
P2:38:35 <Jay|WURM|> they're new tiles, the server has to know how to handle them
P2:38:35 <Roras> glass shoiuld look like stripes with transparency on them
P2:38:37 <kingnerd> damn... Somone just highlight me or something when they release it

P2:43:03 <MikeStar> Kefka
P2:43:17 <paul|not> are there any minimum specs for hosting servers
P2:43:17 <Celdur> :/
P2:43:30 <Roras> THIS GAME
P2:43:31 <kingnerd> paul|not, from what I've seen using top the stats required are fairly low
P2:43:34 <Roras> lol
P2:43:35 <Roras> pwn
P2:43:37 <citricsquid> pauk: they run well off pretty much nothing
P2:43:43 <paul|not> lol
P2:43:45 <Roras> too bad
P2:43:51 <paul|not> 1.6 ghz 1 gb ram oughta work then
P2:43:52 <citricsquid> 20MB ram and 0.2ghz is about what mine use each
P2:43:55 <Roras> this game is waay too difficult to code
P2:43:56 <kingnerd> paul|not, I am hosting a big server on a 500mhz celeron with 1gb RAM and 4gb SSD and it doesn't even close to take up all the resources
P2:44:03 <paul|not> cool
P2:44:05 <Roras> so i cant customize very well
P2:44:13 <citricsquid> I'm running 4 of a P4 and they run beautifully :D
P2:45:06 <Roras> :( im no programmer
P2:45:15 <Nalok> I'm still waiting for an Altair skin >:|
P2:45:17 <MikeStar> are there any tutorials or anything for customizing servers?  or is it a "figure it out" kind of thing?
P2:45:27 <ZimBuster> ^that
P2:45:27 <kingnerd> customize how MikeStar 
P2:45:30 <citricsquid> There's very little you can do atm
P2:45:37 <ZimBuster> I think he means map hacking
P2:45:37 <Jay|WURM|> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Jay
P2:45:40 <MikeStar> custom map sizes and such
P2:45:42 <Awol10> MikeStar: Think most of us are "just figure it out"

P2:47:24 <Nalok> FUCKIN RUN MAYUN! RUUUUUUNNNNNN
P2:47:24 <doohan> And then he'll probably have to pay tax on it too.
P2:47:27 <citricsquid> I'm too scared to go and look
P2:47:59 <Mikesword221> Let me go get a calcuator.
P2:48:07 <Roras> ...
P2:48:14 <Roras> um
P2:48:17 <Roras> lol
P2:48:21 <Roras> i need cash
P2:48:32 <ZimBuster> mow some lawns 
P2:48:35 <kingnerd> Roras how old are you?
P2:48:59 <Nalok> Man, I should buy TF2 and HL2 off steam
P2:49:11 <doohan> tf2 ins't that good
P2:49:11 <ZimBuster> yes you should
P2:49:14 <Nalok> Wait..HL1 is on Steam too right?
P2:49:22 <Quatroking> I only have TF2 for the gmod models
P2:49:22 <ZimBuster> uuh it is good
P2:49:23 <Quatroking> lol
P2:49:26 <Mikesword221> 1$
P2:49:28 <Awol10> I love TF2
P2:49:32 <Quatroking> and because it came with the orange box
P2:49:35 <MikeStar> hl1 is on steam
P2:49:37 <liq3> TF2 IS AWESOME
P2:49:42 <MikeStar> l4d is better than tf2
P2:49:58 <Quatroking> the l4d community is worser than rape
P2:50:02 <ZimBuster> I think not,, but thats just my personal taste
P2:50:03 <Nalok> I have TF2 on 360, and it's getting hella modded
P2:50:04 <MikeStar> oh yeah
P2:50:12 <Ylle> TF2 is okay, runs on a pretty good engine and the graphics are pretty original
P2:50:12 <citricsquid> For the forum, what sort of ranks should I have? "Miner"?
P2:50:31 <ZimBuster> start of with Mob
P2:50:32 <MANIA> Gold Vein Spotter
P2:50:33 <Roras> i am the lazieest man on earth
P2:50:35 <Nalok> "Notch's Apprentice" for mods
P2:50:41 <Ylle> You know UT3 will look like garbage eventually, but TF2s distinct style will keep it pretty fresh :V
P2:50:44 <Roras> er... 16 yr old
P2:50:45 <Mikesword221> Notch has 2,107.14
P2:50:50 <Quatroking> mods should be called golddiggers
P2:50:55 <Ylle> mmm ut3
P2:50:57 <Ylle> pretteh
P2:51:06 <citricsquid> I already put gold diggers for some, I'll switch it to mods :D
P2:51:13 <Quatroking> and banned members should have the rank "fell in the magma"
P2:51:15 <Ylle> but the best ut is 2k4
P2:51:33 <Ylle> assault_convoy ftw. Or just plain rankin
P2:51:35 <citricsquid> quatro: ace idea!
P2:51:41 <Nalok> Penny-Arcade on Steam, Fucking A
P2:51:49 <Quatroking> It's been on steam for AGES
P2:51:57 <Quatroking> Over a year
P2:51:58 <ZimBuster> its there since,,, since..
P2:52:05 <ZimBuster> since community I think
P2:52:08 <Ylle> It's been there since sega was good
P2:52:11 <Nalok> I just noticed, since I just got steam, lol
P2:52:20 <ZimBuster> lol
P2:52:38 <ZimBuster> I remember when I got steam..
P2:52:44 <Quatroking> Same here
P2:52:48 <Quatroking> When I bought HL2
P2:52:50 <Mikesword221> Me three.
P2:52:52 <Ylle> I remember when they shut down WON. Losers.
P2:52:53 <Quatroking> Good times
P2:52:59 <Nalok> What's with the 89 next to LFD?
P2:53:09 <Quatroking> I thought, "hey, this shit is easy" and now I own over 50 gameso n Steam
P2:53:10 <Mikesword221> L4D?
P2:53:10 <Ylle> Won >>>>> steam
P2:53:23 <MikeStar> Left 4 Dead
P2:53:27 <Nalok> I'm guessing the ratings
P2:53:29 <ZimBuster> Steam made me buy games
P2:53:40 <Celdur> i have around 70 steam games >.>
P2:53:45 <Ylle> Steam was such crap in the beginning.
P2:53:45 <Roras> steam  is?
P2:53:46 <MikeStar> WON was crap
P2:53:46 <Mikesword221> I knew that. I was correcting him.
P2:53:50 <Roras> what is steam
P2:53:51 <Ylle> But now, it's pretty cool.
P2:53:52 <Quatroking> Steam is a gaming platform
P2:53:55 <Roras> ???
P2:53:56 <MikeStar> now i've got a super low steamid ;D
P2:54:03 <Roras> idk 
P2:54:11 <icntslp> steampowered.com
P2:54:13 <Quatroking> You buy games online, they get on your steam account and you can legally download them wherever you are
P2:54:14 <ZimBuster> I dont know why people care about low steamids..
P2:54:19 <Ylle> I really liked won, I had way less ping on my 56k on won than on steam.
P2:54:22 <MikeStar> lol
P2:54:23 <citricsquid> Steam is an excellent platform
P2:54:24 <Roras> oh
P2:54:32 <Celdur> i bet steam killed allot of pirates
P2:54:41 <Roras> interesting
P2:54:43 <Ylle> I bet valve killed alot of pirates.
P2:54:45 <Celdur> i mean pirates dont usualy pirate to avoid paying
13P2:54:46 * ZimBuster points at self
P2:54:56 <Ylle> Seeing how valve actually takes care of the customer AFTER they buy the game
P2:54:57 <Nalok> I'm downloading the HL2 demo, to try it out on PC
P2:54:57 <Celdur> they just dont like all the cd bullshit
P2:55:00 <Ylle> nowadays if you buy a game
P2:55:05 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/index.php Sign up guys ;)
P2:55:07 <Roras> just get a USB
P2:55:08 <Quatroking> Valve at the E3: Hye guys, its the zombie game from last winter, but now with 300% more banjo music and bloom!
P2:55:10 <Celdur> yknow how fucking stupid it is to get a game nowadays?
P2:55:11 <Ylle> you buy it, the devs don't give a hoot about you
P2:55:15 <Celdur> with all the DRM shit
P2:55:18 <Lmaoboat> Those CDs are a pain
P2:55:19 <citricsquid> L4D2 will be awesome
P2:55:20 <Lmaoboat> I mean
P2:55:21 <Celdur> and usualy there is a patch for a game
P2:55:25 <Celdur> on DAY ONE
P2:55:27 <Lmaoboat> You have to get them out of the case
P2:55:29 <Quatroking> Left 4 Dead will be facerape for valve
P2:55:36 <Ylle> DRM isn't actually about preventing piracy you know
P2:55:36 <Lmaoboat> And then you have to press the button
P2:55:42 <Ylle> It's about killing the second hand market
P2:55:46 <Lmaoboat> And sometimes it's takes awhile for it to close
P2:55:49 <Celdur> yeah but
P2:55:54 <Celdur> im just talking about how annoying it is
P2:55:57 <sppt> when i heard l4d2, i kinda thought of r2d2
P2:55:58 <Celdur> and how easy it is to pirate
P2:55:59 <Ylle> Oh ya
P2:56:05 <Celdur> and its even easier to buy a game on steam
P2:56:08 <Quatroking> oh, the havoc that broke loose on the steam forums when they announced l4d2

P2:56:26 <Celdur> DRM is promoting pirating

P2:56:28 <Celdur> if anything
P2:56:29 <Roras> hm
P2:56:30 <Mikesword221> 3 to join!
P2:56:31 <Ylle> They all say it's good for killing pirating, but that's just to lull in uninformed people. Infact, it just makes piracy worse.
P2:56:33 <Nalok> Lol, it'll be ready to play in....11 minutes
P2:56:36 <sppt> its stupid because its basically the same game, just diff maps
P2:56:39 <ZimBuster> good idea notch
P2:56:42 <citricsquid> So which of you managed to register notch? :D
P2:56:43 <Ylle> Yeah
P2:56:45 <Mikesword221> And a new place to go to.
P2:56:49 <Notch> I did, citricsquid. =)
P2:56:51 <Roras> Nalok = notch?
P2:56:56 <ZimBuster> just redirect the official forum to that
P2:56:56 <Celdur> the l4d2 boycot is bullshit

P2:57:13 <Ylle> sppt: I agree, I raged hard when they released super mario world, pretty much the same as 3 but with some updgrades here and there.
P2:57:16 <Nalok> This forum is awesome
P2:57:21 <citricsquid> I thought it looked better there, quat :P
P2:57:28 <Notch> it looks really nice, nalok
P2:57:38 <Celdur> l4d2 boycott is bullshit
P2:57:39 <Notch> my sponge is doing infinite loops, heh
P2:57:44 <Notch> I agree with Celdur 
P2:57:45 <Quatroking> If you want I can make a bigger logo
P2:57:50 <Notch> but l4d2 is bullshit as well
P2:57:50 <Celdur> they will still expand l4d1
P2:57:55 <Lmaoboat> What bugs me is when people say the compaines should be responsible for protecting their intellectual property, and not the gov't, and then turn around and bitch about DRM
P2:57:58 <Quatroking> using CS4 master collection ^^
P2:58:06 <Celdur> the only reason its done so fast
P2:58:11 <Celdur> is because of the AIdirector
P2:58:17 <Celdur> all they need to do for the maps is make the maps
P2:58:20 <Celdur> no items no enemies
P2:58:22 <Celdur> no nothin
P2:58:31 <Ylle> The companies should bother more about making a product people want to buy, rather than shell out $50 for something only worth a couple of hours.
P2:58:31 <Celdur> i mean its still sorta cheap
P2:58:33 <sppt> notch, which server is the one with the map hack ( from the blog)

P2:58:39 <modx> what application can you use to backup maps every minute ?
P2:58:42 <Quatroking> all animations EXACTLY THE SAME

P2:59:14 <Notch> I'm very very flattered =D
P2:59:16 <modx> what application can you use to backup maps every minute ?

P2:59:37 <Celdur> well they make those constantly >.>
P2:59:47 <Celdur> im not saying that l4d2 isnt entirely cheap
P2:59:54 <MikeStar> l4d doesn't have a dev kit
P2:59:58 <Quatroking> the l4d SDK isn't even released yet
P3:00:03 <Mikesword221> Nalok, can I post the new blocks update?
P3:00:03 <Ylle> Uuuh
P3:00:04 <ZimBuster> its in beta
P3:00:05 <Celdur> im just saying that all the guys complaining about l4d2 too much do so because they are just spoiled
P3:00:08 <ZimBuster> you can get it already
P3:00:10 <Celdur> by tf2 updates ect.
P3:00:13 <ZimBuster> I played around with it
P3:00:14 <icntslp> are the new forums the new official forums?
P3:00:16 <Celdur> wah wah we dont get free stuff
P3:00:18 <Ylle> while in beta I haven't had any problems with the l4d sdk..
P3:00:25 <ZimBuster> kind of cool

P4:58:31 <Quatroking> 100 by 100 is a great size

P5:18:28 <Spazzo> Well, that's my theory.
P5:18:32 <Parthon> it's just writing bytes to a file

P5:57:56 <peerkoel> yes you can
P5:58:04 <zid> Parthon: Tell me if it needs deleting ;)
P5:58:27 <Parthon> nah, but you can if you want to
P5:58:41 <Parthon> I set all the sliders to max, and put nothing but a flat plain of water in
P5:58:56 <zid> ideally, yes, I need to migrate the old bot's logic to the new framework
P5:59:00 <Lyon> I've seen server with the huge map in, I just dont know how to generate it
P5:59:02 <Parthon> and it was only 8 hours ago when I was bashing my head against a severly weird problem
P5:59:13 <Syniphas> Lemme run a small poll around here
P5:59:30 <Syniphas> How many of you would donate to me if I released a map editor for minecraft?
P5:59:46 <Parthon> me, but only if it had generation capabilities :D
P5:59:54 <Lyon> Couple quid sure
P6:00:04 <Syniphas> You could load a server-generated map
P6:00:07 <Syniphas> And edit that
P6:00:22 <Syniphas> I don't really know anything about procedural generating
P6:00:31 <Syniphas> I mean, I could pull something off, but
P6:00:50 <obnub> Probably not, no.  That's what I love minecraft for
P6:00:52 <Syniphas> I wouldn't know what to generate that could be more usable than the original generator minecraft has
P6:01:00 <Syniphas> obnub: What
P6:01:06 <Syniphas> For... not needing donations?
P6:01:10 <Syniphas> Yeah, okay.

P6:01:30 <Lyon> If you save a SP map, does it save locally?
P6:01:34 <Syniphas> everyone misses the point here
P6:01:37 <Syniphas> No
P6:01:49 <Syniphas> but I think notch made a way to download them
P6:01:57 <Lyon> Oh
P6:02:02 <Lyon> Any more on that?
P6:02:08 <Syniphas> nope
P6:02:10 <Syniphas> sorry

P6:08:32 <Zuriki> For quick switching
P6:08:39 <Syniphas> It kinda blows for editing

P7:05:30 <ZomBuster> and place primitives
P7:05:42 <liq3> kinda small ain't it?
P7:05:42 <Syniphas> I could... by keyboard
P7:06:01 <Syniphas> liq3, that's a normal 256x256 level
P7:06:04 <Syniphas> ..!!!
P7:06:08 <liq3> no, i mean the pixels lol.
P7:06:10 <Syniphas> I GOT ANOTHER GREAT IDEA
P7:06:13 <liq3> you're going to need a zoom button. :p
P7:06:23 <Syniphas> liq3, allows all 256x256 pixels to show
P7:06:28 <Syniphas> it will have
P7:06:29 <Syniphas> ANYWAYS
P7:06:35 <Syniphas> HOW ABOUT
P7:06:37 <liq3> yeh, need 2x, 3x, 4x, etc etc zoom. :p
P7:06:44 <Syniphas> DIFFERENT VIEWS
P7:06:53 <Syniphas> No isometric, no nothing
P7:07:06 <Syniphas> way easier to code :D
P7:07:20 <Zuriki> Syniphas, whats that?
P7:07:26 <ZomBuster> side view you mean
P7:07:31 <ZomBuster> yeh would be cool
P7:07:34 <Syniphas> Like on a 3D editing program
P7:07:35 <Syniphas> you got top
P7:07:38 <Syniphas> left
P7:07:40 <Syniphas> right
P7:07:43 <Syniphas> etc
P7:07:45 <Zuriki> And 3D
P7:07:47 <liq3> and a 3d window. :p
P7:07:47 <Zuriki> :]
P7:07:53 <Syniphas> lol
P7:07:58 <Zuriki> Which could be isometric
P7:08:18 <Syniphas> Are you willing to program it? :|
P7:08:27 <Zuriki> FreeBasic you say?
P7:08:34 <Syniphas> I'm just looking forward to releasing it still today
P7:08:42 <Syniphas> One day it might have isometric
P7:08:44 <Syniphas> just not today
P7:08:51 <Zuriki> Isometric is just 2x1
P7:09:16 <Zuriki> For every 2pixels on x it's 1 on y
P7:09:48 <Zuriki> Idk exactly how the maps are stored.

P7:12:27 <Syniphas> it's hard to draw isometrically
P7:12:35 <Syniphas> And still enable the user to edit it
P7:12:52 <Syniphas> Well, it's not exactly hard
P7:12:54 <Zuriki> Well, I don't use Freebasic.
P7:12:59 <Syniphas> I just can't bring myself to
P7:13:02 <Zuriki> I have no idea how it works.
P7:13:02 <Syniphas> Somehow...
P7:13:07 <Syniphas> Just like C
P7:13:12 <Syniphas> except, simpler to learn
P7:13:17 <Zuriki> Um
P7:13:17 <Syniphas> And I don't know C
P7:13:19 <Zuriki> Okay.
P7:13:21 <Zuriki> XD
P7:13:28 <liq3> C is actually really easy once you get it lol.
P7:13:41 <Syniphas> Yeahno.
P7:13:50 <Zuriki> I use a GDK which makes drawing and input and stuff really easy.
P7:14:04 <Zuriki> And you can still use C/C++ with it for custom stuff.

P7:34:43 <liq3> lol zuriki. XD

P7:34:56 <liq3> Syniphas: Should be checking every tile type...
P7:35:05 <Zuriki> I've never worked with single bytes you see
P7:35:09 <Syniphas> ...for water?
P7:35:16 <liq3> 00 to 18
P7:35:19 <Zuriki> I just work with the standard stuff like int, char and what not
P7:35:22 <liq3> and handle for each. :p

P7:36:31 <Zuriki> Okay
P7:36:50 <liq3> Zuriki: You do stuff like char(1). >.>
P7:36:55 <liq3> Makes a byte 01. 
P7:36:55 <Zuriki> char[1]
P7:37:05 <Zuriki> Look
P7:37:07 <liq3> nah () not []. 
P7:37:09 <liq3> [] is for arrays. :p
P7:37:18 <Vahue> what language is char(1) from
P7:37:22 <liq3> C++...
P7:37:25 <Zuriki> Don't do stuff like that to me because I've not worked in binary.
P7:37:26 <Vahue> uh?
P7:37:33 <liq3> it's type casting. -_-
P7:37:39 <liq3> it converts integer 1 into a char.
P7:37:42 <Zuriki> Well whatever.
P7:37:46 <Vahue> you should do it (char)1

P7:44:43 <Vahue> hmmm!
P7:44:43 <Syniphas> width limits are in the map file
P7:44:46 <Syniphas> from that
P7:44:53 <Vahue> someone make a 512x512x256 map
P7:44:54 <Syniphas> minecraft generates those blocks
P7:44:57 <Syniphas> Vahue
P7:45:00 <Syniphas> they have
P7:45:12 <Vahue> :<
P7:45:18 <Zuriki> If I understood the map file better
P7:45:28 <Zuriki> I could probably make a visual editor

P7:45:50 <Syniphas> I can help you with the format
P7:45:52 <Zuriki> Which specific class file
P7:45:56 <Zuriki> They're all a/b/c
P7:46:01 <Vahue> not sure some are obfuscated
P7:46:11 <Vahue> search for 'blocks'
P7:46:18 <Vahue> thats the name of the block data array

P7:46:29 <Vahue> sorry i forgot

P7:49:55 <Zuriki> Jesus, this is confusing since none of it is commented and all the variables are i,j,k,l etc etc
P7:50:16 <Vahue> its obfuscated, not supposed to be easy to steal code
P7:50:21 <Vahue> look in a.class
P7:50:29 <Vahue> its the saving routine
P7:50:29 <Zuriki> Which one :P

P7:53:36 <Syniphas> I feel like I'm slowly getting somewhere
P7:54:03 <Vahue> you should be able to toggle the layers behind the current one
P7:54:14 <Zuriki>         int i = (int)aabb.x0;
P7:54:16 <Vahue> maybe make them faded or something

P7:54:23 <Zuriki>         int k1 = (int)aabb.z1 + 1;
P7:54:25 <Zuriki> Imo obscure.
P7:54:34 <Zuriki> Idk what aabb is

P7:54:40 <Vahue> its a bounding box
P7:54:44 <Syniphas> I'm kinda getting bored of this...
P7:55:06 <Syniphas> You guys really want something usable out of this for right now?
P7:55:32 <Syniphas> I can make zoom settings, 3 different cursors and a way to edit the map
P7:55:48 <Syniphas> You still have to compress/decompress it yourself
P7:55:53 <Syniphas> I recomment 7zip
P7:56:03 <Syniphas> Anyone up for this?

P11:11:59 <Eagle> imagine what a sponge at the bottom of a lake with finite water would look like.
P11:12:05 <liq3> Might be useful in Team Survival too.
P11:12:11 <Real> there should be a link that says survival and when you go to it the page is simply the text "Soon."
P11:12:18 <liq3> lol
P11:12:24 <Zuriki> Hm
P11:12:32 <Zuriki> Cause water is infinate
P11:12:35 <Real> what if the sponge expands to replace the water?
P11:12:51 <Real> then you have to delete all the newly created spongeblocks
P11:12:57 <Real> how do people feel about that?
P11:12:59 <Evil-Ville> That would make it the ultimate griefing tool

P11:13:47 <liq3> Zuriki: If drowning is in Survival, think of the uses. :p
P11:13:55 <Evil-Ville> There wouldn't be water anywhere anymore

P11:14:05 <Zuriki> Awesome
P11:14:10 <Real> i wouldn't mind that haha
P11:14:12 <liq3> I mean, afiak, sponges will be hard as hell to get in Survival anyway.
P11:14:18 <liq3> If possible at all.
P11:14:27 <Zuriki> Collectable item
P11:14:34 <Eagle> Sponges live in the ocean in real life.
P11:14:34 <Zuriki> You got A SPONGE!
P11:14:43 <liq3> Since you need to collect tiles in Survival before you can create them.
P11:14:47 <Zuriki> Imagine that in an RPG.
P11:15:01 <Evil-Ville> Notch said he wanted to keep them in some form because he likes the texture
P11:15:06 <Eagle> I guess you'd find them at the bottom of lakes?
P11:15:10 <Eagle> Somehow?
P11:15:10 <liq3> "Sponge soaks up Water Blast."

P11:15:35 <Eagle> Haha
P11:15:43 <zid> It's dangerous to go alone! Take this! 
P11:15:51 <Eagle> I guess maybe they'd have to soak up a certain amount and be done
P11:15:56 <liq3> I bet we'll get something silly, like trees will drop seeds that can grow thm.
P11:15:59 <Eagle> And you'd have a wet sponge
P11:16:02 <Zuriki> Then it regerates
P11:16:15 <Zuriki> regenerates*
P11:16:19 <Zuriki> The water that is
P11:16:28 <Zuriki> Due to infiniteness
P11:16:35 <Eagle> And if you stand on sponge blocks, water would come out! :O
P11:16:39 <liq3> Am I the only one super excited about lava traps in CTF or Team survival? o.O
P11:16:40 <Zuriki> XD
P11:16:44 <Eagle> Except that wouldn't be fun.
P11:16:56 <Zuriki> Flood a map with a wet sponge
P11:17:07 <Zuriki> ULTIMATE WEAPON
P11:17:08 <Real> ultimate griefing would be the ability to pick up a full sponge and place it elsewhere, then be able to get some water out
P11:17:29 <Kira> Is Notch going to add paint or colors? He kinda hinted it at a while ago
P11:17:29 <Eagle> The water evaporates out of it.
P11:17:33 <Eagle> Instantly
P11:17:48 <Zuriki> Or
P11:17:51 <Eagle> It's very very hot in minecraft world

P11:18:45 <Drakkar> death
P11:18:48 <Zuriki> Then there is no hope
P11:18:51 <Eagle> You'd travel to the Sth Dimension
P11:18:54 <Zuriki> You'll be dry as  Ibone
P11:18:58 <Eagle> and you'd never be able to come back
P11:19:00 <Evil-Ville> I'd really rather have my things flooded with water than with sponge

P11:19:25 <Drakkar> wait
P11:19:27 <Drakkar> sponges grow?

P11:19:46 <Evil-Ville> Sleeping
P11:19:46 <Eagle> I mean
P11:19:48 <Eagle> Sleeping
P11:19:49 <Real> take it easy
P11:19:50 <Drakkar> some kind of horrible sponge plant thing
P11:19:57 <Drakkar> as they absorb water they cover terrain
P11:20:03 <Evil-Ville> oh god
P11:20:03 <liq3> ROFL.
P11:20:10 <Drakkar> and if you smash a sponge
P11:20:11 <Drakkar> BAM
P11:20:12 <Drakkar> WATER
P11:20:12 <liq3> they spread. lulz.
P11:20:26 <Drakkar> they'd be like some sort of horrible LAND-DISEASE
P11:20:27 <liq3> You go into a cave and there's just sponges everywhere. D:
P11:20:29 <Drakkar> kind of e7ish really
P11:20:30 <Zuriki> Hm, a giant sponge monster.
P11:20:30 <Real> next new block: the LAND sponge
P11:20:32 <Zuriki> Awesome boss
P11:20:33 <Drakkar> xD
P11:20:51 <Evil-Ville> sponge golem
P11:21:01 <liq3> New game mode: Clean the world from the sponge scourge.
P11:21:03 <Zuriki> Spongebob Squarepants
P11:21:09 <Eagle> Everything would be going fine, your team is working together, and BAM you see a sponge enemy coming close.
P11:21:17 <Eagle> Suddenly everybody quits
P11:21:19 <Real> Spongebob BLOCKpants
P11:21:28 <Zuriki> Square/Block
P11:21:34 <Real> false
P11:21:46 <Real> 2D does not equal 3D
P11:21:50 <liq3> Squarebob Spongepants.
P11:21:52 <Zuriki> I said divide
P11:21:53 <Real> boom, roasted
P11:21:55 <Evil-Ville> You could get infected with sponge disease and turn into a sponge zombie
P11:21:59 <Eagle> Spongebob does not have square pants.
P11:22:04 <Eagle> That would imply that he has 2D pants
P11:22:11 <Zuriki> He does.
P11:22:13 <Real> also correct
P11:22:15 <Eagle> Plus they'd be rectangles
P11:22:17 <Zuriki> It's  2D cartoon
P11:22:22 <liq3> They're actual rectangluar.
P11:22:25 <Real> unless, of course,
P11:22:27 <Eagle> I already said that
P11:22:31 <Zuriki> Blah blah shush
P11:22:39 <Eagle> Sponge zombie?
P11:22:40 <Eagle> :OOO
P11:22:41 <Evil-Ville> Minecraft is a 2D game
P11:22:41 <Real> square refers to what the pants are made of
P11:22:45 <Evil-Ville> It all happens on a 2D plane
P11:22:46 <Real> a bunch if squares
P11:22:53 <liq3> Lol Minecraft is 2d? :P
P11:23:04 <Real> technically
P11:23:04 <liq3> rofl we need a 2d version of minecraft. xD
P11:23:07 <Eagle> Technically everything we see is 2D
P11:23:13 <Evil-Ville> yes
P11:23:17 <Eagle> Since we cannot see in 3D
P11:23:47 <notjotham> actually this is bullshit
P11:23:47 <Real> the eyes reflect and rotate 2D images, so that is correct
P11:23:47 <Eagle> If we could we would be able to see all 6 sides of a cube at once. :P
P11:23:50 <Zuriki> I can see in 4D
P11:23:54 <notjotham> you could say luminance is a dimension of measure
P11:24:09 <Eagle> Zuriki can see through TIME
P11:24:14 <Zuriki> Thats the idea
P11:24:15 <Real> i could also say that my rectum contains a black hole
P11:24:20 <notjotham> also we have stereoscopic vision so we could say the difference between the two input sources is the third dimension
P11:24:29 <notjotham> anyone who mentions time when talking about dimensions doesn't get it
P11:24:30 <Eagle> Must be kinda inconvenient, seeing EVERY POSSIBLE MOMENT AT ONCE
P11:24:33 <notjotham> needs a kick in the cunt
P11:24:40 <Zuriki> Eagle.
P11:24:45 <Zuriki> Eagle said it.
P11:24:46 <Real> actually, time is a dimension according to einstein
P11:24:52 <Eagle> I was /joking/ but okay
P11:24:58 <Eagle> hence the unneccesary caps
P11:24:59 <notjotham> i am not debating wether time can be considered a dimension
P11:25:01 <notjotham> anything can be
P11:25:16 <Real> hm
P11:25:19 <Real> i don't think so
P11:25:24 <notjotham> the fact it's a relevent inventoried dimension (i.e. the 4th) is not usually worth bringing up (hence saying 'doesn't get it')
P11:25:24 <liq3> I'm voting 4th dimension is the ability to make decisions. o.O
P11:25:25 <Zuriki> I have a cyclops living in my house.
P11:25:26 <Evil-Ville> I am a dimension
P11:25:48 <liq3> THE SKY IS BLUE
P11:25:51 <liq3> Moving on.
P11:25:55 <Eagle> No it's not
P11:26:00 <Real> the sky *appears* blue
P11:26:03 <Eagle> Yeah.
P11:26:04 <liq3> MOVING. ON.
P11:26:08 <Zuriki> The Sky is high.
P11:26:13 <notjotham> heaven is painted blue
P11:26:15 <Eagle> That doesn't even make /sense/
P11:26:17 <Real> from out reference point
P11:26:26 <Real> from our reference point, the sky is high
P11:26:44 <Eagle> What if the reference point is in space?
P11:26:44 <Zuriki> The sky doesn't exist.
P11:26:45 <notjotham> i spend a lot of time hiking, often traveling through the cloud layer, i have to say, if heaven is made of clouds it's a fucking dark wet cold miserable place
P11:26:47 <Real> from the north pole of the sun, the sky is low
P11:27:15 <Real> any other statements you'd like me to modify for correctness?
P11:27:24 <Real> ;)
P11:27:24 <Zuriki> Lets go to hell.
P11:27:31 <Eagle> Since the atmosphere is a sphere, from any point in space the sky would be low
P11:27:34 <Zuriki> Hell is nice and warm.
P11:27:34 <Real> Hell, Michigan?
P11:27:40 <Eagle> I live in Michigan.
P11:27:47 <Eagle> BTW, don't go to Michigan.
P11:27:52 <Real> Hell is a town/city in michigan
P11:27:57 <Eagle> I know this.
P11:28:00 <Zuriki> Whats Michigan
P11:28:02 <Zuriki> :p
P11:28:02 <Real> excellent
P11:28:07 <Eagle> BLLREDFSDFS
P11:28:11 <Eagle> Michigan is a state
P11:28:12 <Eagle> In the US
P11:28:19 <Eagle> In the shape of a mitten
P11:28:21 <Real> also, there is a town in the northeast (i think) called Mianus
P11:28:24 <Zuriki> Oh, I prefer not to pay attention to the US.
P11:28:30 <Real> it was featured on Jackass
P11:28:52 <Real> but, I digress
P11:28:53 <Eagle> Michigan is the worst state economically
P11:29:01 <Zuriki> It's like a Sponge.
P11:29:02 <Real> are you sure about that?
P11:29:02 <Eagle> But it has the nicest trees. :D
P11:29:09 <Real> have you heard of Florida?
P11:29:11 <Eagle> It's one of the worst ones.
P11:29:19 <Eagle> It also has the /most fat people/
P11:29:27 <Real> "budget crisis" is on the front page of every FL paper haha
P11:29:28 <Eagle> Like litterally it's at the top of the list
P11:29:32 <Eagle> Same in Michigan.
P11:29:36 <notjotham> i am from new zealand
P11:29:38 <notjotham> we have science
P11:29:42 <notjotham> you guys should try it
P11:29:45 <Eagle> New Zealand is beautiful I hear
P11:29:52 <Real> way better than old zealand, from what i hear
P11:29:58 <Zuriki> I'm from the UK.
P11:30:05 <notjotham> there is ambiguity about where old zealand is
P11:30:05 <Eagle> The UK is just a fad.
P11:30:08 <Zuriki> We have... immigrants.
P11:30:11 <Zuriki> XD
P11:30:20 <notjotham> it's either next to denmark or part of the netherlands
P11:30:31 <Eagle> US is made out of immigrants.
P11:30:39 <Eagle> Mostly mexican and korean.
P11:30:40 <Zuriki> US is just ARROGANT
P11:30:44 <Eagle> So?
P11:30:47 <Eagle> :P
P11:30:51 <Zuriki> PEE
P11:30:54 <Eagle> :O
P11:30:59 <Zuriki> Point Example Explain
P11:31:01 <Real> ah, yes, the UK: The United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland
P11:31:12 <Zuriki> I hate the UK
P11:31:16 <Zuriki> THOSE BASTARDS
P11:31:18 <notjotham> i've only visited the UK
