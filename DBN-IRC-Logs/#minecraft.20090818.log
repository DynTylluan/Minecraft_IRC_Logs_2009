A7:12:22 <doohan> A business card that was a magnet would be hilarious though
A7:12:34 <doohan> Specially when people put them in their wallets.
A7:12:46 <citricsquid> A business card that had one of those shop alarms in it would be brilliant. So when they go into a shop the alarms go off.

A9:17:57 <gear|works> person with highest treasure score wins?
A9:17:57 <08Notch> oohh, spectate mode :D
A9:18:19 <mezo> actually, if you only render objects visible to 1 or more players, you could have the spectators free roam
A9:18:34 <mezo> i say that because otherwise they could type stuff to living players and help them out (cheating known as ghosting)

A9:19:05 <gear|works> configurable imo

A9:20:44 <gear|works> i think this is getting too complex lmao
A9:20:46 <Iguana> Cows.
A9:20:55 <Sl1N0> Goblins.
A9:21:00 <mezo> notch, is zombie siege supposed to be a seperate "mode"?
A9:21:03 <Iguana> Dragons.
A9:21:10 <cal> trolls
A9:21:15 <Iguana> Gods.
A9:21:27 <ONI> Wolves
A9:21:28 <08Notch> It'll probably be the reference implemention when the scipting comes.
A9:21:35 <Miclee> Anyone know the link to join your own server?
A9:21:45 <cal> lol
A9:21:47 <Iguana> It's in the externalurl.txt
A9:21:48 <gear|works> it should be in a text file
A9:21:49 <mezo> but the idea is that some sort of game mode will exist where zombies flood the world and eat people, right
A9:21:50 <gear|works> called that
A9:21:57 <Miclee> It's not that link.
A9:22:04 <Iguana> Which one? Lol
A9:22:05 <Miclee> That link doesn't let you join your own server.
A9:22:18 <mezo> thinking in terms of modes is opposite your emergent gameplay philosophy
A9:22:22 <Iguana> Are the ports forwarded...?
A9:22:22 <cal> miclee
A9:22:23 <cal> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
A9:22:28 <Miclee> There we go.
A9:22:30 <Miclee> Thanks cal.
A9:22:37 <mezo> zombie siege doesn't have to be a 'mode', it could simply be one of many parameters of any given map
A9:22:54 <Iguana> I prefer gamemode tbh.
A9:23:06 <mezo> put in place by smaller pieces, like spawn points set to spit out zombies, and the zombies having orders to move to a certain place
A9:23:17 <Iguana> Easier to set up, cause then randomly in the middle of a game, someone sets off zombie seige? (if that's what your getting at)
A9:23:24 <mezo> no
10A9:23:30 * cal (cal@82-32-49-122.cable.ubr07.aztw.blueyonder.co.uk) has left #minecraft
A9:23:31 <mezo> this is why irc channels are so abysmal for this
A9:23:39 <Iguana> =|
A9:23:46 <Miclee> In zombie seige, couldn't you basically just dig a giant whole, cover the top with a few layers?
A9:23:47 <gear|works> iguana i think the idea is when scripting comes along
A9:23:52 <Miclee> hole*
A9:23:53 <gear|works> that you can make all these modes on your own

A9:24:20 <citricsquid> yeah and zombie siege will be an example mode which you can build on top of / edit / play as is. I think that's what he meant anyway.
A9:24:22 <gear|works> and i guess what notch is working on is the ability to have all these things
A9:24:25 <Iguana> Zombies should be able to destroy any player made block they touch.
A9:24:36 <gear|works> a platform for awesome if you will
A9:24:42 <Iguana> Lol
A9:24:53 <mezo> that sounds more inline with what i thought gear|works
A9:25:05 <iPope> freaky I was reading how citric was buying atomic bombs and theres a program on tv right now about it
A9:25:13 <gear|works> considering he plans to add scripting
A9:25:24 <08Notch> good I'm out of shape

A9:25:30 <08Notch> (doing pushups again finally)
A9:25:34 <gear|works> "heres the tools, go nuts"

A9:25:50 <08Notch> just did the second set
A9:25:51 <mezo> yeah that's what i'm looking forward to
A9:26:16 <mezo> you guys been keeping up on toady1's blog? he put up a podcast interview where he talks a lot about this
A9:26:34 <DementedHog> is there any documentation on server input/output?
A9:26:39 <mezo> about just having tools in place for players to go nuts
A9:26:53 <08Notch> DementedHog: No official one, and it's going to change for the next release
A9:27:09 <DementedHog> ok
A9:28:14 <gear|works> notch, have ou considered allowing a server to supply its own tileset?
A9:28:34 <Iguana> =O
A9:28:35 <08Notch> yes, and I won't.
A9:28:39 <Iguana> =(
A9:28:43 <gear|works> too much abuse?
A9:28:55 <08Notch> well, no, but I want the game to look the same in all screenshots. =)
A9:29:00 <Iguana> =P
A9:29:29 <aera> have 16 blocks or something that are server-tilable then?
A9:29:40 <08Notch> no, sorry.
A9:29:45 <aera> meh, alright :)
A9:30:25 <gear|works> well perhaps you might consider in the future an art-mode server
A9:30:31 <mezo> ART MODE
A9:30:33 <gear|works> that would allow that
A9:30:37 <Iguana> WT
A9:30:39 <Miclee> I'm sitting here waiting for survival, since I've got nothing else to play. :P
A9:30:48 <postlogic> Different blocks for each server would make it harder for a lot of people to feel related to the game. I know I wouldn't enjoy it.
A9:30:51 <Miclee> And I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2 info.
A9:30:57 <08Notch> The game's going open source in the (far) future, you can add that then. :D
A9:30:57 <Iguana> Miclee, today?
A9:31:16 <Miclee> Which?
A9:31:20 <Iguana> Both.

A9:35:08 <Miclee> "dragon-loader.swf", "dragon-holder"
A9:35:09 <Iguana> Do you have a dervish with a good build I can have? =P
A9:35:13 <Miclee> I got that from the page source.
A9:35:25 <Miclee> The swf file's name!
A9:36:05 <Iguana> Source code ftw?

A9:43:51 <Miclee> Wouldn't hurt to check.
A9:44:55 <Iguana> How do you open up .swf?
A9:45:10 <citricsquid> You can import them into flash and it'll decompile them

A9:47:07 <gear|works> guildwars bored me
A9:47:28 <PuyoDead> I own it, just didn't really play it much
A9:48:10 <Miclee> Well, I opened the swf in notepad.
A9:48:19 <Miclee> And there are nearly 9000 lines to go through.
A9:48:33 <UnknownX> Guild wars amazes me
A9:48:50 <UnknownX> All its basically made of is a 4gb dat file
A9:49:01 <gear|works> opening a swf in note pad will yield probably nothing
A9:49:55 <gear|works> you'd have to decompile it
A9:50:04 <Miclee> With what?
A9:50:24 <aera> UnknownX: how is that amazing? 
A9:50:52 <UnknownX> They were able to fit that much into a dat file
A9:50:53 <aera> (not to rain on the developers' parade, but that .dat probably has a lot of stuff in it)
A9:51:15 <aera> that file probably has a whole set of files in it, yknow :)
A9:51:19 <Miclee> It does.
A9:51:27 <aera> it's common practice these days
A9:51:27 <Miclee> I has all the textures, models, etc.
A9:51:32 <Miclee> It*
A9:51:35 <gear|works> its probably structured well enough
A9:51:37 <UnknownX> I know they encrypted it into a dat file
A9:51:44 <UnknownX> but how >.>
A9:52:24 <aera> UnknownX: I'll spare you the technical details, but it's easy :)
A9:52:40 <UnknownX> Its the only game i've seen do it
A9:52:45 <aera> i doubt the dat file was the hardest part of their development process ^_^
A9:52:52 <aera> have you not played a Valve game, then?
A9:53:08 <UnknownX> Valve puts it in a dat file?
A9:53:10 <PuyoDead> quite a few games do that
A9:53:10 <aera> most steam games come in one or two .gcf files
A9:53:20 <aera> *valve steam games
A9:53:23 <PuyoDead> starcraft was that way, if I remember correctly
A9:53:38 <PuyoDead> with .mpq
A9:53:52 <gear|works> wow as well
A9:53:55 <UnknownX> I've never bothered to look for valve game files
A9:54:19 <gear|works> but blizzard games are a little more modularized
A9:54:29 <gear|works> with a bunch of different asset files
A9:54:50 <UnknownX> ~:(
A9:55:06 <aera> it's usually just easier and more efficient to bundle game assets together
A9:55:16 <aera> you can usually apply cheap compression if you want too
A9:55:24 <gear|works> expansion.mpq, patch-1.mpq, etc

A10:10:48 <PuyoDead> hmm
A10:14:02 <PuyoDead> so, I find it kind of weird that I found the game through steam, yet when installed, I had to add it manually to the game list

A10:14:27 <PuyoDead> yea

A10:25:25 <Jakkarra> noticed the Dev update

A10:25:59 <PuyoDead> I apparently have crazy timing. when I checked it: "posted 24 seconds ago"
A10:26:27 <Jakkarra> hehe
A10:26:39 <citricsquid> Notch makes pretty art
A10:26:41 <Jakkarra> by the way, has anyone done a Vault boy model yet?
A10:26:53 <PuyoDead> pretty sure, yea
A10:27:03 <Drakkar> its action boy :|
A10:27:06 <Jakkarra> because we culd run a role-play thing with Survaval
A10:27:18 <Drakkar> vault boy was just something fallout 3 introduced
A10:27:23 <Jakkarra> no,
A10:27:28 <Drakkar> a terrible halfassed name

A10:27:37 <Jakkarra> im pretty sure
A10:27:37 <Drakkar> I'm saying the original name was action boy
A10:27:45 <Jakkarra> that sounds worse...

A10:27:57 <Drakkar> the name 'vault boy' was completely bethesda's design
A10:28:00 <Drakkar> and therefore not canon
A10:28:01 <Jakkarra> i think action buoy was just in ONE of the games
A10:28:05 <Drakkar> no
A10:28:07 <Drakkar> its in both
A10:28:11 <Jakkarra> ...
A10:28:30 <Jakkarra> you arent one of those people that go " they changed it... its RUINED FOREVER!!!!"
A10:28:33 <Drakkar> believe me, I own and play the games semi-regularly
A10:28:34 <Drakkar> no
A10:28:40 <Drakkar> I just think vault boy is a retarded name
A10:28:42 <Jakkarra> playes Fallout online?
A10:28:45 <Drakkar> and action boy was better
A10:28:46 <Drakkar> nah
A10:28:49 <Jakkarra> action boy is alse retarded
A10:28:52 <Drakkar> waiting for interplay to get done with theirs
A10:28:59 <Jakkarra> meh
A10:29:03 <Jakkarra> wait
A10:29:11 <Jakkarra> you don't meant eh russian one, do you?
A10:29:11 <Drakkar> action boy was fitting with the retrofuturism vibe
A10:29:14 <Drakkar> ..no
A10:29:17 <Drakkar> interplay themselves
A10:29:20 <Drakkar> are making a fallout mmo

A10:30:59 <Drakkar> no
A10:31:00 <Drakkar> I can't
A10:31:02 <Drakkar> lmao
A10:31:10 <Drakkar> I'm saying that I would rather have interplay do another fallout
A10:31:23 <Drakkar> interplay's writing is definitely more fitting
A10:31:24 <Drakkar> frankly
A10:31:32 <Jakkarra> fair enough
A10:31:33 <Drakkar> but bethesda did a decent job of it

A10:34:00 <Drakkar> oh lol
A10:34:16 <Drakkar> it was better in quake 2 anyway

A11:58:05 <gear|works> vis i will too

A11:58:19 <gear|works> i think tonight ill crack open omen
A11:58:29 <Visiiri> Yeah
A11:58:31 <gear|works> and do some manual editing for a city
A11:58:33 <chrstfer> so we make a city then grief it and add sand and stuff
A11:58:47 <chrstfer> but greif it well so it looks good
A11:58:59 <gear|works> thats actually a good idea
A11:59:02 <LG_Legacy> How did you get back?
A11:59:03 <Jaebn> Hi, I'm a noob at this stuff
A11:59:04 <Visiiri> What size should it be?
A11:59:05 <Visiiri> I'll host.
A11:59:12 <gear|works> have buildings half covered in dunes
A11:59:21 <gear|works> but you can still go inside and stuff
A11:59:21 <Jaebn> How do you server hosts get so good maps?
A11:59:25 <Visiiri> yeahyeahyeah
A11:59:31 <Visiiri> We make them
A11:59:32 <Visiiri> :P
A11:59:32 <chrstfer> it should be 212X212X212
A11:59:33 <Visiiri> :D
A11:59:42 <Jaebn> Yeah, but using what programs?
A11:59:52 <gear|works> theres a program called omen that helps
A11:59:56 <Jaebn> if any
A11:59:59 <Visiiri> Is 212 a power of 2?
A11:59:59 <Visiiri> Omen
P12:00:03 <gear|works> no vis
P12:00:07 <Visiiri> Would you like alink?
P12:00:11 <chrstfer> its the 200 one i thot it was 212
P12:00:13 <Jaebn> Please
P12:00:14 <gear|works> 256, 512
P12:00:18 <chrstfer> right 256
P12:00:22 <Visiiri> no why?
P12:00:22 <Visiiri> ohok
P12:00:23 <gear|works> you mixed those two up
P12:00:24 <Visiiri> I thought you meant I shouldn't give it to him
P12:00:24 <chrstfer> 256X256X256
P12:00:34 <Visiiri> so 256^2
P12:00:45 <Visiiri> I can go three times that easily
P12:00:52 <gear|works> we can decide
P12:01:03 <chrstfer> ok, well thats good 4 nao
P12:01:07 <Visiiri> err...
P12:01:07 <Visiiri> 256^3
P12:01:21 <gear|works> we should get that map that i saw in a mc video
P12:01:24 <gear|works> that was the city scape
P12:01:32 <Jaebn> I found a link to the forums, but they're down

P12:06:18 <Visiiri> easy
P12:06:18 <Visiiri> I can make a desert map
P12:06:18 <Visiiri> Should I do that?
P12:06:18 <Visiiri> Then we could add a city build
P12:06:18 <Visiiri> then terraform sand?
P12:06:35 <chrstfer> make a flatgrass
P12:06:41 <chrstfer> the well ad sand later
P12:06:47 <chrstfer> i guess is better

P12:08:39 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: Right now the plan is pretty much the skin site but with specific stuff for the maps, anything you'd like to see on the site? I'm going to have 2 sections, one for maps and one for tools, but beyond that I have no ideas :(
P12:08:56 <citricsquid> I was thinking of letting users upload screenshots of the map, so others can see it in "actioN".
P12:09:19 <gear|works> build a java app
P12:09:24 <gear|works> to doa  3d rotating view
P12:09:28 <gear|works> im sure you can do it

P12:10:46 <kalanosh> skills to make what?
P12:11:22 <citricsquid> a map previewer
P12:11:31 <citricsquid> what I could do is hack together something that loads the map into singleplayer
P12:11:35 <citricsquid> but that'd be boring
P12:13:25 <gear|works> right
P12:13:50 <citricsquid> google maps for minecraft maps sounds sexy

P4:04:59 <Eagle> I still think that 10 hearts is a lot.
P4:05:06 <Nalok> Ehhh
P4:05:09 <vede> Maybe.
P4:05:27 <Eagle> You could fall off a deadly cliff 3 times in a row and still be alive.
P4:05:28 <Nalok> Yeah, maybe you should start out with 5 or something.
P4:05:46 <vede> Maybe falling should just deal more damage.
P4:05:48 <Nalok> Then as time progresses you gain 5 more..
P4:05:58 <vede> That way we can still have 10 hearts, but they're not worth as much.
P4:06:27 <vede> Falling shouldn't really have a cap.
P4:06:29 <Eagle> Or if you can buy a new heart container (:P) from somewhere once you get enough money.
P4:06:47 <vede> You should be able to find cliffs that are fatal no matter what.
P4:06:52 <Nalok> I wonder if Notch'll make an adventure mode, where you start off in a town, either generated or player made, and you go on quests and jobs and etc.
P4:07:10 <Eagle> That would be a loooong ways away.
P4:07:11 <Nalok> But that might not happen for a few years

P4:16:14 <vede> Moths are weird.
P4:16:17 <cal> they start all nice and small and squigy
P4:16:24 <cal> then they turn fat hairy n nasty
P4:16:41 <vede> When I was young, I used to think that moths were literally made of dust.
P4:16:50 <cal> same :/
P4:17:11 <vede> Because every time I killed one, there was no icky mushy bug stuff, just a *poof* and some dust.
P4:18:19 <vede> Then eventually I CAUGHT one, so I was like "IMMA SEE WHAT DA FUCKS INSIDE AH YOU *NOW*"

P6:04:25 <Daidoji> the fun part is it usually will set the spawn in the bottom bedrock

P6:05:06 <Daidoji> I think we got out with like maybe 5 digs tops
P6:05:23 <Daidoji> the problem is when doing that you have to delete the water/lava
P6:05:29 <Daidoji> otherwise it floods fantastically
P6:05:37 <Blade`Skydancer> Heh.
P6:05:39 <Daidoji> and takes about 20 minutes to finish filling otherwise
P6:05:52 <Daidoji> it's a lot easier to delete the water, then go back and fill it in manually
P6:05:55 <Daidoji> with the editor
P6:06:16 <Blade`Skydancer> Hey, at least it's not like trying to save a huge Hell area from flooding.

P6:34:50 <citricsquid> everytime I see facepunch posts I want to die more.
P6:35:01 <vede> Because such levels allow for water to flow, don't have graphical glitches, but plants will never die, so they're ideal for low-light maps.
P6:35:26 <vede> So you can have houses with flowers, or underground labs with "strange fungi".

P10:28:18 <AlBuzzdrin> and yet nothing has happened
P10:28:26 <Darke> He wont let anyone
P10:28:27 <UnknownX> Citricsquid is paying atleast $150 per month

P10:31:30 <TheOne> I thought about it but I'm to lazy
P10:31:30 <Dav1d> If I put up another forum, would anyone be interested in helping then?

P10:31:58 <UnknownX> Will they be free?
P10:32:03 <Dav1d> yup
P10:32:10 <TheOne> using a free host?
P10:32:11 <antinull> what kinda forum, do you need hosting or what/
P10:32:14 <UnknownX> Like free host
P10:32:16 <Dav1d> nope
P10:32:23 <TheOne> then using what?
P10:32:24 <Dav1d> I pay $20 for a US box from media temple
P10:32:34 <Dav1d> google Media-Temple and go to grid-service
P10:32:39 <Dav1d> that'd be what i'd host it on
P10:32:45 <Eagle> You can't really blame him, though. I mean, if you had a choice between a UFO and some crappy internet forum, what would you choose?

P10:41:45 <Darke> And having a different domain doesn't matter
P10:41:56 <LG_Legacy> True that Unknown
P10:42:00 <AlBuzzdrin> just name it some mc community forums
P10:42:08 <TheOne> ya and thats mad mmmk?
P10:42:08 <Darke> Dav1d: How long would it take to bring them up?
P10:42:15 <Eagle> Just name it minecraftcommunity.net
P10:42:17 <Dav1d> i'll have em up tonight
P10:42:22 <Dav1d> if we can decide on a domain lol
P10:42:24 <AlBuzzdrin> yes eagle
P10:42:26 <Darke> I go with eagles
P10:42:31 <Darke> 3 votes for eagle
P10:42:32 <AlBuzzdrin> i came up with that
P10:42:40 <AlBuzzdrin> i am credit to eagle
P10:42:43 <TheOne> I like it
P10:42:44 <PuyoDead> haven't we had this exact same converation a few times before?
P10:42:44 <Darke> mccommunity.net
P10:42:45 <Dav1d> whats eagles?
P10:42:53 <Eagle> <Eagle> Just name it minecraftcommunity.net
P10:42:59 <Eagle> Apparently Albuzzdrin's too
P10:43:09 <Darke> mccommunity.net
P10:43:10 <AlBuzzdrin> yes
P10:43:18 <UnknownX> Eagle: If citricsquid wants to make a site like that hes going to be pissed
P10:43:21 <AlBuzzdrin> mccommunity.net doesn't sound too bad either
P10:43:22 <Dav1d> mccommunity.net ?
P10:43:27 <UnknownX> just use mc
P10:43:38 <PuyoDead> wake me when someone actually gets everyone to the "new forums"
P10:43:42 <Darke> mccommunity.net
P10:43:42 <Eagle> But I'll always read it as McCommunity
P10:43:48 <Eagle> Like it's a resteraunt
P10:43:50 <AlBuzzdrin> yeah
P10:43:52 <AlBuzzdrin> i know
P10:43:52 <Darke> So
P10:43:55 <LG_Legacy> The forums should stand as it is, instead of being impatient about some little forums which we don't need 24/7 It would be nice for them to come back up sure, but i don't think by making another forum will help this situation.  However since citricsquid is the primary forum hoster, and has worked on the forums, following that, won't there be conflicts?
P10:44:04 <Dav1d> likly no one will use the forums, it'll just push Squid to get the orginal one up
P10:44:07 <AlBuzzdrin> i like the one you/i mentioned but it's too long to type
P10:44:15 <Eagle> Everybody
P10:44:17 <Eagle> Just favorite it
P10:44:25 <LG_Legacy> Though
P10:44:26 <Eagle> You don't have to type it in everytime. >:O
P10:44:29 <LG_Legacy> IF it's a fan-based forum
P10:44:30 <UnknownX> Dav1d why would citricsquid be tempted?
P10:44:30 <LG_Legacy> Sure.
P10:44:38 <AlBuzzdrin> it is a fan based forum
P10:44:52 <LG_Legacy> Then there should be no problem, but the question is why do we need it?
P10:44:55 <Dav1d> because he'll be all annoyed that theres someone else trying to take over his attention seeking
P10:45:08 <AlBuzzdrin> he shouldn't sought that
P10:45:10 <Dav1d> we dont LG_Legacy, where just impatient lol
P10:45:11 <UnknownX> Its not like you can force notch to switch the spots between his forums and your forums
P10:45:11 <AlBuzzdrin> er
P10:45:14 <AlBuzzdrin> should've
P10:45:21 <LG_Legacy> Uh huh..
P10:45:30 <LG_Legacy> So why put it up, and submit to your weakness of impatience?
P10:45:46 <Eagle> LG because we want some goddamn forums
P10:45:47 <UnknownX> So it will never get farther out than about a tenth of the current forum members
P10:45:48 <Dav1d> why the hell should i wait for him to get off his lazy ass
P10:45:51 <AlBuzzdrin> mc community can be just a mc community where we also operate a mc server hurr
P10:45:52 <Eagle> And citric isn't providing
P10:46:18 <TheOne> Does anyone realized he needs PAID first?
P10:46:19 <PuyoDead> are you really that dumb dav1d?
P10:46:22 <LG_Legacy> I doubt 'lazy' comes to mind but meh.
P10:46:25 <UnknownX> Citric is getting money from someone who isn't providing
P10:46:33 <Eagle> He's been needing to get paid for at least a /month/ now
P10:46:43 <LG_Legacy> There could be a number of reasons why citric doesn't have the money.
P10:46:46 <UnknownX> Eagle: More like about 3 weeks
P10:46:52 <Dav1d> Dont bring my intelligence into this, i just want to help the community
P10:46:52 <Eagle> most of a month
P10:47:03 <PuyoDead> then don't assume things
P10:47:10 <AlBuzzdrin> it feels like a year already dayum
P10:47:23 <PuyoDead> as citric has stated multiple times, his client has delayed payment
P10:47:35 <Dav1d> He could get someone else to host them ffs
P10:47:36 <Eagle> Then he needs to get in their face.
P10:47:39 <Dav1d> he could get donations
P10:47:45 <AlBuzzdrin> cept he wouldn't
P10:47:50 <TheOne> He doesn't want them
P10:47:53 <tevar> forums for mine aint that big a dieal
P10:48:06 <UnknownX> Eagle: The client has like a month after citricsquid finishes to pay
P10:48:06 <LG_Legacy> As much as i want to help the community too dav1d, some people will end up arguing or trying to conflict this if you put up a forum. I'm not sure if citric would since it's going to be a community/fan based forum. (Which after all the main forum IS a community forum as stated.)
P10:48:07 <AlBuzzdrin> .. true
P10:48:42 <Eagle> Who is this client anyway
P10:48:46 <AlBuzzdrin> ain't that big of a deal
P10:48:49 <UnknownX> We don't know
P10:48:58 <Dav1d> Instead of agueing, maybe we should wait for squid to come online and talk
P10:49:08 <Dav1d> so we can just sort it out with him
P10:49:10 <Eagle> What kind of contract did he sign that says "Oh we don't have to pay you until like a month after you need it"
P10:49:13 <UnknownX> Which will be in about 6 more hours
P10:49:17 <AlBuzzdrin> and sort out a temporary forum, at least?
P10:49:36 <UnknownX> Eagle: Hes a freelance web developer
P10:49:42 <Eagle> Hm.
P10:49:54 <UnknownX> The client doesn't have to pay immediatly
P10:49:57 <Conscript_Gary> That's not the most stable combination of job descriptors
P10:49:58 <LG_Legacy> That would be the next better step Dav1d.
P10:50:02 <Dav1d> I'll be back in a few hours after school, Maybe I'll put up a "Fan Based" forum for a backup
P10:50:10 <Dav1d> like 7chan is the backup for 4chan
P10:50:31 <AlBuzzdrin> what
P10:50:32 <Dav1d> well, in a very loose sense that is lol
P10:50:42 <Eagle> Is he finished with the website, or is he still making it?

P10:51:15 <antinull> jesus this greifer/hackers love destroying servers...
P10:51:24 <PuyoDead> welcome to minecraft
P10:51:25 <UnknownX> Eagle: He said the client said he would pay him a few days ago
P10:51:39 <Dav1d> its typical like that with freelance though
P10:51:39 <Eagle> And like Conscript_Gary said, a freelance web developer isn't the best way to make oodles of cash.
P10:51:54 <Dav1d> actully, freelancing makes a fair bit if you do it right
P10:51:58 <PuyoDead> freelance anything pretty much sucks, but you gotta start somewhere
P10:52:13 <Eagle> Why is citric hosting several sites on an expensive server when he doesn't have a reliable job? :/
P10:52:15 <TheOne> some things are not about the cash, maybe he likes it... but whats it matter?
P10:52:17 <AlBuzzdrin> freelancer is a good game
P10:52:34 <Dav1d> agreed

P10:52:52 <AlBuzzdrin> too bad they never made a second freelancer
P10:52:59 <UnknownX> Its not like citricsquid is one of those fancy web developers that make tons of cash a year
P10:53:02 <AlBuzzdrin> freelancer's mp is why i kept playing it

P11:51:47 <tarkata14> Also, venn, what kind of skin do you want?
P11:51:53 <Dark_Moo> how much does it cost for hosting?
P11:51:54 <venn177> Meizlizard: What are you talking about?
P11:51:57 <Dark_Moo> i may be able to help
P11:51:59 <potato> facepunch is like something awful for 13 year olds
P11:51:59 <venn177> tarkata14: I don't care, really
P11:52:10 <Meizlizard> As in, what would you want it to look like.
P11:52:10 <TheOne> still doesnt work mail but I give up for the night
P11:52:16 <venn177> potato: Ironic that the average age is about 16, though

P11:52:31 <potato> seriously
P11:52:33 <venn177> Meizlizard: I don't really care, just something unique. Preferrably racist
P11:52:42 <potato> last time i browsed i could have sworn they were all 13

P11:52:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> some of them are yeah
P11:52:55 <Dark_Moo> i'm 17 but the only reason I go on it is for the video games thread because every so often a good game pops up :P
P11:53:00 <tarkata14> Also, potato, who cares.
P11:53:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> some of them are overaged
P11:53:20 <venn177> I'm 18 in 4 days, I go to facepunch because if you ignore a lot of shit, it's a good community
P11:53:22 <tarkata14> I go there because of the PCS&H forum, and the video game forum
P11:53:32 <Dark_Moo> yeah
P11:53:42 <tarkata14> I was just banned for posting in a spam thread, but whatever.
P11:54:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> mr. joe i'm here to rescue you
P11:54:18 <gear> im 22 and didnt even know what facepunch was
P11:54:22 <Dark_Moo> lol I hate most of the admins on there :l
P11:54:35 <tarkata14> I like most of them, Hezzy is the best though.
P11:54:39 <venn177> the problem with facepunch is garry is a massive ego-driven dickwad
P11:54:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> i've never gotten banned on fp before
P11:54:49 <tarkata14> It happens.

P11:55:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> to a certain degree
P11:55:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i hate him for removing the ability to micspam

P11:56:11 <tarkata14> I rarely see griefers who've boughten the game
P11:56:14 <venn177> AnnihilatorBeta: Lankist is the annoying version of thisispain
P11:56:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> and ask yourself why someone would buy gmod to do that
P11:56:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> it makes them look less suspicious though
P11:56:48 <tarkata14> Retarded people are ammused by retarded things.
P11:56:53 <tarkata14> amused*
P11:57:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're probably spoiled, hah
