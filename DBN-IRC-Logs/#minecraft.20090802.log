A12:04:00 <PuyoDead> y'know... I'm not sure if I ever finished that
A12:04:13 <Darkebrz> But Doom 2 actually works with sound if I run it off Skulltag
A12:04:13 <LG_Legacy> Portal
A12:04:16 <PuyoDead> I know I played it for a great length of time, but I don't know if I finished
A12:04:19 <Darkebrz> Beat portal
A12:04:22 <Darkebrz> Countless times
A12:04:23 <LG_Legacy> Hm..
A12:04:34 <Darkebrz> I do want to pirate Gmod though
A12:04:37 <Darkebrz> I mean
A12:04:41 <Darkebrz> I dont have any source games
A12:04:43 <Darkebrz> So... :P
A12:04:47 <LG_Legacy> You don't need source games
A12:04:59 <PuyoDead> myself, I'm off to play Contact s'more

A12:05:12 <PuyoDead> DS game
A12:05:17 <LG_Legacy> Huff..
A12:05:21 <LG_Legacy> When i download Garrys Mod
A12:05:26 <PuyoDead> been meaning to finish it
A12:05:28 <LG_Legacy> It auto installs HL2 Into it
A12:05:56 <Darkebrz> LG_Legacy, do you already have HL2?
A12:06:12 <Darkebrz> I had it and beat it, but I uninstalled it afterwards
A12:06:17 <LG_Legacy> I do.
A12:06:30 <Darkebrz> Yes
A12:06:37 <Darkebrz> It takes the models from source games you have
A12:06:45 <LG_Legacy> Fine then uh..
A12:06:50 <PuyoDead> I've had an extra copy of HL2 for years
A12:06:56 <LG_Legacy> Try HL1? Lol
A12:07:14 <Darkebrz> PuyoDead, why?
A12:07:32 <PuyoDead> because I bought it when it came out, and again when it was on the orange box

A12:07:45 <Darkebrz> LG_Legacy, I could always get the models
A12:07:46 <LG_Legacy> Damage-Incorporated
A12:07:50 <PuyoDead> so when I installed it, steam gave me an extra copy
A12:07:54 <Darkebrz> Sweet
A12:08:17 <LG_Legacy> Think... thinking..
A12:08:37 <Darkebrz> LG_Legacy, like I said, as soon as I get the medal for Red Remover Im playing Doom 2

A12:11:28 <LG_Legacy> Lots of anime chix
A12:11:36 <Darkebrz> "Time to kick ass and chew bubblegum"
A12:12:09 <Darkebrz> All of these ideas are now in a text file
A12:12:13 <Darkebrz> And will be looked at
A12:12:54 <LG_Legacy> Diablo II : The only game you'll spend hours in a dungeon or wild killing monsters and getting items and actually not get addicted like WoW!

A12:44:10 <Darkebrz> Nemba needs to be banned
A12:44:39 <Darkebrz> I really think we need standards
A12:45:20 <Darkebrz> LG_Legacy, can you explain to me how the hell TheOnes Lava Survival makes sense?
A12:45:31 <LG_Legacy> Alright
A12:45:33 <LG_Legacy> So basically
A12:45:40 <LG_Legacy> The ops go and prepare lava
A12:45:44 <LG_Legacy> The users/members
A12:45:49 <LG_Legacy> Have to go and build bases/bunkers
A12:45:55 <LG_Legacy> Protect themselves from the lava
A12:45:59 <Darkebrz> That makes sense
A12:46:03 <LG_Legacy> And if their stuff gets flooded
A12:46:10 <LG_Legacy> They got to tunnel out and find others
A12:46:17 <LG_Legacy> Tunneling and finding others is the most fun part
A12:46:24 <Darkebrz> But their stuff probably wont be flooded
A12:46:25 <LG_Legacy> Because you may accidently flood a place, or someone might of
A12:46:31 <LG_Legacy> So?
A12:46:38 <LG_Legacy> You still create underground or try to
A12:46:40 <LG_Legacy> Or find people
A12:46:56 <Darkebrz> Meh
A12:46:59 <Darkebrz> Not for me
A12:47:14 <LG_Legacy> Lol
A12:47:19 <LG_Legacy> It was actually fun for m,e
A12:47:30 <LG_Legacy> Countless times i had to tunnel my way into new tunnels or my way out to a 'safe' place
A12:47:36 <LG_Legacy> before it got destroyed/flooded

A7:28:12 <Quatroking> she deleted about 3 posts and edited out us saying she didn't read the post
A7:28:25 <Quatroking> which is a fact, because she clearly didn't.
A7:28:39 <citricsquid> She removed her post, does it matter?
A7:28:56 <Quatroking> She could at least apopogize
A7:28:57 <citricsquid> If she made a mistake and removed it, why does it need to be broadcast?
A7:29:01 <Quatroking> apologize*
A7:29:07 <citricsquid> did you contact her privately?

A7:31:25 <Plinky> Minecraft is good. I'll be too poor to buy it when it is released though XD
A7:31:29 <Quatroking> citricsquid: so you think its totally right that she first blamed the topic creater that it has already been suggested, and after that removed all evidence of her saying that, not even apologizing?
A7:31:39 <Quatroking> I find that prety rude.
A7:32:13 <citricsquid> Quatroking: I didn't see it, so I can't comment. However, she has clearly removed herself saying anything wrong and whether or not she apologiises is up to her, personally I think she should but I can't "control" her. 
A7:32:34 <Quatroking> Yeah I understand that
A7:32:41 <Quatroking> But I mainly wanted your opinion

A8:55:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Dual Core Pentium 1 Gig of Ram 160 Gig SATA drive $34.99 per month no setup barebones - Centos 5.x 64 Bit OS servers. 10 mbit unmetered on 1 gbit backbone
A8:55:38 <citricsquid> not bad, provider any good though?
A8:55:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes
A8:56:05 <citricsquid> awsm, can get set ups like that in quite a few places, but most are awful as a provider.
A8:56:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, this guy isn't selling to the mass 
A8:56:39 <citricsquid> oh, no company backing it, just private?
A8:57:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> market, only a few people in certail places
A8:57:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> certain*
A8:57:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> And everyone who's used him says the speeds are amazing, etc
A8:57:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> And good support
A8:57:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, there's a company
A8:57:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> The company doesn't generally sell dedis, they do hosting, but they have 25 extra servers, so he's letting them go to certain people
A8:58:10 <citricsquid> not bad then. I've also been uncertain about such deals though, I'd rather pay extra and go with a proper company.
A8:58:34 <citricsquid> my setup could be had for ~$50, but I pay $90 for the providers amazing support and leniency.
A8:58:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> I would totally do it if I had the money (and needed a dedi), from the reviews I see here
A8:58:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> it is unmanaged though :P

A9:31:12 <Shotz> >:
A9:31:19 <Maveric> Shotz: I got sick of the griefing
A9:31:24 <Maveric> I'll turn it back on
A9:31:30 <Shotz> Backup? D:
A9:31:42 <Maveric> Back up
A9:31:47 <Shotz> I banned the guy who last grief'd the map. 
A9:31:50 <Maveric> Yes, it's backup with a backup
A9:31:56 <Shotz> My wall >;;;;;
A9:32:00 <Maveric> :(
A9:32:02 <Shotz> did you.. see it?
A9:32:03 <Shotz> ):
A9:32:07 <Shotz> Q_Q
A9:32:15 <Maveric> Don't worry, I'll have another server up within a few days
A9:32:18 <citricsquid> I got sick of having 16 servers constantly griefed and having to reset, so I took all my servers off forever :(
A9:32:26 <citricsquid> running 1 is easy ;)
A9:32:30 <Shotz> ;D
A9:32:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not really citricsquid :P
A9:32:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Depends on how much effort you want to put in
A9:32:46 <citricsquid> very little.
A9:32:49 <Shotz> So, did you take it down? :[
A9:32:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then yeah :D
A9:32:50 <Maveric> Soon as the sever has been up for a week or two
A9:32:59 <Maveric> I'll be able to hand out ops to more people, making it a lot easier
A9:33:07 <Shotz> True
13A9:33:10 * AlLnAtuRalX just spent 15 minutes reading and replying to ban appeals
A9:33:33 <citricsquid> Maveric: and then the fun begins
A9:33:42 <Maveric> But it's easy to act responsible for four nights in a row, then be a twat when I'm not around
A9:33:43 <citricsquid> I used to get >5 complaints a day about rogue ops IP banning others
A9:33:54 <citricsquid> constantly rebooting to unban the IP of ops sucks.
A9:33:55 <Maveric> :(
A9:34:25 <Maveric> I'm beginngin work on a playerdatabse with chatlog, ingame time, etc etc tomorrow or the next day
A9:34:31 <Maveric> depending on if anything else springs up
A9:34:45 <Maveric> So it should be easier to keep track of crap
A9:34:51 <Shotz> So.. if your server off? Forever? D:
A9:34:56 <Maveric> It's on now
A9:35:08 <Shotz> o:
A9:35:11 <citricsquid> I was going to build a web based admin panel for managing minecraft server, but gave up. That'd been cool =o
A9:35:37 <Maveric> citricsquid: I could hand you the source when I'm done
A9:35:44 <Maveric> As long as you
A9:36:00 <citricsquid> I WILL TAKE IT AND CREDIT MYSELF FOR IT AND REDISTRIBUTE >:(>:(
A9:36:01 <Maveric> run linux with inotify enabled
A9:36:40 <Shotz> He srsly. Minecraft should have like.. 
A9:36:57 <Maveric> wait... you need to reboot to clear ip bans?
A9:37:04 <Shotz> a window on the hosts pc, or something.. that you can close/open that shows when players login.. 
A9:37:04 <citricsquid> yeah

A9:38:22 <Maveric> I noticed there was a python admin script. I no longer need to write that side of things

A9:39:15 <Shotz> Yeah
A9:39:17 <citricsquid> then changes to 2 etc
A9:39:19 <Shotz> That's what i mean
A9:39:24 <citricsquid> still lots of work though
A9:39:28 <Shotz> I know
A9:39:29 <Shotz> but. 
A9:39:30 <Maveric> ?
A9:39:32 <Shotz> It would help
A9:39:32 <citricsquid> because of diff block types, different players blah blah
A9:39:33 <Maveric> Lots of work?
A9:39:39 <citricsquid> work for the server*
A9:39:52 <Maveric> if blocktype: update db
A9:39:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> My chatlog file right now is 22 MB
A9:39:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> imagine a block log
A9:40:02 <citricsquid> if for every action it's got to write to the config or database it'll use lots.
A9:40:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> And that's only from the past two weeks or so
A9:40:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> (plaintext) :p

A9:41:00 <citricsquid> irc*
A9:41:01 <Maveric> the log for that was over 2gigs after a month
A9:41:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> #ubuntu on irc.ubunru and #fedora on Freenode come to mind as being issues
A9:41:10 <citricsquid> I only use #minecraft, or others when I want to join in.
A9:41:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> ubuntu*
A9:41:38 <Maveric> What do you guys think of a "whitelist" for a private server?
A9:41:44 <Quatroking> Freenode turned pretty gay lately
A9:41:45 <Maveric> Stops people from giving out the link
A9:41:47 <Quatroking> blocking off mibbit
A9:41:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh no you di'nt
A9:41:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> As they should, it's used to evade bans a lot
A9:42:05 <Maveric> Oh?
A9:42:08 <Maveric> Thanks for the tip :P
A9:42:10 <Quatroking> so
A9:42:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, many free OS's come with an IRC client
A9:42:23 <Maveric> I feel special. 
A9:42:28 <Maveric> I have two ip's now
A9:42:36 <Maveric> So I can get banned twice as much now from irc =]
A9:43:10 <citricsquid> *reboots router* I'M BACK!
A9:43:11 <PuyoDead> browser based irc clients just seems like such a bad idea to me
A9:43:24 <Maveric> lol
A9:43:30 <Maveric> static ip's ftw =]
A9:43:32 <citricsquid> they're annoying to use, who keeps a single tab open for 16 hours? =\
A9:43:44 <Maveric> hmm
A9:43:54 <Maveric>  14:44:01 up 24 days,  3:47,  5 users,  load average: 0.26, 0.09, 0.02
A9:44:22 <Maveric> irssi is so god damned cool
A9:44:38 <PuyoDead> that and the simple fact that you have your browser and irc tied together. if it crashes, *poof*
A9:44:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Browser?  Crashes?
A9:44:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Since when?
A9:44:55 <Maveric> As if habe your irc on your computer
A9:45:01 <citricsquid> using shitty websites? :D
A9:45:11 <citricsquid> firefox sometimes crashes for me :(
A9:45:18 <citricsquid> and I dislike chrome.
A9:45:29 <Maveric> firefox doesn't like it when I use youtube and minecraft simultanously
A9:45:39 <PuyoDead> seeing as how we're all playing minecraft...
A9:45:48 <PuyoDead> I'd rather not have my irc tied to it :P
A9:46:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Opera 10 FTW
A9:46:05 <citricsquid> it'd be like a 24/7 netsplit.
A9:46:25 <Quatroking> citricsquid
A9:46:29 <Quatroking> what client do you use
A9:46:32 <citricsquid> mIRC
A9:46:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only time my Minecraft crashes is when I overheat
A9:46:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> and that brings down my entire client
A9:46:38 <Quatroking> stop using it.

A9:59:01 <citricsquid> kick let's them rejoin doesn't it?
A9:59:14 <Quatroking> maybe he's crying
A9:59:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> lets*
A9:59:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> And yes
A9:59:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some dicks even use clients with auto-rejoin
A10:00:10 <Maveric> AlLnAtuRalX: do you find it a problem that you give op to someone, and then they op someone and troubles starts?
A10:00:13 <citricsquid> I only wanted him to stop :(
A10:00:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not at all Maveric 
A10:00:27 <Maveric> ah, ok
A10:00:34 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: how did you avoid that? Even people I trusted did it and caused problem for me :(
A10:00:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then again, I only OP people I think have better judgement than to use it behind my back
A10:00:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I do it by always being there... People know I'm watching :P
A10:00:55 <Maveric> Ah, I *may* have a solution to that problem
A10:01:03 <citricsquid> op levels? :P
A10:01:22 <Maveric> Is that coming soon?
A10:01:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, if aera ever releases his server... :P
A10:01:56 <Quatroking> gah i can't get any idea for Derrek #9
A10:02:06 <Quatroking> SUGGESTIONS PLEASE
A10:02:50 <doohan> You're on 9 now?
A10:03:01 <Quatroking> Yeah
A10:03:06 <Quatroking> well, I am
A10:03:15 <Quatroking> you guys will have to wait
A10:03:17 <doohan> Whats the link?
A10:03:19 <Maveric> I was just thinking that it'd be a *sort of* sollution to have my db of players list if they're an op or not. Each time they use an op command, checks the db and if they're not on it, de-ops them
A10:03:28 <Maveric> They'd only be able to get in one command then
A10:03:35 <Quatroking> http://www.quatroworld.org/
A10:04:09 <citricsquid> Maveric: server auto parses commands, can't stop them
A10:04:12 <citricsquid> iirc
A10:04:24 <doohan> Could if it was behind a rpoxy.
A10:04:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Custom server citricsquid 
A10:04:30 <citricsquid> "The comics are going well, and I'm getting pretty positive feedback from friends all over the world". Friends opinions will always be positive.
A10:04:34 <doohan> Parse then forward
A10:04:41 <Maveric> Yeah, that's why they'd only be able to et in one command
A10:04:48 <Quatroking> citricsquid: that's so not true.
A10:05:08 <citricsquid> Quatroking: of course it is, I said it >:(
A10:05:11 <Maveric> after they've done it, they'd be de-opped. Not a proper solution, but could hold
A10:05:59 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: will they even be allowed? I know notch said not to distribute his code so if they're built from the ground up, sure, but surely they won't work with survival and stuff and will go against some things he implements?
A10:06:03 <Quatroking> poor, poor reginald.
A10:06:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, no survival, and it would be like cat-and-mouse feature
A10:06:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> But they're perfectly allowed under what he's said so far
A10:06:30 <aera> it really depends on what Notch wants overally
A10:06:34 <aera> *legally*, we're fine
A10:06:38 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: that's cool then :) 
A10:06:49 <citricsquid> afaik he wants full control, which is where my "ummm"s come in.
A10:06:49 <Maveric> what are you guys talking about?
A10:06:59 <aera> I think as long as they're not game modes and add value to the game = good
A10:06:59 <citricsquid> so if everyone runs custom servers, it won't be like that
A10:07:03 <Quatroking> guys
A10:07:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes, but he only talked about not distributing modified versions of his code
A10:07:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> and he still has client control
A10:07:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> (somewhat)
A10:07:20 <Quatroking> what if we'd announce on the forums that notch died
A10:07:27 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: true :P I'll ask him when he nexts surfaces :D
A10:07:36 <Quatroking> while he actually didn't die
A10:07:40 <Maveric> don't distribute modified code. Distribute his source and let others patch it :P
A10:07:41 <Quatroking> wouldn't that be fucking hilarious
A10:07:49 <citricsquid> Quatroking: nope?
A10:07:53 <Maveric> with your patch
A10:07:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Like I said when Zuriki was powertripping all over JTE, if anyone's going to be not allowed to do it, I want to see Notch say it himself
A10:07:57 <Quatroking> yes it would
A10:07:57 <citricsquid> fake deaths are only funny when IRL media covers it.
A10:08:00 <Quatroking> imagine the response
A10:08:04 <PuyoDead> we evidently have different understandings of "hillarious"
A10:08:31 <Quatroking> it's spelled hilarious.
A10:08:35 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: JTE wasn't allowed to distribute his server IF it allowed for new game modes and custom skins. afaik that's all that was said/.
A10:08:44 <citricsquid> no mods said he'd be banned for making it, unless I'm mistaken.
A10:08:48 <citricsquid> but that was the "official" line.
A10:08:56 <aera> skins are client-side completely, can't do that with a custom server...
A10:09:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right, but Notch never said that citricsquid 
A10:09:01 <PuyoDead> well then, we most certainly have different understandings, since it is now two different words :P
A10:09:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> JTE's server was fine under Notch's ultimatum
A10:09:07 <PuyoDead> either way, boring idea
A10:09:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> All I wanted was his confirmation before people go recklessly banning
A10:09:20 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: so it's okay to make buying the game irrelevant because Notch hasn't said so?
A10:09:31 <citricsquid> it's okay for me to steal all your accounts, because notch hasn't said so?
A10:09:32 <citricsquid> etc etc.
A10:09:47 <aera> who said you didn't have to buy the game to use custom servers? a few edits to the client jar and it'll be very hard
A10:09:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, but if you're banning in Notch's name, it should have confirmation for Notch
A10:09:49 <citricsquid> it's common sense, damaging minecrafts profitability and growth is bad, he doesn't need to say that.
A10:10:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not damaging its growth
A10:10:08 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: did zuriki say she was banning on behalf of notch? :(
A10:10:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, there are no plans to duplicate Notch's functionality
A10:10:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> She implied it
A10:10:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Many times
A10:10:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> But it also seems she has personal beef with JTE
A10:10:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> haven't touched the forums in the past few days, so I can't say exactly
A10:10:37 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: and I say (and same with zuriki I'm sure) that we'd only ban IF he made such game modes, nobody said he'd be banned for making it.
A10:10:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zuriki said he'd be banned for distributing it in its present form
A10:10:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> brb, have to tend to my server
A10:11:15 <PuyoDead> this all seems terribly irrelevent to me, since this is all temporary anyway
A10:12:28 <citricsquid> actually, If I can find the quote notch said something about disliking publicly released mods (not sure if that includes custom servers) when they're not official supported.
A10:12:34 <citricsquid> not sure if he said that in IRC or on the blog.
A10:12:46 <citricsquid> he wants people to wait for LUA, or keep them private.
A10:13:08 <aera> some things won't be possible with lua, though
A10:13:10 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Zuriki said: "That's not to say we will ban you immediately. You can advertise the SERVER itself. But not a download for the software or making additional game modes created with the custom server available to free players. I wanted to make that a little clearer.
A10:13:10 <citricsquid> ".
A10:13:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> exactly
A10:13:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Distribution = ban
A10:13:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Even in its present form
A10:13:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch's post is Jul 08 citricsquid 
A10:13:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Do not distribute anything Ive made, or modified versions of anything Ive made. I want all client and server downloads to come from minecraft.net.
A10:13:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> I dont wish to lose control of this project, and definitely not before its been finished.
A10:13:44 <Maveric> It'd be cool if Notch made it so you could build things like slingshots and such
A10:13:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> The first sentence is bolded
A10:13:52 <citricsquid> Maveric: that'd be so awesome.
A10:13:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> So keep in mind that distributing [modified] clients and servers not only is illegal, its against my wishes.
A10:14:01 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I know that?
A10:14:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Okay, cool... JTE's server doesn't directly violate any of that
A10:14:17 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I know that
A10:14:24 <citricsquid> I'm not talking about that point
A10:14:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> okay, good
A10:14:39 <Maveric> Oh, could I ask a *HUGE* favour from someone?
A10:15:13 <Maveric> Which should only, hopefully, be a two second answer :P
A10:15:49 <citricsquid> I'm saying that what JTE was asked to do - whether or not he intended on doing, I don't know - was a bannable offence. He was asked to make extra game modes and then distribute the code for them, that in my opinion would not be in the best interests of notch financially and/or game wise, that was what I said he'd be banned for. Nothing more, I don't see how that is unreasonable.
A10:16:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm not saying it's logically unreasonable, I just want to see Notch agree with that
A10:16:19 <citricsquid> but yes, what he makes he can distribute fine, nobody has a problem with that, just if it adversely affects minecrafts profitability and /or development :P
A10:16:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're doing this because it hurts NOTCH's bottom-line
A10:16:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I'd like to see Notch's comment, not Zuriki's
A10:16:49 <aera> I think the main worry from distributing servers is that it's easy to turn off verification of names/the fact that people have paid, nothing more - I'm keeping my code under wraps for that reason

A10:17:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> While citric is trying to hypothesize Notch's bottom-line, I'm worrying about mine
A10:18:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> And an easily modifiable, custom server would be useful in many ways
A10:18:34 <citricsquid> aera: exactly, custom servers can be used to bypass the need for paying for extras, that's what I was "angry" about. but yeah, I don't think notch ever said anything "officially" I seem to remember him saying it in IRC about disliking them being distributed and/or people affecting the growth of minecraft - he said that he does not want to lose control of the project - but you're right...
A10:18:43 <citricsquid> ...he never said anything "officially" on custom servers.

A10:18:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, it's an alpha
A10:19:00 <Maveric> lol
A10:19:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> If we want to treat it as a production game, we're going to need more than what Notch is ignoring us about
A10:19:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> He's known about the socket issue for fucking months
A10:19:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have to reboot my server every day because of that
A10:19:31 <aera> citricsquid: indeed he hasn't I've checked. I think the protocol needs a bit more resilience, then it'd be harder to do the piracy without custom servers and clients
A10:19:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> At this point, there are no good tools besides tp to get griefers
A10:19:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> No matter how many times we asked for hide or spec
A10:19:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which would take minutes to put in
A10:19:54 <PuyoDead> so, in the future, basic sandbox mode will be for free and paid users, right? (as far as we know)
A10:19:55 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: he's working on survival though :(
A10:19:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch ignores... He's doing his own thing
A10:20:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Absolutely, but I can't keep running this with the tools I have
A10:20:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's getting to be too much
A10:20:12 <Quatroking> thats what makes an indie game indie.
A10:20:19 <aera> it is _his_ game, I think it's just that some of us want it to work different
A10:20:21 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: afaik basic sandbox will be free forever, the rest will - in the final game - be paid only. During beta it'll be free for survival, I think.
A10:20:25 <peerkoel> I know custom servers are OK.
A10:20:36 <peerkoel> I was told so in e-mail
A10:20:37 <PuyoDead> and survival and other game modes will be paid only, so...
A10:20:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Awesome peerkoel :P
A10:20:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> By Notch?
A10:20:53 <peerkoel> who else? :) yes, by Notch
A10:20:56 <citricsquid> peerkoel: what about the distribution of custom servers? I'd love to know an official thing :P
A10:21:04 <Maveric> non-free programs make me a sad panda
A10:21:09 <peerkoel> I can't make official statements
A10:21:19 <Maveric> release everything as open source and I'd be happy
A10:21:45 <PuyoDead> in the future, any game mods (Lua or otherwise) that we are currently debating will only really apply to free mode, right?
A10:21:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes!
A10:21:55 <citricsquid> I've been running the "it's all k as long as you don't affect the growth or profitability of minecraft by allowing free to do paid" and I'd like to see if notch agrees with that. Did he just say custom servers were okay in the email, or anything else?
A10:22:06 <PuyoDead> otherwise, any "extras" will require the game to be purchased

A10:22:11 <aera> PuyoDead: I imagine there's no issue with paid users doing anything at all
A10:22:20 <aera> the issue is allowing free users to play games
A10:22:29 <PuyoDead> exactly, I'm seeing this as "you'd have to buy it anyway"
A10:22:30 <peerkoel> I know Notch wants to be the official distributor of his software
A10:22:39 <peerkoel> so you cannot distribute any of his files
A10:22:46 <PuyoDead> so this stuff will only apply to free basic sandbox
A10:22:55 <aera> well, custom servers don't use any of his files
A10:22:59 <peerkoel> you can distribute your own mods/lua scripts in the future
A10:23:03 <aera> but it's more about respecting his wishes
A10:23:22 <peerkoel> custom servers are merely the early lua scripts
A10:23:22 <aera> hell, give me a week and I could write a replacement client too, but I'd rather not, it's a lot of faffing
A10:23:23 <PuyoDead> and in the long run, I really don't see any mods done in sandbox being enough to deter people from buying the game to get the full extras
A10:23:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> absolutely
A10:23:35 <peerkoel> if the API will be good enough

A10:23:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Imagine how much infinitely easier that would make my job?
A10:24:10 <peerkoel> you want a server that cannot be changed?
A10:24:16 <aera> you mean /hide as in inivisble?

A10:24:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> An op-only command

A10:24:38 <aera> ah, yes, read about that

A10:24:44 <peerkoel> hiding is fun :)
A10:24:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I told Notch I want spectate
A10:24:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> every single time he's been on
A10:24:56 <PuyoDead> since /spectate is on the backburner, /hide would work for now
A10:24:57 <peerkoel> it's like a camera
A10:24:58 <citricsquid> I like the idea of spectate, hide seems meh though.

A10:25:17 <AlexVMiner> socket stuff?
A10:25:19 <PuyoDead> yea, hide would only be a workaround for a true spectate
A10:25:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> aera, on large servers (and I mean large), often unclean disconnects will result in a socket being stuck in FIN_WAIT1 for eternity

A10:27:32 <AlexVMiner> i wish i could pay for a dedicated server
A10:27:34 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Just emailed notch asking his official opinion on custom servers and whether or not they can be distributed if they allow for paid things, after that we can have his opinion!
A10:27:47 <PuyoDead> good deal
A10:27:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, also ask if they can be distributed if they DON'T allow for paid things
A10:27:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm much more interested in that
A10:28:09 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: peer said that he already agreed with that, didn't he?
A10:28:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh okay
A10:28:20 <PuyoDead> I miss when Notch was around more often
A10:28:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just want clean disconnects and /hide, and a gallery server maybe
A10:28:22 <citricsquid> but yeah, I'll pastebin when he replies :P
A10:28:22 <peerkoel> hm, what if you run the server through inetd?
A10:28:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> c'est tout
A10:28:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> ummmm... probably wouldn't do anything
A10:28:39 <PuyoDead> with him being so infrequent, it makes him seem more "far away" so to speak
A10:28:59 <aera> inetd needs t to accept packets on stdin, though, surely
A10:29:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not sure if inetd would work w/ minecraft
A10:29:13 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: well, starting tuesday he's working parttime on minecraft for 3 days a week, so it should pick up.
A10:29:50 <PuyoDead> yea, that'll be nice, but I meant more of him just not being around in general
A10:30:12 <AlexVMiner> i never met notch here
A10:30:12 <PuyoDead> I'm sure it's not the case, but it just feels like he's losing interest
A10:30:15 <peerkoel> e-mail works for me
A10:30:15 <AlexVMiner> :(
A10:30:22 <AlexVMiner> i only saw him once
A10:30:35 <citricsquid> I think he's working so much on survival he doesn't want to be distracted by more ideas and bugs in IRC
A10:30:47 <citricsquid> everytime he joins there's thousands of "HEY NOTCH!!!" "FIX THIS" "DO THAT!"
A10:30:52 <peerkoel> haha
A10:30:53 <PuyoDead> true
A10:30:54 <peerkoel> so true
A10:30:55 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:30:57 <citricsquid> might be wrong, but seems likely to me.
A10:30:59 <aera> I'm curious to see exactly what survival will bring to the table
A10:31:06 <Maveric> Sounds like a doup d'tat will go on soon :P
A10:31:12 <AlexVMiner> hey notch! Hi there! Yo dawg!
A10:31:19 <PuyoDead> and that's what I've been trying to believe, that he's going full on survival mode
A10:31:23 <Maveric> or is it d'etat? I never remmeber things
A10:31:29 <AlexVMiner> will survival be single and multi player too?
A10:31:36 <citricsquid> multi, I think?
A10:31:38 <peerkoel> coup d'etat
A10:31:42 <Maveric> ta
A10:31:48 <citricsquid> I'm too scared to read the blog about it so it's a fun surprise what we do in it :D
A10:31:51 <AlexVMiner> i always thought it would be only single player
A10:32:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fuck this.
A10:32:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have to reboot my box now
A10:32:13 <Maveric> :(

A10:32:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> This is why I need a custom server
A10:32:42 <AlexVMiner> Notch is getting too rich
A10:32:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can't take this any more
A10:32:58 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: can't you just switch port, or do people rely on it being the same URL?
A10:33:00 <aera> I'm curious to see if my server would handle the normal building use-case, but haven't got round to it yet
A10:33:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> They rely on the URL
A10:33:15 <citricsquid> :(
A10:33:17 <Nalok> I'm bored, is the gentlemen server up?
A10:33:20 <aera> only ironed out the last physics issues today
A10:33:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm sure you know I'd be glad to test that for you aera :P
A10:33:31 <citricsquid> I'd have just done a nice little forward; redditpublic.com/server/ or something, but hidnsight is a wonderful thing.
A10:33:35 <Maveric> nalok, come to Maveric's epic server if you want a nice server
A10:33:41 <Maveric> Pretty quiet atm, though
A10:33:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, people find us off the serverlist and bookmar
A10:33:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nobody would use that
A10:33:52 <AlexVMiner> lol, an old spongebob is on
A10:33:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I tried that back when I ran a UrT server, still failed

A10:37:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Judging by the bandwidth usage......
A10:37:27 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: why the .tk and .com? 
A10:37:31 <PuyoDead> ahh crap, I just realized I need to use my dsware points soon, and there isn't much to get
A10:37:34 <Maveric> Cause, like, I tried to do that and it sends to the stdin, but like, doesn't actually work. Just writes it in the window and doesn't react like it would if I manually typed /say test in there
A10:37:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> .tk is directly off the server citricsquid

A10:46:55 <citricsquid> shit sorry multi line

A10:47:03 <citricsquid> "Yeah, I guess that's more or less my stance"
A10:47:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Okay, so JTE's server is fine to distribute in current form
A10:47:28 <aera> seems fair

P12:35:06 <grigs> Hey where i get hack for Minecraft ? please
P12:35:14 <aera> grigs: not here
P12:35:20 <grigs> ok
P12:35:26 <citricsquid> Nobody here is allowed to give them out. They're not encouraged.
P12:35:36 <citricsquid> And neither can they be given out on the forum.
P12:35:46 <aera> if you do, the ban-hammer might pay you a visit
P12:35:59 <Dilt|Eee> actually
P12:36:05 <Dilt|Eee> i'm curious as to how these hacks work
P12:36:12 <Dilt|Eee> i'm sure notch would be happy to fix them
P12:36:12 <citricsquid> most stuff is clientside
P12:36:19 <citricsquid> the admin blocks are clientside
P12:36:22 <aera> clients just send positions, etc
P12:36:25 <citricsquid> the hacks just change them in memory
P12:36:27 <PuyoDead> that topographer was awesome
P12:36:31 <Dilt|Eee> mm
P12:36:35 <grigs> ok thx
P12:36:37 <grigs> Bye
P12:36:39 <aera> to stop adminblock hacks, you need server-side checks (easy)
P12:36:44 <citricsquid> so you download map and it says "block xx in xx position is admin!" and the hacks change it to say "block xx is blank"
P12:36:47 <citricsquid> so you can walk through.
P12:36:47 <Dilt|Eee> yeah aera
P12:36:54 <aera> to stop flyhax, you need continuous physics checking (hard)
10P12:37:02 * Saer (Saer@76.226.21.87) has joined #minecraft
P12:37:02 <aera> i've done adminblocks, but not flying

12P12:37:11 * grigs (Mibbit@94.11.broadband10.iol.cz) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P12:37:14 <citricsquid> just lots of position validation
P12:37:14 <aera> oh, noclip is always possible
P12:37:24 <aera> since the server sends the entire map to the client when you connect
P12:37:32 <mail2345> back.
P12:37:47 <aera> tbh, as with all online games it's easier and often better to police than to write all the checks
P12:38:06 <vede> I think that we're good, at least for a while.
P12:38:24 <aera> this is one reason I'm trying to write better ban/griefer management
P12:38:31 <aera> with time, some can be made good
P12:38:35 <aera> the rest, can be ignored
P12:38:38 <citricsquid> I think notch will push out validation with survival. It doesn't matter much right now but it'll be game breaking in survival.
P12:38:55 <aera> indeed, but I'm not sure how much he can do without requiring a massive server
P12:38:59 <vede> Oh, man, Survival.
P12:39:17 <aera> mind you, you only need to check people every 1% of the time
P12:39:27 <mail2345> oh, and better bans like /banmac?
P12:39:32 <aera> you'll catch them at the right point sooner or later, then bam!
P12:39:35 <citricsquid> mac address banning is bad
P12:39:44 <aera> since they can be spoofed, definitely
P12:39:44 <vede> Why?
P12:39:46 <citricsquid> it'll give off the impression servers are secure
P12:39:51 <citricsquid> I can easily change my mac...

P12:40:14 <Dilt|Eee> citricsquid: everyone likes going 'omfg this security is prooo'
P12:40:17 <Dilt|Eee> real security is banning all three
P12:40:25 <mail2345> isn't spoofing on the end of the network?
P12:40:26 <Dilt|Eee> taking every security measure, including obscurity
P12:40:26 <aera> the only way to do proper banning is give every player a unique certificate, and do Proper Cryptography
P12:40:29 <citricsquid> real security is not allowing multiplayer.
P12:40:37 <aera> Dilt|Eee: real security is a lie.
P12:40:40 <citricsquid> once we have paid only servers, we're fine.

P12:41:04 <Dilt|Eee> beyond turning off the computer
P12:41:06 <vede> Yeah, the people who pay are fine.

P12:41:13 <vede> But everyone else gets gypped?
P12:41:22 <Dilt|Eee> honestly
P12:41:27 <Dilt|Eee> going from blockland?
P12:41:35 <mail2345> but that won't be good for the free players, don't forget about them
P12:41:36 <Dilt|Eee> there will be those who pay for the game and yet are still griefers
P12:41:38 <citricsquid> vede: game is going paid only (aside from sandbox) anyway
P12:41:45 <citricsquid> Dilt|Eee: and a single ban sorts them out
P12:41:51 <Dilt|Eee> the difference is that they'll have paid for the game and a single banlist can be maintained
P12:42:11 <aera> yeah, nickbans are the best
P12:42:25 <aera> if people pay for nicks, it stops nearly all griefing
P12:42:26 <vede> Yeah, it's going paid only far into the future.
P12:42:41 <citricsquid> vede: after the final release, not that far away :D
P12:42:55 <vede> Pretty far away, I'd say, seeing how it's still alpha.
P12:42:57 <aera> we'll still need good free servers
P12:43:02 <mail2345> the minecraft demo multiplayer will suck without new anti-griefong
P12:43:04 <vede> And we only have one gameplay mode.
P12:43:09 <Dilt|Eee> indeed mail2345
P12:43:09 <aera> if we want to promote game sales, and thus the continued development of minecraft
P12:43:23 <Dilt|Eee> the question is, what is the best anti-griefing method(s) for minecraft?
P12:43:31 <citricsquid> good ops
P12:43:31 <LG_Legacy> Technically
P12:43:34 <vede> Good ops.
P12:43:42 <LG_Legacy> Soon there will be none
P12:43:53 <vede> What?
P12:44:04 <citricsquid> There is no good automatic griefing prevention, you can't have a bot moderate users. 
P12:44:05 <Dilt|Eee> paid for ops tend to be better than free ops, he means
P12:44:06 <mail2345> see, if you use multiple practucal methods
P12:44:08 <aera> good ops, and good op tools
P12:44:13 <mail2345> and good ops
P12:44:28 <mail2345> maybe notch could pay people to op offical servers.

P3:03:56 <Quatroking> Derrek asks, "so what do you usually do around here" "destroying the galaxy"
P3:04:02 <citricsquid> "What do you do around here?" "DESTROYING THE GALAXY", it should be "What do you do around here", "DESTROY THE GALAXY" or "I AM DESTROYING THE GALAXY"
P3:04:27 <citricsquid> he's saying DO YOU DO not ARE YOU DOING
P3:04:33 <citricsquid> do is wrong tense

P3:05:01 <PuyoDead> yes

P3:05:02 <Quatroking> "What do you do around here" "DESTROY THE GALAXY" sounds gay
P3:05:02 <citricsquid> very much
P3:05:11 <PuyoDead> no, it sounds correct
P3:05:13 <IceFlinger> Also hi people I don't know
P3:05:30 <Quatroking> if I would do that I'd have to add an army running over derrek
P3:05:30 <citricsquid> IT MAY SOUND GAY BUT THAT IS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE SO DEAL WITH IT OR GO BACK TO YOUR SILLY DUTCH THAT US NORMALS DON'T UNDERSTAND!

P4:01:58 <Darkebrz> I hope you don't run the server like that
P4:02:29 <vede> verify-names being false leads to all sorts of trouble.

P4:02:55 <citricsquid> so don't use it on pub servers
P4:02:57 <stickzanimator> o.o
P4:03:19 <citricsquid> verify-names is whether or not it checks if the user exists on minecraft.net and if the password is correct

P4:40:01 <Phom> is it just like, the port number on your router, or something like an Ip?
P4:40:15 <citricsquid> a router has an IP
P4:40:26 <citricsquid> and then you need to forward a port
P4:40:45 <Phom> what does that do?
P4:40:58 <citricsquid> it allows computers to connect to your computer over the internet
P4:41:00 <citricsquid> through that port
P4:41:42 <Phom> oh. well, ive done multiplayer things through my computer, and hosted servers through steam, so how do I figure out which port is fowarded?
P4:42:00 <citricsquid> should say it on your router config page somewhere

P4:51:14 <Darkebrz> Is 384 a power of 2?
P4:51:22 <Phom> good god, I dont know what port number to scan, thats what im trying to figure out...
P4:51:30 <Phom> um, it might be...
P4:51:31 <Snowman> dark: no
P4:51:40 <citricsquid> Phom: just make a new one, it's simple.
P4:51:43 <citricsquid> takes like, 10 seconds.
P4:51:46 <Darkebrz> Thats what I thought
P4:51:48 <citricsquid> type > save > reboot.
P4:52:00 <Phom> right, well I have absolutly no clue how to.
P4:52:00 <Snowman> 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 etc.
P4:52:02 <PuyoDead> dark, think in terms of little usb drives or memory cards
P4:52:08 <vede> 384 is not a power of 2.
P4:52:19 <yoshibot> 256+128
P4:52:25 <Phom> puyo, thats a good idea
P4:52:26 <citricsquid> Phom: folllllooowwww theee tututututoriallllllllll

P5:02:16 <citricsquid> omen blows my mind, in both awesome and how hard I suck at it.
P5:02:20 <LKA> and seeing water/lava spawned in the core of the mountain
P5:02:28 <LKA> like, 15+ blocks above sealevel lmao
P5:02:41 <Phom> then spilling the lava down the mountain
P5:02:52 <LKA> i WISH it was down the mountain
P5:03:08 <LKA> instead it's like "RAHAHAHAH WE HAVE JUST UNLEASHED THE VIRUS UPON THE EARTH!"
P5:03:25 <LKA> and then the lava slowly engulfs everything with those funky physics before everybody crashes

P5:27:42 <Wolfram> Crysis is such a lame game
P5:27:49 <stickzanimator> Orly?
P5:27:51 <Wolfram> I understand using it to test your machine
P5:27:55 <stickzanimator> yes
P5:27:55 <Wolfram> But the gameplay itself?
P5:28:00 <stickzanimator> that's all i use it for
P5:28:02 <stickzanimator> to test
P5:28:04 <Wolfram> Average at best as a game

P5:29:39 <Wolfram> When a game emphasizes its graphics first and foremost

P5:30:02 <Wolfram> Don't you have a trojan to be opening

P5:30:30 <vede> They're just emphasized.
P5:30:34 <Wolfram> But I'll agree to disagree with you
P5:30:41 <stickzanimator> omfg i can't get this level editor to work
P5:30:48 <Wolfram> What's the question, mib_lw2bms
P5:31:00 <Wolfram> Or did you leave

P5:31:27 <stickzanimator> i think i got it

P5:31:36 <Wolfram> If you find that you didn't in fact "get it"
P5:31:39 <Wolfram> Refer to the forum post about it
P5:32:02 <stickzanimator> I did in fact "get it"
P5:32:05 <stickzanimator> So no worries

P10:20:12 <Darkebrz> Sure
P10:20:20 <tgt114> ok
P10:20:25 <tgt114> i set up a new server today
P10:20:38 <tgt114> and i'm having some trouble with the "illegal name" error
P10:20:45 <Darkebrz> mmm
P10:20:50 <Darkebrz> Server link?
P10:20:52 <tgt114> i'm forced to run the server with verify-names=false
P10:21:05 <Darkebrz> Hm
P10:21:11 <Darkebrz> I dont know if there is a fix for that
P10:21:12 <tgt114> i can't join, nor anyone else.
P10:21:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> using external link?
P10:21:39 <tgt114> both
P10:22:03 <tgt114> the server link says "server is probably down" and the external says illegal name

P10:22:21 <tgt114> static ip
P10:22:30 <tgt114> plays fine when verify names is false
P10:22:44 <tgt114> just annoying. i checked the forums. they offer nothing.
P10:23:00 <tgt114> i tried turning off NAT
P10:23:04 <tgt114> nothing.
