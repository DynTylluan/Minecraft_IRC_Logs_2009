A12:09:29 <mail2345> no
A12:09:31 <mail2345> as i said
A12:09:37 <mail2345> i get my allowance every quater
A12:09:41 <liq3> ah, ok.
A12:09:43 <liq3> You want to buy it?
A12:09:53 <mail2345> yea
A12:11:24 <liq3> how long till you can?
A12:12:20 <mail2345> depends on my parents
A12:12:42 <liq3> ugh.p
A12:12:42 <liq3> kk
A12:12:57 <liq3> maybe you should ask them for an advance. ;]
A12:14:11 <mail2345> even if i did have money, there is the problem of convincing them that the site won't steal their money

10A12:17:30 * Ausfriend (B04175@220-244-127-48.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:17:32 <liq3> also, honestly, if they’re worried about $20 being stolen, they have bigger issues. :p
A12:18:08 <mail2345> no, they think that the site will hack the credit card
12A12:18:19 * PixelSith64 (pixelsith@71-217-0-23.tukw.qwest.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

A12:19:54 <liq3> Tell them to use paypal. :/
A12:20:13 <mail2345> "It is asking for my paypal account, their gonna hack it"
A12:20:16 <liq3> They can put their CC details in there, and there’s no way paypal would let that happen.
A12:20:28 <liq3> wait, what?
A12:20:30 <liq3> “hack it”?
A12:20:33 <mail2345> yes
A12:21:09 <liq3> what?
A12:21:20 <liq3> who’s gonna hack it and why?
A12:21:25 <mail2345> to steal money
A12:21:31 <PixelSith64> lolol
A12:21:54 <PixelSith64> Tell whoever is buying minecraft he needs to send in his social security number too
A12:22:13 <Daidoji> and first born
A12:22:21 <PixelSith64> Hm
A12:22:25 <PixelSith64> And his parent's ashes
A12:22:35 <PixelSith64> oh
A12:22:46 <PixelSith64> And his driver's license, car, car keys, passwords
A12:23:08 <liq3> mail2345: yeh, cause they’re so gonna target them, instead of the other 30 million paypal users (many of which have 10000x more money then your family).
12A12:23:29 * mail2345 (gerard.mai@cpe-70-95-131-103.hawaii.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: err, thier right behind me)
A12:23:39 <liq3> lol
A12:24:18 <Griskard> Mail is the son of bill gates
A12:24:29 <PixelSith64> Paypal is trying to kill him
A12:24:29 <liq3> No he’s not.
A12:24:37 <PixelSith64> That's the "thier" he's talking about
A12:24:51 <liq3> If he was, his dad would be like “he’s your monthly allowance son, a debit card with $10,000, go have fun now!”
A12:25:41 <PixelSith64> :P
A12:25:49 <Griskard> Actually, bill gates is tight with his kids
A12:25:53 <liq3> Yeh, I know.
A12:25:54 <liq3> :/
A12:26:02 <liq3> He doesn’t want them being corrupted by money.
A12:26:04 <liq3> or something.
A12:26:14 <PixelSith64> Or he wants more money for himself
A12:26:15 <Griskard> Its called discipline...
A12:26:18 <Griskard> Or something
A12:26:20 <PixelSith64> Because he himself has become corrupted by money
10A12:26:26 * Xeros (Mibbit@ip72-208-186-84.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
04A12:26:26 Xeros has the same ISP district as bomb.
A12:26:38 <liq3> Griskard: What, training them to take his place at the head of his evil empire?
A12:26:39 <Xeros> Ahhhh, the atmosphere.
A12:26:49 <PixelSith64> Skynet?
A12:26:51 <Griskard> OH SHIT!
A12:26:54 <Griskard> ITS XEROS
A12:26:56 <liq3> Nah, Microsoft.
A12:27:05 <PixelSith64> wasn't skynet a working title for microsoft?
A12:27:08 <Darkebrz> OKAY
A12:27:10 <Darkebrz> PONG TIME
A12:27:12 <Darkebrz> |.
A12:27:18 <Chemo> .|
A12:27:19 <Xeros> Omg I'm XEROS!? It's true...okay everyone calm down...let's think this through...
A12:27:23 <PixelSith64> _.
A12:27:23 <Chemo> hi Xeros
A12:27:23 <liq3> |.
A12:27:27 <PixelSith64> |.
A12:27:31 <Darkebrz> o|
A12:27:34 <PixelSith64> Oh, hi Xeros
A12:27:36 <Xeros> Hello peoplez
A12:27:36 <liq3> |.
A12:27:42 <Quatroking> I is learning Pascal :O
A12:27:46 <Xeros> I'm so confused lol
A12:27:49 <Darkebrz> <o|
13A12:27:54 * Quatroking is internet superhero
A12:27:54 <Darkebrz> Missile time
A12:27:59 <liq3> Xeros: Bil Gates is an evil overlord.
A12:28:12 <Xeros> Cool, that'll be fun!
A12:28:14 <Griskard> Aren't the nuclear missiles run on windows? If so I wonder what happens when the popup box comes and says "Do you want to send an error report to microsoft?", does the commander say ""Fucking yes, fire the warhead Liuetenant!"
A12:28:27 <PixelSith64> xD
A12:28:31 <liq3> what...
A12:28:39 <liq3> There’s no way tehy run on windows.
A12:28:47 <liq3> They either use Unix or a custom OS.
A12:28:48 <liq3> XD
A12:29:02 <Griskard> Its a joke. Commander of a US missile base sending an error report to microsoft
A12:29:04 <Xeros> Ya know I came here to ask about programming languages. Last time I was here I asked what a good starter language I should learn, and I was convinced "Python".
A12:29:16 <liq3> Xeros: And?
A12:29:25 <Griskard> >	Aren't the nuclear missiles run on windows? If so I wonder what happens when the popup box comes and says "Do you want to send an error report to microsoft?", does the commander say ""Fucking yes, Actually, better idea. We will send them the entire missile!"
A12:29:26 <liq3> python IS a good starter one.
A12:29:30 <Griskard> Would have been a better one
A12:29:45 <Griskard> Python is
A12:29:45 <liq3> Griskard: Better, still not really funny.
A12:29:57 <liq3> Python can do just about everything, except compil.
A12:29:58 <liq3> >.>
A12:29:58 <Xeros> Two things... I keep seeing things on teh internetz and I keep getting re-convinced..... also I was wondering if you remembered a good Python compiler-majigger ^.^
A12:30:01 <liq3> wait, it can even do that.
A12:30:04 <Griskard> Would you like to send an error report to Griskard?
A12:30:16 <liq3> Xeros: Python doesn’t compile. xD
A12:30:19 <PixelSith64> Would you like to send an error report to Dictator-in-training Griskard?
A12:30:25 <Xeros> Wh...*cry*
A12:30:35 <liq3> Xeros: The closest you can get is a C/C++ wrapper.
A12:30:40 <liq3> and just send the bytecode.
A12:30:46 <Xeros> wrapper!? Parappa the rapper? Kick punch?
A12:30:49 <Eagle> If I learned anything from movies, I learned that the government uses a DOS style OS
A12:30:51 <liq3> Ok, you CAN compile, but it’s ludicrously large.
A12:31:02 <Quatroking> eagle: uh, they do.
A12:31:03 <PixelSith64> If I learned anything from movies, including Terminator 3 I saw earlier today...
A12:31:03 <liq3> Xeros: No, it’s a small C program, about 20 lines, that runs the python code.
A12:31:08 <PixelSith64> Evil robots will one day kill us all
A12:31:11 <Eagle> Or an OS that uses incredibly large fonts
A12:31:11 <Quatroking> eagle: never visited a doctor?
A12:31:16 <Eagle> "LAUNCHING MISSLE"
A12:31:16 <Xeros> Well anyway, I keep going back and forth to C or C++ in terms of what'd be better.
A12:31:17 <PixelSith64> Unless you're reckless, stupid, and want to save people
A12:31:17 <Quatroking> they all use fucking DOS
A12:31:19 <Eagle> "UPLOADING VIRUS"
A12:31:27 <liq3> Xeros: C++ is better imo.
A12:31:30 <Griskard> "ALL YOUR BASE ARE"
A12:31:32 <Xeros> It just sounds like C will help me "understand" programming better!
A12:31:36 <liq3> ...no
A12:31:38 <Quatroking> one thing i learned from movies, all their laptops come from apple
A12:31:38 <liq3> it won’t.
A12:31:47 <Quatroking> or pear.
A12:31:50 <Griskard> Nothing will help that, Xeros
A12:31:51 <Xeros> or C++, idk the difference lol
A12:31:53 <liq3> It’ll help you understand OUTDATED programming.
A12:32:01 <PixelSith64> One thing I learned from that Dell commercial with a bunch of kids in a classroom, each with a Dell computer... All mothers buy Dell computers
A12:32:02 <liq3> C++ is OO.
A12:32:03 <Xeros> I just said C to be lazy
A12:32:03 <Veronika> C will help you understand memory management better. C++ will help you understand modern programming methodologies.
A12:32:09 <liq3> C isn’t.
A12:32:16 <Xeros> OO? What are these strange words! *hides*
A12:32:22 <liq3> Object Oriented.
A12:32:22 <Eagle> One thing I learned from movies is that you can use PDAs to hack the government if you're smart enough
A12:32:30 <Griskard> You can.
A12:32:33 <Griskard> I did
A12:32:37 <Griskard> We won't...
A12:32:50 <PixelSith64> One thing I learned from movies is that the government is always foiled by a bunch of kids
A12:32:50 <liq3> Eagle: One thing I learned from movies is that any lock can be hacked in a few seconds with a PDA.
A12:32:57 <Quatroking> eagle: the government always uses passwords that are within 10 characters
A12:33:02 <Xeros> Well anyway I didn't mean C as in C.. I meant C as in C/C++... from now on I'll remember to....not be lazy lol
A12:33:08 <Eagle> and it's always the name of a president
A12:33:11 <Quatroking> related to a book or a project, most of the time
A12:33:13 <Darkebrz> Eagle: And a laptop can hack extremelly complicated alien space technology
A12:33:14 <Quatroking> oh yes
A12:33:22 <Xeros> So yeah will "C++" help me understand programming?
A12:33:23 <liq3> Xeros: Just use C++. The onyl people who use C these days are the ‘hardcore’ crowd.
A12:33:27 <PixelSith64> One thing I learned from movies: The password is always a common word, place or name
A12:33:30 <Griskard> Like Notch
A12:33:34 <PixelSith64> Ie: Ramses, Linda, or Beth
A12:33:41 <liq3> Xeros: Yes, it probably will...
A12:33:45 <liq3> Yes, definately it will.
A12:33:48 <Xeros> Better than Python?
A12:33:52 <Griskard> Yes
A12:33:54 <liq3> better then python.
A12:34:03 <Griskard> Just python is so easy
A12:34:04 <liq3> Python is better at doing things in less code tho. XD
A12:34:16 <Eagle> One thing I learned from movies is that you can translate audio to different languages instantly
A12:34:17 <liq3> C++ is faster, uses more codes, and more difficulty.
A12:34:33 <Xeros> Alriight. Hmm.. well in that case, I "do" know of C++ compilers.. and I know some C++ language!! :D Only not really.. I just made celcius turn to farenheit once.
A12:34:38 <Griskard> One thing I learned from movies...
A12:34:38 <PixelSith64> One thing I learned from movies is that any computer system can become sentient at ANY MOMENT NOW
A12:34:39 <Griskard> Erm.
A12:34:41 <Griskard> Dunno
A12:34:45 <liq3> Xeros: Use mingw if you wanna be hardcore.
A12:34:45 <PixelSith64> and launch nuclear missiles and declare a global war
A12:34:56 <liq3> Xeros: mingw with makefiles and Notepad++ :D
A12:35:03 <Xeros> hardcore sounds educational...
A12:35:05 <Eagle> that you can launch nuclear missles from a y/n prompt
A12:35:06 <Visiiri|CombatArms> how set up irc srvr?
10A12:35:10 * Visiiri|CombatArms is now known as Visiiri
A12:35:14 <Eagle> LAUNCH MISSLE NOW? y/n
A12:35:19 <PixelSith64> Y
A12:35:19 <PixelSith64> Y
A12:35:20 <PixelSith64> Y
A12:35:20 <Visiiri> y
A12:35:24 <Xeros> I don't see what the difference in compilers would be? I mean.. I'm typing everything so...eh
A12:35:26 <Griskard> Thankfully the Russians don't use computer systems to. Otherwise we could have two super intelligent computers trying to fight each other, using humans, like a giant game of chess!
A12:35:26 <Eagle> Launching missle
A12:35:56 <Xeros> Is it true that Russians when they're 18 have to serve a minimum of 2 years in military?
A12:36:03 <liq3> Xeros: mingw uses g++. it also means you have to use command line. Stuff like Visual C++ and Dev C++ do it automatically, skipping all the nitty gritty command line stuff. :P
10A12:36:08 * toast (cocks@CPE002078cab8d1-CM000f9faa73a8.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #minecraft
A12:36:14 <Visiiri> That's almost the same in america
12A12:36:15 * toast (cocks@CPE002078cab8d1-CM000f9faa73a8.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A12:36:20 <Visiiri> you have to enlist at eighteen
A12:36:22 <Visiiri> and pay taxes
A12:36:23 <Eagle> In America you have to sign up for the draft
A12:36:28 <Eagle> that's it
A12:36:28 <Visiiri> then they rape you up the ass
A12:36:29 <Eagle> :P
A12:36:37 <Xeros> Oh yeah I learned about that lol
A12:36:50 <PixelSith64> One thing I learned from movies is that the school principal is a douchebag and wants to get you in trouble
A12:37:07 <Eagle> And the gym coach has been through like 4 wives
A12:37:18 <Xeros> so g++ hmm... this is...quite...confusing... I wonder if reading from a "C++" for dummies will still work with that...
A12:37:31 <PixelSith64> It will
A12:37:33 <Visiiri> lol
A12:37:36 <liq3> You mean the “for dummies” series?
A12:37:36 <PixelSith64> If you draw a line across the C
A12:37:38 <Xeros> lol
A12:37:39 <PixelSith64> and make it look like a G
A12:37:40 <Visiiri> my gym teacher HAS for lives
A12:37:43 <Xeros> yes teh series
A12:37:47 <Visiiri> wee
A12:37:49 <Visiiri> err
A12:37:50 <Xeros> lmao
A12:37:50 <liq3> yes, should work fine.
A12:37:50 <Visiiri> err
A12:37:51 <Visiiri> wives
A12:37:59 <liq3> The book isn’t compiler specific (or shouldn’t be).
A12:38:00 <liq3> :P
A12:38:08 <liq3> g++ is just a c++ compiler. that’s it.
A12:38:54 <Xeros> wait a sec... will it still tell me if I have errors and stuff? I remember I made something by simply copying out of the book and got quite a few seemingly invisible errors! lol
A12:39:07 <Xeros> it amazed me.
A12:39:39 <liq3> Xeros: Yes, if you use g++ it’ll show you all the errors in the console.
A12:39:47 <Xeros> okay whew lol...
A12:40:03 <liq3> http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
A12:40:08 <liq3> Tutorials, best on the internet I’ve seen.
A12:40:16 <Xeros> ETE? Estimated Time Educated in C++? lol :P
A12:40:25 <liq3> Xeros: What?
A12:40:44 <Xeros> How long do you think it will take me 1: to understand the basics and 2:: to become 'fluent'
A12:40:54 <Xeros> just a guess ^.^
A12:41:00 <liq3> Basics... depending on how much itme you spend on it... 2 weeks to 2 months. ;
A12:41:01 <liq3> :P
A12:41:06 <liq3> fluent, maybe another month or 2.
A12:41:09 <liq3> at least.
A12:41:14 <Xeros> oh really? hmm straange
A12:41:21 <liq3> and i’m talking like 2-4 hours a day. XD
A12:41:32 <Xeros> I thought maybe it'd be like... a few years heh
A12:41:51 <liq3> lol. That’s what the unis want to you to think, so you pay them $30,000. :/
A12:42:16 <Veronika> Xeros: You can get decent at a language in a few weeks. Becoming a good programmer takes years.
A12:42:29 <Xeros> Speaking of languages... how long do you think it'll take me to be fluent in Japanese? hah xP jk
A12:42:31 <Visiiri> ^^lies
A12:42:37 <liq3> Ok, when I said, “fluent”, I meant like 2-3 games. (e.g. pong, tetris, space invaders).
A12:42:44 <Visiiri> lol
A12:42:49 <Visiiri> that'd be EASY
A12:42:55 <Veronika> Lies to what?
A12:42:57 <Visiiri> not so much on space invaters though
A12:43:02 <liq3> I know someone who learned japanese overnight.
A12:43:02 <liq3> xD
A12:43:07 <liq3> on a plane ride to japan.
A12:43:08 <Visiiri> lies to
A12:43:08 <Visiiri> <Veronika> Xeros: You can get decent at a language in a few weeks. Becoming a good programmer takes years.
A12:43:14 <Visiiri> Not true at all
A12:43:17 <Veronika> How's that?
A12:43:28 <Visiiri> It's easy to grab the resources you need then move on
A12:43:42 <liq3> Veronika: You’re mistaking “good” with “expert”> :P
A12:43:54 <Xeros> I'm mainly worried about my "first language" because I plan on learning many programming languages someday
A12:44:01 <liq3> Start with C++.
A12:44:05 <Visiiri> no
A12:44:08 <liq3> If you manage to understand C++, everything else will be easy. :P
A12:44:15 <Visiiri> start with python
A12:44:18 <Visiiri> work your way up
A12:44:23 <Veronika> No, I'm not mistaking anything. I'm not even going to estimate how long it will take to become an 'expert' programmer. A lot of professional programmers never even make it to that point.
12A12:44:37 * aeiowu (aeiowu@ics187-236.icsincorporated.com) Quit (Quit: aeiowu)
A12:44:41 <liq3> Veronika: Probably because they keep using old methods that are outdated. 
A12:44:57 <Xeros> Up? but C++ is a medium-level language.. python is high.. python is easier but i'd like to really understand it all first
A12:46:05 <liq3> Uh, C++ is one of the hardest.
A12:46:18 <Veronika> Let me ask you both, Visiiri and liq3: How much programming have you done, and how much professional experience do you have with it?
A12:46:26 <Xeros> psh... I plan on assembly code someday
A12:46:28 <Xeros> lol
A12:46:29 <liq3> when ppl say “medium”, they mean how “high level” it is.
A12:46:47 <liq3> Xeros: no one uses assembly anyomre, only occasionally to optimize other code (e.g. C++).
A12:46:48 <Xeros> low level programming is assembly code...etc 00010010010010
A12:46:51 <Griskard> Wanna know how much I have?
A12:47:14 <Veronika> Assembly isn't 0's and 1's. That's machine code.
A12:47:14 <Xeros> exactly... I'd like to maybe someday help progress the technology in programming languages
A12:47:20 <PixelSith64> #betahunt anyway?
A12:47:22 <PixelSith64> anyone
A12:47:22 <PixelSith64> ?
A12:47:24 <liq3> Veronika: No professional experienc. As for done? Not that much. I’m just not motivated enough.
A12:47:33 <Griskard> I was one of the people who invented Binary
A12:47:45 <Veronika> liq3: So why exactly does your opinion count for anything, then?
A12:47:56 <liq3> Veronika: Why doesn’t it?
A12:48:13 <Veronika> Because you admitted you have no experience and haven't done anything.
A12:48:28 <liq3> Veronika: The only reason I haven’t made a full game and sold it, is lack of motivation. I easily have the ability. :/

A12:49:25 <liq3> Veronika:  Also, most pro programmers are doing it the hard, simply because it’s tradition. One guy made a full FPS MMO in like 1-2 years or something.
A12:49:30 <Xeros> So yeah my idea was... start with medium level to understand in general.. then learn high level languages to understand more specifically how they work and what they help.... and finally learn low-level to go truly in-depth to the deepest darkest corridors of....eh yeah
A12:49:33 <liq3> With very advanced AI.

A12:50:30 <Xeros> A lot of internets people recommend someday learning languages such as PROLOG, LISP, Haskell or Erlang. Apparently they get you to look at programming completely differently, and to solve problems in different ways or something.
A12:50:32 <liq3> Xeros: High level = they made things easier. Lots of functions to automate things.
A12:50:39 <Xeros> Yep
A12:50:58 <liq3> Xeros: I’ve never used any of them. :/
A12:51:11 <Xeros> I'd rather know what was more difficult before learning how it became easier.
A12:51:21 <liq3> I know LISP is popular, and i’ve heard of Haskell. Never heard of the other 2.
A12:51:54 <Xeros> Lisp is something I think I'm going to get into after understanding programming...because supposedly it's good for AI, something I'm very interested in.
A12:52:02 <liq3> Eh?
A12:52:29 <Xeros> Ooh?
A12:52:50 <liq3> Xeros: Not much to understand about programming. It’s mostly just learning the language, then figuring out how to get it to do what you want.
10A12:54:05 * TheOne-AFK is now known as TheOne
A12:54:22 <Xeros> Well I need to understand it if someday I want to improve it! That's why I'd like to understand assembly and machine code...well I mean idk how "learning" machine code would be but as long as I kinda "get it" someday
A12:54:24 <liq3> Most abstract techniques (e.g. collision detection, AABBs, A*, etc etc), work in any language.
A12:54:35 <Xeros> I mean...someone "got it" somehow when it was invented.
A12:55:10 <liq3> Xeros: Well, CPUs are a mass of logic gates. I’ve tried finding out how they work myself, but there’s no real sources on the internet.
A12:55:31 <Xeros> I'm talking true AI :o the ability for the program to learn by programming and re-programming itself.... which supposedly is being researched currently.
A12:55:32 <gear1> of course theres sources
A12:55:37 <gear1> learn to sources better
A12:55:48 <Veronika> gear1: Don't bother. liq3 is just talking out his ass, anyways.
A12:55:51 <liq3> gear1: no, not really. I’m talking about ones that explain how CPUs work, down to logic gate level. xD

A12:56:31 <liq3> No i’m not. :/
A12:56:37 <Xeros> I'm talking without experience too :D hehe

A12:58:15 <liq3> Veronika: WHat experience do you have btw?
A12:58:16 <Xeros> So far my instincts(instincts for programming? how strange) are to learn C++ first, then maybe Python, then learn a bit more about some others I don't even know yet, learn Lisp...aand the future will only knoww
A12:58:34 <liq3> Xeros: If you learn C++, then python, you’ll pick python up in a few hours or days.
A12:58:39 <gear1> c++ first? sounds like a bad idea
A12:58:47 <liq3> gear1: it’s what i did. :P
A12:58:50 <gear1> or a good idea
A12:58:55 <gear1> if you want to end up like liq
A12:58:59 <gear1> think about it
A12:59:07 <liq3> Honestly I think it’s the best idea. If you learn C++, everything else becomes easy. :/
A12:59:23 <Xeros> Does anyone disagree with liq3 on this? lol
A12:59:29 <liq3> gear1: how would learning C++ first make him like me?
A12:59:37 <gear1> im just having fun at your expense
A12:59:38 <Xeros> oh I didn't read gear's response...hm
A12:59:44 <Griskard> Hmm. How can a program program itself to be better than its original programming?
A12:59:45 <liq3> gear1: that’s rather mean.
A12:59:52 <gear1> im a very mean person
A12:59:56 <gear1> anyway
A1:00:02 <liq3> Griskard: Damn, I might try to program a program that can do that.
A1:00:15 <liq3> gear1: I take it you don’t have many friends?
A1:00:18 <PixelSith64> Umm
A1:00:22 <PixelSith64> It needs to be a Terminator
A1:00:23 <gear1> i only say meh to c++ because it can be a very annoying first language to learn
A1:00:26 <gear1> i have tons of friends
A1:00:30 <gear1> and they love me
A1:00:35 <liq3> gear1: heh, k. Agree about C++ thing.
10A1:00:56 * aeiowu (aeiowu@ics187-236.icsincorporated.com) has joined #minecraft
A1:01:01 <gear1> something like python is really great for beginners
A1:01:11 <Xeros> Idk Griskard, but my guess is like... it has the ability to program knowledge to itself by learning through text that it reads, or eventually visually with images and sound, touch etc
A1:01:18 <gear1> making a php website is great practice
A1:01:30 <Xeros> and then it can re-program itself to refine that knowledge or fix its mistakes.
A1:01:38 <PixelSith64> Xeros, that would have to be a really advanced robot
A1:01:49 <PixelSith64> Far beyond our current technology
A1:02:01 <liq3> PixelSith64: I’m not so sure. :P
A1:02:04 <Griskard> But that would imply that it has the ability to reason on the subject matter to see if its current understanding is correct or incorrect
A1:02:07 <Xeros> Well I'm more about software than hardware, so the ability for it to learn through text is good enough for me
A1:02:17 <Xeros> but sound could work I guess through speech-to-text
A1:02:37 <PixelSith64> I know we have robots that can learn (somewhat) in Japan (Always them. If there's a robot apocalypse, they did it)
A1:02:42 <liq3> Well there’s already bots tha “learn” through text.

A1:05:03 <PixelSith64[ZPS]> but that'd make it take longer

A1:05:05 <PixelSith64[ZPS]> for me to shoot zombos

A1:05:32 <liq3> Veronika: So what would you recommend Xeros do?
A1:06:21 <Veronika> liq3: I'd recommend he start with learning C++, so he can learn about object oriented techniques, as well as static typing, and basic memory management (pointers, references, etc).
A1:06:32 <Veronika> It also has plenty of easy to use and mature libraries.
A1:06:35 <liq3> Veronika: That’s what I been telling him. Durp.

10A5:34:47 * citricsquid (citricsqui@client-81-97-77-9.mcr-bng-013.adsl.virginmedia.net) has joined #minecraft
10A5:34:50 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
A5:43:51 <Xeros> Runescape.. wasted 3 years of my life on that!
A5:44:04 <Siiseli> haha
A5:44:08 <Siiseli> wasted a month on that
A5:44:17 <Siiseli> when I was uh, like, 10?
A5:44:22 <citricsquid> Played it once, hated the tutorial, quit.
A5:44:38 <Xeros> Learned economical things though, at least the basics of buy low sell high... and using charisma and etc to persuade people
A5:44:59 <Xeros> but there is no merchanting anymore =/ damn Grand Exchange
A5:45:06 <Xeros> and trade limit
A5:45:26 <Xeros> Who cares if people were making real money off of virtual money, lol
A5:45:35 <Xeros> I'd be proud opf em
A5:46:00 <Marach> wasted 2 days on that!
A5:46:05 <Snowman> I love watching youtube vids about little kids losing their stuff in runescape
A5:46:10 <Snowman> and raging about them
A5:46:26 <Snowman> and then hearing their moms asking the guys his stuff back
A5:46:26 <Marach> RunEscape!
A5:46:29 <Siiseli> :D
A5:46:39 <Snowman> Then again. I love watching that for every rpg
A5:46:45 <Siiseli> oh those kids
A5:46:45 <Xeros> Ahahaa... I've only had one "true" serious emotional sadness of losing something, but then again it's what got me into the trading aspect of the game.
A5:47:58 <Xeros> It was a rare object... from the older version of the game and there were no more... called a "Disk of Returning".....thought it was 200k, website said 400k, sold for 900k... found out it was worth about 5mil... I spent the rest of my days becoming a great merchant ahah
A5:47:58 <citricsquid> http://open.spotify.com/album/3bdC6SSUENC7jNrybImFDu
A5:48:15 <Snowman> lol
A5:48:36 <Snowman> it's stupid they made items rare like
A5:48:50 <Xeros> I'd love to get into "Eve Online" but... it costs money >.> so I made like 6 trial accounts over and over...
A5:49:04 <Siiseli> I dislike all mmorpgs
A5:49:05 <citricsquid> my irl "friend" plays EVE religiously.
A5:49:23 <Marach> i dont know what you like in mmorpg games
A5:49:37 <Xeros> what! I love the idea of rare items... they don't do that anymore they make all the new "possible rare items" non-tradable. I think rare things are good for an economy
A5:49:38 <citricsquid> I'm too impatient for MMORPG
A5:49:41 <Snowman> EVE: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/208-Eve-Online
A5:50:01 <Quatroking> citricsquid, I've made a drawing of you
A5:50:06 <Quatroking> http://www.uploadscreenshot.com/image/40874/4343993
A5:50:09 <Xeros> I like EVE because to learn a skill you don't have to sit there and click and click and click... you simply..wait.
A5:50:16 <citricsquid> Quatroking: I love you even more now.
A5:50:18 <citricsquid> beautiful!
A5:50:24 <Snowman> wtf, he is yellow
A5:50:30 <Snowman> not purple
A5:50:34 <Quatroking> citricsquid is purple
A5:50:39 <Quatroking> not asian
A5:50:42 <citricsquid> Quatroking: with a hat made of lemons.
A5:50:43 <Snowman> on his site he is yellow
A5:50:45 <Quatroking> lolracism
A5:50:52 <Snowman> Draw me :D
A5:51:03 <Quatroking> purple squids look better than yellow ones anyways
A5:51:13 <Quatroking> eh
A5:51:14 <Quatroking> nah
A5:51:25 <Quatroking> the guy with the beard is notch, btw

A5:54:51 <Snowman> didnt do anything today so I guess I'll make 2 skins today
A5:55:01 <Quatroking> citricsquid, ip.php is giving mysql errors D:
A5:55:08 <citricsquid> Quatroking: oh, silly me
A5:55:10 <citricsquid> I'll fix it
A5:55:38 <Quatroking> yay
A5:56:03 <Snowman> ffs another beard
A5:56:06 <Xeros> is there any known way to seriously reduce lag in Minecraft? It won't work on this slow computer
A5:56:07 <Snowman> I hate beards
A5:56:17 <Xeros> even on single player
A5:56:25 <Snowman> they are too hard to skin on 8x8 pixels :/
A5:56:31 <citricsquid> Quatroking: done
A5:56:37 <Snowman> Xeros, close down background applications
A5:56:40 <Xeros> it freezes for like 8 seconds... then moves one frame...more freeze
A5:56:50 <Xeros> oh I always do that.. I ctrl-alt-delete a mofo
A5:56:53 <Marach> fog, smaller map
A5:56:54 <Quatroking> kthx
A5:57:05 <Xeros> and taskbar-be-gone... and window-breaker
A5:57:24 <Xeros> it lags like crazy on the shortest fog amount.. and on the smallest map
A5:57:55 <Snowman> Squid, when minecraftskins.net comes back, do I have to reupload all my skins?
A5:57:58 <Marach> so thats a really bad pc
A5:58:03 <Xeros> yep
A5:58:08 <citricsquid> Depends on how I do it, maybe.
A5:58:12 <Xeros> maybe once I re-install the OS or something
A5:58:18 <Marach> my pc is crappy and i can play on good framerate everytime
A5:58:24 <Xeros> ooh maybe I can try out Linux hah xP
A5:58:32 <Marach> on linux its even slower
A5:58:34 <Marach> dont try
A5:58:41 <Xeros> whaaa why?
A5:58:45 <Marach> checked it
A5:58:52 <Xeros> doesn't make sense to me.. linux sounds.. even less resourcey or something
A5:58:59 <Griskard> Made my first post on the forums
A5:59:01 <Griskard> Hah

A6:02:38 <SnackTime> Griskard, you may find SnackTimes in many places
A6:02:42 <Xeros> I'll have to try to re-format this XP since it's full of stuff when it was found

A6:32:34 <Visiiri> IDK yet
A6:32:39 <Visiiri> i expected you to say no
A6:32:39 <Xeros> In the beginning, there was the ENIAC Mark I. One day an operator happened to notice that the machine was malfunctioning and traced the problem to a moth that had flown into the machine and gotten beaten to death by the relay contacts.
A6:32:40 <Visiiri> lol
A6:32:42 <Quatroking> acidman: it will once survival multiplayer is done, and minecraft goes in beta
A6:32:48 <Xeros> She removed the moth, taped it in the log book, and made a notation: "Found a bug in the system." Thus, the first computer bug. 
A6:32:48 <AcidMan> Yeah

A6:33:59 <citricsquid> Price goes up when it hits beta :)
A6:34:00 <AcidMan>  Nah
A6:34:03 <citricsquid> beta is when survival is released.
A6:34:05 <Visiiri> I think price goes up when it hits beta
A6:34:05 <AcidMan> In beta it goes up

A7:19:22 <Peerko> you learn be experience

A7:19:47 <Xeros> I have to say though, for some reason reading all this is very exciting to me
A7:20:12 <Xeros> Yeah but sometimes it tells me terms that it may expect me to know when I don't!
A7:20:41 <Xeros> Even though it's a book made for beginners
A7:20:41 <Peerko> so take a step back, familiarize yourself with the missing pieces and continue

A7:22:03 <Peerko> keep reading and you'll get your head around it
A7:22:27 <Xeros> An integer (sometimes known as an "int", from the name of a datatype in the C programming language) is often a primitive datatype in computer languages. However, integer datatypes can only represent a subset of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity. 
A7:22:40 <Xeros> primitive datatype? subset of all integers? ftw!?!?
A7:25:10 <Peerko> primitive means that you cannot create that datatype from other datatypes
A7:25:36 <Xeros> o.o and here I thought primitive meant "old"
A7:25:36 <Peerko> when it says subset of integers, they mean integers in the mathematical meaning
A7:25:45 <Peerko> think of it as atomic

A7:30:08 <Marach> maybe wikibooks
A7:30:17 <Marach> i started with pascal

A7:33:13 <liq3> how is it official?
A7:33:35 <Peerko> you haven't given up after all the confusion, so I think you'll make it to be a novice programmer Xeros
A7:33:41 <Peerko> from there you can go anywhere
A7:34:03 <Marach> hmm i think about buying "thinking in java"

A7:34:06 <Marach> book
A7:34:39 <Xeros> I just want something that will tell me what every single word means... lol like if it says an 'integer' is a 'primitive datatype' I want it to branch off into what 'primitive' means and 'datatype' etc
A7:35:02 <liq3> Xeros: Don’t think anything like that exists.
A7:35:16 <Marach> just ask
A7:35:16 <liq3> Tho, usually just googling the word with C++ will give useful results.
A7:35:28 <Peerko> if you want to do java and you know the basics of programming, go to http://www.java2s.com/
A7:35:28 <citricsquid> someone make a tool that converts a specific area from google maps into a minecraft map pl0x

10A10:13:57 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|CombatArms
A10:14:54 <Xeros> tutorials cover nothing at my lack of understandment... they explain for example that "an integer is a primitive datatype".. despite that I don't know what a datatype is.. or a primitive one.
A10:15:08 <LG_Legacy> Heh
A10:15:29 <Veronika> Data type = type of data. Is it numbers, words, etc.
A10:15:48 <Veronika> Primitive meaning it's simple, and not a collection of data types or anything.
A10:16:13 <Xeros> Yeah well the tutorials don't do that lol.. I'd need a dictionary of C++ lingo
A10:16:42 <Xeros> but I learned about that from the channel(made the channel because it was a lot of off-topicness)
A10:16:46 <Veronika> For now, just worry about making a few functional programs. Learning all the lingo and the stuff going on behind the scenes comes later.

A10:46:26 <Shotz> And well, down to heart is it. Shit a zombie, build something so they cant/find it harder to get to you?
A10:47:15 <Shotz> Wrong?
A10:47:50 <Xeros> idk Veronika.. it would require some "creative programming thinking" on my part.. I barely know what a language can do so I'd only think of huge projects and not smaller realistic ones that I've yet to discover
A10:48:14 <Shotz> Anyone know a good server i can play on?
A10:48:16 <citricsquid> Shotz: September the 4th will be when you can play the beta of it, only for paid players though.
A10:48:25 <Shotz> Yeah, im paid. 
A10:48:39 <Shotz> I paid the very first day i played MC, just to support it. 
A10:48:45 <Shotz> It's not so much money.

A10:50:34 <Shotz> Is there a selected server for the beta or something?
A10:50:38 <citricsquid> it'll be on the website, I assume, on the 1st.
A10:50:40 <LG_Legacy> ... Lol
A10:50:41 <citricsquid> It's single player only.
A10:50:49 <citricsquid> the beta is anyway

A10:57:07 <citricsquid> Actually, thinking about it
A10:57:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> what i think anyways
A10:57:18 <citricsquid> surely someone can just DL the client and hand it out to non playing?
A10:57:27 <citricsquid> Must be possible to bypass any verification.
A10:57:40 <Shotz> I might just start playing through the site anyway
A10:57:51 <Shotz> Because, it's more fun not having hacks.
A10:57:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes you will
A10:57:58 <Shotz> Abnd harder to build thigs.

P12:26:25 <Marach-afk> hmm
P12:26:33 <Marach-afk> try linux
P12:26:49 <LG_Legacy> My guess? The same tempature/memory arises when i use the exact same programs before i crashes, and the computer thinks that it's going over the limit and deciedes to crash again.

P1:14:16 <ChJees> hmm
P1:14:29 <mail2345|afk> in the begining, there was the air block
P1:14:41 <Nalok> MINECRAFT: ORDER OF THE STONE >New Game 
P1:14:46 <Nalok> Continue
P1:14:48 <Nalok> :D
P1:14:54 <ChJees> Hammer and Sickle
P1:14:57 <ChJees> :3
P1:14:58 <mail2345|afk> the notch created the ground rock, and the ocean
P1:15:08 <mail2345|afk> then*
P1:15:30 <mail2345|afk> on the second day, he created the stone of the earth, and the dirt
P1:15:37 <Nalok> The Almighty god they called Notch brought unto the world, dirt and stone.
P1:15:45 <Azjherben> okay
P1:15:48 <mail2345|afk> on the third day he created the grass, and the water
P1:15:59 <Azjherben> http://rapidshare.com/files/273525686/Azjherbeniex_Image_Format_Tools.zip.html
P1:16:02 <mail2345|afk> on the fourth day, Notch created lava, and the ores
P1:16:06 <Nalok> Then...there was color.
P1:16:25 <Azjherben> Although, I still need to add my amazing compression to it.
P1:16:31 <ChJees> Azjherben, couldn't you had picked a worse place to upload to?
P1:16:31 <Azjherben> It's all in that zip.
P1:16:35 <Azjherben> I know.
P1:16:39 <Nalok> I swear Notch should make like a movie showing the blocks
P1:16:40 <Azjherben> Let me do it on my site.
P1:16:40 <ChJees> Get Dropbox ASAP
P1:17:14 <mail2345|afk> on the fith day, he created people in his own image
P1:17:27 <mail2345|afk> on the sixth, he created the tools and blocks for them to live
P1:17:27 <Azjherben> Okay, but this will be on my site for now.
P1:17:40 <mail2345|afk> on the seventh, he created the mobs.
P1:18:14 <Azjherben> He made tools?
P1:18:24 <ChJees> Azjherben, "Closing without error" :p
P1:18:29 <Nalok> Like it starts out with bedrock, then a bunch of dirt and stone falls onto the map, then water and lava flood, then trees begin to grow, then it shows a bunch of little mobs making houses, and they turn into towns, towns into cities, cities into countries
P1:18:31 <ChJees> Horribly unstable
P1:18:41 <Azjherben> Yeah, I'll delete that, message box.
P1:18:44 <Azjherben> But it works fine.
P1:18:51 <Nalok> That would be an epic intro to Survival
P1:18:55 <Nalok> Agree?
P1:19:19 <Azjherben> I also put it on my site.......
P1:19:19 <Azjherben> http://azjherben.org/iazj/Azjherbeniex%20Image%20Format%20Tools.zip
P1:19:34 <Nalok> ...Noone agrees?

P3:28:20 <ChJees> First of all, what are you trying to achieve Azjherben?
P3:28:23 <ChJees> Would help a lot
P3:29:38 <Azjherben> Compression of the image.
P3:29:51 <Azjherben> For example
P3:30:10 <Azjherben> Every instance of three of the same thing in a row, will become...
P3:30:13 <doohan> lo kids
P3:30:18 <ChJees> eh
P3:30:25 <Azjherben> A different character followed by two 0xFE 's
P3:30:27 <ChJees> Why not just use zlib Azjherben
P3:30:41 <Azjherben> ... I'll zlib it after
P3:30:47 <ChJees> lol
P3:30:47 <Azjherben> I want to make this as small as possible

P3:31:18 <Azjherben> kkriger?
P3:31:32 <ChJees> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VqzjafwCNA
P3:32:02 <Azjherben> looking
P3:32:19 <Marach> The entire game uses only 97,280 bytes of disk space. In contrast, most modern first-person shooters fill one or more CDs or DVDs.[1] According to the developers, .kkrieger itself would take up around 200–300 MB of space if it had been stored the conventional way.
P3:32:49 <Marach> speaks for itself
P3:33:13 <Azjherben> hmm
P3:33:19 <Azjherben> well
P3:33:30 <Azjherben> smaller images, do mean smaller movies and textures eventually
P3:34:08 <Azjherben> Wait, why do I need to mess with chars and strings....
P3:34:19 <Azjherben> I can just do all the compressing as it's capturing the pixels

P3:41:27 <Azjherben> well, it's just the pixels
P3:41:33 <Azjherben> they do the storing work for me
P3:41:53 <Azjherben> then at the end I just get each ones color, and save it to a char*

P5:04:40 <Visiiri> no
P5:04:45 <akuryo> what does that mean
P5:04:49 <Visiiri> minecraft isn't ready for finite water
P5:05:04 <citricsquid> Visiiri: missing images what?
P5:05:06 <aera> citricsquid: ok, that's one less excuse
P5:05:06 <akuryo> it's mentionned anywhere
P5:05:08 <akuryo> in the last post
P5:05:16 <Visiiri> Yeah for themes/skins whatever

P5:06:07 <Visiiri> I haven't tried this host though
P5:06:13 <akuryo> sponge was clearly announced as a "temporary solution against temporary floods of temporary infinite water"
P5:06:13 <Visiiri> So it might be different
P5:06:14 <citricsquid> wtf are you on about, seriously.
P5:06:15 <citricsquid> uploads?
P5:06:19 <Visiiri> skins
P5:06:20 <akuryo> really looked like it was VERY temporary
P5:06:24 <Visiiri> buttons and jizz
P5:06:36 <Visiiri> On most forums you have to upload them
P5:06:44 <akuryo> when will infinite water gtfo?
P5:06:46 <Visiiri> in php, it has variables for each one
P5:07:03 <Visiiri> [SITE_LOGO] is the main one, i believe.
P5:07:11 <Visiiri> You have to upload a seperate image to each one
P5:07:12 <AgentGreen> [boring]

P5:08:02 <citricsquid> Visiiri: PHP is my job.
P5:08:02 <Visiiri> no
P5:08:05 <Visiiri> yeah

P5:08:14 <akuryo> PHP is your job.

P8:10:22 <mail2345> hmm, is making a irc plugin for cmss worth the effort?
P8:10:23 <potato> my internet
P8:10:32 <potato> is too sketchy right now for minecraft
P8:10:34 <AlexVMiner> i spent 2+ hours there today
P8:10:45 <LG_Legacy> Though i'll be honest
P8:10:49 <LG_Legacy> We got quite alot of ops
P8:10:58 <AlexVMiner> go on alone and type /op AlexVMiner
P8:10:59 <AlexVMiner> :D
P8:11:04 <potato> what we need is a server for irc regularsw
P8:11:19 <Iguana> Or give me OP
P8:11:19 <potato> just put it in the topic
P8:11:23 <Iguana> I r cooler.
P8:11:35 <LG_Legacy> Shadow, penta, and mastria haven't been on in a while.
P8:11:37 <Darkebrz> Iguana: I updated the forum thread
P8:11:39 <Darkebrz> With a link to a server
P8:11:43 <LG_Legacy> Lol potato
P8:11:44 <Iguana> Kay.
P8:11:45 <LG_Legacy> I might do that.
P8:11:46 <Iguana> I r go on.
P8:11:46 <Darkebrz> If you want to help test, please comeo on
P8:11:49 <Darkebrz> Okay
P8:11:53 <mail2345> so i guess it's a good idea to make an irc/cmss interface
