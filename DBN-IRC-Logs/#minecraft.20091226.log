A1:09:32 <Visiiri> Like Idaho
A1:09:50 <AotC> idaho isn't that bad
A1:10:02 <Visiiri> It is compared to australia.
A1:10:06 <AotC> they have good potatos :3
A1:10:15 <Visiiri> :P
A1:10:47 <Visiiri> :P You'd be surprised. Most Idahoans haven't even touched a real idaho potatoe. They're worth more when they're exported, so we send them to other states.
A1:11:14 <AotC> meh

A1:18:58 <Aeomin> why start a .bat
A1:22:02 <TmTgr> just execute it same as you would an exe
A1:22:08 <Visiiri> :P
A1:22:17 <Visiiri> First off, it's Minecraft. I want to start it via .exe
A1:22:25 <TmTgr> ok
A1:22:26 <Visiiri> I can start a .bat just fine, but I want to add minecraft to steam.

A1:41:18 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:41:21 <VurtualRuler98> Fact: It is easy to win at Battlefront 2's assault space battle mode simply by landing on the enemy ship, and shooting everything constantly.
A1:41:27 <Roadcrosser> who controlls HAL
A1:41:27 <VurtualRuler98> It never occoured to me how simple it is.
A1:41:47 <HAL9000> I control HAL
A1:41:54 <Roadcrosser> ...

A1:43:59 <Catweasel> Why is the server I'm on booting me for some "distance cheat"?
A1:44:08 <HAL9000> because you're griefing
A1:44:15 <Roadcrosser> ?
A1:44:36 <Catweasel> But I'm not doing anything other than making a couple blocks.
A1:44:44 <HAL9000> Block spammer eh?
A1:44:52 <Catweasel> A couple blocks isn't spamming.
A1:44:56 <HAL9000> We have methods for dealing with people like you.
A1:44:57 <Catweasel> Besides, I was going to delete them.
A1:45:09 <Catweasel> Is it because I'm really high up?
A1:45:16 <Roadcrosser> kinda
A1:45:18 <Roadcrosser> yea
A1:45:23 <Roadcrosser> if you go to high
A1:45:37 <Catweasel> I'm pretty much at the clouds.
A1:45:46 <Catweasel> Going into them makes it boot me.
A1:47:09 <HAL9000> We don't help people who use hacks.

A1:50:10 <Roadcrosser> hi
A1:50:12 <AndyFm> anyone there?
A1:50:19 <Catweasel> Hi Andy.
A1:50:20 <AndyFm> hello?
A1:50:29 <AndyFm> hello!!!???
A1:51:09 <PuyoDead> Shoosh, you.
A1:51:35 <Catweasel> Hello.
A1:51:46 <Visiiri> Catweasel: it is kicking you for distance because you are changing blocks more than four spaces away from your position.
A1:51:54 <Visiiri> This is to prevent telegreifing.
A1:52:17 <Visiiri> If this wasn't implimented, you could stand in a corner with an autoclicker and take out the whole map.
A1:52:26 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:52:32 <Roadcrosser> oh
A1:52:34 <Roadcrosser> i see
A1:52:36 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:52:37 <Roadcrosser> um
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> hi?
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> :/
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> :\
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> hy
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> ohai
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> doing anything?
A1:52:38 <AndyFm> ohai kitty
A1:52:39 <Catweasel> An autoclicker?
A1:52:40 <AndyFm> ^.^
A1:52:46 <Catweasel> And how can you change bricks that far away anyway?
A1:52:52 <AndyFm> clicks automatically
A1:52:57 <AndyFm> idk
A1:53:06 <Roadcrosser> that is i think because well
A1:53:09 <Visiiri> Well, you cannot.
A1:53:29 <Visiiri> The most likely cause of this is that the server gets your block change packet before it recieves your location packet
A1:53:31 <Roadcrosser> coords usually get wrong when you are high up
A1:53:41 <Visiiri> [block]            [you]
A1:53:45 <AndyFm> So, what you get for christmas?
A1:53:47 <Visiiri> even if YOU see 
A1:53:54 <Visiiri> [block][you]
A1:54:03 <Visiiri> And, if you need a nice autoclicker, I have one for you.
A1:54:07 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:54:12 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:54:14 <Roadcrosser> umm
A1:54:15 <Catweasel> Why would I need one?
A1:54:18 <Roadcrosser> i tried that
A1:54:21 <Visiiri> Digging really fast.
A1:54:24 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:54:25 <PuyoDead> Road, seriously, learn to talk.
A1:54:31 <Roadcrosser> ?
A1:54:32 <Catweasel> I don't really need one.
A1:54:37 <Visiiri> :P
A1:54:43 <Roadcrosser> id rather blb a big hole XD
A1:54:43 <AndyFm> What, did , you, get, for, christmas?
A1:54:48 <Roadcrosser> which reminds me
A1:54:48 <Visiiri> I'm trying to update it so it supports right-click, but I'm too lazy.
A1:54:55 <Roadcrosser> visiiri
A1:54:59 <Roadcrosser> i want vip
A1:54:59 <Visiiri> Roadcrosser
A1:55:05 <Roadcrosser> with fill
A1:55:07 <Catweasel> Are autoclickers allowed?

A1:55:12 <PuyoDead> This is what I got. http://i.imgur.com/FxLBa.jpg
A1:55:16 <PuyoDead> And only that.
A1:55:17 <Visiiri> it's just like clicking, except faster.

A1:56:22 <HAL9000> Right click, middle click, and left click.

A1:57:03 <Roadcrosser> and support other keys
A1:57:09 <tentacos> Visiiri, I had to add right clicking in your autoclicker myself
A1:57:09 <Roadcrosser> k=like enter
A1:57:10 <HAL9000> Visiiri is just jealous of something that owns him.
A1:57:15 <Visiiri> :P

A1:59:20 <PuyoDead> Doesn't change the fact that you were annoying.

A2:00:52 <AndyFm> so... why did you kick me after i stopped?
A2:01:03 <PuyoDead> Doesn't matter if you stopped or not.
A2:01:03 <Visiiri> If they don't like hacking, they will add -hax to the MOTD or title.
A2:01:17 <PuyoDead> People still get arrested for things they did, right?
A2:01:17 <Catweasel> I thought that meant they ALLOW it.
A2:01:29 <Roadcrosser> stick and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me
A2:01:32 <AndyFm> this is a chat
A2:01:33 <Visiiri> "Why'd you pull me over, officer?" "You ran from the police." "No I didn't! I stop!"
A2:01:35 <Roadcrosser> doesnt apply to you though

A2:18:43 <Roadcrosser> ...
A2:18:58 <HAL9000> You're funny asiekierka.
A2:19:00 <Visiiri> Asiekieka, it's called "PHPBB"
A2:19:06 <Visiiri> Then you do a "new thread"
A2:19:07 <AotC> php is an awesome language
A2:19:14 <Visiiri> title it "last person to post wins"
A2:19:17 <Visiiri> wahlah.
A2:19:19 <Visiiri> MMO.
A2:19:32 <Roadcrosser> ...
A2:19:37 <asiekierka> But
A2:19:39 <Roadcrosser> why is HAL just a circle?
A2:19:39 <asiekierka> mods can cheat
A2:19:43 <asiekierka> therefore i need to code it myself
A2:19:47 <asiekierka> so there are no mods or admins
A2:19:50 <asiekierka> then after 10 years
A2:19:52 <asiekierka> lock the thread
A2:19:59 <PuyoDead> Voila.
A2:20:06 <HAL9000> Because I think in Infinite Loops.

A2:21:19 <asiekierka> you know what
A2:21:24 <asiekierka> I was thinking of a 100-page essay
A2:21:32 <asiekierka> on "Why did you just waste your time to win this crappy game?"
A2:21:48 <HAL9000> Prototype.
A2:21:52 <HAL9000> Is a crappy game.
A2:21:55 <AndyFm> You just lost THE GAME
A2:22:02 <AndyFm> which is pointless
A2:22:04 <HAL9000> What game?
A2:22:09 <AndyFm> The game
A2:22:18 <HAL9000> Like I said, what's the name of it?

A2:22:21 <Visiiri> I did this because I'm a creeee<e for 100 pages>eeep.
A2:22:49 <asiekierka> so, time to code that "the last person to creep wins"
A2:22:51 <AndyFm> the game is called The Game, a stupid game where you can't think about the game
A2:23:03 <HAL9000> It sounds quite drab to me.
A2:23:06 <asiekierka> and you can quit it
A2:23:09 <asiekierka> in any point of your life
A2:23:18 <asiekierka> if you can quit drugs
A2:23:25 <asiekierka> you can quit the game
A2:23:27 <asiekierka> it's that hard
A2:23:43 <asiekierka> What
A2:23:44 <asiekierka> what did I do?
A2:23:49 <HAL9000> A strange game where the only winning move is not to play?
A2:23:56 <asiekierka> Yes
A2:24:00 <asiekierka> Actually, you can't quit either
A2:24:05 <asiekierka> but I just did
A2:24:20 <asiekierka> The Game ends when the British queen mentions it on live TV
A2:24:43 <Visiiri> asiekierka, you should help me with my custom client
A2:25:11 <asiekierka> why

A4:33:04 <asiekierka> yes
A4:33:15 <gdude2002> but how would you get out of water?
A4:33:26 <HAL9000> I just want water like half water or air, and lava to be like water
A4:33:37 <HAL9000> physics wise
A4:34:01 <gdude2002> mm, make you faster in water but not so fast that you can't swim in it
A4:34:07 <HAL9000> not in the speed they move, but the speed you move.

P5:12:46 <Tumm> hi
P5:13:14 <Visiiri> :\ hacks are difficult to code.
P5:13:44 <Tumm> can anyone help me? I've problems with sending the map - protocol #3 seems not to accept chunks with length < 1024 :(
P5:14:09 <Visiiri> Normal server?
P5:14:20 <Tumm> i'm trying to code my own one :/
P5:14:25 <Visiiri> Ah.
P5:14:35 <serp> the chunk is still 1024 bytes even if less than 1024 are valid
P5:14:49 <Visiiri> Well, if you're using any part of the normal one, maps over 1024 and maps under 16 aren't allowed.
P5:15:14 <Tumm> so it's filled up, serp?
P5:15:50 <Aeomin> just fill up with 0x00 is fine
P5:15:55 <Tumm> ah k thx :)!

P5:19:16 <madk1> tWe need more.

P5:20:51 <Aeomin> ooh
P5:20:58 <Tumm> does it print any debug information?
P5:21:08 <Aeomin> the client one does
P5:22:05 <Aeomin> Are you sure everything is correct though?
P5:22:31 <madk1> Only you can prevent Spleef fires. http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=fa24c1414ad88f9e897d03a5323810e7
P5:22:46 <Tumm> well, the client accepts the first 4 packages (it displays this nice progress-bar), i think the gzipped buffer is correct, too (position with 4 bytes and the bytearray)

P6:44:01 <questions> hello i am trying to start a server (got new computer) and when i click start server i get the message 'java' is not recognized as an internal  or external command, operable program or batch file what do i do 
P6:44:10 <vede> ie. in a hex editor, it's FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
P6:44:18 <Visiiri> questions: You are running windows.
P6:44:24 <Visiiri> That's the problem
P6:44:26 <vede> ^^
P6:44:28 <Visiiri> But more detail:
P6:44:36 <Visiiri> your paths aren't defined.
P6:44:40 <questions> yes i am but i have used a server on windows before
P6:44:48 <questions> how can i define my paths?
P6:44:56 <vede> You might not even have Java, questions.
P6:44:57 <Drakkar> java is inconsistent with its setting the path when installed
P6:44:58 <Visiiri> Well, it's sort of complex.
P6:45:05 <Visiiri> First thing, update your java.
P6:45:08 <Drakkar> it doesn't always do it
P6:45:09 <Drakkar> its weird
P6:45:11 <questions> i  just updated it
P6:45:17 <Visiiri> Next, try to run it in winRAR or 7zip
P6:45:36 <questions> try to run it while its compressed?
P6:46:11 <Visiiri> No, just get in the browser.
P6:46:23 <Visiiri> Sometimes those run the batch files instead of sending them directly to windows.
P6:46:27 <Visiiri> That's what happened to mine.
P6:46:32 <Visiiri> if it STILL doesn't work, try this: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_stop_the_error_'java'_is_not_recognized_as_an_internal_or_external_command_operable_program_or_batch_file
P6:47:09 <questions> ok ill look there thanks and this isnt really new it just had to get fixed worked before got new harddrive now say that
P6:47:49 <Visiiri> :> When I upgraded to Vista I had that problem.
P6:48:21 <questions> yea it was on vista before still is now too
P6:50:06 <charrr> If all else also fails, try this: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
P6:52:01 <charrr> I know that these versions do make the batch files work
P6:53:08 <questions> im trying what the wiki answers said im finding  what path my javas on il tell you if it works
P6:56:19 <Siiseli> mail2345, what's up with you occasionally ctcping me
P6:57:12 <mail2345> @siiseli i got bored and ctcp versioned the last few talkers

P7:02:52 <Aeomin> fun isn't it?
P7:03:14 <KillaB> hey, I'm running a minecraft server, and the Generate/Save/Load buttons are all greyed out
P7:03:21 <vede> Yeah, we know.
P7:03:28 <Aeomin> duh?
P7:03:36 <vede> You can't very well generate a new level in multiplayer.
P7:03:38 <KillaB> um so yeah my question was coming up next
P7:03:44 <KillaB> oh
P7:03:46 <KillaB> why not? >_>
P7:03:46 <vede> Nor would you be able to load.
P7:03:53 <vede> Because it's MULTIPLAYER.
P7:04:00 <KillaB> yeah but I'm running the server :0
P7:04:05 <Aeomin> so?
P7:04:09 <vede> Minecraft doesn't know that.
P7:04:16 <KillaB> doesn't it? I'm an admin
P7:04:18 <KillaB> on the server
P7:04:22 <vede> So?
P7:04:29 <vede> Most servers have more than one.
P7:04:33 <KillaB> so it should know that I'm adminning. since I'm an admin
P7:04:42 <vede> What if there's more than one admin?
P7:04:59 <KillaB> then i would think they can load new levels too
P7:05:02 <KillaB> I guess not?
P7:05:05 <vede> No.
P7:05:08 <vede> No they can't.
P7:05:18 <KillaB> oh well that sucks
P7:05:25 <vede> No, it makes sense.
P7:05:39 <KillaB> my friend was making a level in singleplayer and i was hoping we'd be able to play it in multiplayer
P7:05:44 <vede> If you generate a new level or load a level in MP, then you'd be exiting multiplayer.
P7:05:51 <vede> Which you can just do on your own anyway.
P7:06:29 <KillaB> is there a way i could load my friend's level when starting the server?
P7:06:36 <vede> Not currently.
P7:06:45 <KillaB> i see.
P7:06:56 <KillaB> is that on the todo list?
P7:07:02 <Aeomin> before start server yes, but not after

P7:09:45 <Towel> Does anyone know the source of the music in Minecraft? Was it made by Notch or did he get it from somewhere?
P7:10:22 <questions> anyone know anything  else on how to fix the message java isnt recognized as an internal or external....... message?
P7:10:24 <Aeomin> Someone else made for Minecraft
P7:10:27 <VurtualRuler98> That c-whoever guy
P7:10:28 <VurtualRuler98> I think
P7:10:39 <VurtualRuler98> questions, I do.
P7:10:40 <Towel> I know where to find a solution, questions.
P7:10:54 <VurtualRuler98> Change the "java" to "C:/Program Files (x86)/Java" whatever
P7:11:01 <VurtualRuler98> Find it in your program files, link it directly to it
P7:11:14 <VurtualRuler98> Then it'll work fine.
P7:11:16 <Towel> I believe the FAQ that Legacy made has a solution to it, but I also have a link to a forum thread I had to find to fix the problem for myself.

P7:11:36 <charrr> for questions
P7:11:37 <VurtualRuler98> Problem fixed!
P7:11:54 <Towel> Updating Java and then following the tutorial in that thread will solve it.
P7:11:58 <Towel> At least it should.
P7:12:04 <questions>  so go to program files change java to that address and itl work?
P7:12:22 <VurtualRuler98> You have to find the specific .exe thing
P7:12:27 <VurtualRuler98> But it shouldn't be too hard
P7:12:32 <Towel> Or you could change the paths like I did.
P7:12:37 <Towel> And follow a tutorial that has pictures.
P7:12:41 <Towel> So you're less likely to fuck things up.
P7:13:09 <Towel> Vurtual, you have to remember, trying to tell people how to fix problems on computers simply through words is impossible.
P7:13:26 <Towel> It's always easier to provide pictures of what you're talking about.
P7:13:28 <VurtualRuler98> Towel, I just did.

P8:36:24 <Conundrumer> another one of those notability issues?
P8:39:26 <Animator> Wikipedians are a territorial bunch.
P8:40:01 <Animator> Not surprised 40,000 left in the last month alone.
P8:40:24 <Conundrumer> i see them as having experienced a lot of people trying to bring their own creations to a more popular level by creating articles on whatever they mad
P8:40:26 <Conundrumer> e
P8:40:54 <Conundrumer> so of course they have little sympathy for arising indie games and the like
P8:41:49 <Animator> They should still be able to make a wiki about their creations, at least the ones with accurate information and such.
P8:42:35 <Animator> Also, I <3 Windows 7.
P8:42:52 <Conundrumer> accurate, yes, but the wikipedian consensus is that if such articles are allowed to exist, there would be a saturation of "not notable" material
P8:43:55 <Animator> So you mean to tell me the average Encyclopedia -doesn't- have obscure information no one will notice?
P8:44:54 <Conundrumer> it's not my belief, just the wikipedian's logic
P8:45:18 <Conundrumer> i can imagine them already having a meta article on the issue of notability
P8:45:45 <Animator> Wikipedia is slowly collapsing. It won't be long until it falls.
P8:45:53 <Animator> That'll be a sad day, actually.

P9:43:28 <Primis> and then python can change other vars

P9:46:06 <mail2345> actually
P9:46:12 <mail2345> using #2 you could recreate #1
P9:46:14 <Primis> first you'd have the blocks X+Y*Z then you'd have a second varible that shows the current block type there
P9:46:33 <Primis> then you could edit the block type

P11:29:05 <vede> "Retard" describes a person's intelligence.

P11:30:09 <vede> Alright, even if it's not "proper", I don't care, because stupid people need to be shown that they are stupid.

P11:32:49 <Shadaez> Alright, well I just got a little nagry because of mail having me spam, what I thought was the channel.

P11:47:04 <Shadaez> I don't get how yo ucan get offended by a geometric shape
P11:47:11 <Adura> It's like people thinking Niggardly is a bad word.
P11:47:21 <vede> Shadaez, you really are stupid.
P11:47:25 <PuyoDead> Ok, -now- I think you're dumb, Shadaez.
P11:47:38 <Shadaez> what now? :(
P11:47:49 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Finally people agree with the computer who saw it first.
P11:47:52 <vede> I can be offended by a shape or word the same way I can LIKE the way a piece of music sounds, or think a shape looks cool.

P11:48:41 <vede> Or, rather, agree with the message of a speech.
P11:49:05 <vede> Swastikas, in modern culture, represent nazis.
P11:49:23 <Adura> Careful with purple triangles, too.
P11:49:33 <Shadaez> I mean, offended, though?
P11:49:42 <vede> Fascism offends me.
P11:49:49 <Adura> People get offended by everything these days.
P11:50:16 <Shadaez> If you saw it while reading about nazism on wikipedia, would you still be offended?
P11:50:23 <vede> Nope.
P11:50:27 <vede> That's education.
P11:51:01 <Shadaez> I get it up to a point, but not in a game.
P11:51:11 <vede> That's basically why I wouldn't be offended if someone were saying, "When a person says faggot, they're using a pejorative term for homosexuals."
P11:51:23 <PuyoDead> When I see it placed by a stupid kid who thinks shock value is funny, I get most of the offensiveness by the stupid kid.
P11:51:30 <mail2345> ^^
P11:51:40 <mail2345> i'm not offendedd by the symbol
P11:51:47 <mail2345> i'm offended by the attitude behind it
P11:51:50 <Adura> Don't make a picture of Mohammed, whatever you do.
P11:51:55 <vede> Shadaez, you seem to think that just because something is in a game, it becomes completely meaningless with regard to everything.
P11:52:06 <vede> But, uh, even things in games can have messages.
P11:52:22 <Shadaez> Alright.
P11:52:39 <vede> I mean, I could say, "Why the hell are you talking about stuff. It's IN A GAME."
P11:52:40 <frogger> SEE! When A mod says it you listen.
P11:52:56 <Shadaez> I just see it differently, it's obvious they're trying to be shocking so I just ignore it, I guess.
12P11:52:56 * Conundrumer (chatzilla@cpe-72-229-63-237.nyc.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
P11:53:07 <Adura> You're lucky you're not in Germany...
P11:53:15 <Shadaez> If someone went and burned a swastika into your yard or something that's a lot more offensive.
P11:53:50 <frogger> People take swastikas alot worse in germany
P11:54:08 <Shadaez> frogger all you ever did was say SWASTIKAS R RACIST!
P11:54:09 <frogger> The rest of the world does'nt
P11:54:19 <Shadaez> You never explained anything.
P11:54:20 <frogger> No, I did'nt
10P11:54:21 * Conundrumer (chatzilla@cpe-72-229-63-237.nyc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P11:54:24 <Shadaez> basically
P11:54:58 <vede> Even if the swastika was built with genuine intent to represent peace, or be some sort of religious symbol, I would remove it, because no matter what the intent, an average person's reaction will be to think about nazis.
P11:55:26 <frogger> I tryed to explain to you why they are bad
P11:55:41 <tentacos> what annoys me about swastikas in minecraft is that every time I see one, it's generally related to griefing
P11:55:45 <frogger> And you called me a kid who just learn about ww2, and random insults
P11:56:12 <tentacos> either they've modified and turned something into one, or they've wrecked something to the point of no return and left a swastika
P11:56:15 <mail2345> @adura minecraft multiplayer should be banned in germany
P11:56:19 <Shadaez> well, your grammar doesn't help your arguement.
P11:56:23 <mail2345> we need to setup excessive DPI filters
P11:56:25 <Adura> Exactly, like many other videogames.
P11:56:33 <mail2345> IN THE NAME OF THE CHILDREN
P11:56:51 <frogger> I don't use periods becuase most the things I say are not sentence in chats like these
P11:57:04 <vede> frogger, that was a sentence.
P11:57:05 <frogger> But my grammer is entirely not related to swastikas
P11:57:09 <vede> So was that.
P11:57:16 <Shadaez> @vede well my op's are pretty childish but I know they don't mean it, they make swastika's and stuff all the time. They are good people though.
P11:57:17 <frogger> I still don't use periods
P11:57:22 <vede> Why not?
P11:57:27 <frogger> Becuase
P11:57:33 <frogger> I just don't 
P11:57:43 <vede> So maybe you shouldn't try to justify it.
P11:57:45 <Shadaez> do periods offend you?
P11:58:00 <frogger> No, I just don't use them in chats
P11:58:16 <vede> That seems stupid.
P11:58:30 <Shadaez> Same, usually. I switch from talking proper, to talking terribly.
P11:58:40 <frogger> A chat is informal
P11:58:45 <vede> frogger, so what?
P11:58:47 <frogger> For example
P11:58:47 <Shadaez> I always use proper grammer/etc in forums, though.
P11:59:00 <vede> I use proper grammar as often as possible.
P11:59:03 <frogger> In a forum like newgrounds
P11:59:18 <Shadaez> Other people using proper grammer make me do it, too.
P11:59:18 <frogger> I don't use proper punctuation
P11:59:30 <vede> Formal and informal don't matter, grammar is for communication in general.
P11:59:30 <frogger> But in MC forum
P11:59:32 <frogger> I DO
