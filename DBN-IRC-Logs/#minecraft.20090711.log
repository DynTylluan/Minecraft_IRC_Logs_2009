A12:18:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Mouse acceleration...
A12:19:04 <vdgmprgrmr> This is where, you move the mouse and it kind of starts out slow and then builds up to normal speed, correct?
A12:19:09 <vdgmprgrmr> (If so, I hate that.)
A12:19:36 <vdgmprgrmr> But I never noticed it with GOTY edition.
A12:21:01 <vdgmprgrmr> (Which is the only version I ever played.)

A3:33:08 <Foobu> anyone here know if minecraft standalone is legal? as in allowed?
12A3:33:53 * Arg (chatzilla@d58-104-6-192.dsl.vic.optusnet.com.au) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A3:36:44 <Parthon> depends, what's the eula say?
A3:37:00 <Foobu> not certain
A3:37:54 <Parthon> I think it's okay as long as you don't distribute it
A3:38:10 <Foobu> interesting.
A3:38:26 <Foobu> yeah well that won't be a problem, since i'm looking for it if it is indeed legal
A3:38:34 <Foobu> seems like a pretty good tool
A3:38:44 <Foobu> for building and administrating a server
A3:38:44 <JTE> Heh
A3:39:05 <JTE> I programmed a server. :3
A3:39:08 <Foobu> not online it seems, only passed through email by friends it seems
A3:39:38 <Foobu> programmed a server?
13A3:39:48 * JTE nod nods
A3:39:54 <JTE> In Perl. :3
A3:40:01 <Foobu> you mean the map? or what
A3:40:06 <Foobu> the software?
A3:40:08 <Foobu> scripts?
A3:40:09 <JTE> No, I mean the server itself.
A3:40:11 <JTE> The thing you connect to.
A3:40:16 <JTE> I programmed one.
A3:40:22 <Foobu> oh instead of getting his software?
A3:40:25 <Foobu> interesting
A3:40:34 <JTE> Does not require anything made by Notch to run.
A3:40:43 <Foobu> haha cool
A3:40:49 <JTE> And can do everything his server can and more. :3
A3:40:57 <Foobu> private?
A3:41:27 <JTE> Well, everyone says the rule is 'it's okay as long as you don't distribute it'
A3:41:40 <JTE> Notch wants his official server to be the only one.
A3:41:41 <Foobu> no i mean, the server
A3:41:44 <Foobu> is it private?
A3:41:57 <Foobu> I don't need the software
A3:41:58 <JTE> It's not usually up.
A3:41:59 <Foobu> just curious to see
A3:42:02 <Foobu> oh ok
A3:42:12 <JTE> But it can be private or public or not even send a heartbeat to the server list.
A3:42:23 <JTE> :3 Can even verify names so nobody can hack their own.
A3:42:33 <Foobu> hmm
A3:42:40 <Foobu> what can it do that notch's can't?
A3:43:06 <JTE> I added a /tree command that lets you place a tree stump block and a whole entire tree appears instead of just the stump
A3:43:12 <JTE> And a /help command to list commands
A3:43:26 <JTE> and a /color command to list all of the color codes, which I added an alias for as %c
A3:43:50 <JTE> and a /fetch command which teleports someone ELSE to YOU, instead of the /tp command which teleports YOU to THEM.
A3:44:15 <JTE> and a @<person> <message> command which lets you send chat messages directly to someone
A3:44:18 <Adura> /tree could be seen as not staying with the spirit of the gmae.
A3:44:25 <JTE> and a /me command which works exactly as the one on IRC
A3:44:42 <Adura> The other commands are things you'd hope to see in the official code.
A3:44:48 <JTE> Adura: That's why I moved it to ops-only, that and build-griefers. @.@;
A3:44:54 <Adura> Ror.
A3:45:46 <JTE> and let's see, /save to save the map and make a backup copy and tell you the backup's name so you can later get it from the server admins or whatever
A3:46:02 <Foobu> schweet
A3:46:04 <JTE> and /load to load a map without the server going down or anybody needing to disconnect
A3:46:05 <Foobu> sounds cool
A3:46:12 <Foobu> oh MAN that is sick
A3:46:15 <JTE> and /generate to generate a new map of any size without anyone needing to disconnect
A3:46:16 <Foobu> that sounds like the best one
A3:46:20 <Foobu> i really hope that gets implemented
A3:46:27 <Foobu> that /load one
A3:46:34 <Foobu> i am CONSTANTLY taking down my server to reset back 5 min
A3:46:36 <Foobu> etc
A3:46:47 <JTE> but unfortunately my map generation isn't the same as Notch's, so it won't look the same ...
A3:46:52 <Foobu> that and the TP one
A3:47:01 <Adura> Well, it shouldn't be the same as Notch's, so that's fine.
A3:47:03 <Foobu> yeah I got the maps covered
A3:47:21 <Foobu> I think the software really could be better
A3:47:34 <JTE> and /adminbreak to toggle whether you can break the solid admin blocks or not if you're an admin, so you don't accidentally break anything playing Spleef or whatever.
A3:47:35 <Foobu> and actually i found a version of "minecraft standalone"
A3:47:36 <Foobu> but
A3:47:46 <Foobu> it's not the one where you fly and noclip and all that crazyness
A3:47:55 <Foobu> it's just a downloadable client you can connect with
A3:48:14 <Foobu> oh god that one is amazing too jte
A3:48:26 <JTE> and /build instead of /solid, which lets you build ANY of the un-buildable blocks, including the solid admin block, grass, water, lava, gold ore, iron ore, coal, and lava sponge
A3:48:33 <Foobu> seriously?
A3:48:43 <JTE> lava sponge is a custom block type which I added, looks like a normal sponge but only works on lava instead of water.
A3:48:43 <Foobu> these are like all the things i was hoping for
A3:49:23 <Foobu> so you can't distribute this huh
A3:49:30 <Foobu>  now I am dissapoint.
A3:49:33 <Foobu> =P
A3:49:54 <Foobu> that's a reference, not a grammatical error in case it needs to be said...
A3:51:06 <JTE> So I usually toy with anyone who joins my server by being a clone of them for a while. :P
A3:51:43 <Foobu> if you could distribute it legally, would you?
A3:52:03 <JTE> Technically, I already think I CAN distribute it legally, I just haven't yet.
A3:52:09 <Foobu> ahhh
A3:52:16 <Foobu> do you plan to?
A3:52:39 <JTE> I already gave it out to a few people, but mostly I'd just be happy if everyone knew it exists and nothing more.
A3:52:49 <Foobu> lulz
10A3:53:20 * do0han (doohan@client-86-10-18-211.bmly.adsl.virgin.net) has joined #minecraft
A3:53:24 <JTE> I also have the ability to spawn up to 127 - max_players clone characters with any name I want anywhere I want which move any way I want, and I can use them as NPCs
A3:53:37 <JTE> And change any block anywhere in the map at any time
A3:54:32 <Foobu> yeah this sounds like it should be released
A3:54:35 <Foobu> or at least sent to notch
10A3:54:37 * Spadge (Spadge@CPE-124-182-60-190.sa.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
A3:54:40 <Foobu> for consideration
A3:54:47 <JTE> And my server is much more cheat-proof than the official one. It blocks more than just creating block types you're not supposed to
A3:54:59 <JTE> Why would Notch consider it? It's not even written in Java.
A3:55:08 <Adura> You think he'd enjoy being shown what he should do with his project? :P
A3:55:11 <JTE> It's in a completely different language.
A3:55:26 <JTE> And 'better', nobody likes that...
A3:55:43 <Foobu> ehhh Idk adura
A3:55:48 <JTE> "Oh hi Mr.Notch, I like you server, see I just made one that's exactly like that except better! =D"
A3:55:52 <Adura> Now, if you make a client in Perl... yipes.
A3:55:53 <Foobu> i think it's at least something to look at
A3:56:05 <JTE> Nah, I'm making the client in Java.
A3:56:23 <JTE> I can't make the client in Perl without using nonstandard extentions.
A3:56:46 <JTE> But with the same game-centric library that Notch uses, I can make a Java applet that uses OpenGL. And I know OpenGL.
12A3:57:10 * Spadge (Spadge@CPE-124-182-60-190.sa.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A3:57:11 <JTE> Oh.
A3:57:20 <JTE> This message didn't send:
A3:57:21 <JTE> [04:51:44] <JTE> Most of the reason I "can't" distribute this: and I made a /nick command which lets you take any name you want, including names with color codes in it (so I can be "JTE") as well as using any skin that goes along with it (So if I put my name as Foobu, I would look exactly like Foobu), and it changes your character, skin, and chat name.
A3:57:41 <Foobu> well
A3:57:45 <Foobu> i'm sure that part can be removed
A3:58:07 <JTE> With the entire source code available, anyone could easily re-add it.
A3:58:23 <Foobu> if they knew how to code it
A3:58:55 <Foobu> and the source code you could easily release without that part
A3:59:00 <JTE> I've documented every message the server and client send to eachother; There's only 14 of them, and only one of them tells all of your clients what the name of someone is.
A3:59:05 <JTE> :P
A3:59:21 <Foobu> can you put up the server?
A3:59:24 <Foobu> i'd like to take a look
A3:59:38 <JTE> It's up at http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=69.127.21.77&port=27015
A3:59:56 <JTE> I forgot I left it running while I fell asleep last night, for my friend who is also trying to code a client in Python

A4:20:32 <08Notch> one of my monitors broke :-(
A4:20:38 <08Notch> so now I've only got two
A4:20:49 <Adura> Bricked, heh.
A4:21:23 <08Notch> it either blinks really fast, shows a very dim image, or doesn't show anything at all
A4:21:36 <Parthon> ouch
A4:21:40 <08Notch> and it made a noise once. I don't think speakerless monitors are supposed to make noises.
A4:21:44 <Parthon> also .. who needs 3 monitors?!? seriously
A4:21:53 <Parthon> also#2, I want to get 4 monitors eventually :P
A4:21:56 <JTE> Hey Notch
A4:21:58 <08Notch> don't knock it until you've tried it =D
A4:22:01 <08Notch> I want four too =D

A4:22:05 <Foobu> oh hi notch
A4:22:11 <08Notch> hey Foobu
A4:22:25 <JTE> I never got to speak to you before, Notch.
A4:22:50 <Parthon> I have two, it's awesome
A4:22:52 <08Notch> =)
A4:22:57 <Foobu> i got him to change me password once, and he joined my server for like 5 sec and left =(
A4:23:05 <Foobu> that was fun
A4:23:07 <Parthon> but windows is wanky when changing resolutions .. stupid full screen games
A4:23:16 <08Notch> heh, yeah, parthon..
A4:23:57 <JTE> I have a server, Notch. :3 I programmed it completely from scratch entirely in Perl. It's thousands of lines long and requires absolutely nothing from the official server or client, yet has every command the official server has and more. What should I do with it?
A4:24:21 <08Notch> legally and morally you can do anything you want with it. =)
A4:24:25 <Foobu> (and some really cool ones btw)
A4:24:33 <08Notch> but personally, I'd appreciate it if you kept spreading to a minimum until the game is completed
A4:24:50 <JTE> Morally I can't distribute it at all until I remove the /nick command.
A4:24:54 <08Notch> as long as you didn't base it off anything someone else has made, it's all your property
A4:24:55 <Foobu> hmm notch how do you feel about the flying engine known as "minecraft standalone"
A4:24:59 <Foobu> and noclip etc
A4:25:06 <Foobu> is it allowed?
A4:25:14 <JTE> ^ My server has guards against that sort of thing, too.
A4:25:16 <JTE> :P
A4:25:26 <Foobu> haha
A4:25:28 <Foobu> yeah
A4:25:36 <08Notch> Foobu: well, I want people to have fun with the game. But if people are using it to cheat and grief, it's a problem
A4:25:43 <Foobu> absolutely
A4:25:45 <Adura> Consider the stance of the server admin, too.
A4:26:09 <Foobu> it's good that it's underground
A4:26:10 <JTE> Okay then, so the server is mine and I can do whatever I want with it. Yay. :3
A4:26:22 <Foobu> i would hate seeing flying griefers that have an autoclicker to destroy everything in seconds
A4:26:35 <JTE> Now I just need to finish the client I'm working on. And put it on my website. And make it a completely different game.
A4:26:42 <Foobu> rofl
A4:26:51 <JTE> And have everyone think it's stupid and not care, because Notch is awesome.
A4:26:52 <08Notch> if you make everything from scratch, that's very cool. =)
A4:27:02 <JTE> Yeah, but I'm just a programmer.
A4:27:14 <JTE> I can't do any art of any kind for it, so I'm stuck making 'mods' and things like that.
A4:27:16 <08Notch> competition is a very good thing, and I encourage people to make games. =D
A4:27:23 <Parthon> JTE: I'm just thinking, with your server it would be possible to make an autorepair spleef arena
A4:27:28 <Adura> Make all the blocks display their hex values.
A4:27:32 <08Notch> if they "rip off" my ideas, it just means I'm clever. ;)

A4:27:49 <Adura> Minecode!
A4:27:54 <08Notch> worst case, someone makes something better, and minecraft dies.
A4:28:02 <Foobu> never
A4:28:19 <08Notch> Foobu: Even if it happens, it's not the end of the world. I'd still finish the game. =)
A4:28:21 <Parthon> Notch: even then, from what you've learnt, experienced and earnt so far, was it worth it? :P
A4:28:36 <Foobu> haha
A4:28:43 <08Notch> absolutely. I'm interested in making games and showing the world that it can be done. :D
A4:28:44 <Adura> You make it sound like he's dying.
A4:28:46 <JTE> Notch, I am also very lonely, and have been struggling to find people to work with. :< I would like to work with you on something or other sometime, though I rather dislike Java.
A4:29:12 <08Notch> JTE: Talk to me after minecraft is done. =) I'm starting with a solo project just to get used to the business
A4:29:20 <08Notch> I've got many plans for other cool games in the future
A4:29:26 <Foobu> Notch: did you see the script redshift made, the perfect globe replica
A4:29:29 <Foobu> the massive one
A4:29:33 <08Notch> yes! very cool stuff
A4:29:35 <Adura> Find an open source game project or two, JTE.
A4:29:37 <Foobu> it's really.....jaw dropping
A4:29:49 <08Notch> people keep blowing my c^Hmind
A4:30:17 <JTE> Well okay... But if other people come to you and say they want to work with you on stuff, you'd better say the same to them or bring me along. I'll always be here waiting. oo;
A4:30:53 <08Notch> hehe, I've turned down everyone who's asked about helping with minecraft, except for C418
A4:30:58 <JTE> And by "you'd better", I mean "or else I'll be a very sad JTE. :<"
A4:31:03 <08Notch> haha

A4:31:10 <Foobu> linklink
A4:31:16 <Foobu> some cool stuff there...
A4:32:18 <JTE> I'm a bit embarassed of the poor map generator, but okay ...
A4:32:25 <Foobu> hah
A4:32:28 <Foobu> it's actually quite impressive

A4:41:14 <08Notch> neatobuckets =D
A4:41:20 <autoswim> buckets o fun
A4:41:23 <autoswim> ooh mr bucket
A4:41:41 <08Notch> oh wow 850 purchases
A4:42:02 <Foobu> I bought the game 400 times : 3
A4:42:03 <Foobu> jk
A4:42:05 <autoswim> didnt your last post about purcahses show like 450?
A4:42:13 <autoswim> also purchases ignore the rum
A4:42:29 <08Notch> i don't remember when I last blogged it, autoswim. =)
A4:42:32 <08Notch> the rum? :-O
A4:42:38 <autoswim> i cannot survive without rum
A4:42:45 <JTE> I sold a license to my server's code once.
A4:42:48 <08Notch> alrightie then =D
A4:42:55 <Foobu> notch, are you planning on making other blocks unbreakable by others? just curious
A4:42:56 <JTE> Then I used it to purchase.
A4:42:59 <Parthon> Notch: still with paypal?
A4:43:04 <Parthon> oh .. did you get that sorted?
A4:43:18 <JTE> :3
A4:43:20 <autoswim> paypal likes to screw people over who receive large amounts in a short time
A4:43:21 <08Notch> Foobu: No, not really. the game I want to make is survival, not creative
A4:43:30 <08Notch> Parthon: yeah, it seems to work
A4:43:31 <autoswim> i remember when paypal fucked over some SA Goons for the Katrina relief fund
A4:43:35 <Foobu> haha ohhh i read about that
A4:43:44 <Foobu> yeah everyone is being all creative with it hahaha
A4:44:37 <JTE> I like survival.
A4:44:44 <autoswim> I can't wait for death :x
A4:44:50 <Foobu> yeah i'm really looking forward to that
A4:44:53 <JTE> I made breaking gold ore blocks add 10 to your gold count
A4:44:58 <autoswim> Lava pits yesss
A4:44:59 <Foobu> sounds ossum.
A4:45:01 <JTE> and building solid gold blocks cost 100 gold
A4:45:15 <JTE> but that was stupid and annoying so I commented it out for now.
A4:45:30 <08Notch> lol
A4:46:04 <Foobu> hows the survival coding going?
A4:46:23 <08Notch> I've been sick for over a week now, so it's been standing still
A4:46:31 <Foobu> ouch
A4:46:45 <autoswim> you are going to die of swine flu and we will be left with nothing
A4:46:46 <08Notch> yeah, it's some kind of throat infection thing. Much sleep, much Discovery Science, heh
A4:46:53 <Foobu> haha
A4:46:54 <Foobu> winner
A4:46:55 <JTE> That's why I'd like to help, mostly.
A4:47:06 <JTE> Cos while you've been sick, I've been coding feverishly. :3
A4:47:09 <Foobu> even in...JAVA! don don don
A4:47:24 <JTE> Feverishly. I'm sick with THE CODE.
A4:47:39 <08Notch> JTE: I'm almost certainly going to open up an api for the servers. =)
A4:47:40 <Adura> What convinced you to use Perl, anyways?
A4:47:54 <08Notch> you can help by requesting what features should be exposed there
A4:47:59 <Adura> More access via STDERR/STDIN would be nice for me.
A4:48:12 <JTE> Adura: I hated Java forcing me to put error checking everywhere, when I code so that errors can never occur in the first place.
A4:48:22 <Adura> Hehe.
A4:48:26 <08Notch> you can never code so io errors can't occur..
A4:48:27 <Foobu> how about admin scripts notch, like votekick, autobackups, etc
A4:48:41 <08Notch> Foobu: Those could be written as server plugins. =)
A4:48:47 <JTE> Notch: If an error ever occured in my entire Perl script, anywhere, the server would crash and everyone would have been disconnected.
A4:48:49 <Adura> But yeah, STDERR/STDIN is nice and language agnostic.
A4:48:54 <Foobu> yeah, but i had trouble installing those =(
A4:48:59 <autoswim> Foobu: i have a simple batch file that does autobackup and automatically uploads the backups 
A4:49:05 <08Notch> i mean in the future, with the api
A4:49:10 <Foobu> =o
A4:49:11 <autoswim> hrm, guess i could post that
A4:49:12 <Adura> My Perl scripts do backups.
A4:49:13 <Foobu> uploads to any site?
A4:49:17 <autoswim> the 'auto backup' tool that was posted
A4:49:20 <Adura> Script, rather.
A4:49:20 <autoswim> yes any site you have ftp access to
A4:49:29 <Foobu> seeexy
A4:49:34 <autoswim> i guess i'll post it
A4:49:36 <JTE> :3 Yes because Adura so totally doesn't have JTE's server script which also does auto backups.
A4:49:37 <Adura> But yest Notch, make sure It's not Java-only API. Augh.
A4:49:39 <Foobu> you should
A4:49:44 <autoswim> because that other autobackup tool requires .net and people bitch about it a lot
A4:49:50 <08Notch> Adura: Why? the game is written in java
A4:49:54 <Adura> My script works just fine, thank you.
A4:50:05 <Adura> Gah, I don't want to use Java.
A4:50:13 <08Notch> if I make the api java, people can write wrappers for other languages, like lua
A4:50:22 <JTE> lol lua. oo; Okay~
A4:50:41 <Foobu> i only know c++ i feel like a noob.
A4:50:44 <JTE> :3 I once reprogrammed Cave Story from scratch in Lua.
A4:50:56 <JTE> Then I decided "Lua sucks, what am I using it for. X_x"
A4:51:08 <JTE> So now I use Perl. ^___^
A4:51:12 <JTE> True story.
A4:51:19 <Foobu> Cool story bro?
A4:51:45 <Adura> More STDERR/STDIN stuff, things that'd give a lot of control. Guess it'd require a server.properties flag for verbose info.
A4:51:56 <JTE> Foobu: You're still sitting in my server staring blankly at the lava river.
A4:52:27 <peerkoel> hi all
A4:55:21 <08Notch> hi peerkoel
A4:55:49 <Foobu> hello
A4:56:29 <Foobu> ok well notch, great talking to you
A4:56:32 <Foobu> always a pleasure
A4:56:33 <Adura> First thing that'd be nice, is sending /command attempts to STDERR for non-Ops like it does for Ops.
A4:56:34 <Foobu> sleep time
A4:56:43 <Foobu> and JTE; very impressive server
A4:56:59 <Foobu> and /agree adura
A4:57:07 <Foobu> that would help alot of scripts
A4:57:10 <Foobu> addons
A4:57:11 <Foobu> w/e
A4:57:12 <autoswim> JTE do you have a server up :3

A5:41:05 <JTE> at least autoswim gave me a few new things to code.

A5:49:06 <chrstfer> JTE: the name craft is the awesomeest. someday i shall change my name to ChrstferCRAFT
A5:49:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Ohhh I see now, nevermind.
A5:49:47 <JTE> I'm going to name my Minecraft MMO server "World of Minecraft"
A5:50:10 <JTE> And it'll work by having a bunch of different maps on the server, all connected at the seams. :3
A5:50:56 <08Notch> WHY did I put the remote player stuff in the network package? haha
A5:51:02 <vdgmprgrmr> JTE, are you able to do teleportation?
A5:51:02 <08Notch> I really really have to refactor this
A5:51:15 <JTE> vdgmprgrmr, both /tp and /fetch
A5:51:23 <JTE> I like /fetch. :3
A5:51:33 <vdgmprgrmr> No I mean, like, teleport a player to some specified location.
A5:51:50 <JTE> It teleports the player to you. I could make it teleport the player to anywhere I want if I code it though.
A5:52:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Coo.
A5:52:00 <JTE> Even to completely different maps.
A5:53:01 <chrstfer> is it possible to mod the server file? 
A5:53:04 <JTE> I might try making a large overworld by having each 'actual' map be a 32x32 box in the center of a 64x64 map and use the extra space to fill in parts of other maps and keep it all synchronised...
A5:53:17 <chrstfer> or some other way to get fun things?

A5:56:10 <chrstfer> ok. ty. how can you program a server?
A5:56:16 <JTE> Very carefully.
A5:56:16 <chrstfer> explain.
A5:57:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Mmkay, back to watching stuff now.
A5:57:33 <JTE> My server is 2,232 lines long.
A5:57:36 <JTE> Of pure Perl code.
A5:57:55 <JTE> Which I hand wrote from the ground up :3
A5:58:07 <JTE> Across 6 files
A5:58:33 <JTE> Using nothing but network traffic logs from a proxy system I also coded in perl.
A5:59:00 <chrstfer> i dont understand though, HOW? is not the server in java
A5:59:01 <citricsquid> liar, I bet you followed a tutorial! ;)
A5:59:14 <JTE> The original server was written in Java.
A5:59:26 <JTE> My server is completely seperate from it, and uses nothing it does.
A5:59:32 <JTE> It can't even use the same server_level.dat files
A6:00:04 <citricsquid> ;o
A6:00:06 <Adura> That'll be confusing. :P
A6:00:17 <Adura> Unless you made the files more verbose...
A6:01:57 <Ausfriend> Notch, i hate to bother you and everything but is mac support coming back soon?
A6:02:20 <JTE> I made the files more simple.
A6:02:51 <08Notch> what, mac support broke again?
A6:03:01 <08Notch> i had missed that..
A6:03:19 <Ausfriend> Yeah, a lot of people can't run it, and a fix that was posted doesn't work for everyone
A6:03:24 <JTE> It's just the map size, spawn point, and blocks. No name, no author, no save time, none of that. Later I'm gonna add NPCs to it, though.

A6:04:20 <JTE> Heh
A6:05:08 <chrstfer> it would be cool if lava flowed up, at a MUCH slower rate than it flows down. that way its possible for maps like mine

A6:13:14 <peerkoel> that's classified
A6:13:15 <JTE> It's a sport.
A6:13:21 <JTE> We play it in the FBI.
A6:13:22 <peerkoel> and it's not queef
A6:13:23 <citricsquid> haha cue :D
A6:13:46 <Ausfriend> i mean like
A6:13:49 <Ausfriend> Spleef servers
A6:13:49 <JTE> It requires guns.
A6:13:53 <JTE> And water.
A6:13:55 <JTE> And blocks.
A6:14:01 <JTE> >> <<
A6:14:05 <citricsquid> minecraft checkers is awesome
A6:14:12 <JTE> Yesh it is, citricsquid.
A6:14:13 <JTE> :3
A6:14:20 <Spadge> :S
A6:14:21 <JTE> I want to help...
A6:14:26 <Adura> http://whois.domaintools.com/instantrimjob.com Hah.
A6:14:34 <JTE> With the checkers-playing game.
A6:14:40 <chrstfer> its a spleef and according to the wiki it rymes with greef, because that is what you are doing
A6:14:42 <JTE> I will code it. :3
A6:15:34 <JTE> Have spleef, will travel.
A6:15:40 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/4dvp10tj8_moth.JPG
A6:15:55 <citricsquid> There was 2 of those in my room last night, biggest moth I've ever seen :O
A6:16:11 <chrstfer> notch, letting admins place water and lava would pwn ASS!
A6:16:18 <Ausfriend> You've obviously never been to Australia, then.
A6:16:23 <Ausfriend> our wildlife is out to kill us
A6:16:24 <JTE> JTE already did that, chrstfer... :<
A6:16:25 <Spadge> AU rox
13A6:16:27 * JTE mews...
A6:16:41 <Rroff> citricsquid I had some of those in the other day
A6:16:43 <Cue> That's pretty big, citricsquid
A6:16:46 <Rroff> but they were changing color
A6:16:46 <Cue> It's also pretty
A6:16:49 <Cue> Compared to normal moths
A6:16:50 <Rroff> to match the background
A6:16:53 <Spadge> letting admins create water and lava would be stupid imo
A6:16:58 <Ausfriend> They're tiny
A6:16:59 <Ausfriend> get real
A6:17:07 <citricsquid> rroff: awesome
A6:17:15 <chrstfer> nice, can i enter the beloved JTE's server?
A6:17:22 <Cue> http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/05/16/3881_local-news.html This one's bigger
A6:17:27 <JTE> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=530ae5b55ff0a56c21fc24e1f3140d7
A6:17:27 <JTE> I'm testing something right now, though
A6:17:43 <JTE> But I think it works.
A6:17:43 <Adura> I put water in a tree, someone destroyed the tree.
A6:17:52 <citricsquid> pffffffft, it's australia, you have weird everything.
A6:17:53 <JTE> Yeah, it's all good.
A6:18:12 <Ausfriend> see
A6:18:12 <JTE> Adura: I put lava in a pit, Notch destroied the pit..
A6:18:15 <08Notch> that.. moth.. has to be.. fake..
A6:18:15 <Ausfriend> com.au
A6:18:24 <JTE> So it happens often.
A6:18:29 <Cue> Hercules moths are massive.
A6:18:49 <Cue> http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=hercules%20moth&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi
A6:19:05 <Adura> Hah, somone had some fun on my small map.
A6:19:21 <chrstfer> your map seems to have crashed mah firefox...
A6:19:26 <JTE> mew...?
A6:19:36 <JTE> That's very strange. Let me generate a new one...
A6:19:38 <Ausfriend> Cue: look how badass that caterpillar looks
A6:19:50 <Cue> inorite
A6:19:52 <Cue> It has spikes
A6:19:57 <Cue> It looks like Sonic the Hedgehog
A6:20:13 <Ausfriend> but can Sonic turn into a giant flipping moth
A6:20:15 <Ausfriend> no sir
A6:20:16 <Ausfriend> it cannot.
A6:20:25 <Rroff> http://aten-hosted.com/images/moth.jpg
A6:20:31 <Rroff> can guess which bit it was on before :P
A6:20:44 <citricsquid> oh wow
A6:20:45 <citricsquid> awesome
A6:21:06 <Rroff> bit smaller than yours tho
A6:22:26 <Ausfriend> Notch, a question about premium. If you prepurchase now, do you get free updates to the full version?
A6:22:33 <08Notch> yes
A6:22:40 <Cue> Remind me, what does premium give...?
A6:22:47 <08Notch> the game, cue. =)
A6:22:47 <Ausfriend> ah great
A6:22:50 <08Notch> the game won't be free when it's done
A6:22:52 <Cue> touche.
A6:22:52 <citricsquid> skins! :D
A6:23:06 <Cue> ffff
A6:23:09 <Ausfriend> and you will be increasing the price when its done?
A6:23:09 <Cue> stupid exchange rate
A6:23:15 <08Notch> Ausfriend: Yes
A6:23:19 <Ausfriend> ic
A6:23:20 <Cue> I remember a time when 9.95 euros was more like £5 :(
A6:23:29 <peerkoel> good old days hm
A6:23:31 <Ausfriend> and Cue, i agree. Euros is a fail currency
A6:23:31 <Ausfriend> no offense.
A6:23:35 <Cue> No
A6:23:42 <Cue> The pound is weak as hell
A6:23:43 <08Notch> Cue: Yeah.. that's the reason I change in euros. Dollars<->Swedish Kronor is very random
A6:23:44 <Cue> That's why.
A6:24:07 <Cue> How much would is be in Kronor?
A6:24:19 <08Notch> I get about 100 kronor per sale now
A6:24:36 <Cue> That's £7.77... :o
A6:24:49 <08Notch> sounds about right
A6:24:51 <citricsquid> What can 100 Kronor buy you? :D
A6:24:58 <08Notch> two big mac meals. :D
A6:25:03 <citricsquid> :D
A6:25:05 <08Notch> or, well, just under that
A6:25:10 <08Notch> like 1.75 big mac meals
A6:25:20 <Adura> You just lost the vegan potential customers.
A6:25:24 <citricsquid> Did sales pick up yesterday? It seems to have gone up over 70 in the past 24 hours.
A6:25:43 <Ausfriend> Minecraft is Â£10 yeah?
A6:25:49 <08Notch> citricsquid: heh, no, not 70. But it's gone up, yes
A6:25:57 <Rroff> 9.99 euro I think
A6:25:58 <08Notch> I think the average for the last few days has been about 20 per day
A6:26:02 <08Notch> 9.95 euro
A6:26:04 <Rroff> so like £8.16 or something
A6:26:05 <peerkoel> 9,95 for me
A6:26:06 <Ausfriend> right
A6:26:14 <Ausfriend> thats like $15 AUD
A6:26:17 <Ausfriend> which sucks :(
A6:26:23 <Cue> So how much is this getting you, Notch...? o.o
A6:26:32 <citricsquid> Notch: I have no sense of time anymore, It felt like 24 hours ago when it said ~780 :D
A6:26:33 <08Notch> Cue: It's all on the front page. =)
A6:26:45 <08Notch> I've sold like 850 copies, at 100 sek each, that's 85000 kronor
A6:26:51 <08Notch> after taxes, I get like 40000
A6:27:04 <Cue> £111
A6:27:05 <08Notch> which would last me about three months if I quit my job. :D
A6:27:05 <Ausfriend> ouch, taxes in sweden must suck
A6:27:05 <Cue> Nice
A6:27:05 <citricsquid> 850 * 9.95 - ~5% of paypal fees 
A6:27:10 <Ausfriend> i heard its 56% tax?
A6:27:20 <Cue> Now if only Xbox Live Community Games was that good
A6:27:22 <08Notch> something like that, yes, Ausfriend 
A6:27:28 <Rroff> ouch that sucks
A6:27:29 <Ausfriend> bugger
A6:27:29 <Cue> Because the CG section is really poor right now
A6:27:30 <citricsquid> move to cuba! They don't have taxes do they?
A6:27:36 <Cue> You get these shitty games like Rumble Massage
A6:27:44 <Cue> Where's the good stuff? :(
A6:27:45 <08Notch> I don't mind paying taxes really.. but when I have to pay more than I get to keep, it kinda stings..
A6:27:59 <Ausfriend> move to Finland
A6:28:05 <08Notch> there are a few loopholes, though
A6:28:17 <08Notch> like if I buy a new monitor, I pay that via the company and don't have to pay taxes
A6:28:17 <Cue> Wait ,my mistake
A6:28:20 <Cue> £3111...
A6:28:23 <citricsquid> That happens here in the UK, the richest of society pay well over 50% which is silly, makes it pointless to earn lots.
A6:28:25 <08Notch> so the monitor is half price for me. :D
A6:28:28 <Cue> You've seriously got that much?
A6:28:38 <Cue> £3000+ from this? :O
A6:28:46 <08Notch> huh? i don't think it's that much, no
A6:28:48 <Rroff> and counting
A6:28:56 <Cue> 40,000 SEK is £3k.
A6:29:01 <08Notch> oh wow
A6:29:02 <Rroff> take out server costs
A6:29:03 <Cue> http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&hs=0TG&q=40000+sek+in+gbp&btnG=Search&meta=
A6:29:08 <Rroff> and its around £3K
A6:29:15 <08Notch> the server is 200 dollars per month
A6:29:19 <Cue> That's a lot...
A6:29:20 <citricsquid> cheapcjeap
A6:29:22 <Cue> What do you get for that?
A6:29:22 <citricsquid> cheap*
A6:29:28 <08Notch> it's a pretty good server. =)
A6:29:32 <Ausfriend> Notch, did you base this off Infiniminer or did you make it from scratch with an idea from Infiniminer.
A6:29:36 <08Notch> i think I blogged it a while back, Cue
A6:29:46 <08Notch> Ausfriend: It's written from scratch
A6:29:53 <Cue> We pay $99 for a Phenom, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD and 1.5tb bandwidth... :S
A6:29:53 <citricsquid> http://notch.tumblr.com/post/126392210/moving-to-the-new-web-server
A6:29:55 <Cue> On a 100mbit port
A6:30:08 <Cue> ahhh
A6:30:13 <Cue> That's nice
A6:30:18 <Cue> What the hell do you use it for though?
10A6:30:31 * rosetta (Rosetta@78.150.78.75) has joined #minecraft
A6:30:36 <08Notch> i will use it for all my projects
A6:30:43 <08Notch> mojang.com will move there once I get around to it
A6:30:50 <Cue> I mean, isn't most of it done clientside in SP?
A6:30:52 <08Notch> and I'll make more games in the future
A6:30:58 <Cue> And the bandwidth is sucked from the host in MP... :S
10A6:30:59 * doohan (doohan@client-86-10-18-211.bmly.adsl.virgin.net) has joined #minecraft
A6:31:10 <Ausfriend> mmmm, Java Console shows nothing erroneous when i start Minecraft, and it doesnt load :(
A6:31:19 <Cue> Still, that's a damn, damn good deal
A6:31:21 <Cue> Where's it from?
A6:31:26 <citricsquid> singlehop.com =D
A6:31:34 <08Notch> yep. citricsquid recomended them
A6:31:35 <JTE> Hi rosetta.
A6:31:51 <rosetta> hey
13A6:31:58 * Cue came
A6:31:58 <JTE> I hear you have a server too? :3
A6:32:05 <Cue> Do they do any unmetered?
A6:32:17 <rosetta> Yeah I'm trying to make one
A6:32:25 <citricsquid> cue: I think the max they do is 10tb
A6:32:48 <Rroff> you gotta go insane to use 1Tb
A6:32:52 <Rroff> 10tb even
A6:32:53 <citricsquid> yeah, 10tb unless you get a custom quote
A6:32:54 <08Notch> incoming traffic doesn't count towards the limit
A6:33:11 <Cue> Depends on what you're doing, really
A6:33:13 <citricsquid> How much have you used so far Notch?
A6:33:20 <Rroff> I've barely gone over 1Tb on the most insane of bandwidth useages
A6:33:21 <08Notch> not much. =)
A6:33:25 <Cue> File hosting would obliterate 10tb probably
A6:33:28 <Cue> On some servers
10A6:33:44 * Ste (chatzilla@5ad87e77.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
A6:33:52 <Cue> The file host provided by a community member for SRB2 apparently used 200gb a day
A6:33:52 <peerkoel> hm, almost got my grass growing
A6:33:57 <Rroff> if you were hosting a lot of popular files I guess
A6:33:57 <Cue> Although I'm not entirely sure that's true
A6:34:07 <Ste> Hi all
A6:34:08 <Cue> Considering they were on a 5tb/m servage plan
A6:34:25 <Cue> And 200gb would wipe it out in a few weeks.
A6:34:40 <citricsquid> across all my siteas (including minecraft forum and wiki) I get >10,000 uniques a day and only do 1GB bandwidth :D
A6:34:49 <Cue> Nice.
A6:34:49 <Rroff> when I was seeding the ETQW demo torrent
A6:34:58 <Rroff> I was uploading around 3Gigabytes a minute
A6:35:01 <Rroff> but
A6:35:03 <Ausfriend> what
A6:35:06 <doohan> Notch, I'm curios, you don't have to answer if you don't want, but what so far do you think about such open development?
A6:35:13 <doohan> Is it something you think you'd do for your next game?
A6:35:15 <Ausfriend> damn i wish i had that sort of internet in Australia
A6:35:16 <Rroff> after a couple of days that dropped off to almost nothing
A6:35:17 <chrstfer> DEMO???? a DEMPO as a TORRENT!!!
A6:35:25 <08Notch> doohan: Absolutely, in a heartbeat
A6:35:34 <doohan> Cool :)
A6:35:35 <Ausfriend> it costs me $90 AUD for 5mbit and 150gb dl limit
A6:35:37 <08Notch> It's a bit scary, hehe
A6:35:47 <08Notch> but to be honest, I think it's VERY good for goodwill
A6:36:03 <08Notch> I think my next game(s) will get more sales just because people remember me from minecraft
A6:36:07 <chrstfer> notch, can you make flying/noclip/cheats for admins, and make them allow others, on a name by name basis?
A6:36:19 <citricsquid> can I pre-order it now, Notch? ;) 
A6:36:29 <doohan> Are you at all worried about the possibility of free custom clients for playing with free custom servers?
A6:36:41 <citricsquid> chrstfer: I think he said no to that before, doesn't want noclip in the game.
A6:36:42 <Ausfriend> If you released Minecraft on XBLA or PSN you'd get a ton of new customers
A6:36:50 <Ausfriend> if its possible
A6:36:51 <Ausfriend> i mean
A6:37:01 <Cue> Ausfriend, he could release it on Community Games if he wanted to, very easily
A6:37:06 <Cue> Not PSN though, lots of contracts
A6:37:06 <citricsquid> If he released it on steam, that'd be awesome.
A6:37:10 <doohan> I mean people have written compatible servers from scratch. Is it much of a leap to make a matching client?
A6:37:15 <Rroff> XBLA would be possible I think with a bit of porting
A6:37:15 <Cue> But Community Games gets very little attention
A6:37:15 <doohan> Minecraft on steam would be cool.
A6:37:20 <Ausfriend> Steam is great for indie devs
A6:37:20 <Cue> Very, very little attention
A6:37:24 <08Notch> doohan: I'm not worried about competition, that's just cool
A6:37:26 <Cue> Uh, total port... >_>
A6:37:27 <Ausfriend> but the tax they induce is heaps
A6:37:34 <Rroff> for PSN don't you need the development hardware as well?
A6:37:41 <Rroff> which is like 10 grand up front
A6:37:42 <08Notch> but I'm a bit worried about people stealing my work. ie cracking the client and distributing that and so
A6:37:42 <Cue> C#/C++ or gtfo with 360
A6:37:43 <doohan> That's good, I want to see the finished minecraft :)
A6:37:44 <citricsquid> Ausfriend: Yeah, but the extra sales would make up for it :D
A6:37:45 <Cue> You can't use Java =P
A6:37:49 <Adura> If someone made their own server and client... it'd be an Infiniminer clone. :P
A6:38:02 <08Notch> but I think that risk is worth it.
A6:38:13 <Cue> Community Games with C# and XNA would work wonders
A6:38:14 <peerkoel> cracked?
A6:38:18 <peerkoel> what?
A6:38:19 <Cue> You'd have some awesome stuff there
A6:38:22 <peerkoel> where?
10A6:38:26 * Arg (chatzilla@d58-104-6-192.dsl.vic.optusnet.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A6:38:37 <Cue> But it would require a lot of work
A6:38:46 <Cue> And like I said, CG doesn't get the attention needed for good devs
A6:39:01 <citricsquid> I think you're in a position where so many people know about minecraft, if a clone came along it'd be ignored and anyone who did play it would end up on minecraft anyway.
A6:39:14 <Cue> http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6211893.html Although... =P
A6:39:18 <peerkoel> most possibly citricsquid 
A6:39:21 <Ausfriend> I dont think many people know about Minecraft
A6:39:27 <doohan> notch you reckon you would try to put minecraft on the sun store if it's anygood?
A6:39:27 <Cue> YES
A6:39:29 <Cue> USER RATING <3
A6:39:56 <Ausfriend> completely unrelated note: TES Daggerfall is now freeware
A6:39:57 <Ausfriend> http://www.elderscrolls.com/downloads/downloads_games.htm
A6:40:21 <citricsquid> Ausfriend: If you consider the biggest forums, somethingawful, facepunch and a few others are pretty much in love with minecraft, any clones would get shot down in an instant.
A6:40:38 <Ausfriend> not to mention 4chan
A6:40:43 <Ausfriend> god those goons love that game
A6:40:55 <citricsquid> goons are somethingawful!
A6:41:00 <doohan> Yeah
A6:41:03 <Cue> If you can get 4chan's audience loving your game
A6:41:04 <Ausfriend> oh
A6:41:06 <Ausfriend> well then
A6:41:06 <08Notch> Ausfriend: !!! =D
A6:41:08 <Cue> You control the Internet.
A6:41:17 <08Notch> doohan: I'd love to, when it's done. =D
A6:41:22 <doohan> Sweet
A6:41:22 <citricsquid> Cue: thank god you didn't call them anonymous <3
A6:41:29 <08Notch> my dream goal is to end up on steam and/or the stardock one
A6:41:36 <Ausfriend> eww stardock
A6:41:47 <Ausfriend> Impulse Digital store or something?
A6:41:48 <citricsquid> Notch: better get planning achievements then! :D
A6:41:48 <doohan> The stardock one seems a bit of an underdog just now.
A6:41:50 <Ausfriend> Yeah, its crap
A6:41:51 <doohan> Yeah impulse
A6:42:20 <08Notch> yeah, it's an underdog. but I'd love to see it get bigger. compeition = good
A6:42:34 <citricsquid> world of goo sold a shit tonne on steam didn't they? If minecraft got like that...
A6:43:18 <Ausfriend> world of goo had 95% piracy race
A6:43:21 <Ausfriend> the devs said
A6:43:28 <Ausfriend> *piracy rate
A6:43:30 <citricsquid> yeah, and they still made lots of sales :D
A6:43:53 <doohan> new moneky island demo
A6:43:59 <chrstfer> notch, how are you feeling? 
A6:44:04 <doohan> I forgot about that cause I had to use a mobile phone as a modem :)
A6:44:08 <Ausfriend> brb
13A6:44:10 * doohan downloads
A6:44:11 <chrstfer> looking at the dev blog, and you said you was sick
A6:44:17 <Ausfriend> im gonna ask the 4chan irc about minecraft
A6:44:17 <08Notch> chrstfer: Better than a week ago, but my throat is still very sore
A6:44:20 <Ausfriend> yeah i went there
A6:44:45 <08Notch> I'm not that worried about piracy, to be honest. Sure, I don't want it, and I won't let people legally pirate my game
A6:44:55 <08Notch> but it's a part of the pc market, and there really are honest customers out there as well
A6:45:16 <08Notch> so I'd rather make the piracy bit act as advertisement for the game if I can
A6:45:18 <chrstfer> oh. im smart... lol'
A6:45:36 <Ausfriend> Steam has very secure DRM, if you are going to release it on that
A6:45:40 <citricsquid> I'll buy a game if the price is right and I think I'll get my moneys worth, played >40 hours of minecraft which easily makes back the money, there are commercial games I bought and got bored after 20 mins.
A6:46:03 <Ausfriend> I'd buy minecraft in an instant if i could get it to work
A6:46:04 <Ausfriend> zzzzzz
A6:46:21 <Cue> I refuse to buy a game if it has no multiplayer
A6:46:24 <Cue> If it has, though
A6:46:26 <Cue> I'm all over it
A6:46:38 <Cue> The only game I bought that had no multiplayer on the 360 is Superman Returns
A6:46:42 <Cue> I hate that game, boring as hell
A6:46:55 <Cue> The better the multiplayer, the more I play it
A6:47:05 <Cue> Which is probably why Halo 3 is my most player game...
A6:47:08 <Ausfriend> see: team fortress 2
A6:47:11 <Ausfriend> low ass piracy rate
A6:47:15 <Ausfriend> good MP
A6:47:19 <citricsquid> cheap games are always the best, for some reason. I got CoD1 for £10 and played over 1200 hours of it.
A6:47:19 <Cue> TF2 on PC, yeah
A6:47:19 <Ausfriend> and no SP at all
A6:47:58 <Ausfriend> i bought UT99 packed with the original retail of Unreal for $45 at Harvey Norman 10 years ago and i still play them both today
A6:47:59 <citricsquid> teamfortress is very well priced, I think that is part of the success it has; it's not a game you have to consider when buying, it's sort of "hey that's cheap and mentioned a lot, I'll buy it!". 
A6:48:12 <Cue> UT2004 is the best UT ever.
A6:48:14 <Cue> UT3 sucks. :x
A6:48:32 <Ausfriend> Ut2004 is the most popular, but UT99 has the best game mechanics
A6:48:35 <Ausfriend> you cannot argue with this
A6:49:13 <Ausfriend> Hows the lag on minecraft
A6:49:15 <Ausfriend> ?

A6:50:28 <JTE> Q3A is so better than UT99. >>
A6:50:47 <Ausfriend> Q3a is more tourney than ut99
A6:50:50 <08Notch> quake live!!
A6:50:52 <Ausfriend> more competetive
A6:50:58 <08Notch> well, I suck at it. But still, QUAKE LIVE!
A6:51:00 <Ausfriend> quake live is a laggy shitfest
A6:51:04 <Ausfriend> no offense
A6:51:09 <citricsquid> is that the browser one?
A6:51:12 <08Notch> :-(
A6:51:12 <Ausfriend> yeah
A6:51:28 <citricsquid> that was fun to play, everyone was too good for me though :(
A6:51:33 <Ausfriend> you cant put quake onto a browser
A6:51:37 <Ausfriend> science doesnt work that way
A6:51:53 <08Notch> lol

A6:52:14 <08Notch> i don't know why I find that funny :D
A6:53:00 <JTE> Ausfriend, you can put anything onto a browser with the right plugin. Unfortunately, Quake Live is a custom plugin that requires a whole administrative installation process and installs two mostly-unremovable PunkBuster services whether you like it or not, thus eliminating most of the POINT of it being browser-based.
A6:53:17 <JTE> They're doin it wrong. :(
A6:53:27 <citricsquid> battlefield heroes is pretty cool
A6:54:14 <Ausfriend> urgh

A6:56:45 <citricsquid> Should topics on the forum based around a specific server be allowed? People keep making topics about their own servers and I have no idea if they should be allowed to stay; quick, community survey, go!

A7:08:50 <JTE> Heh.
A7:09:01 <Ausfriend> Notch, how about gravity, so if you destroy a trees trunk then the leaves fall or something

13A7:09:20 * citricsquid sneaks away for a shower

A7:14:40 <ZomBuster> lol
A7:14:52 <systat> I got banned and lots of other people...
A7:14:55 <JTE> Oh, I got a solution that will make griefers happy as well as players.
A7:14:59 <ZomBuster> dont worry about puregamersss it's a mess
A7:15:07 <Ausfriend> JTE explain.
A7:15:08 <ZomBuster> didnt knew they got voteban tough
A7:15:38 <JTE> Forget votekick, instead do votemute, and make mute ignore block change commands.
A7:15:42 <JTE> as well as chat.
A7:15:52 <JTE> Then they can run around destroying stuff all they like
A7:15:56 <JTE> and building whatever
A7:15:59 <JTE> and nobody else will see it.
A7:16:13 <JTE> So it won't disturb anyone. XD
A7:16:26 <doohan> Then you'll have to store loads more stuff though right?
A7:16:26 <Ausfriend> client side block creation/destruction that doesnt get sent to the server?
A7:16:34 <JTE> Naw.
A7:16:52 <JTE> When you build/break a block in minecraft, the client IMMEDIATELY shows the change
A7:16:55 <doohan> Does the client store the full state or just the stuff near by?
A7:16:57 <JTE> then sends it to the server

A7:17:21 <Ausfriend> whats going on
A7:17:22 <Owner> are there any mods here or anything
A7:17:22 <doohan> Cause you'll move away then go back and it'll be changed
A7:17:28 <JTE> and the server will ignore it for anyone else. :3
A7:17:38 <JTE> doohan, the client stores the full state of the map

A8:04:26 <citricsquid> It's on a server if you want to make some, or I could if you know what pics you need :)

A9:17:18 <Ausfriend> Im using it via Vmware

A9:17:23 <Ausfriend> Everything is already updated
A9:17:24 <Rroff> and pray your not using an older intel chipset that only does 16bit 3D

A9:17:30 <citricsquid> Notch: This is perfect!
A9:17:50 <Adura> Fine updates, though.

A10:04:51 <autoswim> o ok
A10:04:58 <citricsquid> also legal age is 16 here in the UK.
A10:05:16 <Minerman> There's a thing called an enter key. It hates you. Stop pressing it
A10:07:02 <Bob_Ross> you guys are lucky, critic and zuriki
A10:07:08 <Bob_Ross> y'all can screw at 16

A10:07:44 <Bob_Ross> lol
A10:07:46 <citricsquid> and there are lots of people who have sex before 16...
A10:08:43 <autoswim> gasp..
A10:08:49 <autoswim> notch removed our ability to fly! (for now)
A10:09:10 <autoswim> imo we should be allowed to fly and turbo like we were until survival is working
A10:09:17 <Minerman> I find the new Minecraft update to be pretty awesome. Now I can leave the music on without the constant, annoying sound effects.
A10:09:19 <autoswim> its a total hassle of a bitch to build tall stuff
A10:09:23 <PuyoDead> oh darn, hacks were fixed

A10:13:49 <oldage> and... the height limit is dumb
A10:13:59 <oldage> can we get the height limit away? or higher?
A10:14:08 <citricsquid> Yes, you can use one of the map editors
A10:14:14 <Bob_Ross> secks
A10:14:15 <citricsquid> and then upload that copy of the map to your server.
A10:14:27 <PuyoDead> well autoswim, guess you'll just have to build like everyone else
A10:14:31 <oldage> everything on the map will be gone though right?
A10:14:41 <autoswim> oldage there is a program out
A10:14:46 <autoswim> that can add or double the height of the map
A10:14:48 <citricsquid> I don't think so, there are editors that take prebuilt maps
A10:14:51 <autoswim> highest i've seen so far is 4096
A10:14:54 <oldage> oooh
A10:15:00 <autoswim> I have one that'll add without wiping the map
A10:15:01 <oldage> ok, thanks guys!

P1:12:32 <iPope> thats not helpful at all :P
P1:12:41 <JTE> Then, talk to me about it more here. :3
P1:13:18 <iPope> right i understand everything up to the server communcating with the java applet, I dont know how your doing that
P1:13:43 <autoswim> uh the sand-watch glitch doesn't work in mp
P1:14:03 <autoswim> oh i didn't read the that line
P1:14:08 <autoswim> -the
P1:14:16 <JTE> I'm doing it through the internet.
P1:14:46 <iPope> *sigh* i guessed that
P1:15:08 <iPope> right the client says a command, e.g /nick
P1:15:08 <iPope> the server gets the command
P1:15:08 <JTE> You're asking me something silly, like "how does a PHP script send web pages to clients on an Apache server? I thought only HTML could do that!"
P1:15:08 <JTE> :P
P1:15:21 <JTE> The server gets the command "/nick", yes.
P1:15:21 <iPope> nope thats not what im asking
P1:15:29 <JTE> It gets it the same way it gets normal text.
P1:15:40 <iPope> yup got that
P1:15:41 <JTE> The fact that it gets interpreted AS a command in the first place is entirely server-side.
P1:16:01 <iPope> yup, but what i want to know is what the server does after that
P1:16:19 <JTE> The server sees "Oh hay, this guy said /nick, I should change their name!" and makes a note of whatever new name they chose.
P1:17:00 <iPope> Uhuh, then the server sends that info to the client, which in turn changes there name inside the java applet?
P1:18:29 <JTE> Actually, normal chat text gets sent exactly as what you see: When you see "JTE: Hi mom!" that means the server LITERALLY sent "JTE: Hi mom!" to you. So if I use /nick, I can just change that to "iPoop: Hi mom!" and be done.
P1:20:03 <JTE> The only thing that needs to be sent to change the name over your character's head ... is the only packet that gets sent to clients containing a person's nick in the first place.
P1:20:03 <iPope> ah okay
P1:20:03 <iPope> any chance you can get server running? so i can see this in action
P1:20:34 <JTE> I can, I was just looking into having someone else host it for me ...

P5:32:44 <stickzanimator> aaaah

P5:44:23 <Quatroking> Hey there
P5:44:35 <Thi3f> Hey
P5:45:25 <Animator> What the hell?
P5:45:38 <Animator> I accidentaly pressed a button and I couldn't stop walking.
P5:45:46 <Animator> Is there autopilot on Minecraft?
P5:45:46 <Quatroking> lol?
P5:45:55 <Quatroking> Could be keyboard lag
P5:45:59 <Quatroking> I have it once in a while
P5:46:09 <Animator> Actually, here's a thought.
P5:46:17 <Quatroking> just press the key of the direction you're walking to
P5:46:31 <Animator> To anyone that's playing Minecraft right now, start walking and then press the Alt button.
P5:46:36 <Animator> And see what happens.
P5:46:39 <Quatroking> Oh you mean that
P5:46:49 <Quatroking> that happens with all java apps
P5:46:54 <Quatroking> that are embedded
P5:47:00 <Quatroking> even flash.
P5:47:10 <Animator> Cool.
P5:47:21 <Animator> I could use that in spleef.
P5:47:44 <Quatroking> once you alt, the browser cuts off the media's controls so that things like the adress bar don't interfere
P5:47:57 <Quatroking> however, it doesn't throw the key released code
P5:48:05 <Quatroking> causing the app to think you're still holding the key
P5:48:07 <Quatroking> get it?
P5:48:33 <Animator> Yes.
P5:50:09 <JTE> Flash isn't a java app.
P5:50:16 <Siiseli> orlu
P5:50:18 <Siiseli> orly*
P5:50:20 <Siiseli> I never.
P5:50:23 <JTE> Yes, o rl u.

P5:54:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> hasn't been released yet though
P5:55:32 <Thi3f> 7 was released in 2006
P5:55:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Really?  The final version?
P5:56:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> By released, I mean released for distribution via traditional MS channels... betas and alphas don't count as releases
P5:56:14 <Thi3f> Yeah, something like that or early 2007
P5:56:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> neither do RCs, which are release candidates, and not releases
P5:56:51 <Thi3f> 7 is already replaced by 8, since March

P5:58:22 <Thi3f> Bah, October
P5:58:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> RC is available now though.. good enough in my book
P5:58:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> though I've never used it as a standalone OS
P5:58:54 <Thi3f> Mm, I've tried it, but I'm looking for a replacement for XP, as my standalone OS
P5:58:54 <rosetta> I am on Windows7 and its pretty cool but its going to hurt when I have to pay for it :/
P5:59:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Pay?  Bah!  Even when I used OS X I didn't pay
P5:59:36 <Thi3f> But I feel like I can wait for the final version so I don't have to go through the reinstalling process again

P6:05:38 <citricsquid> They're good for different things; Linux if you like tinkering, windows if you want out of the box. There is no "better" operating system in general, unless you give specific points that it's "better" at. Like gaming, windows is clearly better, but Linux is "better" at other things. Silly argument.
P6:05:39 <Thi3f> The whole "my OS is better than yours" is stupid
P6:05:56 <Quatroking> window's isn't better for gaming.

P6:08:53 <citricsquid> If you can find official working drivers for linksys WUG54GS USB adapter for ubuntu, you win.
P6:09:03 <Quatroking> usb adapters are stupid
P6:09:08 <Quatroking> get a pci
P6:09:17 <Quatroking> its worth it.
P6:09:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I have never, ever gotten a Linux installation working at the same capacity Windows could.
P6:09:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-setup-linksys-wusb54g-v4-wireless-in-ubuntu-gusty.html
P6:09:37 <Quatroking> LOL
P6:09:39 <citricsquid> is that official?
P6:09:40 <Thi3f> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook2-1/Hardy
P6:09:49 <citricsquid> See
P6:09:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linksys has no official drivers for Linux to my knowledge
P6:09:53 <citricsquid> that's messing about
P6:09:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Thi3f, get Intrepid or Jaunty
P6:10:00 <citricsquid> I don't want that, I want out of the box.
P6:10:11 <Thi3f> AlLnAtuRalX, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook2-1/Intrepid
P6:10:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, bet Windows XP won't support that out of the box
P6:10:21 <citricsquid> yes it does
P6:10:24 <Thi3f> Even Intrepid has the touchpad part :)
P6:10:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Thi3f, I have the same hardware
P6:10:33 <citricsquid> I've had it working out of the box on both xp and vista without anything but running install CD.
P6:10:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Besides the touchpad
P6:10:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Touchpad can be a bitch...
P6:10:42 <Thi3f> I'm not pulling stuff out of my ass, I've gone through the procedures
P6:10:53 <Thi3f> It's closing in on being out of the box compatible
P6:10:56 <Thi3f> But not yet it isn't
P6:10:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> The first part didn't apply to me (the whole bootloader shit)
P6:11:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> because I wiped OS X entirelty
P6:11:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I just stuck the CD and followed the install
P6:11:15 <Quatroking> Anyone knows if there's a way to wirelessly connect my TV card to the cable connection downstairs?
P6:11:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Haven't had the touchpad issues, so I can't profess to those
P6:11:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> only thing that doesn't work is iSight mic, camera works fine
P6:11:39 <Thi3f> For my macbook the sound didn't work out of the box either, even though I've heard that it normally does
P6:11:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I got HL2 working on Linux once after five or so hours of coaxing. Everything was green, and it ran at about 5fps.
P6:11:49 <Thi3f> Webcam worked fine for me as well
P6:12:01 <Quatroking> My pc is in the loft so I'm not really wanting to wire a cable through the entire house
P6:12:12 <Thi3f> I got everything working eventually of course, but it wasn't out of the box, and far from easy for the average user
P6:12:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=2890
P6:12:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> platinum (flawless out of the box)
P6:12:27 <Quatroking> Nobody?
P6:12:32 <Quatroking> I really want to watch TV here
P6:12:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> What works
P6:12:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Everything in singleplayer, downloading from steam.
P6:12:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Not for me, obviously.
P6:12:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> What does not
P6:12:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Everything works.
P6:12:40 <vdgmprgrmr> I used Wine.
P6:12:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> All graphic settings at their maximum, resolution: 2048x1152, fullscreen, average FPS: 80.
P6:13:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I tried every goddamn thing I could find for HL2 and Wine on the internet.
P6:13:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Couldn't get it working as well as I could on Windows.
P6:13:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, you're doing something wrong, this was 5 yrs ago, or you're making shit up
P6:13:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> every single person reports platinum :P
P6:13:22 <vdgmprgrmr> This was about two years ago.
P6:13:39 <Thi3f> However, I can't say that Windows is working out of the box either, considering every time I reinstall it I need to track down drivers here and there, but there the "hard" part is hunting them down, not fixing it
P6:13:56 <Quatroking> I can throw my monitor on the max resolution in ubuntu only
P6:14:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Never tried HL2 in WINE, but Portal works fine
P6:14:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Both source
P6:14:06 <Quatroking> Windows limits to 1920x1080
P6:14:12 <Thi3f> And OSX is so hardware limited (from what I've seen with hackintosh'es) so it's not even in the ballpark, but it isn't supposed to be, so
P6:14:28 <Quatroking> OSX is for rich people
P6:14:29 <vdgmprgrmr> With WinXP, I can install, install SP2, install drivers from a CD, and from then on I can do anything I might want to do.
P6:14:42 <Thi3f> vdgmprgrmr, install what drivers?
13P6:14:43 * AlLnAtuRalX detests OS X
P6:14:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Sound drivers.
13P6:14:50 * AlLnAtuRalX also has an iMac
P6:14:53 <Quatroking> So any way I can get wireless coax?
P6:15:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Various other motherboard things.
P6:15:13 <vdgmprgrmr> I install video drivers from nvidia.com
P6:15:20 <Thi3f> So it's not out of the box
P6:15:32 <vdgmprgrmr> It's about as out of the box as you can fucking get.
P6:15:52 <Thi3f> Without limiting the hardware, yeah :P
P6:15:56 <Quatroking> please guys, I really want to be able to get TV here in the loft
P6:15:57 <Thi3f> But
13P6:15:59 * AlLnAtuRalX installed them from synaptic (more OTB)
P6:16:04 <vdgmprgrmr> How else should I get video drivers?
P6:16:04 <Quatroking> wired coax is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE
P6:16:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> on Ubuntu that is
P6:16:05 <Thi3f> Linux is even more out of the box considering drivers
P6:16:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fedora that was using yum
P6:16:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Magically conjure them to my harddrive?
P6:16:16 <Thi3f> vdgmprgrmr, a decent package manager
P6:16:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> package management
10P6:16:31 * c418 is now known as C418
P6:16:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> apt, yum, Pacman
P6:16:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Or I can spend the amazing five minutes it takes to download them.
12P6:16:39 * Sat (Mibbit@75-161-189-76.mpls.qwest.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
P6:16:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> or you can press one button and spend less time
P6:16:47 <Thi3f> Yeah, but you shouldn't have to hunt down drivers
P6:16:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not hunting anything down.
P6:16:55 <Thi3f> In the case of video cards it's easy
P6:17:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> what would you rather do, firefox.com click download, click windows, save file as, runt he installer, next, next, next, agree, finish
P6:17:01 <Thi3f> But for other drivers it's not always
P6:17:03 <vdgmprgrmr> I know exactly where to go.
P6:17:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> or sudo apt-get install firefox
P6:17:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> and done
P6:17:09 <Thi3f> Especially not for laptops
P6:17:10 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: What if the drivers don't exist, then what? You spend 10 hours fucking with user made stuff that barely ever works.
P6:17:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I guess you have a rare case then.... never heard of such an issue
P6:17:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linksys is usually fine with Linux
P6:17:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Unlike broadcom (>:()
P6:18:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Allnatural, yeah, that'd be all cool and nice if I could actually get other shit working.
P6:18:10 <Thi3f> AlLnAtuRalX, aren't there tv cards that lack linux support?
P6:18:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Either you guys haven't tried linux in the past year, or you all have fringe hardware
P6:18:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> 20 machines, from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, all worked out of the box...
P6:18:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't have fringe hardware at all.
P6:18:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> What doesn't work OTB then vdgmprgrmr ?
P6:19:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll look into it
P6:19:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Tell me fast so I don't think you're searching the google
P6:19:23 <Thi3f> I haven't had a problem in the past year because I haven't installed linux on anything other than average hardware in the past year :P
P6:19:31 <vdgmprgrmr> I haven't tried in the last year.
P6:19:36 <vdgmprgrmr> But can you really blame me?

P6:20:02 <vdgmprgrmr> After trying it five times and not a single goddamn thing going right, I would rather just stick with WIndows.
P6:20:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have no problem with that
P6:20:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> As long as you plug into ethernet, everything SHOULD work as planned if you use a mainline distro (Ubuntu/Fedora I recommend)
P6:20:40 <Quatroking> hey guys, you know that whole ehternet through electric lines?
P6:20:46 <Quatroking> *ethernet
P6:20:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Umm... kind of
P6:20:53 <Quatroking> can that be done with coax too?
P6:20:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> no idea
P6:21:00 <citricsquid> hey guys, rain breaks my internet. 
P6:21:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's like $200 though
P6:21:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> a wifi router is cheaper

P6:22:18 <Quatroking> I need coax for TV
P6:22:19 <Quatroking> :/
P6:22:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> :'(
P6:22:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> well, if it works, you're fine
P6:22:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> on the other hand, I made the MISTAKE of buying the cheapest router I saw (Belkin)
P6:22:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I get 1/2 the internet speed in here than near the router
P6:23:05 <Quatroking> rofl
P6:23:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Pay money for the interwebz!
P6:23:20 <Quatroking> my modem is firewall/mode/router/wifi all in one
P6:23:27 <Quatroking> 70 bucks
P6:23:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking, I have one of those, but that's near where I keep my servers, so I need a separate
P6:23:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> wireless access point
P6:23:55 <Quatroking> use more than one WiFi card?
P6:23:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> It came free with the fiber optics...
P6:24:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Won't help... A new router would though... The signal is just too poor
P6:24:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus I have 3 computers
P6:24:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> 1 router is cheaper than 3 new cards
P6:24:26 <Quatroking> That's what I do, two cards, an antenna for each and really improves the signal I receive

P8:48:09 <Akai> considering all tabs except the one for minecraft hasn't been active for hours?
P8:48:39 <Adura> Web pages contain more than one connection, you have to consider images and other assets.
P8:48:56 <Akai> no pages are loading though
P8:49:02 <Akai> nothing's loading at all
P8:49:34 <Akai> and firefox did it a second time with just xkcd and minecraft open

P11:13:11 <Animator> I see no one's in a hurry to delete the porn.
P11:14:26 <Eagle> They're all enjoying it.
P11:15:16 <Adura> They didn't even remove the watermark, hah.
P11:15:43 <Eagle> Thank god it's not tranny porn.
P11:22:47 <JTE> Heh.

P11:23:28 <Eagle> ?
P11:23:35 <Adura> The porn threads.

P11:24:46 <Eagle> JTE, your avatar reminds me of... Kid Radd.
P11:24:55 <Eagle> Or, your skin.
P11:24:57 <Eagle> I meant.
P11:25:51 <JTE> It is Kid Radd.
P11:26:07 <JTE> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=976
P11:26:12 <Eagle> His brother, you mean?
P11:26:34 <Eagle> His brother is red. :P
P11:27:32 <Animator> And the threads are in more than one forum.
P11:27:33 <JTE> http://home.att.net/~miller.daniel.r/raddstand.gif -- This is Radd
P11:27:34 <JTE> http://home.att.net/~miller.daniel.r/gnarlstand2.gif -- This is his brother.
P11:27:50 <Eagle> I know, JTE. :P
P11:27:52 <JTE> They aren't wearing the same suit or anything.
P11:28:02 <Eagle> :P
P11:28:04 <JTE> My character is a Kid Redd. Not a Gnarl.
P11:28:09 <JTE> I'll bother to make Gnarl later.
P11:28:12 <Eagle> Kid Redd
P11:28:15 <JTE> Because Gnarl is awesome and deserves to be made.
P11:28:15 <Eagle> As in
P11:28:17 <Eagle> Red?
P11:28:23 <JTE> I like red. ^^
P11:28:26 <Eagle> XD
P11:28:35 <Eagle> I say orange is better.
P11:28:45 <JTE> At least I didn't make him green and call him "Matrix Radd"
P11:28:52 <Eagle> (I.E. The ninja guy. I haven't read Kid Radd in a while)
P11:28:59 <JTE> Maybe give him some shades.

P11:29:12 <JTE> Kobayashi. :3
P11:29:19 <Eagle> :D
P11:29:26 <JTE> The Japanese guy who wins the Koney Island hotdog eating contest every year.
P11:29:33 <JTE> Or whatever.
P11:29:44 <JTE> Very unskilled with the third dimension.
P11:29:54 <Eagle> Yeah.
P11:29:59 <JTE> ... You know, I'm the same JTE who programmed Kid Radd.
P11:30:04 <JTE> But by that point there was nobody left~
P11:30:18 <JTE> Just me and DakeDesu.
P11:30:18 <Eagle> You /programmed/ Kid Radd?
P11:30:20 <Eagle> Like
P11:30:25 <Eagle> As a game?
P11:30:36 <JTE> As THE game, yes.
P11:30:45 <Eagle> :O
P11:31:00 <Eagle> Is it finished?
P11:31:49 <JTE> ^^; Was one of my first programming projects, not too good. ... I scrapped the engine and started rewriting Cave Story instead, planning on putting Kid Radd features in later, but that didn't get very far either (There may be one video floating around YouTube showing off its online abilities)
P11:32:14 <Eagle> D:
P11:32:18 <JTE> Basically, anything I program and develop by myself never gets finished.
P11:32:31 <Eagle> I have that problem too.
P11:32:32 <Eagle> Well
P11:32:35 <Eagle> I don't program
P11:32:38 <Eagle> But you get what I mean.
P11:36:11 <PuyoDead> wow. huge level generation in singleplayer is no joke
P11:36:11 <Animator> The forums are slowly becoming porn spam.
P11:36:26 <vdgmprgrmr> It is indeed huge.
P11:36:39 <Adura> It's that guy who made the minecraft porn that caused this.
P11:39:06 <Animator> Oh hey, there's a lesbian porn thread.
P11:39:29 <Animator> I'd enjoy it more if it WASN'T IN THE FORUM.
