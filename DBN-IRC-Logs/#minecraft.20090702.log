A12:25:27 <Arsonide> Do any of you know where the modified server for infiniminer is that automatically boots hackers? I'm trying to set up a server with atleast some asylum from them.

A1:55:30 <Hauskaz> Does grass grow/die after enlarging the map?
A1:55:36 <Hauskaz> It doesn't anymore for me.
A2:02:32 <JTE> Apparently not ...
A2:02:45 <JTE> That is VERY strange.
A2:03:48 <Hauskaz> The sheer size of the map might have simply slowed the growth update process by an extreme amount or something.

A2:07:40 <JTE> No.
A2:08:40 <JTE> It is very possible there is some kind of 'timer' in the grass that makes it 'active', and mapjack decimates that variable, making all grass never 'think' in order to spread or die.
A2:09:18 <Hauskaz> Hm, probably.
A2:09:32 <Hauskaz> I also noticed that it removed all the gold blocks from the map.

A4:13:47 <Dav1d> does it only prevent the server from displaying in the list
A4:13:47 <citricsquid> The server doesn#'t show up on the server.jsp page
A4:13:56 <Quatroking> ._.
A4:13:58 <citricsquid> can only be connected through url in externalurl.txt
A4:14:00 <Dav1d> or does it make it so you have to have a minecraft account
A4:14:12 <citricsquid> verfify-names is for accounts, afaik
A4:14:15 <Dav1d> how else would you connect too it then
A4:14:23 <citricsquid> the URL in externalurl.txt
A4:14:24 <citricsquid> you copy it down
A4:14:28 <citricsquid> and go to that in browser
A4:14:48 <Dav1d> no shit

A4:16:18 <Dav1d> *sigh*
A4:16:45 <Dav1d> anyway. that setting only effects the listing of the server right
A4:16:48 <citricsquid> yes
A4:17:02 <citricsquid> If it's private it won't show on the server list, if it's public it will. Only thing that changes is that.
A4:17:07 <Dav1d> good. i thought it might do some other wacky stuff
A4:17:14 <Dav1d> good, thanks

A4:18:27 <Dav1d> 0_0
A4:19:43 <Dav1d> last question for you fine chaps
A4:20:01 <Dav1d> in ssh, how do i start the server so that i can close the terminal

A6:43:51 <cryzed> Quatroking: you've got a clue?
A6:43:58 <Quatroking> Eh
A6:44:09 <Quatroking> I don't know if you can change an exisitng map
A6:44:22 <Quatroking> but you can create new ones with custom sizes in OME
A6:44:42 <cryzed> and Mapjack
A6:44:43 <cryzed> right?

A6:47:24 <Quatroking> read the changelog
A6:47:44 <cryzed> Quatroking: you said that it was possible with OME aswell?
A6:47:52 <Quatroking> Yeah
A6:47:56 <cryzed> Can I use the algorithm there which is used for the normal maps aswell?
A6:48:03 <cryzed> e.g water, hills
A6:48:05 <cryzed> not just flatland
A6:48:40 <Quatroking> You can even import heightmaps and CT scans
A6:48:59 <Quatroking> you can even draw your map in MS paint and then import it over
A6:49:06 <cryzed> so is that a yes?
A6:49:10 <Quatroking> Yeah
A6:49:22 <Quatroking> Basically you could even import childporn and host that as a map
A6:49:31 <Quatroking> hilarity.
A6:49:46 <cryzed> Quatroking: okay :D
A6:51:54 <cryzed> Okay
A6:51:58 <cryzed> but the algorithms
A6:52:04 <cryzed> for the random creation

A7:07:32 <JTE> Heh.
A7:09:22 <JTE> It's silly, the singleplayer client knows how to generate maps of many different sizes, but the multiplayer server has only one size (that we know of) ... and using the same algorithms would be difficult, considering we don't even KNOW more about them than each step's one-word name and the general idea of what the end result is supposed to look like...
A7:09:41 <cryzed> JTE: shit :(
A7:10:21 <JTE> Maybe if you hack apart the server or client's one-letter classes to figure out which one(s) generate the map, you might be able to do something ...
A7:10:40 <JTE> but I'm not gonna go there. @.@;

A8:05:28 <Bobo> narbacular drop :P
A8:05:29 <UnknownX> no
A8:05:30 <Bobo> loved that game
A8:05:47 <Bobo> i'm pretty sure its made by the same people who created portal
A8:05:53 <Bobo> but before valve took it on
A8:06:18 <UnknownX> everything valve touches turns to gold
A8:06:31 <Bobo> mmh
A8:06:40 <UnknownX> everything microsoft touches turns to shit
A8:07:10 <UnknownX> unless project natal comes through
A8:07:25 <doohan> That's a bit of huge generalisation isn't it?
A8:07:30 <doohan> I mean think about...er...
A8:07:32 <doohan> and um...
A8:07:40 <doohan> And what about that other one...
A8:07:42 <doohan> You know...
A8:08:18 <UnknownX> halo is about the only game that they made thats good
A8:08:55 <doohan> Bungie made halo.
A8:09:02 <doohan> ms just published and hyped.
A8:09:08 <UnknownX> im pretty sure microsoft helped
A8:09:15 <doohan> Yeah with cash.
A8:09:18 <doohan> And a dev kit.
A8:09:24 <UnknownX> its still helping
A8:09:39 <doohan> That's not the same as actually making it though.
A8:09:44 <Bobo> i like windows
A8:09:49 <doohan> Rare's games on the other hand
A8:09:55 <Bobo> windows is a pretty cool game
A8:10:04 <doohan> Well rare is owned by ms.
A8:10:05 <UnknownX> windows isnt a game
A8:10:14 <Bobo> i'd say Blizzard is my favorite game company
A8:10:15 <doohan> I play java the game all day at work
A8:10:28 <doohan> With some bits of email the game too.
A8:10:39 <doohan> Email as an mmo.
A8:10:41 <Bobo> Blizzard has the best art styling and quality
A8:10:42 <doohan> is an*
A8:10:51 <UnknownX> portal and l4d seem more successful than half life
A8:10:58 <doohan> That's cause they are.
A8:11:03 <doohan> Sold at different times as well.
A8:11:04 <Bobo> i dont think portal is more successfull than halflife 2
A8:11:09 <UnknownX> no
A8:11:15 <UnknownX> you didnt just say that
A8:11:19 <Bobo> portal had huge hype when it came out
A8:11:25 <Bobo> but so did halflife 2
A8:11:26 <doohan> Gaming as a whole is a lot more popular now than when hl came out.
A8:11:32 <UnknownX> if you did i will have to kill you
A8:11:47 <Bobo> you'd kill me for stating an opinion?
A8:11:51 <UnknownX> no
A8:11:54 <Bobo> just like your statement was an opinion

A8:12:26 <UnknownX> we are talking about facts
A8:12:30 <UnknownX> FACTS
A8:12:31 <Bobo> no, no we're not
A8:12:34 <Bobo> quiet
A8:13:04 <UnknownX> if you watched E3 halflife 2 got last against l4d and portal
A8:13:27 <doohan> Does notch have swine flu?
A8:13:32 <UnknownX> no..
A8:13:44 <Bobo> is that a fact?
A8:13:49 <UnknownX> yes
A8:14:04 <UnknownX> hes probably got strep throat or something
A8:15:04 <UnknownX> half life 2 isnt more successful because its a never ending series
A8:15:14 <UnknownX> gets kind of old
A8:15:22 <UnknownX> portal is fresh
A8:15:26 <UnknownX> and so is l4d
A8:15:43 <doohan> I didn't tihnk portal was fresh
A8:15:43 <UnknownX> l4d 2 and portal 2 are being made

A8:16:42 <UnknownX> portal has a different style from every other game made ever
A8:16:50 <doohan> Not really.
A8:16:55 <UnknownX> because its made by a different author

A8:18:00 <UnknownX> valve has never made a game like that before
A8:18:06 <UnknownX> so its fresh
A8:18:17 <doohan> So what you mean is it's fresh, for valve.
A8:18:18 <UnknownX> SMELL THE FRESHNESS
A8:18:21 <UnknownX> yes
A8:18:34 <doohan> You need to include that qualifier next time you say that.
A8:19:34 <ZomBuster> <doohan> But I didn't think "I've never seen this before wow!"
A8:19:35 <ZomBuster> wtf
A8:19:47 <doohan> have you never played prey?
A8:20:06 <ZomBuster> ok its technically the same
A8:20:13 <ZomBuster> but in prey its just a gimmicky thing
A8:20:14 <UnknownX> ive never played a game that has an abandoned factory, portal gun, evil psycho computer ai, and a companion cube in the same game
A8:20:17 <doohan> The main game mechanic is right out of there.
A8:20:22 <ZomBuster> its not even used in its full potentional
A8:20:37 <UnknownX> portal is ALL about one gun
A8:20:40 <UnknownX> and portals

A8:21:54 <UnknownX> ive never seen a companion cube in another game

A8:22:07 <ZomBuster> now every game has portals and companion cubes
A8:23:25 <ZomBuster> no seriously
A8:23:59 <UnknownX> and what game has THAT EVIL PSYCHO COMPUTER AI SINGING A REALLY SENSELESS ADDICTIVE POINTLESS GREAT USE OF MUSIC HAPPY MAD PSYCHO SONG
A8:24:15 <UnknownX> none
A8:24:17 <ez> The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
A8:24:20 <UnknownX> except for portal
A8:24:39 <citricsquidisworking> Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not. Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
A8:24:53 <ZomBuster> let the quoting begin
A8:24:57 <ez> haha
A8:25:05 <ez> I'm not even angry :)
A8:25:13 <doohan> So, the unique thing is the companion cube?
13A8:25:23 * ez loves the companion cube
A8:25:25 <doohan> Is that what we've established here?
A8:25:29 <UnknownX> yep
A8:25:33 <doohan> Excellent.
A8:25:34 <UnknownX> and the portal gun
A8:25:41 <ZomBuster> and glados
A8:25:43 <ZomBuster> and cake
A8:25:47 <ez> oh cake
A8:25:50 <doohan> Killer ai isn't new foo'! :P
A8:26:04 <UnknownX> glados wasnt a killer ai

A8:27:22 <ZomBuster> oh dont start with the bondage thing
A8:27:28 <UnknownX> ok fine
13A8:27:28 * ez does not hug the turrets
A8:27:42 <ez> who are you?
A8:28:32 <UnknownX> and it has those cute little turrets that go crazy when you mess with them :3
A8:29:50 <UnknownX> doohan has failed at making a point
A8:30:12 <UnknownX> portal is unique
A8:30:33 <ez> are you still there?
A8:31:00 <ZomBuster> you know I got one of the Portal devs in my steam friends?
A8:31:10 <UnknownX> nowai
A8:31:50 <doohan> What are you playing now, n degrees from galdos?
A8:31:54 <doohan> glados*
A8:31:58 <ez> can I touch u?
A8:36:02 <ez> fps puzzle games with no leathal weapon must be kinda rare?
A8:36:34 <doohan> In that regard it is.
A8:36:57 <doohan> But it's more of a collection of elements from other places, put together in a rather entertaining fashion.
A8:36:59 <ez> and ur shot at as well hehe, by the nasty cute turrets =)
A8:37:23 <ez> isnt everything a combination of already known substanses?
A8:37:39 <doohan> I guess so.
A8:38:03 <doohan> But it's more the way everyone was like: "Portals!!! Oh wow!!! This has never been done!!!"
A8:38:08 <doohan> But meh
A8:38:15 <doohan> Maybe I'm just a cynic.
A8:38:19 <ez> =)
A8:38:28 <doohan> Anyway like I said, it was good fun.
A8:38:32 <doohan> And that's what matters.
A8:39:01 <ez> great fun indeed

A8:55:59 <UnknownX> oh hey look im the 694th purchase!
A8:56:02 <ninti> I am still waiting for some kind of griefer protection
A8:56:12 <UnknownX> thats what beta is for
A8:56:27 <UnknownX> most griefers will be gone
A8:56:50 <ninti> Will it be pay only at that time...I thought he wsn't doing that until full release?
A8:57:07 <UnknownX> when it hits beta its not free anymore
A8:57:23 <ninti> Ahh...then that needs to happen tomorrow
A8:57:30 <ninti> because it is getting worse
A8:57:32 <UnknownX> which the eta for beta is.... in a few weeks
A8:57:38 <UnknownX> :/
A8:58:05 <citricsquidisworking> I think sandbox will be free until full release
A8:58:06 <UnknownX> i give notch 5 days before he goes ballistic over griefers
A8:58:09 <citricsquidisworking> but survival will be paid onlu
A8:58:39 <UnknownX> if he allows online sandbox for free i want $9 back
A8:58:51 <citricsquidisworking> "until full release"
A8:58:54 <doohan> I can't play till I have a real connection again
A8:59:23 <UnknownX> "until full release" doesnt work for me
A8:59:28 <UnknownX> i dont want griefers
A8:59:46 <doohan> then set up your own server
A8:59:47 <citricsquidisworking> unknown: Paid only won't stop griefers.
A8:59:50 <doohan> ban everyone
A9:00:02 <UnknownX> most griefers
A9:00:05 <citricsquidisworking> Just use private servers if you care so much
A9:00:56 <UnknownX> im talking about on other servers when you want to build with random people and a griefer fills your tunnel with water it isnt very fun
A9:00:57 <ninti> Easier said then done...just fix the griefing problem with one of 10 solutions on the forums

A9:01:34 <UnknownX> them*
A9:01:39 <ninti> Well...sandbox is quickly becoming useless anyway
A9:01:44 <citricsquidisworking> "Oh sorry you must have been in the server for 5 mins and have danced 8 times whilst shouting "cats" to build here"
A9:01:58 <doohan> ninti, you mean with the external editors and the like?
A9:02:14 <UnknownX> banning will be more efficient in beta
A9:02:15 <ninti> Thatshould be up to the server admin...Right now the server admins have one choice...private or complete destruction on a daily basis
A9:02:28 <citricsquidisworking> I have public servers that do fine
A9:02:34 <citricsquidisworking> if you have good ops you're not going to have any problems
A9:02:43 <ninti> Which one?
A9:02:49 <UnknownX> because you have like 3 ops on each of them 24/7
A9:03:03 <ninti> Reddit has 90 ops...it is destroyed this morning
A9:03:12 <ninti> completely annihilated
A9:03:34 <ninti> This is out of fricking control
A9:03:37 <UnknownX> one of these days the griefers will get to you citric
A9:03:54 <ninti> They get be everywhere and on all the time...they can't
A9:03:59 <citricsquidisworking> Unknown: If I want to build seriously I play privately, if I want to play for fun I go public
A9:04:04 <Daidoji> that's why I got a rotating dat file
A9:04:06 <citricsquidisworking> nothing I have cared about has ever been griefed.
A9:04:24 <ninti> Then you are playing a different game than I am
A9:04:43 <UnknownX> its no longer fun when your build is destroyed when you turn around
A9:04:55 <citricsquidisworking> Don't play in public then. 
A9:05:09 <UnknownX> then whats the point in having friends
A9:05:19 <ninti> I don't have a whole hell of a lot of choice citric
A9:05:22 <citricsquidisworking> You play with them privatrely?
A9:05:24 <citricsquidisworking> privately*
A9:05:29 <Daidoji> if you have friends you don't have to play in public?
A9:05:46 <citricsquidisworking> The point is: The only way to ever stop griefers WILL make the game less fun for legitimate players.
A9:06:00 <Daidoji> naw
A9:06:12 <Daidoji> you can easily have server things to prevent stuff
A9:06:16 <ninti> The point is, the server admin should have the choice...it is quickly becoming non-fun because of the griefers right now
A9:06:20 <UnknownX> what if you didnt have a way of reaching the friend without telling the whole server the address
A9:06:46 <Daidoji> how would that ever be a situation
A9:06:56 <citricsquidisworking> Daido: Show me a single suggestion on how to remove griefing that won't effect how legitimate players play.
A9:07:04 <ninti> I would rather have optional admin-based tools for stopping griefers with the off chance of it not being fun...to right now where it is not fun
A9:07:17 <UnknownX> i have tons of friends but never see some of them at all
A9:07:47 <ninti> a /noalter flag would be my first choice for an alternative
A9:08:01 <citricsquidisworking> ninti: That would suck.
A9:08:10 <citricsquidisworking> "Oh you can't build here this guy said he doesn't want you to"
A9:08:17 <UnknownX> it would be used for personal things
A9:08:25 <UnknownX> like...
A9:08:25 <citricsquidisworking> the game is a sandbox, it's freedom that makes it good.
A9:08:27 <doohan> There was a guy trying to do that on one of my servers
A9:08:32 <doohan> We told him top fuck off.
A9:08:39 <doohan> "this is my area"
A9:08:43 <doohan> -p
A9:08:44 <Daidoji> if you run a server and you're that paranoid about it you could always do the fun glass prison
A9:08:58 <doohan> I've done that to people :)
A9:09:00 <doohan> Good laugh.
A9:09:12 <citricsquidisworking> If you care about it that much, play privately. It's the only and simplest solution.
A9:09:13 <doohan> 2x2 prison
A9:09:25 <UnknownX> theres only one problem
A9:09:33 <doohan> Personally I've found the maps are big enough to accomodate lots of people

A11:03:30 <Dossy> Answerrrr theee quessttiooonnnn
A11:03:40 <citricsquid> I have no idea.
A11:03:50 <citricsquid> because I'm better? =D
A11:03:51 <Dossy> Not good enough.
A11:04:21 <Dossy> It says your on ADSL too and NTL is cable...
A11:04:32 <citricsquid> I'm on virgin media adsl.
A11:04:43 <Dossy> That's probably why then
A11:04:52 <Dossy> NTL didn't support/use/sell it
A11:05:37 <Dossy> Hmm, might get on with making my Gamercard generator UI then
A11:07:09 <UnknownX> when i listen to fast music it makes me faster O.o
A11:07:18 <UnknownX> its creepy
A11:07:30 <Dossy> Better sell that idea to athletes, tbh.
A11:07:30 <UnknownX> and when i listen to slow music it makes me slower
A11:08:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyone know if esper's NS allows for custom hostnames?
A11:08:47 <UnknownX> i wonder what the next version of minecraft will include
A11:08:56 <UnknownX> maybe new bricks
A11:08:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hopefully a way to turn the music off (glares at Notch)
A11:09:07 <UnknownX> there already is one
A11:09:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> UnknownX, it also turns sound effects off

A11:38:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm using ALSA on Fedora 11
A11:38:33 <08Notch> what's ALSA? Is it supposed to support multiple sound sources?
A11:38:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes it is
A11:38:44 <08Notch> I don't actually stop the sound thread when muting
A11:38:56 <08Notch> i can make it do so, at least
A11:39:06 <Adura> <Notch> what's ALSA? <-- Linux users are shuddering. :P
A11:39:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Should probably help...
A11:39:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I hate Pulseaudio
A11:39:27 <fanta> me too
A11:39:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll try it on Pulseaudio just in case (it's what most Linux users use these days)
A11:40:08 <08Notch> Adura: lol, sorry. Educate me =D
A11:40:23 <Adura> I'm no Linux expert, mind you.
A11:40:45 <Adura> It's a sound daemon option on Linux.
A11:40:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> ALSA = Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
A11:41:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, it was the most popular one before Pulseaudio came in (a soundserver which allows networked sound, etc) and now most distributions use Pulse as defauly
A11:41:41 <08Notch> very strange it not working right with other sound sources..
A11:41:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Pulse is full of bugs though, so I switched back to ALSA (I'll reinstall pulse later)
A11:42:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> any other ALSA users here to confirm my bug?

A11:47:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, not true
A11:48:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've installed linux on 10s of boxes
A11:48:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> only one had an issue
A11:48:06 <Rroff> well in one case it was the Eee
A11:48:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> that was my desktop; it had a broadcom card
A11:48:11 <Rroff> which was originally designed for linux
A11:48:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff, true, true
A11:48:16 <citricsquid> I can't use linux because of my wireless adapter not having proper drivers.
A11:48:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, what wireless card?
A11:48:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have a broadcom
A11:48:28 <citricsquid> USB adapter :D
A11:48:31 <Rroff> and I couldn't get games like Quake 3 to play audio without some weird script that poked dma channels and stuff

A11:48:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> that + my video card (ATI)
A11:48:52 <citricsquid> Some users hacked together some drivers but they were subpar so I gave up and stuck with windows.

A11:56:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Decent in low FoV
A11:56:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> medium is okay too, not too fast though
A11:56:22 <Rroff> I've got the original 701

A11:58:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> (my favorite WM)
A11:58:24 <Rroff> anyhow
A11:58:35 <Rroff> the GPU on the 701 uses system memory which is its big performance draw back
A11:58:36 <Dossy> Zombuster: Awesome, I'll go take a look :p
A11:58:43 <Rroff> overclocking the CPU results in the memory bus increasing
A11:58:49 <Rroff> which gives better GPU performance
A11:59:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not an option for me anyway due to the battery life issues
A11:59:18 <Rroff> I also used SPD tool to tighten the RAM timings as much as possible
A11:59:22 <Rroff> got another 10% or so performance
A11:59:40 <Rroff> as it only runs the RAM at a fraction of the speed its capable of

P12:24:10 <Rroff> I think you can use cron + cygwin dlls
P12:24:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not worth the hassle IMO
P12:24:24 <PuyoDead> I'm using some guy's program from the forums, but it's a hell of a hog
P12:24:27 <Rroff> nope
P12:24:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Cron is awesome in that it takes virtually no resources
P12:24:43 <Adura> I'll work on the perl script soon.
P12:24:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I assume Adura saw my suggestion ;)

P12:25:14 <Adura> I did read the post, too.
P12:26:13 <Adura> Though, the perl script is a fraction of the size of a minecraft server's memory usage.

P12:27:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> VB3 is amazing

P12:47:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff, that's because of the res :P
P12:47:09 <08Notch> on what? and why?
P12:47:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> The applet, so I can have centered fullscreen without having to use my own stylesheet lol
P12:47:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> not fullscreen, resized applet I mean
P12:47:36 <Adura> That's not CSS, though! 
P12:47:51 <Dossy> Yeah, align= has been deprecated, has it not?
P12:48:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Does every browser in the world not support align= ?

P12:48:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm*
P12:48:40 <08Notch> the css seems to be mostly sane, but the html still is a bit broken
P12:48:42 <Rroff> and the ads :(
P12:48:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> so that was my choice (headline images are often off-topic)
P12:48:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> the ads show on mine too
P12:48:53 <Dossy> <br>... how could you...
P12:48:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> I uninstalled adblock
P12:48:57 <08Notch> and I'm a bit tempted to start abusing jquery. :D
P12:48:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> because it was eating RAM
P12:49:03 <Adura> jQuery good.
P12:49:06 <08Notch> Dossy: :-O Sorry!!
P12:49:07 <Dossy> jQuery win.
P12:49:15 <Dossy> :D
P12:49:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn Apple, not allowing official adblock in the appstore
P12:49:35 <08Notch> also, the front page shows the minecraft logo twice, which is just bad design
P12:49:36 <fanta> http://jqueryvsmootools.com/
P12:49:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> They make me jailbreak this thing again and again
P12:50:19 <Dossy> fanta, tl;dr please? :|
P12:50:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> CSS has no fluid way to align a div center right?  If it does, I can just use Stylish
P12:50:42 <Adura> text-align: center
P12:50:44 <Adura> Maybe...?
P12:50:50 <Dossy> margin: 0px auto;
P12:50:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> would that work for the applet?
P12:51:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> hmmm good idea Dossy, I'll try that out later
P12:51:03 <Dossy> But that requires a width var
P12:51:04 <fanta> AlLnAtuRalX, margin auto
P12:51:08 <Dossy> So just make it the same as the applet :D
P12:51:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Dossy, the problem is users like to resize the applet
P12:51:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> to fit their screen
P12:51:26 <fanta> ah, dossy was faster :O
P12:51:29 <08Notch> the applet gets the size from the applet tag. There's no real reason for this
P12:51:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch if you modify the size it becomes aligned to the right of the screen
P12:51:47 <08Notch> the game only reads the size once at startup. I'll change that
P12:51:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> because of the auto margins
P12:51:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Noooooo
P12:52:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Don't take away my fullscreen!
P12:52:04 <08Notch> what?
P12:52:06 <08Notch> i won't.
P12:52:11 <08Notch> if anything, I'll make it built in
P12:52:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> yay
P12:52:16 <Dossy> :o
P12:52:19 <Dossy> Awesome :D
P12:52:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then I can use it on epiphany instead of firefox
P12:52:28 <08Notch> I'm just saying I could make the applet support resizing in runtime
P12:52:38 <08Notch> so it could, for example occupy the entire web page size
P12:52:49 <08Notch> and then you could resize your browser, and the applet would resize along with it
P12:52:51 <Dossy> Using jQuery go.
P12:52:53 <Dossy> :p
P12:53:04 <08Notch> unfortunately, the width/height stuff only gets read once, so I don't know how easy it is to fix. =)
P12:53:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, yeah, if you resize while int he applet, the game itself does not resize
P12:53:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sometimes I also need to delete /tmp/minecraft.net
P12:53:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> But that's rare
P12:53:35 <08Notch> $('#applet').css('width', '900px'); ftw
P12:53:49 <Dossy> :D
P12:53:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> you're right!  I could do it all in stylish instead of greasemonkey
P12:54:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll get on that later today
P12:54:27 <Dossy> $("#applet").fadeOut('slow').css('width','900px').fadeIn('slow');
P12:54:27 <08Notch> a while back I tried to make f5 toggle fullscreen mode in the applet, but that failed horribly on my computer, hehe
P12:54:28 <Dossy> :p
P12:54:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, any chance of a fluid GUI?

P12:56:03 <Shuzup> I've heard you messed around with the memory so it doesn't work in singleplayer anymore
P12:56:15 <08Notch> no, i haven't changed anything like that on purpose

P12:56:31 <08Notch> AHH DOUBLE BR!!
P12:56:33 <Shuzup> Do you know how to do it? I just want to use it on singleplayer.
P12:56:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> That would be cool... An embed in my website to say what server I'm on
P12:56:41 <08Notch> i don't know, Shuzup. =)
P12:56:45 <Shuzup> Damn.
P12:56:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Shuzup, that got patched a while back
P12:56:56 <08Notch> ah yeah, player info pages would be really cool. =)

P12:56:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Map editors are the only way now IMO
P12:57:09 <Shuzup> It got patched in the form of, being kicked when you used it

P1:16:15 <Dossy> I disagree...
P1:16:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> I actually want to get badly injured once so I can get treated with some sort of opiate :P
P1:16:43 <Dossy> Come lie under this sofa, burns pass as being badly injured right?
P1:16:54 <08Notch> i don't think the bottle of wine I've got is still potable..
P1:16:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol Dossy
P1:17:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch : I'll Fed Ex one to you
P1:17:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P1:18:02 <msarge> allnatural, i think most perscription pain meds are derived from opiates so you just need to have sugery or something, get your wisdom teeth taken out!
P1:18:12 <Dossy> Fed Ex = hidden arrow
P1:18:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> msarge, yes, but most of them are modified in a way as to not have psychological effects
P1:18:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> same thing as novacaine and cocaine
P1:19:13 <msarge> maybe
P1:19:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Once you take out the psychoactive ingredients for only the ones that inhibit neurotransmitter production, you don't get any of the interesting effects, just the boring side-effects 
P1:19:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> :)
P1:20:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn science... Nobody prescribes cocaine anymore
P1:20:13 <msarge> i certainly got some interesting side effects from many of the persciption pain killers ive gotten from surgeries
P1:20:44 <msarge> aaaaaaaaanyway
P1:20:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Absolutely, but many of them are the unimportant or undesirable ones... Hallucinations, etc are very rare (depends on your tolerance level of course)
P1:20:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P1:21:38 <msarge> so anyone know whats next for MC?
P1:21:54 <Dossy> Notch will, if anyone
P1:21:57 <Dossy> uhduh.
P1:21:59 <Dossy> :P
P1:22:14 <Adura> The ore veins look interesting when you strip stone.
P1:22:27 <Syndlig> AlLnAtuRalX, if you want to have a drug-induced hallucinatory episode why don't you just shoot up some acid or something?
P1:22:30 <msarge> i figured that much, but i also figured people come in and ask all day so.. thought i would ask around first
P1:22:36 <Syndlig> Cut out the middleman of personal injury and just coast.
P1:22:53 <08Notch> msarge: My immediate plans is to add some nice settings to the client (disable sound, configure keys), and to work some on survival mode
P1:23:13 <08Notch> I want to get rid of as many special magic keys as possible and move it all into menus
P1:23:23 <Rroff> acids are bad
P1:23:36 <Adura> Let the console see commands that fail.
P1:23:39 <Rroff> if your really after a high - DMT
P1:23:42 <Adura> Great for adding custom commands.
P1:23:45 <Rroff> otherwise don't bother
P1:23:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Agreed Syndlig,just saying
P1:23:58 <Adura> Private chat would also be nice.
P1:24:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus I don't know any reliable dealers or anything
P1:24:06 <msarge> Notch: that sounds fantastic.
P1:24:23 <08Notch> i want to draw some nicer graphics for the menu buttons and so
P1:24:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, can you also add disable music but not sound?
P1:24:39 <08Notch> oh, and I HAVE to add client-side level saving and make server-side saving premium only
P1:24:44 <08Notch> there's like 2gb of map data on the server..
P1:24:49 <08Notch> yes, AlLnAtuRalX.
P1:24:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> TYVM
P1:25:06 <Dossy> Hmm, need to buy premium asap, tbh...
P1:25:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Is the music file public?  Maybe I could loop it in the background so it won't be choppy
P1:25:23 <Adura> Basically, add things that would allow me to do more with the STDERR text.
P1:25:27 <msarge> I wouldn't mind saving maps client side, it makes a lot of sense
P1:25:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> If it's not, I'll find something else though
P1:25:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> msarge, especially if they were in the same .dat format
P1:25:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then you could make maps in single and put them on multi
P1:26:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Without having to run a private server while you're on single :P
P1:26:18 <08Notch> msarge: The reason it's server-side only is actually because the applet wasn't signed at first
P1:26:33 <08Notch> then people started sharing maps a lot (before mp at least)
P1:26:43 <msarge> AlLnAtuRalX: that would be sweet
P1:27:11 <Dossy> Noclip'd be nice for OPs too
P1:27:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think spectator a la Q3 would be nicer
P1:27:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> It would be the ultimate anti-grief
P1:28:04 <Dossy> Lets just hope Notch is writing all this down :p
P1:28:10 <Prime_2> Hey notch
P1:28:12 <Prime_2> did you get my memo
P1:28:18 <08Notch> i did, hehe
P1:28:25 <08Notch> i will fix at least the sand one. =)
P1:28:32 <Prime_2> sand/gravel
P1:28:36 <Prime_2> but yeah
P1:28:43 <PuyoDead> <mnx> and why is it possible to download "walden" into an ipod or kindle?  <mnx> that kind of irony should be radioactive.
P1:29:26 <Prime_2> as it stands, fixing the gravel glitch would mean providing a good way to get rid of lava in an area without using water
P1:29:36 <Prime_2> (gravel/sand)
P1:29:38 <msarge> Notch: I also wouldnt mind deleting some of the levels Ive made, to free up some server room, but I do not see that option
P1:29:39 <ZomBuster>  gravel glitch?

P1:31:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura wants to implement phony commands in her script?
P1:31:39 <Prime_2> notch, how about a sign block
P1:31:43 <Prime_2> where you could put text.
P1:32:13 <Prime_2> I've made a few rooms situated under lava(lava over glass), even one where the lava is the only entrance
P1:32:20 <msarge> Alright, Notch, I'm outta here, good luck with the game
P1:32:32 <Prime_2> in these cases, I placed a counter-measure to prevent a catastrophic lava flood, should some idiot break the tiles from the inside
P1:32:33 <08Notch> i like the idea of signs. =)
P1:32:47 <08Notch> thank you, msarge =)
P1:32:48 <Prime_2> specifically, I always have a source of water nearby, at the highest open tile
P1:32:49 <ZomBuster> make the text float above the block a la player names
P1:33:07 <Dossy> bump for signs
P1:33:14 <Prime_2> if a lava flood happens, you can bust that open, and flood the place with water to solidify the oncoming lava
P1:33:23 <Prime_2> and then you can effect repairs.
P1:33:34 <Adura> I'm not a her, ror.
P1:33:34 <Keymax> bump, it could show the message after targeting the sign
P1:33:44 <Prime_2> however, a sign block would let people know that
P1:33:46 <Adura> But, phony commands would be good for voteban/votekick.
P1:33:58 <Adura> And report.

P2:19:22 <Lmaoboat> Hey Notch, I had an idea for dedicated servers: You could set the server so that it's only joinable by OPs when no OPs are on, and when joins, it would go to the public server list. That way, you could leave a server running, but not have to worry about it getting griefed 
P2:19:22 <Nalok> lol
P2:19:39 <Nalok> Ohay Notch, get better soon :D

P2:49:56 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Yes, no on the fritos?
P2:51:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Ah, if not, just any corn chips should do. Bowl, put corn chips in, pour chili over the top, apply cheese. "Corn chip chili pie" successfully created.
P2:51:25 <ZomBuster> but but
P2:51:34 <ZomBuster> putting them in a bowl doesnt make it a pie!
P2:51:41 <Dossy> 'greed
P2:51:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well that's too bad.
P2:52:07 <ZomBuster> I can put my cat in a grinder and put it in a bowl but that wouldnt be cat pie WOULD IT
P2:52:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Since "Frito chili pie" is too ingrained into our culture to change the definition.
P2:52:37 <Dossy> 'Frito chili pie' sounds far too much like Nachos to me...
P2:52:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Well but it's chili.

P2:54:52 <Dossy> I suppose nachos is just the chips (Americanisation gogogogo) with a sauce and cheese :|
P2:55:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, basically.
P2:55:22 <Eagle> Pretty much.
P2:55:46 <Dossy> Regardless of what the sauce is.
P2:55:51 <Dossy> Or the cheese ftm
P2:56:05 <vdgmprgrmr> We have "nachos"=tortilla chips+cheese and "meat nachos"=tortilla chips+cheese+meat and "frito chili pie" which has been explained.
P2:56:25 <Dossy> Hmm
P2:57:15 <ez> what's fritos?
P2:57:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Fritos are corn chips.
P2:57:27 <ez> oh I see
P2:57:37 <ZomBuster> its a brand
P2:57:43 <Eagle> We have "chips n' cheese" = tortilla chips + cheese and "nachos" = tortilla chips + cheese + meat
P2:57:51 <ZomBuster> complicated math
P2:57:54 <ez> I had almost the entire garlic in there aswell now haha
P2:58:13 <ez> chips as food, I never really got that

P2:58:46 <ez> if it's like french fries I get it, but real chips?
P2:58:47 <Dossy> ttyl all
P2:58:53 <Eagle> And then we have "flamingos" = cheese - (cow + sqrt(tortilla chips))
P2:58:58 <ez> thats like eating candy for dinner lol

P3:19:14 <Eagle> Have SuperDot and Notch fused together?
P3:19:24 <Super-Dot_iPod> Wuh?
P3:19:29 <Eagle> To become one supreme being?
P3:19:33 <Super-Dot_iPod> Not to my knowledge
P3:19:34 <PuyoDead> ok, time to see what snow world looks like
P3:19:42 <Super-Dot_iPod> That'd be cool though
P3:19:49 <Eagle> But it could have happened while your back was turned.
P3:19:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch is already a supreme being. Fusing with anyone else would just make him LESS supreme.

P3:20:19 <Eagle> That's only if you divide by two after fusing.
P3:20:27 <Eagle> That's not how it works. :O
P3:20:47 <vdgmprgrmr> You average it after fusing.
P3:20:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Everyone knows that.
P3:20:52 <Eagle> No you don't.

P3:22:03 <Super-Dot_iPod> No, he said marshmA--yeah you got it
P3:22:19 <Super-Dot_iPod> (p-p-p-pedantry)
P3:22:27 <vdgmprgrmr> If you combine a creature with Awesome=2 (a rat) and a creature with Awesome=9001 (Notch) you get a creature with Awesome=451.5 because Notch's awesome has been tainted by the rat.
P3:22:38 <Eagle> Nope.
P3:22:43 <vdgmprgrmr> UH-HUH
P3:22:53 <Eagle> You get a creature with Awesome=9003
P3:22:58 <Super-Dot_iPod> Yeah but rats are awesome
P3:23:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope.
P3:23:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, I have an idea for a system.
P3:23:10 <Eagle> Yup.

P3:42:59 <ZomBuster> you could do a countdown lol
P3:43:02 <Eagle> We'd need fightin music.
P3:43:06 <ZomBuster> GET READY TO.. SPLEEF
P3:43:12 <ZomBuster> and make duke nukem voice it
P3:43:16 <Eagle> And a 3...2...1...GO! sound file
P3:43:18 <Nalok> *insert SSB countdown*
P3:43:39 <Super-Dot> I think countdowns work best in text
P3:43:50 <Eagle> It could be both.
P3:43:55 <Super-Dot> Since they're reliable
P3:44:19 <Eagle> We just need notch to give us the ability to assign sound files to text.

P5:09:13 <LF> notch are you going to fix the lack of mirroring of the arm and leg skins?
P5:09:19 <08Notch> yes
P5:09:22 <LF> Yay
P5:11:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, I propose a [PRISON] label in front of all servers w/ a spawn prison :P
P5:11:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm getting sick of them, frankly
P5:12:00 <08Notch> there's no way for me to know that..
P5:12:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Disallow spawning inside a 1x1 block?
P5:12:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> That might work also
P5:12:21 <ZomBuster> nah
P5:12:26 <ZomBuster> its just up to the server
P5:12:35 <iM> griefer!
P5:12:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> ZomBuster, it gets annoying when I have to waste time joining 3 servers before I can find a legit one
P5:12:48 <iM> there is a griefer on the dedicated 24/7 #1 
P5:12:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> also, I have to run a custom script to clear my /tmp folder and restart firefox-bin before joining any servers
P5:13:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> so that makes it a triple waste of time
P5:13:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> if I don't run the script, my FPS is cut in half
P5:13:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> So basically it goes join, wait, prison, script for 30 seconds, load minecraft.net, join, wait, prison
P5:13:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's maddening to be frank
P5:15:04 <ZomBuster> stick to the same servers
P5:15:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> What if I want to tour around?
P5:15:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> I like to see what other servers look like
P5:15:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> not just my own
P5:16:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> I knew this would happen when Notch introduced op blocks....
P5:18:11 <fragmer> i am actually pro-prison
P5:18:47 <fragmer> i think that, with the ridiculous amounts of griefing/vandalism, it it necessary to lock the server down in the absense of any OPs
P5:19:05 <wingboy> i only prison on my fun server since its needed to gather players
P5:19:13 <wingboy> otherwise its retarded to use

P5:21:28 <fragmer> backups alone won't do anything to reduce the rate of griefing
P5:22:05 <Rroff> my script helps
P5:22:10 <LF> it'd be great if we could password public and private games
P5:22:13 <Rroff> coz it makes a named backup on join
P5:22:14 <fragmer> the only way is to have OPs present at all time to hand out IP bans >_>

P7:53:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
P7:53:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm just pointing out some guy who was reported as a griefer on the forums

P7:53:54 <JTE> o.o
13P7:54:03 * JTE is awake! :o

P7:54:40 <Wolfram> Deletion is dangerous, man
P7:54:59 <Wolfram> I try not to delete anything at all until I've been around and talked to the owners/operators for a while.
P7:55:19 <JTE> That's not a spire, that's the washington monument! ... or something.
P7:55:32 <PuyoDead> those damn single block pillars drive me nuts

P7:55:50 <PuyoDead> or when people will make one right next to another

P8:10:25 <JTE> Heh.
P8:10:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> there are many methods for block protection
P8:10:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> how honest do you think you can be at reading my mind
P8:10:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> speakin of which
P8:10:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm wearing a tinfoil
P8:10:57 <Jat> permissions suck because they would mean that once someone leaves the server their stuff can never be removed by anyone else who actually wants to build there
P8:11:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> try it
P8:11:08 <Wolfram> No, no, you have me all wrong.
P8:11:12 <Wolfram> Permissions to build in general.
P8:11:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> op gives 'em out
P8:11:20 <Jat> oh
P8:11:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> like candy
P8:11:28 <Jat> whats the point of that?
P8:11:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> 'cept they're poisonous
P8:11:36 <Inschato> So someone can tour your level without wrecking it?
P8:11:43 <Wolfram> If people who come in have no build authority, they can only spectate.
P8:11:48 <Inschato> Looking at a level out of a prison window isn't much fuuuun
P8:11:50 <Wolfram> If you elevate them, they may build.
P8:11:55 <Infinity> So whenever someone joins they have to beg to the OP to get build permissions
P8:11:57 <Wolfram> It's a prison with a free tour.
P8:12:04 <Wolfram> Why not? They already beg to be let out.
P8:12:12 <Wolfram> Prisons don't please everyone, that's valid.
P8:12:13 <Wolfram> But they see use.
P8:12:17 <Wolfram> And they will continue to see use.
P8:12:25 <Infinity> lol prison
P8:12:27 <Wolfram> Why not let them look around while they wait?
P8:12:36 <Jat> because that still sucks
P8:12:40 <Wolfram> So does griefing.
P8:12:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> obviously it should be optional for server owners
P8:12:47 <Wolfram> Oh, naturally.
P8:12:52 <Infinity> Is Jat a dev
P8:12:54 <Wolfram> Owners should be able to set the default.
P8:13:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> obiviously obvious
P8:13:06 <Wolfram> Further, servers should be labeled.
P8:13:07 <Jat> nothc is the only dev
P8:13:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> oblivious
P8:13:13 <Infinity> wait really D:
P8:13:15 <Wolfram> The name should indicate whether or not permissions are in place.
P8:13:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Reddit Public Server just hit 100 OPs
P8:13:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> really
P8:13:43 <Wolfram> Nice. That's quite a few.
P8:13:45 <Infinity> lol
P8:13:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wouldn't be surprised
P8:13:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's why we have no griefers, or prison Wolfram :P
P8:13:53 <Adura> With the amount of swasticas I see, I have a feeling there's going to be few jews with permissions.
P8:13:54 <Infinity> It should be changed to add more ranks
P8:13:58 <Infinity> like superadmin rank that can give OP out
P8:14:01 <Jat> tlol adura
P8:14:03 <Infinity> instead of causing OPs to multiply
P8:14:04 <Wolfram> Manpower is a good alternative.
P8:14:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol @ t Jat
P8:14:11 <Wolfram> Unfortunately, it's not as readily available.
P8:14:19 <Jat> ah im too used to typing in minecraft
P8:14:19 <Inschato> Adura, I don't think there are hordes of nazis, just stupid people drawing them because they're so easy to do
P8:14:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't know... I'm denying a lot of people here
P8:14:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah for sure man i hate capping all those strategic points only for them to be capped by the enemy again
P8:14:35 <Infinity> Inschato is right you know
P8:14:40 <Wolfram> Well, there are OPs
P8:14:43 <Wolfram> And then there are good OPs
P8:14:46 <Adura> A script that strips swasticas... hm.
P8:14:55 <Infinity> and then there are rapidly reproducing OPs
P8:15:00 <Wolfram> I could have thousands of OPs, but how many would be doing the job correctly?
P8:15:05 <Inschato> I thought about that, it wouldn't be overly useful.. someone could make one of a different thickness or such
P8:15:12 <Adura> Correctly is subjective.
P8:15:18 <Wolfram> Efficiently?
P8:15:28 <Wolfram> Tantamount to the needs of the owner?
P8:15:32 <Wolfram> The needs of the players?
P8:15:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> 100%
P8:15:42 <Wolfram> Of my thousands?
P8:15:45 <Wolfram> Not a safe bet.
P8:15:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have hundreds
P8:15:52 <Wolfram> Speaking generally, not of your hundred.
P8:15:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> hundred
P8:15:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> we've never had an issue or a rogue
P8:16:01 <Wolfram> See above installments.
P8:16:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> here's an idea, make me op
P8:16:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm worth infinity
P8:16:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> You never go on AnnihilatorBeta 
P8:16:23 <Jat> anyway whenever youre thinking of a plan for something like dealing with griefers, think of what will happen in the worst case scenario if it is implemented... because that or something close to it is probably what will actually result
P8:16:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> That, plus your user name makes me weary...
P8:16:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> i never go on myself, maybe
P8:16:35 <Wolfram> Alright, I'll take that bet.
P8:16:42 <Wolfram> Worst case scenarios for permissions.
P8:16:53 <Wolfram> You enter a server, it has no admins
P8:16:56 <Wolfram> And you have no permissions.
P8:16:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> and plus, my name makes me a weary person
P8:16:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> All servers go closed
P8:17:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft becomes a desert
P8:17:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> nobody builds
P8:17:06 <Jat> yes what natural said
P8:17:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> influential builders leave
P8:17:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> go to other games that are true SB
P8:17:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> (Infiniminer, Blockland)
P8:17:21 <Wolfram> That's a little broad.
P8:17:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft collapses
P8:17:21 <Jat> is not just one server it will be ALL of them
P8:17:25 <Infinity> what does SB mean
P8:17:26 <Wolfram> "World War Three"
P8:17:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> sandbox
P8:17:30 <Infinity> ah
P8:17:32 <Wolfram> "Everyone dies"
P8:17:39 <Adura> Griefers give reconstructers something to do.
P8:17:43 <Jat> lol
P8:17:43 <Infinity> lol
P8:17:45 <Wolfram> One person at least will have an open server, right?
P8:17:50 <Wolfram> Reddit will never have permissions.
P8:17:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're right adura
P8:17:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Never
P8:17:58 <Wolfram> So that worst case is moot.
P8:17:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> we can't ban them all or they'll go extinct
P8:18:04 <Wolfram> All servers closed will never happen.
P8:18:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, but reddit can only hold so manyu
P8:18:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> so many*
P8:18:10 <Adura> Of course, there has to be a balance...
P8:18:13 <Wolfram> You have supporters.
P8:18:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> of course, some server admins are stat whores
P8:18:22 <Wolfram> Many of your hundred OPs, I'd wager.
P8:18:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm sure they'll go to whichever method will get them more people
P8:18:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol Wolfram 
P8:18:35 <Wolfram> Well!
P8:18:43 <Wolfram> I'm sure these people must be friends, like-minders, etc.
P8:18:45 <Wolfram> You trust them!
P8:18:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  They don't all think like me
P8:18:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> I trust everyone who comes into my server
P8:19:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> any positively double plus good servers that you gals recommend?
P8:19:02 <Jat> also it will make mods feel even more overimportant than they already do which is of course a bad thing
P8:19:07 <Jat> i mean ops
P8:19:08 <Wolfram> The point is that not everyone thinks like ME.
P8:19:12 <Wolfram> Not all servers will be closed.
P8:19:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> Most will be... face it, people are selfish
P8:19:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> they don't care about the users, they care about THEIR buildings
P8:19:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> So they'll close
P8:19:34 <Wolfram> And a "closed" server isn't necessarily a "you can't build here" server.
P8:19:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's not very difficult to imagine
P8:19:38 <Wolfram> Many will let people in, no doubt.
P8:19:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh, no?  Sure, but how do you know who?
P8:19:55 <Wolfram> You'll just have to check.
P8:20:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Check what?
P8:20:01 <Wolfram> It's not different than prisons, is it?
P8:20:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, and prisons don't work either
P8:20:11 <Wolfram> Wait, it is. You can walk around instead of waiting.
P8:20:20 <Wolfram> That's debatable, but they still see use.
P8:20:22 <Wolfram> Which would you prefer?
P8:20:27 <Wolfram> If you had to pick?
P8:20:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't care... I wouldn't go on either
P8:20:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> as long as they're labeled and EASY to see
P8:20:35 <Wolfram> Unacceptable.
P8:20:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can avoid them
P8:20:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Acceptable
P8:20:44 <Wolfram> Within the bounds of those two choices
P8:20:46 <Wolfram> Which do you prefer?
P8:20:49 <Wolfram> Hypothetically?
P8:20:52 <Jat> i have a question for you wolfram
P8:20:59 <Wolfram> Go on.
P8:21:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> How can you chose between two things that both restrict creativity equally?
P8:21:03 <Infinity> is your last name Alpha

P8:21:11 <Wolfram> No, no it isn't.
P8:21:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> he's the alpha
P8:21:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh you're not?
P8:21:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> damn, well nice knowing you
P8:21:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Once he gets into beta, he'll agree with me
P8:21:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P8:21:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah get inside of me
P8:21:38 <Wolfram> You restrict entry to prevent rampant griefers.
P8:21:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just a bug folks, nothing to see here
P8:21:45 <Wolfram> Not a perfect solution, but we don't have a lot of options.
P8:21:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, CLOSE THE SERVER
P8:21:55 <Infinity> lolwut
P8:21:56 <Jat> whats the point if youre just gonna give build permissions to everyone then?
P8:21:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> If an OPs not on, close the server!
P8:22:02 <Wolfram> And don't evade the question, AlL.
P8:22:05 <Jat> and if you dont give build permissions then people will just leave anyway
P8:22:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I answered it
P8:22:08 <Wolfram> If you know for sure that prisons are going to see use.
P8:22:10 <family> Hey, I was wondering if there is anything I can do so my comp can handle mine craft better? It lags alot when water or lava are nearby, or if there is alot of blocks in my view
P8:22:14 <Wolfram> Would you rather encounter them, or permissions?
P8:22:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> family, press F
P8:22:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> lower FoV
P8:22:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Encounter them Wolfram ? 
P8:22:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not sure I understand the question
P8:22:37 <Jat> maybe you can use that greasemonkey script to lower the resolution
P8:22:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> both
P8:22:39 <Jat> ?
P8:22:43 <Infinity> lol incorrect use of encounter
P8:22:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wouldn't help Jat

P8:22:58 <Jat> oh
P8:23:00 <Jat> i didnt know that
P8:23:05 <Jat> thats weird
P8:23:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Still the same amnt of mathematical computations to be done by the GPU
P8:23:10 <Wolfram> Nevermind. I can see you won't be persauded to see my point of view.
P8:23:13 <Wolfram> See, mind, not agree with.
P8:23:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> well you see if you interrogate them and you find me
P8:23:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sorry, I'm not easily persuade-able
P8:23:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> and you say my name is weary
P8:23:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> i will be sad
P8:23:35 <Icalasari> Oh, also, I am having problems with using a server x.x Damn Vista
P8:23:38 <Wolfram> Open-minded would be the word to use.
P8:23:44 <iM> <3 Vista
P8:23:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> <2 vista
P8:23:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh, I'm very open minded Wolfram 
P8:23:53 <Wolfram> Or term, not word.
P8:23:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> To my ideas
P8:24:02 <Infinity> Vista sucks
P8:24:02 <Wolfram> The irony stings my eyes.
P8:24:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P (joking, of course)
P8:24:05 <Jat> wolfram i think i termed my question wrong when i asked it

P8:24:13 <Infinity> no you

P8:24:18 <Infinity> Windows 7 is better than XP even
P8:24:19 <Wolfram> Well, as long as no one is bent out of shape
P8:24:26 <Wolfram> Honestly, if we could replace prisons with permissions
P8:24:26 <Jat> what i meant was that i was asking you to actually explain how permissions would help prevent griefing
P8:24:28 <Wolfram> Should we?
P8:24:31 <iM> i had to put that in quotation marks
P8:24:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> well infinity you know what kinda person i am
P8:24:46 <Wolfram> The server OPs, Jat, could determine who to admit.
P8:24:50 <iM> anyhoo

P8:25:00 <Wolfram> Only the people would be free to wander.
P8:25:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> I would idle on 10 or 15 accounts

P8:25:07 <Icalasari> Anyways, I am trying to set up a server. However, I am using an editing program to change the map. Whenever I go to the direct link that I am given by the server, I get neither the edited nor the original map. I get a randomly generated map
P8:25:07 <Wolfram> Well, consider this, Jat
P8:25:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> and then slowly grief
P8:25:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> when the OPs are not on
P8:25:13 <Wolfram> If you don't know anyone in your server
P8:25:14 <Infinity> what are you talking about
P8:25:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm a cheap bastard
P8:25:17 <Wolfram> But you let in only a couple at a time
10P8:25:18 * NgLF (moor.t7@adsl-69-149-119-87.dsl.austtx.swbell.net) has joined #minecraft
P8:25:23 <Wolfram> It would be easier to monitor them than a whole gaggle.
P8:25:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're talking wwii pow camps for some reason
P8:25:33 <Wolfram> Especially if you weren't alone, but supported by auxiliary OPs
P8:25:33 <Jat> but then they will just wait until youre not watching anymore
P8:25:34 <JTE> heh.
P8:25:35 <Jat> and then grief
P8:25:40 <Jat> if that is their intention
P8:25:52 <Icalasari> If my username is too long, you can call me Ica for short. Anyways, can anybody help me with the server problem?
P8:25:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's why we need spectator mode
P8:26:00 <Wolfram> And then be banned.
P8:26:05 <Wolfram> But a trickle is better than a floodgate.
P8:26:20 <JTE> Hi Icalasari.
P8:26:22 <JTE> What's up? :3
P8:26:28 <Jat> i havent really found griefers flooding in to be a problem since maybe the first few days of multiplayer
P8:26:30 <Infinity> :3 is reserved for heterosexual conversations
P8:26:41 <Wolfram> Bigger servers catch it worse, I imagine.
P8:26:49 <Wolfram> But that's really a question of luck
P8:26:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, Wolfram..
P8:26:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> E:
P8:26:53 <Infinity> What is bigger supposed to mean
P8:26:54 <Wolfram> Which is a factor in everything.
P8:26:55 <Jat> as long as the ops make sure they check people theyre not familiar with once ina  while
P8:26:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bigger servers, more luck
P8:26:56 <Icalasari> Hello JTE. Not much. Just trying to figure out what the problem I'm having with setting up a server is
P8:26:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> more ops*
P8:26:59 <Infinity> I get a lot of playres just be being at top of server list >.>
P8:27:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
P8:27:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Icalasari, say your issue again?
P8:27:12 <Wolfram> That depends on the owner, really.
P8:27:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> I ammended it AnnihilatorBeta 
P8:27:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> One line above yers
P8:27:22 <Icalasari> I get a link and everything, but it won't take me to the map. It takes me to a randomly generated map instead
P8:27:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
P8:27:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, if the owner's not a selfish powerhungry bastard
P8:27:36 <Jat> wolfram what youre saying is that players who join will just have to wait a short while before they are allowed to grief
P8:27:38 <Infinity> you put the server_level.dat in correct location
P8:27:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wasn't listening to your conversation
P8:27:41 <Infinity> while the server is down
P8:27:43 <Infinity> then you restart
P8:27:45 <JTE> And make sure you're logged in.
P8:27:49 <Infinity> oh
P8:27:52 <Jat> and the admins will still have to watch them like they do now
P8:27:53 <Wolfram> Point, AlL, but owners do have the right to be so.
P8:27:53 <Infinity> clientside issue
P8:27:58 <Infinity> make sure ur logged in and enable cookies
P8:28:04 <Icalasari> I am logged in, and cookies are enabled
P8:28:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sure Wolfram... And those kind of peoples might deserve a griefing or two
P8:28:14 <Wolfram> Jat, I'm equating permissions to prisons
P8:28:16 <Wolfram> Because they are the same
P8:28:19 <Jat> oh ok
P8:28:26 <Infinity> Except permissions let faggots roleplay too
P8:28:28 <Wolfram> The difference is that permissions allow you to wander.
P8:28:33 <NgLF> Does anyone have a good Priv Dedicated server?
P8:28:37 <Icalasari> How do I take DOWN the server, though?
P8:28:41 <Infinity> NgLF why not just singleplayer
P8:28:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Icalasari, what OS?
P8:28:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> close the command prompt
P8:28:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linux it's killall java
P8:28:47 <Icalasari> Vista
P8:28:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh...
P8:28:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
P8:28:54 <Jat> but i still find prisons ineffective
P8:28:58 <Icalasari> I killed the security measures on it though
P8:29:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> If I was a griefer, prisons would piss me off
P8:29:09 <Icalasari> >.> Rather have viruses than Vista security
P8:29:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> make me grief even more
P8:29:12 <Wolfram> Well, I admit they leave something to be desired
P8:29:26 <Wolfram> But that's about the pinnacle of anti-griefing at the moment for small scale servers.
P8:29:34 <Wolfram> More OPs, good OPs is better
P8:29:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll be right back guys, going to grab dinner
P8:29:40 <Wolfram> But not always an option.
P8:29:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll look forward to the discussion while I'm biting into a dead animal
P8:29:45 <Jat> bye natural
P8:30:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> dead animals, nice use of wording
P8:30:04 <Jat> when i join a server and end up in a prison i just disconnect and never go back
P8:30:09 <Jat> i dont feel welcomed
P8:30:10 <JTE> JTE just wants to make minerals unbreakable.
P8:30:13 <Icalasari> I wish I had a choice in OS, but Microsoft OS' support the most programs and besides, this is the family computer >.>
P8:30:13 <Wolfram> That's your right.
P8:30:16 <Wolfram> You can certainly do that.
P8:30:24 <Jat> and i feel like any mistake i make will get me banned or something
P8:30:27 <NgLF> Noone hosts a good priv dedicated server
P8:30:27 <Wolfram> Hence the labeling natural suggested.
P8:30:30 <Wolfram> I agree with that totally.
P8:30:31 <Jat> im just saying that many people feel that way
P8:30:34 <Jat> not just me
P8:30:41 <JTE> blah blah blah...
P8:30:43 <JTE> o.o
P8:30:45 <Wolfram> Well, they will have to speak for themselves.
P8:30:52 <Jat> most people wont
P8:30:57 <Jat> tthey will just stay silent and give up
P8:30:59 <Wolfram> Oh, I don't know about that.
P8:31:02 <Icalasari> Jat: I joined a server that would only allow two people, and ended up in a 1x1x2 hole of unbreakable blocks >.>
P8:31:06 <Adura> Noone's skin is pretty cool.
13P8:31:08 * JTE can't keep up with too many conversations and just goes back to working on a server proxy. @.@;
P8:31:17 <Jat> lol ica D:
P8:31:24 <Wolfram> In any case, I'll pose the same question to you, Jat
P8:31:39 <Wolfram> If you had to bump into either a prison or a permission server, which would be less obnoxious?
12P8:31:48 * Rroff (msrp24@host86-177-103-32.range86-177.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Quit: Don't drink and drive, smoke dope and fly home)
P8:32:04 <Jat> a permission server would only be slightly less obnoxious
P8:32:09 <Jat> but that doesnt make it better really
P8:32:14 <Jat> or a good idea
P8:32:14 <JTE> Sure it does.
P8:32:16 <Wolfram> Better is better, my friend.
P8:32:25 <Icalasari> Honestly, the whole read me for the server setup should include more information
P8:32:25 <JTE> You'd be able to look at everyone else's beautiful arts.
12P8:32:31 * fragmer (fragmer@c-98-248-163-16.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: ...but not as much as I love bacon...)
P8:32:44 <Wolfram> Precisely, JTE.
P8:33:03 <Wolfram> And of course, the advent of some greater idea down the road could make permissions obsolete
P8:33:12 <JTE> ACTUAL ROLEPLAY STUFFS where not everyone has the ability to magically create and destroy would be possible. And you could even set up a Museum server that way or something. oo;
P8:33:22 <Wolfram> Ideally our counter-measures will only become more advantageous to everyone
P8:33:24 <Jat> yes i agree it would be good for roleplay
P8:33:43 <Jat> is roleplay really that popular?
P8:33:47 <Wolfram> I enjoy roleplaying, but I've never even thought to try it at minecraft.
P8:33:49 <Jat> i havent even seen it
P8:33:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
P8:34:00 <Infinity> I don't think roleplaying is very easy with gigantic blocks >.>
P8:34:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's very popular even if it doesn't seem like rp
P8:34:08 <JTE> There isn't much to do in minecraft that would allow for decent roleplaying ... yet. :<
P8:34:14 <Infinity> JTE is right
P8:34:15 <Wolfram> Yeah, the overlap of roleplayers with internet users is pretty high, I think
P8:34:15 <Infinity> you need food
P8:34:17 <Infinity> and hunger system
P8:34:23 <Infinity> and weapons
P8:34:23 <Wolfram> Even in a lot of middle-agers. D&D is old.
P8:34:25 <Infinity> etc
P8:34:26 <Infinity> for RP
P8:34:30 <JTE> Of course JTE is right. :3 JTE is JTE.
P8:34:33 <Jat> i only remember seeing maybe a few roleplay servers a few weeks ago but i didnt bother joining them to see what they were doing
P8:34:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> E:
P8:34:41 <Wolfram> As is your right.
P8:34:43 <Jat> so i have no idea what minecraft roleplay is...
P8:34:43 <Infinity> F:
P8:34:45 <Icalasari> I've been trying to make a dungeon server myself. If we could, say, mine for materials to make weapons, and had enemies implemented, then it would be awesome
P8:34:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> T:
P8:34:49 <Wolfram> Same as any other roleplay.
P8:34:49 <Inschato> Hmm
P8:34:51 <JTE> Okay, okay, so. Everybody eats Grass Blocks.
P8:34:56 <Icalasari> Oh, and switches. Can't forget those switches
P8:34:58 <Infinity> yes.
P8:35:01 <Inschato> If anyone comes to my server and annoys VurtualRuler98, I'll give you a metaphorical cookie.
P8:35:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes jte
P8:35:03 <Icalasari> JTE: What about the mushrooms? :P
P8:35:05 <JTE> And you have to cultivate grass blocks by having dirt blocks next to them.
P8:35:06 <Infinity> Mushrooms are more tasty
P8:35:10 <Wolfram> Right NOW Minecraft RP would essentially be chat RP.
P8:35:15 <JTE> Icalasari: Don't Eat the Mushrooms D:
P8:35:16 <Wolfram> With a basic graphical interface.
P8:35:17 <Jat> grass blocks are not a sustainable resource in broken maps!
P8:35:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> shrooms are poisonous and you die from it
P8:35:19 <Infinity> yes.
P8:35:19 <Inschato> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a8657a3d0b6c06f1bf5030366d09a151
13P8:35:21 * Inschato cries
P8:35:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> stop crying baby
P8:35:30 <Icalasari> JTE: I built up an immunity
P8:35:50 <Jat> to grass?
P8:35:58 <Jat> oh mushrooms
P8:36:00 <Jat> nevermind
P8:36:00 <JTE> Jat: Maps only become broken from mapjack. Becase mapjack is broken. :<
P8:36:03 <JTE> And it makes me sad.
P8:36:05 <Jat> nope
P8:36:12 <Jat> they become broken because of their dimensions
P8:36:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> glass should be edible
P8:36:19 <Jat> its not just mapjack
P8:36:29 <JTE> What dimensions break grass?
P8:36:46 <Jat> people say its stuff thats not power of two but i think its just anything thats over 256
P8:36:49 <JTE> Can grass only exist above or below a certain threshold?
P8:36:52 <Jat> tbut i havent tested it yet
P8:37:03 <Wolfram> No.
P8:37:19 <Wolfram> Well, for sure grass exists as low as you care to grow it.
P8:37:24 <Wolfram> So I assume up is the same.
P8:37:28 <NgLF> Sorry to ask again, but Does anyone run a good Dedicated Private server? 
P8:37:33 <JTE> Stuff that's not a power of 2 would be logical, considering I just changed a 64 height map to a 96 one ...
P8:37:46 <Jat> and now grass doesnt work?
P8:37:59 <JTE> Yep.
P8:38:05 <Jat> oh ok cool
P8:38:06 <Wolfram> Doesn't work how?
P8:38:07 <JTE> Maybe if I jack it up to 128 it'll work again? :3
P8:38:08 <Wolfram> No longer spreads?
P8:38:15 <JTE> No longer spreads. NO LONGER DIES.
P8:38:19 <Wolfram> Hmm.
P8:38:20 <JTE> No longer thinks at all.
P8:38:21 <Jat> i really have no idea why non power of two dimensions break grass
P8:38:26 <Jat> although plants get broken too
P8:38:29 <Jat> not just grass
P8:38:34 <Wolfram> I think no longer dies has interesting implications. Shaded dirt is pretty ugly.
P8:38:52 <JTE> Heh.
P8:38:52 <Jat> until someone digs up a piece of grass and you can never replace it
P8:39:02 <Wolfram> That's a point.
P8:39:13 <Jat> tyou have to replace it with green blocks
P8:39:20 <Wolfram> Doesn't quite match, either.
P8:39:25 <Jat> nope
P8:39:32 <Wolfram> Of course, if we had a grass block...
P8:39:35 <Wolfram> But then, I like grass as it is.
P8:42:33 <JTE> Yay, adding another 32 blocks of height fixed the grass
P8:42:39 <JTE> That is REALLY weird, but okay. :33
P8:42:46 <JTE> At least it's not permanently fucked.

P8:43:20 <liq3> JTE: Yeh, gotta be power of 2 size. No idea why.
P8:44:32 <JTE> liq3: Possibly some algorythm for determining which/when grass grows requires a power of 2 in order to work effeciently or at all..? I have no idea either, and I'm a programmer. :(
P8:45:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Guess who's back?
P8:45:30 <PuyoDead> Mr. Kotter?
P8:45:34 <Wolfram> I wish.
P8:45:36 <Wolfram> That show rocked.
P8:45:39 <PuyoDead> yes, it did
P8:45:46 <Wolfram> Welcome back~
P8:45:50 <Wolfram> Your dreams were your ticket out~
P8:45:58 <PuyoDead> quite the earworm of a song
P8:46:02 <Wolfram> Agreed.
P8:46:06 <Wolfram> Gotta google it, now.
P8:51:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jat, are you in the US?
P8:52:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> He left?  WHAT?  NOBODY LEAVES!

P8:52:36 <PuyoDead> he just did
P8:56:29 <PuyoDead> there needs to be a map repository
P8:57:36 <JTE> http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/6429/treasurebox.png -- I like hiding treasure boxes like this.
P8:57:42 <JTE> Full of two gold blocks.
P8:58:11 <Wolfram> Haha.
P8:58:18 <Wolfram> Never thought of that.
P8:58:23 <fydo> lol
P8:58:36 <Wolfram> I like connecting things with long, elaborate tunnels
P8:58:42 <Wolfram> And then walling off and disguising both ends.
P8:59:21 <Wolfram> Where is NgLF? In the heat of all that discussion I'm afraid everyone ignored him.
P8:59:24 <PuyoDead> someone made a bank on a server I was on... I reverse robbed it, and placed a bunch of gold in the back
P8:59:35 <JTE> heh.
P9:00:14 <Grethena> Is there no +q or +a on this server?
P9:00:54 <Wolfram> AlLnAtuRalX, what do you mean to say with that forum post about /spectate?
P9:01:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> It would finish griefers Wolfram 
P9:01:14 <Wolfram> Clarify.
P9:02:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> If users were able to follow and watch griefers without the griefer knowing, not only would the griefer know he/she was never out of scrutiny, but one person doing this at all times on a public server (we have many more TPing every minute) would catch them.  Couple that with votekick and ban if there are no ops on, already implemented on our servers, and finished, fini.
P9:02:54 <Wolfram> That case depends on OPs, which obviate the need for permissions or prisons. A valid point. However
P9:03:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> ouple that with votekick and ban if there are no ops on
P9:03:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Couple*
P9:03:06 <Wolfram> Prisons still see use when a server is lacking in many or quality ops.
P9:03:22 <Wolfram> I don't factor votekick, and I'll tell you why.
P9:03:37 <Wolfram> Because I disapprove of votekick; it would be abused horribly.
P9:03:41 <Wolfram> Not even to speak of voteban.
P9:03:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, have you ever played Quake?
P9:03:49 <Wolfram> The last thing we need is griefer TEAMS kicking people.
P9:03:57 <Wolfram> Yes, I have.
P9:03:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> 3?
P9:04:06 <Wolfram> No, only the original.
P9:04:17 <Daidoji> I love how all this griefer drama is going on
P9:04:30 <Wolfram> No drama, just a civil discussion.
P9:04:35 <Wolfram> We're trying to get things done.
P9:04:36 <Daidoji> uh not here
P9:04:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, in 3, as I'm sure in the original (which I only played a few times because I get raped), cheating is a huge issue... There are cheaters EVERYWHERE.  Cheats are free, easy, and they ruin the game.  Just as griefers do ehre
P9:04:39 <Daidoji> I mean in general
P9:04:42 <Daidoji> everywhere
P9:04:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> In these games, OPs are also not prominent at all... Reliance is placed upon 2 factors
P9:04:54 <Daidoji> MY SHITTY CASTLE HAS BEEN RUINED OH NO
P9:04:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> 1) spectating, and 2) votekick
P9:05:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Votekick is done with a time interval (say, 30 seconds)
P9:05:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> and then users vote yes or no
P9:05:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Whichever side has more votes gets done
P9:05:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> if it's even, it goes to no
P9:05:28 <Wolfram> I understand the concept.
P9:05:28 <Daidoji> make votekick premium only
P9:05:30 <Daidoji> problem solved
P9:05:32 <PuyoDead> I'll agree that spectating is a huge part there
P9:05:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> That pretty much ends cheating in Quake Wolfram 
13P9:05:33 * Prime_2 pokes JTE
P9:05:48 <Wolfram> And your case is that what's good for the goose is good for the gander?
P9:05:49 <PuyoDead> but in my experience, votekicks are kind of, err, forgotten
P9:06:04 <PuyoDead> either people don't vote, rendering the vote useless
P9:06:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, no, but I fail to see any differences between the scenarios
P9:06:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, I don;t think you understand
P9:06:15 <Wolfram> I'm sorry, but I simply won't be convinced that implementing votekick won't lead to a lot of abuse.
P9:06:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> VoteKick would be official
P9:06:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it would be in big letters
P9:06:24 <PuyoDead> I absolutely understand
P9:06:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> on a part of the screen where there's nothing
P9:06:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it would be hotkey'd
P9:06:32 <PuyoDead> yea, I know
P9:06:33 <Wolfram> Worse, votekick could work from prisons.
P9:06:42 <PuyoDead> in FPS, a lot of times, people ignore it
P9:06:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, it's only a kick
P9:06:45 <Daidoji> prisons are retarded
P9:06:47 <Wolfram> You'd be handing griefers more power than players.
P9:06:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> If an OP gets kicked, they just pwn whoever voted
P9:06:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, lol
P9:06:56 <Daidoji> how the hell is that any better why even have the server up
P9:07:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> you're ignorant, I'm sorry
P9:07:07 <Wolfram> Personal attacks? Please.
P9:07:11 <PuyoDead> sorry wolfram, but I have to disagree there
P9:07:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, simply observations
P9:07:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are never more griefers than players
P9:07:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I can't see how that's MORE power
P9:07:35 <PuyoDead> the griefers might get a couple votes, sure... but chances are, there are far more people voting against them
P9:07:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> True
P9:07:41 <Wolfram> Never, and why? Because they operate more effectively solo.
P9:07:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> plus, ops can cancel votes
P9:07:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's how it works in quake also
P9:07:49 <Wolfram> They hide and destroy when no one is looking.
P9:07:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> admins can veto if they disagree
P9:08:03 <Daidoji> what about survival mode
P9:08:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> What about it Daidoji ?
P9:08:13 <Daidoji> that will take effort.
P9:08:15 <Wolfram> And you're still using larger servers as the basis for your predictions.
P9:08:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not even being actively developed yet
P9:08:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> we have no info on i
P9:08:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> it*
P9:08:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, not at all
P9:08:22 <Daidoji> yes we do
P9:08:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> and of course the feature would be optional
P9:08:32 <Wolfram> What about smaller servers? Say two OPs and six players online.
P9:08:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, what, Notch's speculation from weeks ago?
P9:08:41 <Daidoji> no
10P9:08:42 * Nalok (gdhammerbo@c-24-126-0-81.hsd1.wv.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P9:08:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> It could develop into something totally different
P9:09:00 <Daidoji> he's had it planned a basic way from the start
P9:09:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> i see the debate goes on still
P9:09:03 <PuyoDead> it's a little early to be talking about how survival is going to go
P9:09:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Way too early
P9:09:12 <Wolfram> In any case.
P9:09:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol AnnihilatorBeta 
P9:09:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just got back, so...
P9:09:20 <Wolfram> Let's say we go this route.
P9:09:25 <Wolfram> Votekick and spectate.
P9:09:27 <PuyoDead> the vote route?
P9:09:31 <Wolfram> Will that erase prisons?
P9:09:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmkay
P9:09:33 <Wolfram> I think not.
P9:09:34 <PuyoDead> I just want spectate :P
P9:09:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Probably, yes
P9:09:37 <Daidoji> no I'm 100% certain survival mode is gonna use resources
P9:09:46 <Wolfram> What do you base that prediction on?
P9:09:48 <Daidoji> and take time to get those, it's not gonna be instant
P9:09:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Your point Daidoji ?
P9:09:56 <PuyoDead> I don't see many people use prisons in the first place, honestly
P9:09:59 <Daidoji> it's not a prediction, it's a fact.
P9:10:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know
P9:10:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> his point is that in real life you don't need resources
P9:10:06 <Wolfram> Absurd, haha.
P9:10:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're not supposed to build in survival anyway Daidoji 
P9:10:13 <Wolfram> Cases consisting of "Because I said so."
P9:10:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> at least not like we do now
P9:10:19 <Wolfram> I'm not sure why I even bother.
P9:10:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what
P9:10:25 <Daidoji> yes you are
P9:10:26 <PuyoDead> and as long as there are op blocks, there will be prisons
P9:10:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> not supposed to build what do you mean
P9:10:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, it's worked for other communities
P9:10:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nexuiz, Quake
P9:10:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Urban Terror
P9:10:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> almost every game I've played
P9:10:39 <JTE> People keep opening my boxes, taking the gold, and replacing it with stones/air and re-closing it. XD
P9:10:40 <Wolfram> I understand where you're coming from, friend.
P9:10:48 <Wolfram> But enough! See for yourselves.
P9:10:52 <Daidoji> gotta build a house to keep out the bears
P9:10:53 <Wolfram> Once it gets implemented, assuming it does
P9:11:02 <Wolfram> We'll see the effect it has on grief and on prisons.
P9:11:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> gonna build a van and live in there
P9:11:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just want all ops of prison servers to do me a favor
P9:11:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> A nice, large
P9:11:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> [PRISON] tag
P9:11:12 <Wolfram> And then one of us will be wrong, and for god's sake, I hope it's me.
P9:11:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's doable, right?
P9:11:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Very easy, in fact
P9:11:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> when you guys make prisons
P9:11:25 <Wolfram> Labels are perfectly acceptable.
P9:11:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> So why don't people do it?
P9:11:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> you should totally make them wolfenstein 3d style
P9:11:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> So put one on your server Wolfram 
P9:11:33 <Wolfram> Because they're lazy? Who knows.
P9:11:40 <Wolfram> Mine is private. We haven't gone public yet.
P9:11:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> So what are you bitching about in the first place?
P9:11:52 <Daidoji> gotta mine for iron to make tools and better weapons so you won't be raped by bears as much.
P9:11:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Get some experience handling a public...
P9:12:02 <Wolfram> As you're so kind to point out
P9:12:06 <Wolfram> The world doesn't revolve around me.
P9:12:10 <Wolfram> I'm interested in the community's benefit.
P9:12:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> well said
P9:12:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Absolutely.  If I ran a private server, I'd stay out of it
P9:12:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> end of argument
P9:12:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just because I haven't faced public server issues, and haven't had to handle them in the first palce
P9:12:44 <Wolfram> I'm not a republican or a democrat, friend
P9:12:46 <Wolfram> But I still vote
P9:12:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  Are you a citizen?

P9:13:05 <Wolfram> Yes. Therefore, my opinion matters.

P9:13:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> You have experience with both republicans AND democrats.. be it regular people, the media, local office
P9:13:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, who are you referring to?
P9:13:46 <Wolfram> Make clear your point.
P9:13:48 <Wolfram> Me, no doubt.
P9:13:53 <Daidoji> in the country of bearslam there is no democracy
P9:14:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> ?
P9:14:12 <Wolfram> Don't ask me.
P9:14:13 <PuyoDead> err, Dai?
P9:14:20 <PuyoDead> you ok over there?
P9:14:32 <Daidoji> bearslam, land of the bears.
P9:14:39 <PuyoDead> sure thing
P9:14:53 <Wolfram> Irrelevant comment is irrelevant
P9:14:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> they have parachuting bears watch out
P9:14:55 <Daidoji> ask notch about it
P9:15:06 <PuyoDead> can you explain how votekick would be abused wolf?
P9:15:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> sure thing
P9:15:14 <Wolfram> Sure.
P9:15:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, are you a Redditor?
P9:15:16 <PuyoDead> or at least not productive
P9:15:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> as wolf, i have here to present you how it can be abused
P9:15:23 <PuyoDead> yea, recently
P9:15:26 <Daidoji> it can be abused but it's highly unlikely
P9:15:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Puyo: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUsers/comments/8xokz/what_brought_about_your_sexual_awakening_and/c0arodu
P9:15:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> say a group of griefers join a small server
P9:15:43 <Wolfram> Say you have some troll griefers. These guys could be from anywhere. Birds of a feather, right?
P9:15:47 <Wolfram> I'm looking at 4chan specifically here.
P9:15:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> does this seem like it's not consistent with the rest of Reddit?  @PuyoDead
P9:15:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> they gang on up some players and begin to votekick them
P9:15:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, if ops can veto votes
P9:15:56 <Wolfram> These guys drop in, blend
P9:16:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> hey
P9:16:05 <Wolfram> What if there are no OPs on?
P9:16:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, Wolfram, as of yet I have seen no organized griefing
P9:16:16 <Wolfram> Why would they?
P9:16:19 <Daidoji> hey we did it in wurm
P9:16:19 <Wolfram> They're more effective alone.
P9:16:24 <PuyoDead> yea... that doesn't fit there at all
P9:16:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> h
P9:16:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> So if they're not communicating....
P9:16:36 <Wolfram> Why would they? Votekick is a reason to do it.
P9:16:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
P9:16:51 <PuyoDead> ok, ok...
P9:16:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> How would they know to vote yes/no
P9:16:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> um
P9:16:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or if the user is valid/griefer?
P9:17:01 <AlLnAtuRalX>  If they're not talking to each other
P9:17:03 <PuyoDead> so a group of griefers, hypothetically, I can see that
P9:17:14 <PuyoDead> 4chan could do something like that, I suppose
P9:17:15 <Wolfram> PuyoDead understands what I mean.
P9:17:20 <Wolfram> Re-read, perhaps?
P9:17:25 <Daidoji> you know you can have a votekick entirely by script
P9:17:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, how so?
P9:17:36 <PuyoDead> I've only seen 2, maybe 3 on at a time, personally. but I'm following you
P9:17:37 <Wolfram> I hadn't even thought of that, Daidoji.
P9:17:53 <PuyoDead> you mean Dexter's script?
P9:17:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, I have it on Reddit Public
P9:17:58 <Infinity> What if Notch made Minecraft able to be editabble with Lua so that using a few simple hooks you can draw menus, make blocks appear, etc
P9:18:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> using Adura's script
P9:18:06 <Daidoji> people can make 3D models via script and you're surprised by a vote kick
P9:18:19 <Wolfram> And just so we're clear, AlLnAtuRalX, my inclination to consider these matters from all angles isn't a personal attack
P9:18:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, you'll be proud to know it hasn't been abused yet (:O)
P9:18:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> I never took it as one
P9:18:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> And even if I did that would be irrelevant
P9:18:39 <Wolfram> And yet you deal them to me in turn?
P9:18:40 <Daidoji> the script would just act like a player
P9:18:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Where is that Wolfram ?
P9:18:47 <Daidoji> they would show up on the list
P9:18:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quote me please
P9:18:53 <Daidoji> and would technically be an OP
P9:18:54 <Wolfram> Certainly.
P9:18:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> I like it when I get quoted
P9:19:16 <PuyoDead> my point is, Wolfram, that the chances of griefers outnumbering other, good people is very slim
P9:19:23 <Wolfram> <AlLnAtuRalX>: you're ignorant, I'm sorry
P9:19:33 <Daidoji> well yeah
P9:19:35 <PuyoDead> hence, that being abused seems likea far fetched idea
P9:19:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I already responded; mere observation
P9:19:40 <Daidoji> it depends on if they really want to do something
P9:19:45 <Wolfram> Which is another attack.
P9:19:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, griefers are not organized
P9:19:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> we're giving them far too much credit
P9:19:55 <Daidoji> untrue
P9:19:58 <Wolfram> I understand your point, PuyoDead.
P9:20:03 <Daidoji> us goons have griefed the shit out of a few games
P9:20:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Most of them are angsty 11 y/os who are jealous of others' buildings
P9:20:08 <Daidoji> and we were all hardcore about it
P9:20:11 <Wolfram> I'm just not ruling out the possibility of organization given the motivation to do it.
P9:20:12 <PuyoDead> they can be, but are very unlikely to be
P9:20:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, I know quite a few people from goons
P9:20:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Trust me.. Not organzied
P9:20:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh you silly goons
P9:20:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> (no offense)(
P9:20:23 <Daidoji> sorry
P9:20:25 <Wolfram> One thing I consider often is this
P9:20:29 <Daidoji> but we were very organized.
P9:20:30 <Wolfram> One griefer shows up.
P9:20:34 <Wolfram> You catch him and ban him.
P9:20:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> And they were both far too immature for me to take them seriously
P9:20:39 <Wolfram> He happens to be a 4chan kid.
P9:20:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> daidoji
P9:20:44 <Wolfram> He heads over there, posts your link
P9:20:49 <Daidoji> have you played wurm at all
P9:20:50 <Wolfram> And says what happened.
P9:20:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, giving 4chan too much credit
P9:20:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Want me to tell you a story?
P9:21:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're not planning to grief on a game like mc, are you? :<
P9:21:03 <PuyoDead> that could very well happen, but it also VERY unlikely
P9:21:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> I once went on 4chan (I was bored)
P9:21:06 <Daidoji> if it involves EVE I don't give a shit
P9:21:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Told them this yarn
P9:21:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> about how this chick dumped me, etc
P9:21:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I hated her
P9:21:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> posted hot pics
P9:21:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> promised tits, the whole bit
P9:21:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> then I gave my AIM and said
P9:21:32 <Wolfram> Sounds like you fit right in.
P9:21:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> You know what to do /b/
P9:21:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Guess what they did?
P9:21:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Two people IMd me
P9:21:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Two
P9:21:49 <Daidoji> no annil
P9:21:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> And the thread was bumped many times (not by me)
P9:21:54 <Daidoji> mc isn't an mmo
P9:21:55 <Wolfram> Guess you didn't make much of an impact.
P9:22:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> cool
P9:22:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> One of them kept IMing me for weeks
P9:22:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> let's be friends
P9:22:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> said he loved me, etc
P9:22:12 <Wolfram> Nonetheless, isn't this argument over? I'm taking the go ahead, wait and see approach.

P9:22:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> How is that organization?
P9:22:39 <Wolfram> Anyway, if you're suggesting nothing serious can come of it
P9:22:46 <Daidoji> how is what
P9:22:48 <Wolfram> Do I have permission to direct those people to Reddit?
P9:22:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> You don't know fellow goons?
P9:22:53 <Wolfram> Simply in the name of science.
P9:22:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Do it
P9:23:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> they already know about it Wolfram 
P9:23:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Reddit has been on 4chan every day for like 10 years
P9:23:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> for science
P9:23:29 <Wolfram> I didn't realize you were so frequent a visitor.
P9:23:32 <Wolfram> Nonetheless, very well.
P9:23:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Never implied that I was
P9:23:36 <Wolfram> I'll see what I can do.
P9:23:39 <Daidoji> uh that's like saying how can I be black cause I don't know the names of every black person
P9:23:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Reddit on 4chan has been on Reddit and Reddit IRC
P9:23:47 <Daidoji> MAN THOSE BLACK PEOPLE SURE ARE UNORGANIZED
P9:23:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> which I no longer frequent because it became a cesspool
P9:24:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> lol daidoji
P9:24:06 <Daidoji> there's like 80,000 goons
P9:24:08 <Daidoji> maybe more
P9:24:09 <Drakkar> lololol
P9:24:10 <Daidoji> I lost count
P9:24:13 <Drakkar> <-- Goon
P9:24:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Most of them 4 year old
P9:24:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> olds*
P9:24:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> <-- not goon
P9:24:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some of the most immature people I've met online
P9:24:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Once again, no offense
P9:24:30 <Adura> <-- human
P9:24:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> <-- lesbian
P9:24:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're not human you liar
P9:24:55 <Drakkar> there's worse
P9:24:59 <Drakkar> much much worse
P9:25:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have a feeling that's going to be on my Wiki very, very soon...
P9:25:04 <Daidoji> if you want to talk about immature why don't you read the gamefaq forums
P9:25:09 <Drakkar> it also depends on what forums you roll in
P9:25:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> facepunch
P9:25:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, if I wanted immature I'd be on Ebaum'sWorld
P9:25:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> not Minecraft
P9:25:24 <Daidoji> at least we ban people that act overly retarded.
P9:25:25 <Drakkar> some SA forums are pretty fagtastic
P9:25:51 <Daidoji> anyway back to the point
P9:25:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's why i don't post on those forums anyways
P9:25:53 <Drakkar> others are fairly reasonable though
P9:26:01 <PuyoDead> hey! I have fantastic news! I just had 2 greifers on at once!
P9:26:03 <Daidoji> there is nothing more scary than a small group of goons in a random mmo
P9:26:09 <Drakkar> small?
P9:26:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh boy
P9:26:11 <Daidoji> they'll destroy everything. that's a fact.

P9:26:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Goons comes off to me as a bunch of toddlers
P9:26:42 <Daidoji> the goon secret I'll tell you
P9:26:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Maybe it's just the few I've met
P9:26:51 <Daidoji> we don't take games so serious.
P9:26:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> All drama queens who like to act importantly
P9:26:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> I didn't meet them in-game
P9:27:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> I met them all on TeamSpeak servers
P9:27:05 <Daidoji> well some do
P9:27:15 <Drakkar> its pretty varied
P9:27:19 <Daidoji> I'll admit, there's some hilarious goon on goon drama on occasion
P9:27:25 <Daidoji> but we live for pubbie tears
P9:27:29 <Drakkar> as I said it depends on the forums and subforums

P9:28:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> So, yeah... glad we're discussing Minecraft
P9:28:03 <Adura> If the name "goons" wasn't so generic, I could tell if they were from SA.
P9:28:34 <Daidoji> you just gotta ask them the question
P9:29:08 <Daidoji> the super secret goon question I'll reveal it here.
P9:29:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> minecraft executive
P9:29:38 <Daidoji> you ask "what god do you follow?" they must answer "the path is gray." (the period is important)
P9:30:07 <liq3> No
P9:30:13 <liq3> That's not the super secret goon question.
P9:30:20 <Daidoji> well not anymore.
P9:30:32 <liq3> Yes, that's what I just said.
P9:30:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> so what's the new super secret goon question then
P9:31:28 <Daidoji> heh, what new super secret goon question?
P9:32:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> thanks
P9:32:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'll keep that in mind
P9:32:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> also it's 10:35 already
P9:32:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> that debate lasted for over than an hour or maybe two
P9:32:36 <Nalok> 10:32 here >.>
P9:33:00 <Nalok> And damnit damnit damnit Minecraft still wont work
P9:33:03 <PuyoDead> it only figures that as I'm talking in here about griefers, I get hit by two at once
P9:33:06 <Wolfram> I'd say it became less debate and more argument about three fourths of the way through.
P9:33:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's what you said
P9:33:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> gentlemen
P9:34:02 <Adura> Scientology doesn't stand a chance against them, ultimately.
P9:34:18 <Wolfram> What? The anonymous loyalists?
P9:34:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> what politics
P9:34:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> what what
P9:34:41 <Wolfram> Scientology is altogether huge and creepy.
P9:35:46 <Wolfram> Their practices really startle me, too. They force your to sever your ties to non-scientologists, calling them SPs.
P9:35:56 <Wolfram> Friends, family, anyone who won't convert.

P9:36:33 <PuyoDead> oh no! some people walking around saying bad things about them!
P9:36:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Puyo, yt?
P9:36:41 <Wolfram> They're HUGE, man. I researched them a little.
P9:36:47 <Daidoji> wolfram don't be an interbulator
P9:36:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Puyo: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUsers/comments/8xokz/what_brought_about_your_sexual_awakening_and/c0arodu
P9:37:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can't believe I'M the one getting down'd... On Reddit nonetheless!
P9:38:06 <PuyoDead> ehh, I don't bother much with community based sites. as you can see by my reddit activity
P9:38:11 <PuyoDead> at least it's not digg ,though
P9:38:30 <Wolfram> Interbulator nothing. My statements are factual in regard to Scientology
P9:38:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I love how she was so quick to type go fuck youself...
P9:38:47 <Wolfram> Both in how big they are and how nervous they make me.
P9:38:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh no!  Some people believe in aliens!
P9:38:59 <Daidoji> you posted on reddit.
P9:39:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i will never post on reddit

P9:39:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, I know you find this hard to believe, but scientology actually helps a lot of people
P9:39:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just as Christianity does
P9:39:26 <Daidoji> that's a pretty good troll
P9:39:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh shi- now I have to go through my Reddit history
P9:39:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> to find that one comment
P9:39:41 <Wolfram> You'd argue with a brick wall, wouldn't you?
P9:39:46 <Wolfram> Fair enough. You support it, I oppose it.
P9:39:49 <Wolfram> I'll agree to disagree.
P9:39:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Only if the brick wall had Wolfram painted on it
P9:39:58 <Daidoji> do you really support scientology
P9:39:59 <Wolfram> So you admit personal bias?
P9:40:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, far from it
P9:40:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, it was a joke
P9:40:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Daidoji, they have their place
P9:40:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> what a joke. ha ha ha.
P9:40:27 <mib_44pc7q> so  if I can't connect to my local serv with http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=127.0.0.1&port=25565 what do I try next?
P9:40:33 <PuyoDead> ok, ok, OK
P9:40:38 <PuyoDead> natural, what the hell?
P9:40:40 <Daidoji> their place is in jail yes
P9:40:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> mib_44pc7q, use &ip-
P9:40:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> conver to scientology is your best bet
P9:40:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> not server
P9:40:48 <PuyoDead> AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, I know you find this hard to believe, but scientology actually helps a lot of people
P9:40:49 <mib_44pc7q> ah, that would explain it
P9:40:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't agree with the church either... they've held back science for hundreds of years, but unfortunately life experience has told me that some people benefit a lot from christianity
P9:40:52 <mib_44pc7q> thank you
P9:40:54 <PuyoDead> you had better not be serious
P9:40:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, h/o let me get the reddit post
P9:40:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> before you kill me
P9:41:09 <PuyoDead> you had better deliver the meaning of life
P9:41:13 <Jat> lol
P9:41:16 <PuyoDead> anything short of that is worthless
P9:41:19 <Daidoji> 42 etc
P9:41:25 <Wolfram> After the research I did, I'm totally opposed to them.
P9:41:25 <Daidoji> well that's the answer
P9:41:30 <Daidoji> that's not the question.
P9:41:32 <mib_44pc7q> it worked, I appreciate the help

P9:42:11 <Wolfram> I mean, SOUP KITCHENS help a lot of people, but they don't corrupt any.
P9:42:16 <Wolfram> I'd say that's a distinguishing trait.
P9:42:22 <Daidoji> they're only still going because of a few hollywood elite
P9:42:33 <Daidoji> honestly if they didn't get a few back in the 70's they'd have died out
P9:42:34 <Wolfram> Incorrect. Scientology is RICH, man.
P9:42:37 <PuyoDead> that and the fact that they take in so much money
P9:42:39 <Adura> It helped Will Smith become a star.
P9:42:40 <Wolfram> Probably BECAUSE of the elite, then again.
P9:42:48 <Jat> lol on mibbit everyone elses icon on the users list has brown hair but your own icon has blond hair
P9:42:53 <Wolfram> But if they lost their backing in Hollywood now?
P9:42:57 <Wolfram> They'd still be filthy rich.
P9:43:08 <Sanjuaro> Sorry for the bother but does anyone in here use Osici's Minecraft Editor?
P9:43:14 <PuyoDead> I do San
P9:43:16 <Wolfram> Only sparingly.
P9:43:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hold on, I'm looking
P9:43:38 <Daidoji> if tom cruise came out and denounced them and appoligized for all his crazy behavior they'd pretty much cease to exist
P9:43:38 <Sanjuaro> I'm having some trouble with it, I've worked awhile on a map but for some reason it isn't saving.
P9:43:48 <Daidoji> but that's not gonna happen
P9:44:01 <PuyoDead> that still wouldn't bring them down
P9:44:09 <Daidoji> I mean if tom denounced them as much as he praised them
P9:44:12 <PuyoDead> they're entirely too large for that to do anything
P9:44:27 <Wolfram> The problem is that hollywood won't touch them
P9:44:30 <Daidoji> they're not that large
P9:44:30 <PuyoDead> a cult, is a cult, is a cult. it's the mindset
P9:44:32 <Wolfram> No one big will, and I'll tell you why
P9:44:32 <Adura> I'll never make a joke about online groups again, ror.
P9:44:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> DAMN... Can't find it
P9:44:45 <Wolfram> Because when you attack scientology in public
P9:44:48 <Daidoji> they'res more moon people in the us than scientologists
P9:44:49 <Wolfram> They sue you
P9:44:49 <Jat> lol adura did you start this?
P9:44:58 <Adura> "Scientology doesn't stand a chance against them, ultimately.", yes.
P9:45:04 <Wolfram> They CREATE cases out of thin air
P9:45:04 <Jat> haha
P9:45:10 <Wolfram> And bring your credibility into question

P9:45:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> hurrah
P9:45:32 <Daidoji> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonies
P9:45:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> I guess I'll have to paraphrase... There was a redditor who had an insane friend ready to commit suicide.  The friend discovered scientology, got what is pretty much equivalent to paid therapy.  He doesn't really believe in the thetans shit, but it gave him a leg to stand on in a hard time, and he's probably living today because of it
P9:45:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm not saying scientology is good
P9:45:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm for eliminating it
P9:45:48 <PuyoDead> Sanjuaro, is it larger than the standard size?

P9:45:52 <Wolfram> I could save you today and kill you tomorrow.
P9:45:55 <Adura> It's a crutch, gotcha.
P9:45:56 <Wolfram> That wouldn't really improve my case.
P9:46:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> But you can't just throw on blanket statements about EVERY individual case
P9:46:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, don't bullshit me
P9:46:12 <Wolfram> I can speak generally.
P9:46:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> show me evidence that scientology killed someone
P9:46:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> please do
P9:46:18 <PuyoDead> yea, but... ANY therapy could have done that
P9:46:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Killed, directly
P9:46:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, agreed, but he didn't look for any therapy
P9:46:30 <Wolfram> Yeah, let me pull up my murder file. However
P9:46:36 <Adura> Someone is going to link that ytmnd.
P9:46:37 <Wolfram> I'll get you some evidence on their negative shit, hold on.
P9:46:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> what's the point in arguing ffff
P9:46:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, credible source
P9:46:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Reuters, Times, AP, BBC
P9:46:54 <PuyoDead> AK47's did great for saving the lives of the people holding them, too
P9:46:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's all I accept these days

P9:47:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> lulz
P9:47:20 <Sanjuaro> PuyoDead it's 255x255x255.
P9:47:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, Reddit is very very biased and hivemind
P9:47:28 <Adura> Twas a joke, heh.
P9:47:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> It happens to be exactly how I think, so it works
P9:47:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P9:47:38 <PuyoDead> whoa, that's probably why, San. did you run it with a higher memory limit
P9:47:42 <Daidoji> lisa mcpherson?
P9:47:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> fox news is best news
P9:47:44 <Adura> Consider most of my lines to be humour.
P9:47:49 <Daidoji> pretty sure they killed her.
P9:47:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Will do
P9:48:01 <Wolfram> Here's a harassment case: http://www.factnet.org/Scientology/harassment_backfire.html
P9:48:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, credible source
P9:48:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's true they do harass people
P9:48:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> <AlLnAtuRalX> Reuters, Times, AP, BBC
P9:48:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> <PuyoDead> AK47's did great for saving the lives of the people holding them, too
P9:48:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> <AlLnAtuRalX> that's all I accept these days
P9:48:20 <Wolfram> Read for yourself.
P9:48:29 <Daidoji> insert joke about how the catholic church killed millions of jews
P9:48:35 <PuyoDead> either way, I absolutely refuse to give Scientology any credit
P9:48:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's a bit extremist PuyoDead 
P9:48:44 <Wolfram> You want something from Times?
P9:48:45 <Wolfram> Hold
P9:48:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> me too!
P9:48:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> I hate them too, but surely, exceptions must be made
P9:48:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> i refuse to give any credit!
P9:49:01 <PuyoDead> they manipulate people, on a grand scale
P9:49:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, absolutely
P9:49:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> i refuse! refuse!
P9:49:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> so does every other fucking corporation and for-profit institution
P9:49:18 <PuyoDead> the exceptions are so small in context
P9:49:28 <Daidoji> but see that's the difference
P9:49:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can't hate them all
P9:49:37 <Daidoji> they pretend to be a church
P9:49:37 <PuyoDead> all the people? of course not
P9:49:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> No PuyoDead all the organizations
P9:49:47 <PuyoDead> those are all the poor suckers
P9:49:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Corporations, if you will
P9:49:49 <Daidoji> microsfot doesn't pretend to be a religion
P9:49:59 <Daidoji> so....spelling
P9:50:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  They still manipulate people
P9:50:11 <Wolfram> AlLnAtuRalX, forgive me when I say this, but
P9:50:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are 100s of sites about Microsoft's wrongdoings, lies, monopolistic practices
P9:50:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> i am microsfot mind control unit
P9:50:19 <Daidoji> but they're straight forward about it
P9:50:20 <Wolfram> You strike me as a man who just can't stand to be wrong
P9:50:21 <PuyoDead> well, a pretty good chunk of the people running those things are probably trying to be good people
P9:50:22 <Daidoji> scientology is sneaky.

P9:51:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> a credible source was a prerequisite
P9:51:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, you're a little hive-mind

P9:51:26 <PuyoDead> wow, that was quick

P9:57:33 <Wolfram> Must be losing my edge
P9:57:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> edge
P9:57:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> go drink some coffee
P9:57:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I also hate Christianity, Judaism, Islam...
P9:57:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> edge
P9:57:42 <Wolfram> Oh, wait!
P9:57:43 <PuyoDead> not really, is was more possitive for you
P9:57:44 <Wolfram> I get it!
P9:57:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> langdell
P9:57:58 <Wolfram> Cock the ol' dogleg up, pew pew, right
P9:58:05 <PuyoDead> there ya go
P9:58:20 <Wolfram> Technically there are two animals in my name
P9:58:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> wonder if there's a #debate channel
P9:58:24 <Wolfram> But I have no idea how a ram pisses
P9:58:32 <PuyoDead> much the same, I'd guess
P9:58:58 <PuyoDead> Natural, I do have to admit, I'm a bit biased towards "religious" organizations, and just the cult mindset in general
P9:58:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> wolframaplha?
P9:59:07 <Wolfram> No Alpha.
P9:59:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Just click #debate for a #debate channel...
P9:59:13 <Wolfram> Where do people keep getting that?
P9:59:28 <PuyoDead> the same place they get "pyro" for my name?
P9:59:36 <Wolfram> No, I think it's a totally different person.
P9:59:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, wolframalpha.com
P9:59:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> nah, it's funny calling you that for some reason
P9:59:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Computational knowledge engine Wolfram 
P10:00:05 <Wolfram> Oh, right. I think I read about that.
P10:00:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> suuure you did
P10:00:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram.com : Wolfram is the company behind them
P10:00:33 <Wolfram> I did. Brother stumbled it to me
P10:00:34 <PuyoDead> so... we done here? everything out of our systems?
P10:00:39 <Wolfram> Presumably because he knows I use this name
P10:00:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> alpha is the government conspiracy behind them
P10:00:46 <Wolfram> How old are they? I hadn't heard of them previously
P10:00:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what
P10:00:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, few months
P10:00:58 <Wolfram> So fairly new, I see.
P10:00:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> wolfram|alpha that is
P10:01:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> wolfram is a bit older
P10:01:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Hey you guys, anyone know a non-computer-intensive, action-oriented dungeon-crawling game that's free?
P10:01:04 <Wolfram> That's what I meant.
P10:01:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> that is, the company behind wolfram|alpha
P10:01:14 <Wolfram> Yes, I think I do.
P10:01:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> :/
P10:01:21 <Wolfram> Try Wayfarer. It's in alpha, though
P10:01:25 <Wolfram> Browser based
P10:01:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Wolfram...
P10:01:30 <vdgmprgrmr> and Hart.
P10:01:42 <Wolfram> Was never a huge daytime vampire show fan
P10:01:48 <Wolfram> Pop culture vampires, etc.
P10:02:06 <Wolfram> Oh, you might try Nethack
P10:02:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> they suck etc
P10:02:11 <Wolfram> IF that qualifies for action
P10:02:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Not nethack.
P10:02:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I hate nethack.
P10:02:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Too complex.
P10:02:31 <Wolfram> Really? Well, no
P10:02:32 <Wolfram> I admit that
P10:02:38 <Wolfram> It takes some getting used to.
P10:02:49 <Wolfram> Well, Wayfarer is very simple by comparison, but is a roguelike in the same vein.
P10:03:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I can't stand roguelikes that are complex.
P10:03:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I've never heard pf Wayfarer.
P10:03:17 <Wolfram> Hold on and I'll link you.
P10:03:23 <Wolfram> Bear in mind that it's not finished in the least.
P10:03:33 <Wolfram> http://benhem.com/games/wayfarer/
P10:03:36 <vdgmprgrmr> But I'm not really looking for a roguelike, I already have Rogue, and it satisfies me in the roguelike area.
P10:03:41 <Wolfram> I really hope that fellow finishes it.
P10:03:55 <Wolfram> Action-y dungeon crawler, not hardware intensive...
P10:03:56 <Wolfram> Diablo 2?
P10:04:07 <PuyoDead> if it were free
10P10:04:11 * Spazzo (spazzo@CPE0022b0ca43d8-CM0011ae04842a.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #minecraft
P10:04:14 <PuyoDead> were? was?
P10:04:16 <PuyoDead> I dunno
P10:04:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> everything is free
P10:04:20 <Wolfram> Free to play online.
P10:04:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> free will
P10:04:25 <Wolfram> Have to purchase the game, technically
P10:04:32 <Wolfram> But I've never been above a little piracy.
P10:04:44 <PuyoDead> I figured that's what he meant by free
P10:04:49 <PuyoDead> but *shrug*
P10:05:13 <Wolfram> You could wait for Diablo 3 which I think will be excellent, but it'll be hard on a weaker machine.
P10:05:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'd give you 5 dollars towards a new PC...
P10:06:20 <Wolfram> You could take a look at the older Fallout game, too.
P10:06:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fallout 2 > 1
P10:06:29 <Wolfram> Controls are sort of clunky, though.
P10:06:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> and 3 I guess
P10:06:45 <Wolfram> I didn't like 2; the whole beginning naked with a spear thing threw me off.
P10:06:49 <Wolfram> 3 was excellent, though.
P10:06:55 <Wolfram> Different type of game though, really.
P10:06:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Three was a little to action-focused
P10:06:59 <PuyoDead> I really, really need to play fallout 3
P10:07:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not as free-roaming... Still open, but not AS open
P10:07:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which ruined it for me... The graphics are nice though
P10:07:19 <Jat> hey vggmprgrmr have you tried the doom roguelike?
P10:07:25 <PuyoDead> I think I died on the rate of once every minute in fallout 2 at the start
P10:07:28 <Wolfram> Valid point on action focus; it's different from the early games. Radically
P10:07:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm still reeling form the Bethesda - id purchase
P10:07:49 <Wolfram> But any fan of the Elder Scrolls titles NEEDS to play Fallout 3.
P10:08:03 <Jat> bethesda purchased id?
P10:08:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah they did Jat
P10:08:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> yuh huh
P10:08:16 <Wolfram> I'm glad to hear that, actually. It's news to me
P10:08:16 <Jat> i thought i remember hearing something about that
P10:08:31 <Jat> maybe carmacks decided to sell it and then go start a new company
P10:08:31 <Wolfram> Elevating the skills of the id team to a broader market is a good thing
P10:08:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh my god this computer is a piece of shit.
P10:08:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Glad?  I just hope the open source projects don't get derailed
P10:08:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's all
P10:08:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> One of the reasons I love id
P10:09:02 <Wolfram> A potential negative, you're right
P10:09:05 <Wolfram> Still, not all bad
P10:09:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I hope not Wolfram, Bethesday says they won't dick around in id's business
P10:09:41 <Wolfram> I don't honestly know a lot about Bethesda's policies
P10:09:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> All I know is the article I read
P10:09:57 <Wolfram> But if I had to pick a side, I'd guess them to honor that statement before I'd condemn them to violate it
P10:10:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Can't play Wayfarer.
P10:10:11 <Wolfram> No?
P10:10:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> g'night
P10:10:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Gnight Angrybanana 
P10:10:28 <Wolfram> Later, Beta
P10:10:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> AnnihilatorBeta, 
P10:10:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope.
P10:10:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh yay
P10:10:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Not even with 3d mode turned off.
P10:10:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> people are actually saying good night to me
P10:10:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> well, bye
P10:10:54 <Wolfram> Lands, man
P10:10:56 <Wolfram> What are you running?
12P10:10:57 * AnnihilatorBeta (OverwatchF@bas1-toronto48-1242461302.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: <3)
P10:11:32 <vdgmprgrmr> I told you. A piece of shit. The thing is a turd with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor attached.
P10:11:32 <Wolfram> That probably rules Diablo 2 out.
P10:11:46 <Wolfram> Maybe even D1. Good god
P10:11:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, I'll donate you $5
P10:11:56 <Wolfram> I really don't know what to tell you other than "Try Nethack again."
P10:12:07 <vdgmprgrmr> This isn't my computer.
P10:12:09 <Wolfram> I assure you this
P10:12:14 <vdgmprgrmr> It's my grandparents' computer.
P10:12:15 <Wolfram> If you can get into Nethack, it's rewarding
P10:12:18 <vdgmprgrmr> And they are retards.
P10:12:25 <Wolfram> And if you can beat it, god
P10:12:29 <Wolfram> THAT is a feeling
P10:12:44 <fydo> holy crap, I can only dream of beating nethack
P10:13:00 <Wolfram> I ascended a tourist, but I had to spoil heavily
P10:13:03 <Wolfram> Much to my chagrin
P10:13:04 <vdgmprgrmr> I've tried to get into nethack, but it just feels so... bland.
P10:13:07 <PuyoDead> my god, nethack has a splendid time of smacking me around
P10:13:11 <Wolfram> They say it can't be beaten without spoiling
P10:13:24 <Jat> vdg if you like simple roguelikes try the doom roguelike
P10:13:26 <Wolfram> Tell me this: do you play it with the graphical interface?
P10:13:29 <Jat> its fun and sort of has action
P10:13:30 <Wolfram> Or do you look at the matrix
P10:13:34 <Jat> and is pretty simple
P10:13:39 <Jat> since its doom and all
P10:13:40 <vdgmprgrmr> No, no graphical interface.
P10:13:42 <PuyoDead> I've been more of one to play my DS lately
P10:13:49 <Wolfram> The interface may help your experience dramatically
P10:13:56 <Wolfram> And if you need a bigger dose than 2D tiles
P10:13:58 <Wolfram> Try Falcon's Eye
P10:14:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm turned off by all the stuff in it. Not by the graphics.
P10:14:09 <Jat> oh
P10:14:16 <Wolfram> Oh, well I suppose there's no helping it, then.
P10:14:18 <Jat> nevermind then i guess
P10:14:20 <Wolfram> A pity, though.
P10:14:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, you just bored?
P10:14:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> read http://419eater.com/html/letters.htm
P10:14:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's great...
P10:14:40 <Wolfram> I was a DS man until recently, PuyoDead
P10:14:48 <Wolfram> Lots of PSP lately
P10:14:54 <PuyoDead> ahh, I've got both, myself
P10:14:54 <vdgmprgrmr> It's like, deities and classes and tons of different monsters and... it all just kind of mushes together to become a vomit-like mixture.
P10:14:57 <Wolfram> Same
P10:15:11 <PuyoDead> find myself spending more time playing real games on DS, but more emulation on PSP
P10:15:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, you consider going text-based?
P10:15:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or is that too oldschool/
P10:15:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, You play Deus Ex?
P10:15:31 <Wolfram> Well, both my handhelds are modified
P10:15:31 <vdgmprgrmr> I've played Deus Ex.
P10:15:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> So play it some more
P10:15:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P10:15:38 <Wolfram> So I have trouble sticking to one title on either machine
P10:15:42 <Wolfram> Deus Ex is good
P10:15:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nothing better than Deus Ex
P10:15:47 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't like text-games generally.
P10:15:54 <PuyoDead> yea, same here. well, the DS isn't "technically" modified, of course
P10:16:06 <Wolfram> Right. R4, M3? Cyclo?
P10:16:11 <PuyoDead> AK2i
P10:16:14 <PuyoDead> had a cyclo
P10:16:25 <PuyoDead> well, still ahve it, just don't really use it
P10:16:26 <Wolfram> Never heard of the AK. R4, myself
P10:16:30 <PuyoDead> have rather
P10:16:49 <Jat> you want a roguelike with graphics and actions but not too complicated?
P10:16:53 <PuyoDead> acekard. AK2i is one of the few to work on a dsi
P10:17:01 <PuyoDead> your is an older r4, right?
P10:17:02 <Wolfram> Oho, acekard
P10:17:08 <Wolfram> Ahh...let's see
P10:17:09 <Jat> vdg
P10:17:12 <Wolfram> Purchased last year, definitely
P10:17:20 <PuyoDead> by older, I just mean a few years at most
P10:17:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't care about graphics, really.
P10:17:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> You have the dis PuyoDead ?
P10:17:26 <Wolfram> Graphics may not necessarily be his issue, Jat
P10:17:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> dsi*
P10:17:27 <Wolfram> Yeah
P10:17:28 <PuyoDead> ok, that sounds good, then
P10:17:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Is the camera worth it?
P10:17:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> To upgrade I mean
P10:17:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I mean.. losing GameBoy compatibility... That's difficult
P10:17:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm looking for mindless action plus dungeon crawling.
P10:17:51 <PuyoDead> well, the camera is more of a "hey, here's something else!" thing
P10:17:59 <Wolfram> Yeah, I'd avoid the DSi
P10:18:05 <PuyoDead> the DSi is more than twice as powerful as the DS
P10:18:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've seen people taking pictures with it in the middle of NYC PuyoDead 
P10:18:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> so it can't be *that* bad
P10:18:17 <PuyoDead> so, right now it's kind of a moot point
P10:18:21 <Wolfram> When they modify it, I'd be happy to upgrade
P10:18:27 <PuyoDead> but once DSi only games start to trickle out, it'll show
P10:18:33 <Wolfram> I have no qualms about stealing from Nintendo
P10:18:40 <Wolfram> Sick of their peripheral gimmicks
P10:18:44 <Jat> vdg have you ever played shiren the wanderer?
P10:18:48 <Wolfram> OH
P10:18:52 <Wolfram> EXCELLENT SUGGESTION
P10:18:58 <Wolfram> Vehemently advocate that game
P10:18:59 <PuyoDead> oh man, shiren
P10:19:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe...
P10:19:21 <Wolfram> Roguelike. Easy to pick up
P10:19:25 <Wolfram> Unforgiving but expansive
P10:19:32 <Wolfram> Ported to DS, I believe, originally SNES
P10:19:34 <Wolfram> So you could emulate
P10:19:41 <Jat> this http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=shiren
P10:19:42 <Wolfram> Might have to find a translation .ips though
P10:19:56 <PuyoDead> so yea, Natural, for now the DSi is more of an early adoption thing
P10:20:17 <PuyoDead> but later on, when it becomes the new Gameboy Color, it'll be a must
P10:20:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Cool
P10:20:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hopefully the price will go down also
P10:21:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Not much a fan of emulation.
P10:21:07 <PuyoDead> there haven't been any DSi only games yet, but there are some DSi "enhanced" ones slowing making it out
P10:21:15 <Jat> why not vdg?
P10:21:17 <PuyoDead> not much of a... what? how is this?
P10:21:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Or asian-influenced things.
P10:21:25 <Jat> oh
P10:21:38 <PuyoDead> what?
P10:21:41 <Wolfram> Wow, haha
P10:21:43 <Jat> what about diablo? thats a mindless dungeon crawl with lots of action
P10:21:45 <Wolfram> That's...pretty broad
P10:21:51 <Wolfram> I don't think his machine will handle it, Jat
P10:21:57 <Jat> oh yeah i forgot
P10:21:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm a very picky person.
P10:22:08 <Wolfram> That may be part of your problem, to be honest.
P10:22:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, do you work?
P10:22:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Get a new computer, damn it!
P10:22:17 <PuyoDead> oh, Wolfram, if you're a fan of complex games, give Knights in the Nightmare a shot
P10:22:21 <Wolfram> He has a good one.
P10:22:23 <vdgmprgrmr> And this piece of crap could probably run Diablo, but I never liked Diablo either.
P10:22:32 <Wolfram> That's his grandparent's machine
P10:22:36 <vdgmprgrmr> And as I said, this isn't my computer.
P10:22:38 <Wolfram> Knight in the Nightmare, you say?
P10:22:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, play flash games
P10:22:49 <PuyoDead> yea, very good game, but amazingly complex
P10:22:58 <Wolfram> You know, I can think of another dungeon crawler I sampled recently
P10:23:06 <Wolfram> Not really to my taste but since yours is fairly opposite
P10:23:08 <Wolfram> I'll link you
P10:23:12 <Jat> oh hey cool finally someone else besides me who doesnt like diablo too much
P10:23:31 <Wolfram> http://www.kongregate.com/games/garin/monsters-den
P10:23:32 <Wolfram> There.
P10:23:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jat, I hate all Blizzard games
P10:23:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not hate
P10:23:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> but
P10:23:53 <Wolfram> HATE EH
P10:23:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't know... They do weird things to people
P10:23:58 <vdgmprgrmr> OH MY GOD I CAN HARDLY FUCKING RUN INTERNET EXPLORER
P10:24:06 <Wolfram> Good lord
P10:24:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Look at WoW and Starcraft
P10:24:10 <Jat> why are you using internet explorer?
P10:24:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> vdgmprgrmr, why would you want to?
P10:24:21 <Wolfram> WoW is addictive, but I blame the players, not the company
P10:24:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Trust me, I don't want to.
P10:24:35 <Wolfram> It does what it does well, that's why people like it so much. It's not for me, but as they say
P10:24:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, it is designed to be that way though
P10:24:37 <Wolfram> Different strokes
P10:24:42 <Wolfram> Well, of course it is
P10:24:44 <PuyoDead> hey! Rock n' Roll Racing was a Blizzard game!
P10:24:46 <Wolfram> They make money on subs
P10:24:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's the casino of gaming
P10:24:50 <PuyoDead> you better not hate that
P10:24:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Keep putting money in...
P10:24:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, why would I?
P10:25:06 <PuyoDead> you said you didn't like all blizzard games
P10:25:07 <vdgmprgrmr> But I know my grandparents'll get all crotchety if their internet looks different suddenly, and I don't want to deal with that trouble.
P10:25:10 <Wolfram> But that's no basis for condemnation; most online games do it these days.
P10:25:13 <Jat> they also made the lost vikings didnt they?
P10:25:17 <PuyoDead> yup
P10:25:23 <Wolfram> Lost Vikings, my god
P10:25:26 <Wolfram> That's a blast from the past
P10:25:52 <Jat> lol uninstall furefox it when youre done with it vdg... or just hide it so theyll never find it and they can keep using ie
P10:25:53 <PuyoDead> oh yea, Wolf, as for knights in the nightmare... it's a bit of SRPG, mixed with a shooter. as in, shoot 'em up
P10:25:58 <PuyoDead> if that even makes sense
P10:26:10 <Wolfram> Doesn't at all, but makes it all the more intriguing
P10:26:15 <PuyoDead> yea, exactly

P10:28:23 <Wolfram> Riviera wasn't really my cup o' tea
P10:28:26 <vdgmprgrmr> According to the internet, Knights in the Nightmare is "a tactical bullet-hell RPG"
P10:28:32 <Wolfram> And neither does this appear to be, to my chagrin
P10:28:32 <PuyoDead> well then, you're in luck
P10:28:37 <PuyoDead> it plays absolutely nothing like it
P10:28:38 <Jat> sounds like manic shmup
P10:28:45 <Jat> i dont really like manic shumps very much
P10:28:49 <Wolfram> Oh, no, that much is apparent
P10:28:57 <Wolfram> Riviera was a role player on rails
P10:29:07 <Wolfram> With the odd minigame
P10:29:08 <Zach_> My problem is outlined here http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=767
P10:29:09 <PuyoDead> it's shmup in the sense that you have to doge things
P10:29:36 <Jat> oh
P10:30:08 <Wolfram> Sorry, Zach_; that's outside my expertise
P10:30:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Fuck it. I'll make my own.
P10:30:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zach_, are you sure it's the right Internal IP?
P10:30:37 <Jat> cool
P10:30:44 <Jat> youre really gonna make one vdg?
P10:30:46 <Zach_> Internal IP?
P10:30:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Why the hell not, eh?
P10:30:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> 192.168.0.100
P10:30:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> or 192.168.1.100
P10:30:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> whatever that box says
P10:31:05 <Zach_> Oh, right
P10:31:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> you dont need to gray it out; it's your internal not external IP
P10:31:09 <UnknownX> oh... did i forget to exit off of this when i went to sleep?

P10:31:17 <PuyoDead> whoa... http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/nacl000000fd

P10:31:23 <Jat> if it turns out good post about it on the forums or something vdg
P10:31:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zach_, what operating system
P10:31:28 <Zach_> Like .101 or .100 and .102

P10:36:27 <Jat> i was wondering where you were :o
P10:36:31 <Jat> ]i think its port is closed
P10:36:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yay Zach_ 
P10:36:35 <thealexray> it's just i haven't been able to connect
P10:36:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Put that into the box
P10:36:42 <Redshift> yeah might be the port

P10:39:46 <thealexray> even usenet needed maintenece
P10:39:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> I went on vacation for 3 months last summer
P10:39:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> had 11 quake 3 servers
P10:39:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> None of em went down (all fine)
P10:40:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> I didn't even check in once for 3 months
P10:40:11 <Wolfram> Spare me your devil-talk
P10:40:14 <thealexray> let me ask a question
P10:40:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> yesss?
P10:40:38 <thealexray> were those quake 3 severs using java archetecture?
P10:40:47 <thealexray> because im pretty sure they werent
P10:40:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> thealexray, no, but what difference does it make?
P10:40:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it's not java architecture
P10:40:56 <Wolfram> That's a good point I failed to make
P10:40:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> java's a language
P10:41:10 <thealexray> yes
P10:41:14 <thealexray> it is a language
P10:41:15 <Wolfram> I think what's he's saying is it would be easier to exploit Minecraft than to exploit Quake 3
P10:41:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only reason my MC server ever crashed was a player-limit but, which I squashed
P10:41:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, nonsense
P10:41:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Java is one of the most secure languages
P10:41:29 <Jat> i think by architecture he means the virtual machine and stuff
P10:41:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> it sandboxes everything...
P10:41:35 <Wolfram> Don't talk to me
P10:41:37 <Wolfram> It's his case
P10:41:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh
P10:41:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> you're just clarifying? I see
P10:41:51 <Wolfram> Assuming, really
P10:42:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> thealexray, most big corporations I know use Java for processes on their important servers... their uptimes are measured in years
P10:42:40 <thealexray> you realize that most multi crashes are caused by shitty netcode and not by malicious intent and that java is rife with shitty netcode and that one of the things that carmak optomized from the first was the netcode
P10:43:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?  Java?  Shitty netcode?  Does not compute, sorry... w/e I'm not getting into another one of these

P10:43:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't know... Most Wall Street Banks use Java
P10:43:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's just from personal experiencce
P10:43:53 <Wolfram> Java is apparently not "type-safe"
P10:43:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> haven't seen other comapnies
P10:43:56 <Wolfram> Whatever that means
P10:44:12 <Wolfram> http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/629/papers/Saraswat-javabug.html
P10:44:16 <Wolfram> For your perusal
P10:44:20 <thealexray> franky i basically use oracle systems
P10:44:26 <thealexray> at my current job
P10:44:51 <Jat> thats an article from 1997 wolfram...
P10:44:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol was about to say that
P10:45:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's okay, computers don't change in 12 years
P10:45:33 <Jat> time to get back to my ASM!
P10:45:33 <Wolfram> Haha, I just googled and linked
P10:45:45 <Wolfram> Still looking because I have no idea about it at all
P10:45:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram just wants to contradict me
P10:45:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> he probably looked for Java security flaw or something
P10:45:53 <Wolfram> Spare me your petty presumptions
P10:45:56 <Wolfram> I want to know for myself
P10:45:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P10:45:58 <Wolfram> No more
P10:46:15 <Wolfram> I googled "How safe is java"
P10:46:24 <Wolfram> Because as I've stated previously
P10:46:27 <Wolfram> I don't know anything about it
P10:46:59 <thealexray> almost all of the architecture i work with these days is peoplesoft or oracle lol
P10:47:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> Java is a piece of shit on the web... everyone knows that (besides the cross-platform), but it is exceptionally robust for server applications
P10:47:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wasn't peoplesoft bought by Oracle or something?
P10:47:35 <thealexray> yes
P10:47:58 <thealexray> but peoplesoft uses its own architecture still
P10:48:02 <Jat> doesnt oracle havea  reputation for being crappy? not that i would know or anything so im just asking
P10:48:15 <PuyoDead> Wolfram, oh, and in case you're curious why I asked, and if you didn't know already, I asked about your R4 because the market is saturated with replicas now
P10:48:33 <PuyoDead> hate to see someone have one bust up their DS or something ridiculous
P10:48:34 <thealexray> for example i work for CUNY which acquired a contract with peoplesoft
P10:48:50 <thealexray> but now works with oracle on a corporate level but still uses peoplesoft archetecture
P10:49:15 <Wolfram> Well, this article I just read states that java was designed ground-up with security in mind
P10:49:20 <Wolfram> And that it is therefore very solid
P10:49:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly Wolfram 
P10:49:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Java gets a bad rep for some reason
P10:49:40 <Wolfram> I'd have to gather some more evidence, of course
P10:49:45 <Wolfram> But that's one argument in favor of
P10:49:48 <Wolfram> Also, PuyoDead
P10:49:58 <Wolfram> Hadn't heard that, but thankfully mine appears to be genuine
P10:50:32 <thealexray> what companies do yall work for if you can say?
P10:50:43 <Wolfram> Not applicable in my case
P10:50:46 <Jat> i personally do not like java mainly because i hate programming in it
P10:50:51 <Jat> i find it very unpleasant
P10:50:52 <PuyoDead> ok, good
P10:51:17 <PuyoDead> someone asked me recently if they should get an R4, and I had to tell them not to
P10:51:19 <Jat> in fact from what ive seen everything about java is actually quite great except for the language itself... in my opinion...
P10:51:27 <Wolfram> I'm not a fan of programming in general, really
P10:51:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> The syntax is a bitch Jat
P10:51:34 <Wolfram> Yeah, I don't blame you, PuyoDead
P10:51:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> anyway, I'll brb
P10:51:36 <Wolfram> If that's the case
P10:51:43 <thealexray> nobody is willing to disclose their company, huh?
P10:51:51 <Wolfram> I'm not sure there ARE any other companies

P10:59:28 <Wolfram> There's a game I was told to watch out for coming up for DS
P10:59:30 <PuyoDead> oh, speaking of... if you do play that, prepare for a mountain of tutorials

P10:59:38 <PuyoDead> scribble... oh
P10:59:40 <Wolfram> I would expect as much from a game called complex

P11:00:42 <PuyoDead> well, there was a part where someone needed to move a whale back into the ocean
P11:00:43 <Wolfram> Part of me hopes it is, but I just can't swallow it
P11:01:13 <PuyoDead> apparently the devs spent months just entering things from dictionaries, encyclopeias, etc.
P11:01:16 <PuyoDead> so, the whale...
P11:01:42 <PuyoDead> they guy first brought up a forklift, and hauled it back
P11:02:02 <PuyoDead> did it again, but used a shovel to dig under it to drop it in

P11:02:59 <PuyoDead> so far, it sounds like they done a damn fine job
P11:03:01 <Wolfram> Because theoretically, you could just created a "Victory Button"
P11:03:03 <Wolfram> And have done with it
P11:03:08 <Wolfram> Hey, if they deliver, more power to them
P11:03:10 <Wolfram> But that's DS?
P11:03:14 <Wolfram> I didn't know which platform it was.
P11:03:30 <Wolfram> Create a button, not created one
P11:03:33 <PuyoDead> one guy summoned a time machine, went back and got on a dinosaur, then came back and killed some robots with it

P11:03:38 <PuyoDead> yea, DS
P11:03:46 <Wolfram> I saw the time machine, but no dinosaurs
P11:04:04 <Wolfram> So, hold on
P11:04:06 <Wolfram> You have a PSP
P11:04:09 <Wolfram> It's got custom firm
P11:04:10 <PuyoDead> yup
P11:04:18 <Wolfram> Are you big on Final Fantasy Tactics?
P11:04:29 <PuyoDead> very much so
P11:04:38 <Wolfram> Fascinating!
P11:04:40 <PuyoDead> although, the PSP port was a bit disapointing
P11:04:51 <Wolfram> The slowdown was a nuisance, but that was it, really
P11:05:08 <Wolfram> Are you familiar with Xlink?
P11:05:11 <PuyoDead> and although it's purely nostalgia, the new translation kind of through me off
P11:05:17 <PuyoDead> yea, not really used it extensively
P11:05:27 <Daidoji> oh you guys talking about uh
P11:05:29 <Wolfram> I have yet to do any of the cooperative missions is why I ask
P11:05:33 <Daidoji> that drawn together sequel
P11:05:35 <Daidoji> er
P11:05:38 <Daidoji> drawn to life sequel
P11:05:47 <Jat> lol drawn together
P11:05:50 <Wolfram> Is it by those guys? Game seems totally different
P11:05:55 <Daidoji> same guys yes
P11:06:03 <Wolfram> Well then I suppose we are
P11:06:04 <Daidoji> well the original you had to draw things
P11:06:04 <PuyoDead> pretty sure it's not the same people

P11:07:06 <PuyoDead> really?
P11:07:13 <Wolfram> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_to_Life
P11:07:18 <PuyoDead> never saw 5th cell anywhere on drawn to life, odd
P11:07:19 <Wolfram> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts
P11:07:44 <Wolfram> I love wikipedia
P11:07:44 <PuyoDead> interesting
P11:07:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Alright guys
P11:07:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's been fun today
P11:08:04 <Wolfram> Fun if not necessarily productive
P11:08:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Even though I have reason to suspect trolling, I'll still be back tomorrow
P11:08:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P11:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> bye
P11:08:11 <Wolfram> Later

P11:11:23 <PuyoDead> oh yes, so... xlink?
P11:12:49 <Wolfram> Xlink, yes.
P11:13:03 <Wolfram> I've never actually used it, but it's supposed to make ad hoc features possible over wireless internet.
P11:14:05 <PuyoDead> yea, I've wanted to try it for PSP. that is, phantasy star portable
P11:14:18 <Wolfram> I haven't played that yet.
P11:14:28 <Wolfram> I understood it had card-based gameplay?
P11:15:27 <PuyoDead> episode 3 on gamecube did, this one is pretty much straight PSO
P11:16:05 <Wolfram> That's good to know; card based video games deter me
P11:16:21 <Wolfram> You know, come to think of it
P11:16:32 <Wolfram> The image I downloaded failed to read, that's what stalled me on PSP
P11:17:59 <PuyoDead> weird. I actually bought it, and made an image myself, so I don't know what could have been up with the out in the wild

P11:18:55 <Wolfram> Yeah, no telling.
P11:19:09 <Wolfram> I get my images from a specific place, and that's the only time I've had one seize up on me.
P11:19:10 <Wonton> Does anyone know any way to fix a java fatal error 7?
P11:19:20 <Wolfram> Outside my expertise, Wonton.
P11:19:41 <Wonton> Any way to contact NotcH?
P11:20:23 <Parthon> by email
P11:20:48 <Nalok> I can't sleep and it's 12:20 what the fuck should I do :/?
P11:21:26 <Wolfram> Do you need to be up tomorrow?

P11:28:28 <Nalok> ...No
P11:28:29 <Nalok> :D
P11:29:33 <Wolfram> Haha. In that case, don't worry about it.
P11:29:39 <Wolfram> Make something to eat and watch a movie or something.
P11:29:53 <Wolfram> Reading usually calms me down to the point of sleeping.
P11:30:03 <Wolfram> And it helps to have white noise present. Fan blowing, etc.
P11:30:14 <Wolfram> Constants only; erratic noises keep you awake
P11:30:26 <Wolfram> Such as radio or television. And if you do sleep to those, you won't become as rested
P11:30:36 <Wolfram> Your mind continues to track them
P11:31:43 <PuyoDead> when I was younger, waiting for the bus in the mornings (still inside, that is) I used to watch G.I.Joe
P11:32:00 <PuyoDead> thing is, I was of course still tired, and would almost always fall asleep
P11:32:57 <PuyoDead> but I always heard all the dialog still, and every single friggin' time, I would have dreams with the speaking and sound effects, but my mind made up everything else
P11:33:33 <PuyoDead> never made a damn bit of sense, and it was always weird to wake up near the end, and see what the episode was really about
P11:39:25 <Nalok> One time I stayed up until 7 AM :|
P11:39:43 <Wolfram> I've gone on 24 stints, but they've never been terribly pleasant
P11:40:03 <Wolfram> At some point your body stops trying to tell you to rest and you just plod on relentlessly
P11:40:17 <Wolfram> But then you craaaash

P11:41:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I once remained awake for three days.
P11:41:55 <vdgmprgrmr> It was fucking insane.
P11:41:58 <Wolfram> I don't think I can top that.
P11:42:03 <Wolfram> MAYBE two, but never three
P11:42:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't recommend anyone EVER do that.
P11:42:15 <Wolfram> It's hard to recall. When you go that long without rest it kind of blends together on you
P11:42:52 <Wolfram> I should go play Guild Wars, but I'm suffering a lack of motivation.
P11:43:15 <PuyoDead> I've done the 3 day thing. it really is awful
P11:43:54 <PuyoDead> I actually got to the point of hallucinations
P11:44:00 <vdgmprgrmr> So did I.
P11:44:03 <PuyoDead> not pleasant by any means
P11:44:07 <Wolfram> Three days is when they say that starts.
P11:44:27 <PuyoDead> it was when I was still in high school, and working
P11:45:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I was getting angry at people for crap they didn't do, and me being angry in that state was probably either totally hilarious or gut-wrenchingly sad.
P11:45:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Or both.
P11:45:14 <PuyoDead> hah, yea, sounds about right
P11:45:20 <PuyoDead> I honestly don't remember much of it
P11:45:34 <Wolfram> Must be something akin to inebriated attitude 
P11:45:41 <PuyoDead> well, except the painted lines in the road coming up and whiping the car
P11:45:45 <Wolfram> Back in high school and working
P11:45:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I remember being at my computer for three hours for three days.
P11:45:49 <Wolfram> I know that feeling
P11:46:04 <Wolfram> I've never stayed up on the computer. I can't convince myself to do it for something like that
P11:46:16 <Wolfram> Usually staying up for absurd amounts of time involves a lot of responsibilities
P11:46:51 <vdgmprgrmr> There's no damn way I stayed on that computer for more than three hours, but dammit, three days went by and I was out of my head.
P11:47:18 <Wolfram> Haha.
P11:47:32 <Wolfram> You ever go to sleep during one phase
P11:47:36 <Wolfram> And wake up in the same phase
P11:47:40 <Wolfram> And have no idea what day it is?
P11:47:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P11:48:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Go to sleep, wake up, "ohshi- how long was I asleep?"
P11:48:25 <Wolfram> After one of the aforementioned consciousness marathons I went to sleep as soon as I could
P11:48:29 <Wolfram> Which was about six in the evening
P11:48:36 <Wolfram> And I woke up more than 24 hours later
P11:48:39 <PuyoDead> holy freaking crap. I just joined the 420chan MC server
P11:48:41 <Wolfram> And couldn't even tell where exactly I was
P11:48:57 <PuyoDead> this could be the worst griefing I've ever seen
P11:49:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I found myself under a table in a corner once.
P11:49:04 <Wolfram> I went out in to my living room and asked my room-mate who the president was
P11:49:12 <Wolfram> I've gotta come look now, PuyoDead
P11:49:22 <PuyoDead> this is truely a sight to behold
P11:50:16 <vdgmprgrmr> It's weird, because the table was right up against the wall on two sides, and there was two chairs on each of the remaining sides, and the whole table was behind a big dresser and a bed. (None of the furniture we actually used.)
P11:52:13 <PuyoDead> I just have weird sleeping habits now
P11:57:19 <PuyoDead> I wish I had the map from this server
P11:58:07 <PuyoDead> yea, that was enough for me
P11:58:12 <Wolfram> What a disaster area
