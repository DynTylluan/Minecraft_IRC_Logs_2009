A12:03:21 <Visiiri> Ohai derp
A12:03:22 <Visiiri> guess what
A12:03:26 <derp> hi
A12:03:33 <Visiiri> Wait- I can't tell you in #minecraft. People here don't like it.
A12:03:38 <gordenfreechmen> my friend is about to make our retarded server public
A12:03:38 <derp> =o
A12:03:54 <Aeomin> heh
A12:04:09 <AndrewPH> It's probably going to su- be great.
A12:04:14 <Animator> Dock should really buy the game.
A12:08:28 <gordenfreechmen> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=bd2578d5f9f287cc0ccd11758918d69d
A12:08:30 <gordenfreechmen> magic platforms
A12:08:50 <vede> Yeah, I find it difficult to believe that Dock has been playing since Minecraft was created, like he said on the forums.
A12:09:10 <Skillkills> He has though
A12:09:12 <vede> He may have played around the beginning, maybe, and kind of thought it was interesting.
A12:09:17 <Skillkills> But i cant believe he doesnt have a skin
10A12:09:48 * Griob (Griob@c-24-34-152-40.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:09:52 <vede> I mean, he even came on here and commented on how those servers using the "visitor jail" mechanic was weird.
A12:09:54 <Griob> Hi

A12:10:17 <Skillkills> so?
A12:10:19 <vede> You know, something you would have become accustomed to LONG ago.
A12:10:32 <Skillkills> I hack out..
A12:10:36 <PixelEater> Whats the best dedi host for minecraft servers (reasonable price and lotsa RAM)
A12:10:42 <Skillkills> If the server doesnt have -noclip that is
A12:10:42 <Skillkills> xD
A12:11:02 <Skillkills> I could still hack out even if it did but... meh
A12:11:03 <vurtual> I feel horrible being around during the time of jails being invented, and not stopping it.
A12:11:22 <Visiiri> Ohai vurtual :>
A12:11:28 <vede> Um, a lot of people were around when the spawn prisons were invented.
10A12:11:30 * Griob (Griob@c-24-34-152-40.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:11:44 <vede> Hell, I'm partially responsible for that honeycomb prison method.
A12:11:55 <vurtual> Yeah.
A12:12:05 <vurtual> But I remember being on a server where it was first being used.
A12:12:08 <Visiiri> I'm partially responsible for being able to glitch out >:D
A12:12:17 <vede> So do a lot of people, vurtual.
A12:12:21 <Griob> Ofc hax kinda ruin all that...
A12:12:25 <vurtual> But on the upside I invented watervators.
A12:12:25 <Visiiri> The first spawn jail I was introduced to was a maze
A12:12:41 <Visiiri> Griob: it's optional to allow noclipping now
A12:12:57 <vede> Seriously, you don't need to act like you've been around since forever ago.
A12:13:03 <vurtual> Back in my day we didn't have mazes, we had a small box. They took ages to invent the even still hard to use 1x2
A12:13:17 <Griob> Wow! Shows how much ive been paying attention recently.. :P
A12:13:23 <vede> Back in my day we didn't have goddamn multiplayer.
A12:13:27 <Griob> Vede was that to me?
A12:13:32 <vede> No.
A12:13:33 <derp> http://imgur.com/mzxWK.png =/
A12:13:36 <Visiiri> Oh
A12:13:40 <Griob> Alright...
A12:13:42 <Visiiri> I came about a month later, i think

A12:13:49 <Visiiri> when was multiplayer developed?

A12:14:51 <vede> I dunno, that might be too early.
A12:14:57 <Visiiri> wat
A12:14:59 <Visiiri> a date?
A12:15:00 <Visiiri> o.o
A12:15:03 <vede> Oh.
A12:15:05 <vede> :/
A12:15:07 <vede> No idea.
A12:15:13 <Visiiri> Like, febuary
A12:15:15 <Visiiri> or like june
A12:15:22 <vurtual> June probably.
A12:15:35 <Visiiri> Oh, so I was right in the beginning
A12:15:40 <Visiiri> I came around june 22
A12:15:43 <mail2345> BACK IN MY DAY WE DIDN'T HAVE MINECRAFT
A12:15:47 <Visiiri> and there was multiplayer there
A12:15:55 <vurtual> Because I only started playing after my birthday, and then MP was being worked on a while after.
A12:16:28 <vurtual> Back in my day we had legos.
10A12:16:44 * Saer (Saer@c-68-60-135-121.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:16:56 <Saer> good morning minecrafters!
A12:16:59 <Saer> May I ak you
A12:17:02 <Saer> ask*
A12:17:16 <Saer> do any of you know where to find server hosts? not in tht way
A12:17:31 <Saer> a dedicated hose
A12:17:33 <Saer> host*
A12:17:35 <Saer> excuse me
A12:17:39 <Aeomin> it's everywhere
A12:17:41 <derp> guys?
A12:17:41 <Aeomin> just pay
A12:17:46 <derp> remember my problem? mail?
A12:17:47 <PixelEater> a good one.
A12:17:50 <derp> i figured it out.
A12:17:52 <derp> after 2 hours
A12:17:55 <Saer> :/
A12:17:57 <derp> want to know what was wrong?
A12:17:59 <PixelEater> With reasonable RAM and uptime. oh, and price.
A12:18:03 <Saer> pixel this isnt the place to ask
A12:18:09 <Saer> i am going to go drown myself in a hole
10A12:18:11 * Saer (Saer@c-68-60-135-121.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
A12:18:17 <vede> derp, it wouldn't be that minecraft-server/jar thing, would it?
A12:18:22 <derp> yes.
A12:18:29 <vede> Yeah, that was crazy insanely obvious.
A12:18:35 <vede> Did you seriously miss that?
A12:18:41 <derp> i had to change this; COMMAND = ("java", "-cp", "-Xms512M", "-Xmx512M", "minecraft-server.jar", "com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer")
A12:18:44 <derp> to this; COMMAND = ("java", "-Xms512M", "-Xmx512M", "-cp", "minecraft-server.jar", "com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer")
A12:18:57 <derp> i just had to swap cp and the xms
A12:18:58 <derp> that's it
A12:19:01 <derp> change their positions
A12:19:06 <derp> alter no code just move it around
A12:19:07 <derp> jesus christ
A12:19:08 <AndrewPH> That's your fault then
A12:19:12 <derp> lol.
A12:19:14 <derp> 2 hours for that
A12:19:25 <AndrewPH> It was a user error
A12:19:33 <vede> Those -Xmsblahblah things aren't even necessary.
A12:19:38 <derp> yeah huh
A12:19:41 <derp> i have a big map
A12:19:41 <PixelEater> Anyone know of a good dedi host? With reasonable RAM and uptime. oh, and price.
A12:19:44 <derp> doesn't work without them
A12:19:57 <vurtual> Rogue Squadron used the "castle thunder" sound effect for TIE bomber bombs, and it was also used in the powerpuff girls.
A12:19:58 <vurtual> Mind=blown
A12:20:22 <AndrewPH> mind=watthefuck
A12:20:35 <vurtual> PixelEater, look infront of you. You'll see a computer. I heard it was a pretty good host.

A12:21:41 <vede> vurtual, riiiight, because... everyone has an internet connection up to the task of server-hosting, and everyone ALSO wants their internet connection to be slaughtered by... server-hosting.
A12:21:47 <PixelEater> vurtual, this is an old, piece of crap laptop.
A12:21:57 <mail2345> @derp hrm
A12:21:59 <mail2345> strange
A12:22:02 <PixelEater> vede, I do, but its for the Archives.

A12:22:10 <PixelEater> vede it needs a new server
A12:22:18 <mail2345> also
A12:22:20 <mail2345> i got bored
A12:22:24 <mail2345> made a flatgrass in smacx
A12:22:25 <PixelEater> vede lol, Adam would rather keep the VPS.
A12:22:28 <mail2345> the ai to say the least

A12:22:35 <vurtual> My 512kbit(63 kilobyte is the absolute maximum ever it's gone to) connection can handle an 8-man server without ever noticing anything. Most people have connections waaaay faster.
A12:22:37 <mail2345> is doing interesting behaviours
10A12:22:48 * Mastria|AFK (chatzilla@CPE-69-76-193-144.kc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
A12:22:52 <mail2345> thier bases
A12:22:57 <mail2345> are in a straight line :S
A12:23:10 <PixelEater> vurtual, by 8-man, you mean only you are on. then yes.
A12:23:21 <vurtual> No, 8 people at once.
A12:23:27 <PixelEater> im kidding. lol.
A12:23:36 <vurtual> I had no speed hits, but the server would choke up violently if I really used it all.
A12:23:50 <AndrewPH> vurtual
A12:23:50 <vurtual> mail, don't some drugs do that? Make you do everything in a line?
A12:23:53 <AndrewPH> what's your ingame name
A12:23:57 <vede> vurtual, my connection is far better than yours, and people get disconnected very often.
A12:24:03 <vurtual> Then it isn't better.
A12:24:04 <vede> So I'm going to have to call bullshit on you.
A12:24:13 <vurtual> Your connection is unstable and sucks, not my fault.
A12:24:20 <AndrewPH> My connection is pretty similar to vurtual's and if I use vanilla software people never get disconnected
A12:24:27 <vede> Alright, you know what, vurtual?
A12:24:27 <AndrewPH> with like
A12:24:29 <AndrewPH> twice as many people
12A12:24:37 * Wolfgang (skrwd132@97-113-160-170.tukw.qwest.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A12:24:41 <vurtual> AndrewPH, in 100% of cases or say "VurtualRuler98" is my ingame name for everything.
A12:24:43 <vede> I don't think I've seen you do anything here that couldn't qualify as trolling.
A12:25:18 <AndrewPH> vede what's your ign
A12:25:24 <vede> What?
A12:25:27 <AndrewPH> ingame name
A12:25:33 <vede> vede
A12:26:09 <Aeomin> I ran a server using vanilla software on a 64mb RAM PC 2 months ago
A12:26:17 <AndrewPH> Me too
A12:26:19 <AndrewPH> except uhh
A12:26:21 <AndrewPH> my laptop
A12:26:27 <AndrewPH> 366 mhz single core
A12:26:31 <AndrewPH> 128 mb ram
A12:26:55 <vede> The server doesn't take a massive amount of processing power or RAM, as far as I know.
A12:26:56 <Visiiri> Five lines? You're turning into me and my fail talking.
A12:27:08 <Visiiri> No, but it does suck up internet.
A12:27:22 <Aeomin> it does use like 40MB of RAM
A12:27:27 <Visiiri> If I play Combat Arms, or anything online for that matter, it bugs out.
A12:27:32 <Aeomin> and some processing power for map compression
A12:27:53 <AndrewPH> How many people here have a server that uses 900MB of their ram?
A12:27:57 <PixelEater> Visiiri, is that why you havent been on lately?
A12:27:58 <AndrewPH> All you JTE users should raise your hands
A12:27:59 <AndrewPH> :|
A12:28:50 <AndrewPH> Animator what's your ingame name
A12:29:19 <Aeomin> JTE uses that much?
A12:29:28 <AndrewPH> on a 256^3 map
A12:29:31 <vurtual> Why are you asking us this? Trying to send bounty hunters to delete our player-blocks and push us into pits with no build surface?
A12:29:38 <AndrewPH> on average it's more like 700
A12:29:44 <Visiiri> PixelEater, hehehe, yeah, I got CS:S, HL2, GMOD, L4D2, and $200 nx for Combat Arms.
A12:29:46 <AndrewPH> or 800
A12:29:58 <Aeomin> I don't get why 800MB..
A12:30:07 <AndrewPH> Because jte's not exactly smart
A12:30:20 <AndrewPH> Main example: lol perl
A12:30:36 <Aeomin> well, there are people says it's VERY advanced
A12:30:40 <PuyoDead> Second example: lol selling mah server
A12:30:44 <Aeomin> and took years to develop (dun dun dun)
A12:30:45 <AndrewPH> It's nice and all
A12:30:50 <AndrewPH> but tbh
A12:30:58 <AndrewPH> It's not really worth the RAM consumption
A12:31:08 <AndrewPH> unless you're like me and have an extra gig you never end up using
A12:31:17 <Aeomin> 20mb should be good enough
A12:31:19 <Visiiri> And it takes twenty minutes for it to generate a 64^3 world.
A12:31:22 <Aeomin> for 256^3
A12:31:28 <AndrewPH> Generating is almost instant
A12:31:33 <AndrewPH> loading on the other hand...
A12:31:33 <Visiiri> Not in JTE's
A12:31:37 <AndrewPH> Yes in JTE's
A12:31:42 <Visiiri> It takes a very long time to generate it
A12:31:43 <AndrewPH> using /generate or /new?
A12:31:45 <tentacos> I'd like Notch's server if it had just a few more functions
A12:31:49 <Visiiri> not /new, /generate
A12:31:52 <AndrewPH> oh
A12:31:57 <Visiiri> :P
A12:32:04 <Aeomin> what's difference?
A12:32:06 <AndrewPH> using /generate is very retarded
10A12:32:11 * Evilgrim (evil_grim1@client-82-20-59-81.brnt.adsl.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
A12:32:12 <Visiiri> Yeah, it is.
A12:32:15 <vede> tentacos, like what functions?
A12:32:16 <AndrewPH> normally /new doesn't actually generate a map
A12:32:18 <AndrewPH> unless you mod it
A12:32:21 <AndrewPH> but that would be dumb
A12:32:28 <AndrewPH> It just makes a flat ___
A12:32:35 <AndrewPH> with __ being what you typed in
A12:32:53 <vurtual> Notch's server would be awesome if we had a smooth interface and you didn't need to reload the server for every map.
A12:33:08 <vede> A smooth interface?
A12:33:08 <Visiiri> :< dedicated hosting costs too much
A12:33:11 <AndrewPH> Notch's server will be awesome when he adds in the features custom servers have
A12:33:33 <Visiiri> I hope he doesn't.
A12:33:37 <AndrewPH> I hope he does
A12:33:38 <Visiiri> Then custom servers will advance
A12:33:42 <Visiiri> then notch will advance
A12:33:45 <AndrewPH> They wouldn't be able to advance
A12:33:46 <Visiiri> it will turn into a race
A12:33:48 <vurtual> Instead of the awkward and unreponsive feel that minecraft gives you, and if we didn't have to use cmd to type into the server directly.
A12:33:50 <AndrewPH> Because there would be nothing to add
A12:33:52 <Visiiri> and then the game will be overdone
A12:33:57 <Aeomin> then game itself never improves..
A12:34:11 <vede> vurtual, you really have no idea how a server is supposed to work, do you?
12A12:34:16 * FontPeg (localhost@adsl-234-42-167.jax.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: internet died O_O)
A12:34:30 <vede> And what "awkward unresponsive feel" are you talking about?
A12:34:30 <AndrewPH> vede, well he could at least add an optional gui for people like vurtual
A12:34:47 <vede> Make your own damn GUI, like I did.
A12:34:55 <AndrewPH> does anybody know animator's in game name?
A12:35:00 <vede> It's Animator.
A12:35:03 <AndrewPH> oh k
A12:35:18 <AndrewPH> query me if you want to know why I'm gathering names of certain people
A12:35:38 <Aeomin> certain people eh..
A12:35:59 <tentacos> it'd be nice to have private messaging, fetching, sending players to specific coordinates, and a way to restrict a players ability to change blocks
12A12:36:03 * Foe (chatzilla@c-98-248-47-122.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A12:36:20 <vede> Yeah, those would be good server functions.
A12:36:41 <Aeomin> i still want progressive loading.. =(
A12:36:50 <vede> Private messaging is planned.
A12:37:14 <vurtual> All those fancy features would make everything boring, as we'd be warping and teleporting, we'd have no sense of being only human.
A12:37:36 <vede> vurtual, those are goddamn op functions.
A12:37:40 <vede> Not for standard players.
A12:37:44 <vede> DX
A12:37:50 <gordenfreechmen> Animator
A12:37:54 <AndrewPH> Summoning and multiworld were planned for the official server some time 
A12:38:17 <tentacos> sending players to a specific position would be nice for spawnjails (automatically removing trusted users), but if you could remove a players ability to change anything, it'd be better

A12:40:03 <Animator> Gorden, yes?
A12:40:08 <mail2345> awesome command - /ignore *!*@*
A12:40:10 <mail2345> also guys
A12:40:14 <mail2345> in the current server
A12:40:20 <mail2345> protocol*
A12:40:34 <mail2345> secure private messaging is possibile
A12:40:38 <mail2345> in band
A12:40:49 <Aeomin> custom server?
A12:40:57 <mail2345> erm
A12:41:01 <mail2345> no
A12:41:03 <mail2345> regular server
A12:41:06 <mail2345> and custom client
A12:41:11 <mail2345> okay
A12:41:18 <vede> mail2345, yeah, but not as a function usable as a command.
A12:41:20 <mail2345> use the diffe-hellman key exchange protocol
A12:41:42 <mail2345> @vede clarify?
A12:42:00 <vede> Like, you can't do /privmsg whoever whatever in the server console.
A12:42:28 <mail2345> oh
A12:42:31 <mail2345> you can

13A12:43:16 * PuyoDead slaps mail
A12:43:25 <mail2345> as i said
A12:43:32 <mail2345> basically when a client logs in
A12:43:36 <mail2345> says a magic line
A12:43:45 <mail2345> the server begins to negotiate a key
A12:43:55 <mail2345> which will then encrypt private messages
A12:43:55 <gordenfreechmen> animator did you disconnect too

A12:44:18 <Animator> I did.
A12:44:28 <Animator> Someone's lagging the server.
A12:44:30 <mail2345> the custom client hides messages

A12:45:24 <tentacos> I don't even know how to respond to what you're saying

A12:48:35 <vurtual> Well that sucks.

A12:50:32 <mail2345> @tentacos but that takes out the challange
A12:51:25 <Aeomin> the challenge? make a program that sniff the packet, and connect to another server for chat

A12:51:35 <AndrewPH> yes

13A4:07:29 * ez installing steam
A4:07:32 <PuyoDead> Plus, while it's technically shareware, there is no cripple with it if you let it expire.
A4:07:41 <Marach> mirc has too many buttons and features
A4:07:55 <Roadcrosser> i always dreamed of getting a java coded irc bot that plays interactive fiction
A4:07:57 <Marach> i just want to run and talk
A4:07:58 <PuyoDead> It just asks you to register upon startup, and has a little wait.
A4:08:08 <PuyoDead> Then Mibbit is perfect for you, Marach.
A4:08:13 <Marach> NO
A4:08:15 <Marach> NEVER
A4:08:20 <Roadcrosser> ...
A4:08:29 <Marach> firefox + mibbit = 500 mb memory taken
A4:08:38 <PuyoDead> If mIRC has too many buttons for you, there's not much else to turn to.
A4:08:38 <Marach> thats more that my physical memory now
A4:08:42 <Roadcrosser> mibbit might be considered as on-the-go irc
A4:08:48 <ez> kinda nice sale on steam during the hollidays
A4:08:54 <Roadcrosser> i use it on iphone
A4:09:06 <PuyoDead> Yea, I hope they do it next year, since I currently have $0.00
A4:09:08 <Roadcrosser> i wish i could get a steam

A4:09:18 <AndrewPH> steam is free roadcrosser
A4:09:21 <AndrewPH> the games aren't
A4:09:26 <Roadcrosser> im underaged
A4:09:30 <PuyoDead> Lie?
A4:09:33 <AndrewPH> Steam is still free
A4:09:34 <Roadcrosser> nah
A4:09:42 <AndrewPH> you don't need to be 18 to have a steam account
A4:09:45 <Roadcrosser> i dont lie about my age :/
A4:09:48 <Roadcrosser> no i dont\
A4:09:50 <Marach> mibbit works nicely on iphone
A4:09:52 <Roadcrosser> i need to be 13

A4:10:16 <PuyoDead> Ask your parents. There's nothing "explicit" about Steam itself.
A4:10:18 <Marach> vede: ha
A4:10:31 <PuyoDead> Might as well be a glorified IM client by itself.
A4:10:46 <Roadcrosser> whenever i ask i get a long lecture about a age 'stairs' and theres a step i cant reach yet
A4:10:48 <Marach> oww, Space Quest Collection at 96%...
A4:10:50 <vede> On Linux, in my experience, it depends on how intelligent the devs are.
A4:10:54 <ez> oh, it's so much fun teasing Notch that I have an older steam account than him lol
A4:11:00 <vede> It can be great, or it can be DREADFUL.
A4:11:16 <vede> On Windows, it's usually pretty much all the same.
A4:11:26 <Roadcrosser> unix?
A4:11:35 <vede> Dunno.
A4:11:42 <vede> I only have experience with Linux and Windows.
A4:11:55 <Roadcrosser> is it lai nucks or lee nucks
A4:12:09 <Marach> its linux
A4:12:09 <Roadcrosser> and unix is a linux os
A4:12:10 <Quatroking> my steam account is from mid-2007
A4:12:20 <Marach> unix was before
A4:12:24 <vede> I think it's "lin" (as in lint) "ucks"
A4:12:26 <Quatroking> I got HL2 somewhere there and yeah, it needed steam.
A4:12:55 <vede> Also Roadcrosser, Linux is a Unix OS.

P2:03:27 <Leonardo> ./itsover
P2:03:32 <bildramer> 256x64x256
P2:03:36 <Icenisse> 256x256x256

P2:03:44 <bildramer> :l
P2:03:48 <bildramer> Erm...
P2:03:48 <Icenisse> :D
P2:03:57 <bildramer> The normal map is 256x256x64
P2:04:08 <bildramer> XYZ, Z = height/up/gravity
P2:04:13 <Icenisse> noo 256
P2:04:14 <Leonardo> 512x512x256 works.
P2:04:16 <Leonardo> I think/.
P2:04:25 <serp> why isn't Y up?
P2:04:25 <Icenisse> I want 256 :)
P2:04:31 <Icenisse> no z is up
P2:04:33 <calzoneman> actually, bildramer, z is the depth
P2:04:34 <madk> the biggest you can have is 1024x64x124 or 512x128x512
P2:04:37 <calzoneman> y is up
P2:04:40 <Icenisse> y is up in 2D
P2:04:47 <calzoneman> it is in 3d too
P2:04:49 <Leonardo> Learn your axis people!
P2:04:51 <bildramer> AAAARGH
P2:04:52 <Siiseli> z is depth in 3d.
P2:04:53 <bildramer> NO
P2:04:56 <serp> but this is 3d... y is usually up in 3d
P2:04:58 <Leonardo> RAAAAAGE.
P2:05:00 <Leonardo> lol.
P2:05:00 <bildramer> :/
P2:05:03 <calzoneman> http://www.supraconsciousnessnetwork.org/superstringgraphic3.jpg
P2:05:03 <Siiseli> y is always up
P2:05:22 <Leonardo> IM BORED SO IMMA MAKE SOMETHING DUMB.
P2:05:26 <bildramer> It's Z for maths, actually
P2:05:30 <Icenisse> X=north/south. Y=west/east. Z=up/down
P2:05:30 <bildramer> Y too
P2:05:34 <bildramer> ^
P2:05:39 <Icenisse> only in 2D
P2:05:40 <bildramer> Y for 2D
P2:05:41 <Leonardo> I can't believe were having a nerd fight about which is which.
P2:05:43 <Leonardo> *facepalm*
P2:05:45 <bildramer> Z for 3D
P2:05:50 <Siiseli> uh, what
P2:05:51 <calzoneman> in most standard 3d applications, y is upward
P2:05:56 <Siiseli> you are silly Icenisse 
P2:05:57 <Leonardo> GUYS LETS DO THIS. Y X AND Z ARE PART OF THE ALPHABET.
P2:05:58 <Icenisse> you can see mc as a birds eye view
P2:05:58 <Leonardo> HAPPY?
P2:06:04 <Icenisse> NO
P2:06:05 <bildramer> The XY plane is the plane you're looking at from bird's view or whatever
P2:06:11 <Leonardo> *sigh*
P2:06:15 <Leonardo> I'll just walk away.
P2:06:15 <bildramer> :L

P2:17:21 <Siiseli> what?
P2:17:21 <Leonardo> Ez, I think its because of the Chili sauce.
P2:17:24 <Skillkills> Yea, for some reason minecraft goes x,y,z    right,up,forward   but everywhere else it goes x,y,z     right,forward,up
P2:17:25 <Siiseli> what about finland vurtual 
P2:17:26 <ez> oh right
P2:17:31 <Leonardo> XD
P2:17:35 <bildramer> lmao
P2:17:35 <Siiseli> Skillkills, what the fuck, it does not :D
P2:17:42 <08Notch> what? y = up!
P2:17:42 <Icenisse> zuriki tell these power abusing things to understand that my name owns
P2:17:43 <Leonardo> People get it straight, X, Y and Z are part of the alphabet.
P2:17:46 <Siiseli> it is a common standard in everything that y is up.
P2:17:46 <bildramer> roblox doesn't support spaces in file/directory names
P2:17:47 <Leonardo> They're the last 3 letters.
P2:17:49 <Skillkills> On everything i have ever seen its been that way
P2:17:49 <bildramer> LIEZ
P2:17:51 <Leonardo> SHEESH.
P2:17:51 <bildramer> Z IS UP
P2:17:52 <vurtual> Well, Simo Hayha wouldn't be able to shoot outside of Finland, due to using the wrong co-ordinates for a system of physics, if it used xzy.
P2:17:58 <Quatroking> the MD3 format uses Z as vertical axis
P2:18:00 <Skillkills> Minecraft is the first time its ever been right up forward
P2:18:04 <Leonardo> Z is the 26th letter of the alphabet.
P2:18:08 <Siiseli> md3 is weird.
P2:18:15 <08Notch> It's a bit confusing when I mix 2d maps (the sunlight heightmap for example) and the terrain data, though
P2:18:18 <vurtual> Z has been up forever.
P2:18:21 <Leonardo> Wait, how about letters are in the alphabet?
P2:18:21 <bildramer> ^
P2:18:23 <Leonardo> 26?
P2:18:28 <vurtual> 27 now.
P2:18:31 <Leonardo> SICK.
P2:18:32 <bildramer> huh.?
P2:18:34 <08Notch> no, z = depth. Why else would the z-buffer be called the z-buffer?
P2:18:39 <gdude2002> xd
P2:18:40 <Leonardo> The 27th letter is DERF.
P2:18:45 <bildramer> Well
P2:18:46 <vede> Hello, Notch.
P2:18:48 <Leonardo> Im bored so Imma google the new letter.
P2:18:49 <serp> pluto ceased being a planet and became a letter instead
P2:18:56 <08Notch> hi vede
P2:18:57 <bildramer> only 1 programmer mixed it up, then more, then more
P2:19:00 <bildramer> that's quite possible
P2:19:01 <08Notch> why are people being confusing, vede?
P2:19:08 <Leonardo> Because you called us weird.
P2:19:08 <vurtual> No, it's Ã•
P2:19:10 <Leonardo> :(
P2:19:15 <vede> I don't know, why are they?
P2:19:17 <vurtual> And the 28th may be Thorn, as that letter was awesome.
P2:19:21 <Quatroking> uh
P2:19:22 <bildramer> Notch: XY plane is like on a football field
P2:19:23 <Quatroking> well
P2:19:26 <bildramer> Z is up
P2:19:26 <Quatroking> this is weird
P2:19:34 <Leonardo> http://pmburgess.blogspot.com/2005/09/27th-letter-of-alphabet.html
P2:19:35 <vede> Personally, I agree with your coordinate system, Notch.
P2:19:36 <Leonardo> SICK.
P2:19:37 <Quatroking> the MD3 model uses a spherical coordiante system
P2:19:41 <bildramer> The Greek alphabet rules.
P2:19:44 <vede> Y is vertical from a player's perspective.
P2:19:45 <Ten_Tacles> gah
P2:19:47 <bildramer> Quatroking: D:
P2:19:47 <Quatroking> coordinate*
P2:19:56 <bildramer> phi, theta, r
P2:20:01 <bildramer> sucks doing sin
P2:20:06 <serp> Z- should be forward so that I can use the right hand rule 
P2:20:09 <bildramer> cos, atan etc. for every single point
P2:20:10 <vede> HOWEVER, I do understand why a person would have Z be vertical.
P2:20:13 <Quatroking>     Ï = rsinÎ¸
P2:20:14 <Quatroking>     z = rcosÎ¸
P2:20:14 <Quatroking>     \varphi = \varphi

P2:32:58 <Leonardo> I wonder how much Dock is getting paid.
P2:32:58 <Leonardo> :(
P2:33:30 <madk> Notch, may I ask you why you despise custom servers so much? Some of them seem to contribute a lot to your game. Many of them are written from scratch, and do not intrude on your own code, namely Spadge's server. Especially if you're going to use lua scripting for servers at a later time, all that we're going to end up with is custom servers.
P2:33:36 <Leonardo> tl;dr
P2:33:38 <Leonardo> :D
P2:33:46 <vede> Ever since a few months ago, Minecraft has seemed more like a kids' game (like 5-10 year-olds) than anything (that's not a bad thing!) and I keep thinking that Minecraft will look best if you keep going in that direction.
P2:34:01 <08Notch> madk: I strongly believe people should be allowed to make custom software like that, as long as it's done from scratch
P2:34:01 <Leonardo> Soon, Minecraft will be bought by Disney.
P2:34:03 <Leonardo> lololol.
P2:34:06 <Quatroking> NOTCH YOU HAVE MAIL
P2:34:16 <Ten_Tacles> XD
P2:34:16 <08Notch> and, yes, a lot of them add fun features that users like.
P2:34:30 <08Notch> my reasons for not liking them is mostly personal. I feel like I lose creative control.
P2:34:42 <Ten_Tacles> custom servers are fun but i have a sad feeling that they edit minecraft
P2:34:44 <08Notch> and there's also a risk of them costing me sales if they start letting people use premium features for free in the future
P2:34:53 <Ten_Tacles> :/
P2:35:00 <Leonardo> Notch, are you gonna make a sequel?
P2:35:01 <Leonardo> :D
P2:35:02 <Quatroking> Notch then you should sue them
P2:35:03 <Ten_Tacles> i think that would to start to get illigeal
P2:35:06 <08Notch> I could, but I won't.
P2:35:07 <madk> What will you do about lua when, and if, you implement it? Personally, that's what I'm looking most forward to, because it will give server owners creative control over their own servers.
P2:35:08 <Quatroking> also check your inbox

P2:39:40 <asiekierka> aww
P2:39:46 <Leonardo> wwa.
P2:39:46 <asiekierka> and i only found out about it
P2:39:53 <Jat> its really laggy anyway
P2:39:55 <asiekierka> why do i find out about things a month after they go uncool :(
P2:40:03 <Leonardo> Cause you're slow.
P2:40:05 <Leonardo> Like me.
P2:40:07 <Jat> i thought you were around when minecraft had the world of text thing
P2:40:11 <asiekierka> no
P2:40:13 <asiekierka> i was banned then
P2:40:20 <asiekierka> i was banned for like, 3 months

P2:42:26 <Leonardo> I have a question for you all.
P2:42:26 <Peerko> Notch: are moving platforms included in 'programmable blocks'?

P2:43:25 <asiekierka> he was talking about the platforms
P2:43:34 <jdl> Hmm... I factory-like block spawner and conveyorbelt WOULD be interesting.
P2:43:35 <Leonardo> Thank you captain obvious.
P2:43:38 <vede> Well, if we're able to create/destroy blocks from the code...
P2:43:50 <DragoonEnRegalia> At this rate, you could set up a Rube Goldberg machine with Lua.
P2:43:50 <vede> It would be theoretically possible to create "moving" platforms...
P2:43:53 <08Notch> a conveyor belt like thing that pushes blocks along at a relatively slow pace could work
P2:43:59 <DragoonEnRegalia> That could work.
P2:43:59 <bildramer> woot Matrix

P3:00:58 <Quatroking> Which is a feature only ultimate and enterprise is supposed to have
P3:01:00 <vede> I don't think it would be very out of character. It doesn't have to be a sci-fi jump booster.

P3:02:25 <08Notch> *fp-drrrr*
P3:02:29 <jdl> Catapults? Were having a war?!?!
P3:02:35 <DragoonEnRegalia> No
P3:02:35 <vede> Catapults which can fire rocks, TNT, or PEOPLE.
P3:02:39 <08Notch> I don't know, Miclee. I still want them. =)
P3:02:48 <DragoonEnRegalia> Soylent Green: Made of People.
P3:02:48 <08Notch> catapuling people in survival mode would be interesting
P3:02:53 <Quatroking> Oh yes
P3:02:54 <Skillkills> xDDD
P3:02:57 <Quatroking> CATAPULTING SHEEP
P3:03:00 <Quatroking> WOOT
P3:03:00 <jdl> LOL
P3:03:00 <Miclee> lol
P3:03:01 <vede> And *hilarious*.
P3:03:01 <DragoonEnRegalia> YES.
P3:03:05 <Skillkills> Come flying down and BAM... splat... your dead
P3:03:14 <Skillkills> I have an idea!
P3:03:17 <vede> Yeah, we should be able to catapult most anything.
P3:03:23 <08Notch> agreed
P3:03:24 <vede> People, farm animals, kitchenware.
P3:03:26 <DragoonEnRegalia> Good god, not buildings.
P3:03:26 <Quatroking> "Hey you there! FUCK YOU!" **catapults a sheep** "oh god my castle!" "SUCKERRR"
P3:03:29 <Skillkills> Shooting people out of catapults... while they are on FIRE
P3:03:30 <jdl> Flying pi-- I mean bacon xD
P3:03:38 <08Notch> if I added them, they should be able to launch pretty much everything.
P3:03:40 <08Notch> like real catapults.
P3:03:43 <Quatroking> catapulting creepers
P3:03:44 <Quatroking> oh god
P3:03:48 <DragoonEnRegalia> Oh yes.
P3:03:52 <Skillkills> OMG
P3:03:55 <Miclee> We need horses.
P3:03:58 <Miclee> Rideable ones
P3:03:58 <DragoonEnRegalia> CATAPULTING TOWERS!
P3:03:59 <Skillkills> imagine this
P3:04:01 <Miclee> that we can put armor on.
P3:04:10 <Quatroking> catapulting CATAPULTS
P3:04:15 <Miclee> lol
P3:04:21 <DragoonEnRegalia> WHICH CATAPULT MORE CATAPULTS!
P3:04:22 <Quatroking> which catapult sheep mid-air
P3:04:24 <madk> which are catapulting catapults?
P3:04:29 <jdl> Catapulting stone! But how would we be able to start lauching it?
P3:04:31 <DragoonEnRegalia> Et cetera, et cetera...
P3:04:37 <Miclee> CATAPULT CREEPERS. They're like bombs!
P3:04:38 <madk> ad infinitum
P3:04:41 <jdl> switch?
P3:04:54 <Skillkills> a catapult in a hole in the ground: some blocks to move things into the cup:something steps on the blocks, gets propelled forward into the cup, gets fired on touch sensing blocks
P3:04:54 <Quatroking> catapult sheep drenched in oil, on fire
P3:05:03 <Quatroking> >:D
P3:05:06 <jdl> Now fires would be awesome
P3:05:06 <Quatroking> burnnn
P3:05:07 <DragoonEnRegalia> This will solve everything in Survival.
P3:05:08 <vede> Yeah, I can see people keeping large prisons full of creepers, as LIVE ammunition.
P3:05:21 <Quatroking> That would be so awesome
P3:05:21 <madk> He Notch, who the heck is Derek?
P3:05:26 <DragoonEnRegalia> Creeper bombs and catapults.
P3:05:27 <08Notch> Derek Yu!
P3:05:28 <Miclee> We also need a way for there to be AI "players" that try to build cities and stuff.
P3:05:32 <madk> You swore by him on your blog
P3:05:34 <Quatroking> Derek is that guy I drawed a few months ago
P3:05:43 <madk> link?
P3:05:47 <Quatroking> HE DIED THO, TWICE
P3:05:58 <vede> madk, if you play indie games, you should know who he is.
P3:05:59 <vurtual> Kill someone, and catapult their corpse before it vanishes.
P3:05:59 <Miclee> O.O
P3:06:01 <vede> Such is law.
P3:06:04 <madk> Derek Yu?
P3:06:04 <vurtual> Then it poisons the impact area.
P3:06:05 <jdl> Tornadoes!!!
P3:06:12 <ZomBuster> creeper catapults?
P3:06:16 <Miclee> We need HURRICANES.
P3:06:25 <Quatroking> what the FUCK 3D Realms, WHAT

P3:06:28 <vurtual> Throwing hurricanes.
P3:06:34 <DragoonEnRegalia> Guys, before you know it we'll be catapulting esteemed members of this community.
P3:06:36 <jdl> Natural disasters would help make the game life-like.
P3:06:39 <vurtual> We can put them on our utility belts, along with a baridium code-key thermal detonator.
P3:06:41 <madk> Is he referring Derek Yu?
P3:06:49 <Quatroking> METEOR RAIN
P3:06:50 <Skillkills> OMG

P8:18:42 <revenant> I linked on the main page btw Quatro.

P8:18:57 <revenant> That wouldnt be nice.

P8:23:23 <PoF59> Oh, cool, now our castle has a blacksmith
P8:23:24 <vede> I was just poking around on some forum, and there was a thread for "what could replace war?" And one of the suggestions was "football"
P8:23:31 <revenant> vede.
P8:23:35 <revenant> I support building trains on the moon.
P8:23:40 <revenant> Its a valid use of coal and steel.
P8:23:42 <mail2345> hrm
P8:23:42 <vede> So someone pitches in and says, "But America created football, they'd always win!"
P8:23:43 <revenant> And then we race them.
P8:23:43 <mail2345> what
P8:23:54 <mail2345> also
P8:24:01 <revenant> Honestly if we replaced war with a sport, it would be soccer.
P8:24:05 <mail2345> uhh
P8:24:06 <vurtual> Here's what can replace war.
P8:24:09 <vurtual> Interstellar war.
P8:24:12 <mail2345> ^^
P8:24:12 <revenant> Trains on the moon?
P8:24:14 <mail2345> FUCK YEA
P8:24:19 <mail2345> KILL THOSE ALIEN BASTARDS
P8:24:25 <revenant> Argentina and Brazil will become the new world powers > >
P8:24:25 <vede> So the person who suggested it says, "No, I mean FOOTBALL, like with your FEET kicking a BALL, not that stupid crap you play over there."
P8:24:30 <vurtual> I call dibs on the LAAT/i.
P8:24:32 <revenant> XD
P8:24:34 <revenant> nice vede.
P8:24:35 <revenant> nice.
P8:24:40 <vurtual> vede, our football is the real football.
P8:24:49 <vurtual> Yours is "futbol" according to my spanish directv channel.

P8:24:59 <revenant> > >
P8:25:08 <revenant> But its the same in every other language
P8:25:09 <vurtual> It's now what you have to call it in a discussion with both.
P8:25:14 <revenant> podospheros in greek.
P8:25:15 <TestDummy> LET'S ARGUE ABOUT SPORTS
P8:25:17 <revenant> Guess what that means
P8:25:21 <vede> So the dumbamerican's reply was "But then some other country would win!"
10P8:25:21 * Taco142 is now known as tacoBELL
P8:25:21 <revenant> feet. sphere.
P8:25:25 <revenant> foot ball.
13P8:25:54 * TestDummy points out that vede is from the US.
P8:26:02 <vede> Basically, you have "United States" and you have "Every other country in the world."
P8:26:04 <vurtual> American football has plenty of foot and ball stuff. We just decided kicking it around was a waste of time, and throwing and running are our specialties.
P8:26:15 <vede> TestDummy, indeed.
P8:26:23 <PoF59> Remember how I said I could buy damn well anything? well now I have a blacksmith, lets go see if I'm right
P8:26:56 <tacoBELL> So my hacks just stopped working.
P8:27:03 <revenant> Honestly, why havent we adopted the metric system yet...
P8:27:06 <mail2345> erm
P8:27:08 <vurtual> Also, if any football were to be emergency-replacing war, it probably would be Europe-football, because only a small nation would ever really need such a thing.
P8:27:08 <mail2345> companies
P8:27:09 <Drakkar> psst
P8:27:12 <mail2345> also
P8:27:12 <revenant> Have I mentioned our current system is BULLSHIT?
P8:27:14 <Drakkar> the US uses the metric system
P8:27:16 <mail2345> revernant
P8:27:23 <revenant> not on road signs we dont
P8:27:25 <mail2345> everyone knows the imperial system is shit
P8:27:34 <mail2345> it's just that companies are lazy fags
P8:27:34 <vede> Drakkar, not the average citizen.
P8:27:40 <vurtual> Metric is for precise things.
P8:27:42 <mail2345> i use metric
P8:27:46 <Drakkar> you're taught metric in school

P8:27:50 <revenant> Metric is much easier.
P8:27:50 <mail2345> ^^
P8:27:55 <vurtual> Like, life or death sniper stuff, military stuff.
P8:27:59 <vede> Drakkar, we're taught that metric EXISTS.
P8:28:02 <revenant> It's more efficient, easier to learn and visualize.
P8:28:03 <Drakkar> no
P8:28:05 <revenant> Exactly vede.
P8:28:05 <vurtual> Anything for a common person, not-metric, as it just works wel.
13P8:28:05 * TestDummy is okay with imperial if it means we don't have to turn everything upside down.
P8:28:07 <revenant> Yeah, pretty much.
P8:28:08 <vede> And then we're taught that it's only used for science.
P8:28:13 <revenant> Exactly.

P8:28:29 <vede> Everything else, we use the "real" measurement system.
P8:28:34 <vurtual> Absolutely everything in American life is easy to use with imperial/standard/starwars system.
P8:28:37 <revenant> arbot which is of course... the bullshit one
P8:28:51 <revenant> lol arbot
P8:28:54 <vede> arbot?
P8:28:56 <revenant> XD
P8:29:01 <Drakkar> no it's pretty much stated that the only reason the metric isn't used more widely in the US is because everyone already knows the imperial pretty much
P8:29:09 <TestDummy> ^
P8:29:17 <revenant> Then educate people about the metric system thouroughly.
P8:29:21 <TestDummy> Do it./
P8:29:21 <Drakkar> and changing curricculum like that would require a whole new set of books
P8:29:22 <revenant> And institute it on roads.
P8:29:24 <Drakkar> which requires more money
P8:29:28 <Drakkar> and just a little protip
P8:29:29 <revenant> Oh dea.
P8:29:32 <Drakkar> our schools are badly underfunded already
P8:29:34 <revenant> But you admit, its better.
P8:29:35 <TestDummy> MAKE YOUR LIFE ABOUT CONVERTING THE US TO THE METRIC SYSTEM
P8:29:38 <TestDummy> Problem solved.
P8:29:42 <Drakkar> I don't care one way or another
P8:29:43 <revenant> Why do you NEED a book for the metric system?
P8:29:44 <vurtual> Most things we use are around a foot in length, we're six feet or five feet. Computers are over 20 inch monitors for new ones, under for tiny ones. 50 inch TVs are big, 60 are giant.
P8:29:47 <revenant> It has none the old bullshit.
P8:29:50 <TestDummy> You're obviously really adament about it.
P8:29:54 <revenant> Just memorize some prefixes.
P8:29:59 <vede> And because everyone uses the imperial system, and because all of our teachers outside of science teachers teach us the imperial system.
P8:30:01 <revenant> and you've literally got ALL YOU NEED.
P8:30:03 <vurtual> Also, the "new books" for instating metric would be one tiny handbook that tells the teacher to remind people that they now use metric.
P8:30:04 <vede> I learned imperial before metric.
P8:30:04 <TestDummy> That, or you could move to Canada. Isn't that far from Pennsylvania.
P8:30:06 <revenant> OK guys.
P8:30:06 <Drakkar> yes

P8:30:19 <Drakkar> so everything beyond science would have to have new books rewritten to accept the metric

P8:30:30 <revenant> How many centimeters in a kilometer then?
P8:30:32 <vurtual> Wait guys.
P8:30:36 <AndrewPH> like 10k
P8:30:37 <vurtual> Why haven't we had a power of 10 system before?
P8:30:38 <revenant> 100,000.
P8:30:40 <revenant> Exactly.
P8:30:41 <Drakkar> 1700ish
P8:30:47 <PoF59> BTW, I wasn't bluffing, so far I'm decked out in the best stuff ^^
P8:30:50 <AndrewPH> I haven't used metric in so long
13P8:30:51 * TestDummy wonders where we're going with this.
P8:30:51 <revenant> you can do all metric calculations in your head.
P8:30:56 <Drakkar> closer to 1750
P8:30:59 <revenant> It's much much easier and more efficient to use.
P8:31:01 <Jat> my most hated units of measurement are football fields, olympic swimming pools, and libraries of congree
P8:31:04 <revenant> And it has smaller more precise units.
P8:31:07 <Jat> congress
P8:31:11 <revenant> I'm with Jat
P8:31:12 <vede> "multiply by 100" "multiply by 10" "multiply by 1000"
P8:31:17 <vede> You just add zeros.
P8:31:20 <revenant> exactly.
P8:31:23 <TestDummy> How many femtometers is it to your mom's house?
P8:31:24 <Drakkar> psst
P8:31:25 <AndrewPH> or remove 0s
P8:31:26 <Drakkar> who cares
P8:31:28 <vede> Or move a decimal point.
P8:31:38 <Drakkar> go look up for someone saying metric is bad or worse than imperial
P8:31:39 <revenant> exactly.
P8:31:41 <Drakkar> yes thats right
P8:31:42 <vurtual> vede, that's not easy for anyone important in the USA. You start using metric, what will the farmers do?
P8:31:43 <Drakkar> keep scrolling
P8:31:46 <Drakkar> because no one said it
P8:32:12 <revenant> 10 kilometers --> 100 decameters --> 1000 meters --> 10,000 decimeters ---> 100,000 centimeters
P8:32:13 <vurtual> They use not-metric ALL THE TIME! They're the kind of person who can't just add zeroes quickly. Not everyone is like that!
P8:32:25 <revenant> I know!
P8:32:40 <Jat> i think you messed something up revenant
P8:32:44 <Drakkar> man you people are more annoying than macfags
P8:32:45 <TestDummy> THERE ARE 128 OUNCES IN ONE GALLON
P8:32:46 <vurtual> All the not-computer-nerds are defenseless! You can't just tell people to become machines, droids, and robots! Nonstandard units are their life!
P8:32:47 <revenant> Because its easier to multiply by 12, 13 and 620? than it is to add 10.
P8:32:49 <revenant> what Jat?
P8:32:55 <revenant> I probably messed up the prefixes.
P8:32:57 <Jat> somewhere along the line you lost a 0
P8:32:58 <revenant> I never use deca and deci
P8:33:02 <vurtual> It is for the guy who makes your food.
P8:33:09 <revenant> Where Jat?
P8:33:15 <Jat> i think when you got to meters
P8:33:21 <revenant> lol
P8:33:24 <revenant> yep
P8:33:25 <Jat> then it followed into decimeters
P8:33:28 <revenant> I forgot centameters.

P8:34:23 <Iguana> Not me. :/

P9:34:06 <revenant> I'm makin meh a usb
P9:34:10 <AndrewPH> lol usb install is easier
P9:34:15 <revenant> And my stupid virtual machine wouldnt format as ntfs
P9:34:20 <revenant> so I had to format it as fat
P9:34:23 <revenant> and then use convert
P9:34:24 <AndrewPH> fail
P9:34:29 <AndrewPH> FAT SUCKS
P9:34:29 <revenant> convert E: \fs:ntfs
P9:34:33 <AndrewPH> E:
P9:34:38 <revenant> ntfs fails even more.
P9:34:39 <revenant> :E*
P9:34:47 <AndrewPH> FAT can't handle very large files
P9:34:49 <revenant> NTFS is honestly shit.
P9:34:55 <AndrewPH> it's still better than FAT
P9:34:58 <revenant> lol
P9:34:59 <revenant> yep
P9:35:02 <revenant> exFat is promising.
P9:35:06 <revenant> But I'm most interested in ZFS
P9:35:10 <AndrewPH> Windows needs ext3
P9:35:24 <revenant> Apple's HFS+ has worked quite well in my experience.
P9:35:37 <Jat> i dont really understand the big deal about file systems
P9:35:40 <revenant> I'd say EXT3, HFS+ and ZFS.
P9:35:44 <Jat> whats so specialy about different file systems?
P9:35:46 <AndrewPH> Jat, some are better than others
P9:35:47 <revenant> Current three favorites.
P9:35:51 <revenant> yep.
P9:35:51 <Jat> better how?
P9:35:55 <AndrewPH> Example, the ones windows uses FRAGMENT
P9:36:00 <revenant> allocation block sizes, caching, metadata.
P9:36:05 <AndrewPH> s
P9:36:06 <revenant> Yep, they arent journaled.
P9:36:06 <AndrewPH> fragments
P9:36:10 <PuyoDead> Better read/write times, less fragmentation, less chances of corruption, etc.
P9:36:11 <revenant> HFS+ for instance, is a journaled OS
P9:36:18 <revenant> FS*
P9:36:20 <Jat> other oses file systems dont fragment?
P9:36:20 <Digmaster> Are people allowed to distribute custom minecraft servers?
P9:36:28 <revenant> It's iffy.
P9:36:32 <revenant> OpenCraft has been fine.
P9:36:34 <Digmaster> Becouse someone did
P9:36:36 <PuyoDead> ext3 might as well never fragment
P9:36:37 <Digmaster> ah
P9:36:40 <AndrewPH> Digmaster, they are if they don't contain any of notch's code
P9:36:46 <revenant> EXT3 works very nicely.
P9:36:53 <revenant> In other words dont use java.
P9:36:58 <revenant> Youll avoid all chance of infrigment.

P11:31:19 <sdgsdfg> why does still water flood?
P11:31:50 <sdgsdfg> in omen i made a bunch of still water and then loaded the server and it flooded the server
P11:31:54 <sdgsdfg> is this intended?
P11:32:17 <vurtual> Why is your name "sdgdfg"?
P11:32:38 <sdgsdfg> because to join irc you need a name
P11:32:39 <PuyoDead> May have came in from the sides, and it may have been old normal water still there.
P11:32:46 <sdgsdfg> so i smashed my face against the keyboard a couple times
P11:32:48 <sdgsdfg> and hit join
P11:32:48 <vurtual> Are you some insane girafarig?
P11:33:00 <PuyoDead> Don't mind vurtual, he's a bit of a doofus.
P11:33:06 <sdgsdfg> anyways
P11:33:26 <sdgsdfg> i'm using omen 0.6.0
P11:33:36 <sdgsdfg> and with the brush tool and the still water blocked selected
P11:33:44 <sdgsdfg> i drew some water, which then flooded the server
P11:33:54 <vurtual> Did a block mess with it?
P11:34:05 <vurtual> I remember making water flood by messing with it using sand and block-placement.
P11:34:22 <sdgsdfg> it might have
P11:34:30 <sdgsdfg> how could i prevent that from happening in the future?

P11:52:22 <Animator> In an era long ago, after I found my first internet community, I found another and wanted to try my hand at moderating a forum.
P11:53:10 <Animator> I find an advertisement forum, sign up there, it was beggining there, I became mod. I was ever vigilant (like in these forums) and it turns out that was where I found out I had a gift for moderating stuff.

P11:54:06 <Animator> I spent a couple months there. All was well, until MisaTange did an amatuer move.
P11:54:38 <Animator> She closed the forums because she was visiting family for a week, while knowing she had available mods that could take over.
P11:54:57 <Animator> I was very, very angry at this, because she instantanouesly killed all forum traffic in one shot.
P11:55:10 <Animator> So I ranted. Very much.
P11:55:16 <Animator> It shook her to the core.
P11:55:26 <Animator> So much that she went out to start -another- forum.
P11:55:31 <Animator> And -another- forum.
P11:55:34 <Animator> And etc.
P11:55:44 <Animator> None of them ever grew to be anything.
P11:56:01 <Animator> She couldn't live it down.
P11:56:27 <Animator> And here's the thing on my part.

P11:56:31 <PuyoDead> Well, sounds like we might expect some interesting stuff from her.
P11:56:53 <Animator> I hadn't fully matured yet, so everytime I saw her, I would remind her of it.
P11:56:58 <Animator> Every. Single. Time.
P11:57:07 <Animator> And then I stopped seeing her for a while.
P11:57:16 <Animator> She kinda fell under the radar.
P11:57:26 <Animator> Fastforward a year, and here we are.
