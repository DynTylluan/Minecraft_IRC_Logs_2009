A12:00:53 <Inschato> You know what seems really dumb? The server keeps autosaving even if it's empty
A12:01:28 <PuyoDead> that it a bit odd
A12:01:48 <Jat> alex
A12:02:02 <alexsuraci> me?
A12:02:08 <Jat> yep
10A12:02:15 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:02:47 <Jat> im trying one of the examples in the learn you a haskell tutorial and its giving me parse error
A12:02:55 <alexsuraci> Which one?
A12:03:15 <Jat> the bmitell one about 3/4 of the way down the page with four lines after where http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions
A12:03:46 <alexsuraci> hm, looks fine here. are you trying to put it in ghci or something?
A12:03:53 <Jat> when i try to load the file it says 15:11: parse error on input '='
A12:03:55 <alexsuraci> s/here/to me
A12:03:57 <Jat> yeah
A12:04:09 <Jat> what?
A12:04:12 <alexsuraci> nothing
A12:04:16 <Jat> oh
A12:04:20 <alexsuraci> i'll run it here
A12:04:29 <Jat> anyway it seems to be referring to the equals sign after skinny
A12:04:43 <Jat> but i cant really tell
A12:05:25 <alexsuraci> Jat: works here
A12:05:30 <Jat> im using ghci 6.10.3
A12:05:33 <Jat> crap
A12:05:33 <alexsuraci> same
A12:05:36 <alexsuraci> want to upload yours?
A12:05:41 <alexsuraci> http://paste.pocoo.org/
A12:07:25 <Jat> oh wait
A12:07:51 <Jat> when i copied and pasted directly from the page it worked... even though it looked exactly the same in notepad++
A12:07:53 <Jat> exactly
A12:08:37 <Jat> heres mine anyway http://paste.pocoo.org/show/126852/
A12:08:52 <Jat> maybe ghci doesnt like tabs or something
A12:09:21 <alexsuraci> generally you want to use spacing all the time in haskell
A12:09:29 <alexsuraci> since you hardly ever really indent anything
A12:09:31 <alexsuraci> it's all aligning
A12:09:54 <alexsuraci> it's erroring because you have some spaces before "skinny" which moves it out of the normal column for "where"
A12:10:36 <Jat> ah i see the problem really was the tabbing in notepad++
A12:10:45 <Jat> that extra spacing wasnt there in notepad++
A12:10:54 <alexsuraci> ah
A12:10:58 <Jat> it must have translated the tabs when i uploaded it
A12:11:16 <Jat> for some reason i had notepad++ set to use actual tabs instead of spaces for tabs
A12:11:37 <Jat> i thought that setting just made it treat spaces like that as tabs not actually put tabs in the file...
A12:11:45 <Jat> so i changed it now
A12:11:49 <LucasAnderson> b TEST
A12:11:52 <LucasAnderson> tnope
A12:11:54 <LucasAnderson> <b> Test
A12:11:56 <LucasAnderson> tnope
A12:11:57 <Jat> anyway thanks for the help alex

A12:12:05 <Adura> The heck.
A12:12:06 <alexsuraci> Jat: np, how's it going?
A12:12:13 <Jat> i like haskell so far :D
A12:12:19 <alexsuraci> cool :)
A12:12:42 <Jat> i havent liked having to deal with functional languages too much in the past when learning them and stuff
A12:12:58 <Jat> but haskell doesnt feel so awkward
A12:13:18 <alexsuraci> probably because it's the purest of them, it gets pretty much everything with FP right
A12:13:40 <Jat> even purer than lisp?
A12:13:45 <alexsuraci> afaik the others have some little language warts here and there
A12:13:58 <alexsuraci> never really used lisp, but I wouldn't hesitate to say it's at least equal
A12:14:12 <alexsuraci> I've found absolutely nothing wrong with Haskell in my time working with it
A12:14:58 <Jat> i really like the syntax in general... especially the fact that i dont need to use parentheses so much or those curly braces that i forgot what theyre called
A12:15:10 <Jat> the less time i need to spend on shift the better
A12:15:28 <Jat> also makes it look cleaner
A12:18:42 <alexsuraci> yeah
A12:19:27 <Jat> you said real world haskell is also good?
A12:19:36 <alexsuraci> I liked LYAH better
A12:19:56 <alexsuraci> RWH sort of throws code at you without explaining it well

A4:08:13 <Parthon> vdgmprgrmr: the problem is that random people on the internet have more impact on your life than some black dude that likes chlorine bleach a little too much
A4:08:44 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A4:08:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm confused as to what you're trying to say.
A4:13:43 <Parthon> I'm saying that MJ had little impact on your life, so you are right not to care :P
A4:13:54 <Parthon> MJ = black dude that likes chlorine bleach a little too much
A4:14:09 <citricsquid> He had a skin condition, bro.
A4:14:32 <citricsquid> He didn't choose to be half white.
A4:14:40 <Parthon> what was his skin condition?
A4:14:58 <citricsquid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo
A4:15:07 <citricsquid> and he had plastic surgery because he hated the way he looked.
A4:15:29 <citricsquid> "Michael Jackson was diagnosed in 1986 with vitiligo and lupus; the latter was potentially lethal but was in remission in Jackson's case.[14] In a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey in February 1993, Jackson dismissed suggestions that he bleached his skin, admitting for the first time that he had the illness."

A4:25:15 <citricsquid> and he liked kids because he never had a real childhood.

Silly media.
A4:25:40 <Parthon> I never believed he was
A4:25:53 <Parthon> he was just an easy target for a fucked up media system

A10:09:54 <PuyoDead> well, technically they are compressed, but that's what the game does. you can change it from .dat to .rar, and it'll open it
A10:10:02 <JTE> o.o
A10:10:16 <JTE> It's not a rar silly.
A10:10:18 <JTE> It's a .gz
A10:10:30 <JTE> :P
A10:10:48 <JTE> :3 And I am making my own map format.
A10:11:03 <JTE> And will need a painful converter utility at some point.

A11:22:40 <Dilt> certainly not
A11:22:42 <PuyoDead> I completely enjoy the music to minecraft, I just wish it wasn't so choppy at the moment
A11:22:56 <Dilt> however, that music on your youtube is certainly your own I believe?

A11:41:10 <citricsquid> I haven't used it, I was under the impression it did what you wanted though, maybe not :(

P1:22:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anybody know of any disadvantages of running without verify-names ?
P1:22:49 <Quatroking> hai
P1:23:25 <citricsquid> Doesn't verify-names not check with the master server if the username is registered?
P1:23:35 <peerkoel> nope
P1:23:43 <peerkoel> well, indirectly it does
P1:23:56 <peerkoel> because the applet HTML gets a mppass param
P1:24:15 <peerkoel> and that mppass is based on the heartbeat info
P1:24:39 <citricsquid> well, username/password is stored plaintext in a cookie, so if verifynames is false, can't we modify that and become someone else?
P1:24:52 <peerkoel> in a cookie?
P1:25:24 <Dossy> citricsquid: Theoretically :p
P1:25:31 <peerkoel> omg
P1:25:31 <Darkebrz> A chocolate chip one that your browser eats
P1:25:33 <citricsquid> our usernames and passwords are, I assume that's what is used to interact with the applet
P1:25:48 <peerkoel> no it's the mppass param to the applet
P1:25:52 <Dossy> In plaintext though? :|
P1:25:55 <Snowman> our passwords aren't exncrypted? :/
P1:25:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> 	    <param name="username" value="AlLnAtuRalX">    
P1:25:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> 	    <param name="sessionid" value="-5053627678902252412">    
P1:26:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's from the pagesource
P1:26:07 <citricsquid> snowman: not in cookies
P1:26:11 <peerkoel> I don't know what the sessionid is for
P1:26:19 <Dossy> Is it a session that's set?
P1:26:28 <Dossy> Has Notch made a custom session handler?
P1:26:32 <citricsquid> _lgn is the name of the cookie.
P1:26:41 <peerkoel> oh, it could be used for single player level saving perhaps
P1:26:41 <citricsquid> username|password
P1:28:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup, there it is in plaintext
P1:28:03 <Dossy> Pretty bad having it unencrypted... 
P1:28:24 <Dossy> Name	JSESSIONID
P1:28:26 <Dossy> Value	abccnqLmz9MWLh4oX2qjs
P1:28:28 <Dossy> Host	minecraft.net
P1:28:29 <Dossy> :|
P1:28:32 <Dossy> What's that then
P1:30:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm pretty sure verify-names has to do with the URL of the server
P1:30:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because you can use ?ip= with it, but the apge on ip= still has the sessionID, cookes are still there
P1:30:20 <Quatroking> hey citricsquid
P1:30:47 <citricsquid> quatro: yo
P1:30:53 <Quatroking> did your datacenter fixed those IP's yet
P1:31:02 <Quatroking> or are they still downloading porn
P1:31:04 <peerkoel> the url of the server is unrelated to verify-names
P1:31:05 <citricsquid> yes, going to setup tomorrow
P1:31:11 <Quatroking> yaay
P1:31:17 <peerkoel> because the url does not change for host+ip settings
P1:31:29 <peerkoel> and the heartbeat will send out different salt
P1:31:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> peerkoel, then why can't I use ?ip= with it enabled?
P1:31:36 <peerkoel> don't know..
P1:31:46 <citricsquid> verify-names is for running locally isn't it? It probably does bypass the session checking.
P1:31:55 <peerkoel> is the mppass param added on the ip= page?
P1:32:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not sure
P1:33:25 <Snowman> I have too many cookies >.>
P1:33:52 <netzero> Is there a page anywhere that describes the makeup of the server_level.dat file?

P2:54:22 <Ylle> Who actually remembers all that crap about networking layers and crap?
P2:54:23 <citricsquid> oh, notch: Someone pointed out earlier that there's a problem with logging in and switching domains, so logging in at http://www.minecraft.net will mean you're not logged in at minecraft.net and vice versa, would you be willing to use some mod_rewrite (.htaccess) that stops this from happening? A few people asked for it :P (I have the code if you want it)
P2:54:37 <08Notch> oh yeah, citricsquid..
P2:54:42 <08Notch> the server isn't apache, though
P2:54:45 <Ylle> I always have to refer to the books
P2:54:45 <08Notch> it's resin
P2:54:46 <citricsquid> oh :(
P2:54:48 <Ylle> ahaehaha
P2:54:58 <08Notch> but yeah, I need to fix that, hadn't even thought about it
P2:55:05 <Russ> any help?
P2:55:19 <08Notch> gah, my throat
P2:55:27 <08Notch> it's way worse in the evenings..
P2:55:31 <citricsquid> too much celebrating! :P
P2:55:39 <08Notch> hehe, I've slept most of today, actually
P2:55:48 <PuyoDead> did you get anything to help? any medication or anything?
P2:55:51 <Joat> Why do I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something...

P2:55:58 <08Notch> no, it's a virus, so nothing'll kill it
P2:56:07 <Prime_2> notch!
P2:56:07 <PuyoDead> you should get AVG Free
P2:56:09 <08Notch> I take some painkillers at night
P2:56:10 <Meizlizard> Opening console on my mac is scary. My computer is dealing with all these issues and yelling at different parts of itself.
P2:56:21 <Prime_2> hey notch

P2:56:22 <08Notch> Prime_2!!
P2:56:26 <Meizlizard> I feel so lazy by comparison.
P2:56:29 <Dilt> PuyoDead: AVG Free is inefficient, use Avast+Spybot+HijackThis!
P2:56:33 <Prime_2> I'm still waiting on that fix
P2:56:40 <08Notch> Prime_2: It's coming in the next update. =)
P2:56:49 <Joat> Say, Notch. If I decide to (it may be more convenient for the user), can I put the game in a regular frame instead of an iframe?
P2:57:05 <Prime_2> along with an option to turn off music and/or SFX, I hope
P2:57:05 <Prime_2> lol
P2:57:13 <citricsquid> joat: as long as you include the entire page, is what he said :D Method doesn't matter, I assume.
P2:57:20 <08Notch> yeah, what citricsquid said
P2:57:32 <Joat> My thanks. Fare thee well.
P2:58:05 <08Notch> Prime_2: yes, hehe
P2:58:16 <Dossy> Hm, off now
P2:58:23 <08Notch> mmm, food
P2:58:23 <Dossy> Bye guys :)
P2:58:29 <Joat> By the way, I'm not sure what to make of it: I have a good many views on my MC Party thread in the forums, but not a single comment. Not sure what to think on that, whether people like it or not...
P2:58:36 <PuyoDead> I'm apparently one of the few who really like the music, but it's super choppy
P2:58:43 <citricsquid> joat: link? :)
P2:58:49 <PuyoDead> if I turn to look into the map, it's almost completely cut out :P
P2:58:51 <08Notch> i love the music. =D But I'm a bit of a c418 fanboy
P2:59:04 <08Notch> hmm.. fascinating
12P2:59:07 * Lmaoboat (chatzilla@pool-71-126-132-107.washdc.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P2:59:07 <citricsquid> I also really like the music, only gets choppy every so often, rarely noticable.
P2:59:07 <Prime_2> hmm
P2:59:12 <Dilt> actually, i like the music, but... i think there should be some variety
P2:59:15 <Joat> The music, for me, is not choppy, but it doesn't play all the time. It needs to take a long time to load, then plays. If only it could be streamed.
P2:59:16 <Prime_2> Notch, I think solidified lava should have a different looking block
P2:59:22 <08Notch> yeah, these are just the first test songs
P2:59:25 <Dilt> the same trancy tune for a while gets annoying
P2:59:26 <08Notch> Yeah, Prime_2. =)
P2:59:31 <Dilt> also, Notch
P2:59:32 <citricsquid> needs some death metal!
P2:59:44 <08Notch> oh you mean within the individual songs?
P2:59:45 <Dilt> if the comp can't handle the framerate, the music gets choppy
P2:59:50 <Joat> Ah.
P2:59:51 <Prime_2> it would make carving out lava MUCH easier, particularly after some greifer lets in water

10P3:00:29 * ReaperSWE (trashcan@bb-dhcp-85-11-200-56.ornskoldsvik.com) has joined #minecraft
P3:00:31 <08Notch> Dilt: Yeah.. It's really strange though, since both music streaming and sound mixing are done in separate threads from the rendering, and they're both top priority
P3:00:32 <LF> Also Notch this doesn't really bother me but I thought you should know, when running the game in google chrome the game starts running about about 0.5 FPS but works fine in firefox/
P3:00:35 <LF> .*
P3:00:35 <ReaperSWE> Was there a client update just now?
P3:00:41 <08Notch> no, ReaperSWE.
P3:00:58 <Dilt> are you sure there's nothing that's at a higher priority?
P3:01:26 <08Notch> well, the main game loop might be at the same priority.. hmm
P3:01:42 <Dilt> yeah.
P3:01:44 <Dilt> that'd be the cause then
P3:02:05 <08Notch> LF: Yeah, it runs really weird on different browsers.. The downloaded will probably be the main way to play in the future
P3:02:08 <Dilt> if it's seperately threaded with a higher priority, then the only case is that there's something at equal or higher priority yanking it down
P3:02:25 <08Notch> I can make it launch from the website still if people want to browse servers there and so, it might be nice to have a community base
P3:03:00 <LF> Leaving it optional would be great
P3:03:08 <08Notch> yeah.. I could try either lowering the main game thread priority, or manually synching the threads once per frame
P3:03:17 <08Notch> the file io thread is SUPPOSED to buffer four seconds worth of sound
P3:03:24 <LF> People could download it on their home computers and simply use it on there and when they're not at home they can run it from the website
P3:03:41 <08Notch> and there's no way anyone is playing with 0.25 frames per second. ;)
P3:03:51 <08Notch> yeah, I'll have both as an option. =)
P3:04:04 <08Notch> but I thought a third option might be to have it start the downloaded when you click a play link
P3:04:14 <LF> Hmm
P3:04:16 <Dilt> i think the worst i can do is 1-3 FPS
P3:04:16 <ReaperSWE> that'd be the best option
P3:04:25 <LF> It would be easier than coding a server browser in to the game
P3:04:40 <LF> A direct to IP connect option would be nice as well
P3:04:42 <ReaperSWE> click a server in browser, launch java applet join server
P3:04:50 <citricsquid> Server browser is just querying the master server and listing stuff isn't it?
P3:04:58 <LF> Although I don't know how easy that would be to code
P3:05:00 <Dilt> if you're having a distributable client, maybe have it be in a minecraft: link format?
P3:05:15 <Dilt> ah, hm
P3:05:21 <Dilt> hmmm.
P3:05:22 <LF> citricsquid it's easier because he already has a server browser done on the website
P3:05:34 <Meizlizard> Will port forwarding always be required?
10P3:05:41 * Lmaoboat (chatzilla@pool-71-126-132-107.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
P3:05:47 <citricsquid> meiz: of course :P If you run from home PC.
P3:05:58 <08Notch> direct ip connection is already possible. just add ?ip=<ip>&port=<port> to play.jsp
P3:06:12 <Meizlizard> I mean, you can run a starcraft server just by launching the game.
P3:06:26 <Angelo> god fucking
P3:06:29 <Meizlizard> It isn't 24/7, but you can have friends connect.
P3:06:31 <Angelo> why do servers keep crashing!?
P3:07:03 <citricsquid> Meizlizard: Forwarding isn't because of minecraft, it's because of your network setup afaik. Home networks are normally configured to refuse connections through ports you haven't allowed.
P3:07:45 <Meizlizard> So could I skip the port forwarding by running minecraft through a port already open?
P3:07:54 <Meizlizard> Or would that be unbearably laggy?
P3:07:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Holy shit Notch is here
P3:08:03 <UnknownX> you just noticed?
P3:08:16 <08Notch> hey vdgmprgrmr

P3:08:28 <08Notch> I'm still ill, but I thought I'd drop by =)
P3:08:37 <Angelo> notch, my server has crashed for about 3 times now 12/15 players, how come?
P3:08:40 <08Notch> I've slept a LOT today
P3:08:45 <Angelo> (@ linux)
P3:08:48 <08Notch> Angelo: The freeze crash?
P3:08:53 <Angelo> i dont know
P3:08:56 <citricsquid> angelo: Was it running for a while and then just disappeared?
P3:08:56 <08Notch> I think there's a problem with how I close the connection streams
P3:08:57 <Angelo> we all get disconnected
P3:09:00 <Angelo> and thats it
P3:09:05 <Angelo> YES!
P3:09:08 <Angelo> that too
P3:09:08 <08Notch> did the server say anything?
P3:09:09 <Angelo> sometimes
P3:09:17 <Angelo> the sockets keep on fin_wait1
P3:09:24 <citricsquid> Mine run for about 48/72 hours then just disappear without errors :( 
P3:09:27 <Angelo> and it sucks, i have to reboot my whole server to fix that
P3:09:35 <Angelo> wait let me check that notch
P3:09:37 <citricsquid> angelo: Just switch the port? :D
P3:09:55 <Angelo> i only have 1 port forwarded :P
P3:10:19 <Angelo> uhm i dont think i can see an error.
P3:10:24 <Angelo> im using nohup
P3:10:37 <Angelo> and the server.log doesn't show up anything either
P3:10:42 <Angelo> just someone joining and poof it crashes

P3:10:57 <citricsquid> Angelo: http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=693
P3:10:59 <citricsquid> like that?
P3:11:24 <Angelo> no, it is 12/15
P3:11:30 <Angelo> then someone joins (13th)
P3:11:32 <Angelo> then it crashes
P3:11:36 <08Notch> i got some reports on that earlier. seems to happen on linux only? or that might be a coincidence because most servers are hosted on linux, heh
P3:11:50 <08Notch> is it always the 13'th person?
P3:11:51 <citricsquid> So it's a specific number everytime?
P3:12:00 <Angelo> i haven't checked, i will check if it happens next time
P3:12:01 <08Notch> sounds like some kind of a running-out-of-handles thing.. hmm
P3:12:15 <Angelo> maybe if you all could connect it happens?
P3:12:17 <Angelo> its 5/15 now

P3:13:32 <Dilt> C418: he has conficker not the flu
P3:13:36 <08Notch> it's not a flu, it's some kind of throat virus thing
P3:13:55 <C418> I had some kind of stomach virus last month
P3:13:57 <C418> it...
P3:14:00 <C418> actually was really cool
P3:14:04 <C418> I was one day really really sick
P3:14:05 <Quatroking> oh hey guys, notch
P3:14:06 <Angelo> lol
P3:14:09 <C418> and had 2 weeks of doing nothing
P3:14:11 <Quatroking> I'm fucking sick as well
P3:14:15 <C418> because there was no medicine for it
P3:14:29 <08Notch> lol
P3:14:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I... don't get sick.
P3:14:38 <Angelo> uhm
P3:14:40 <08Notch> i do.. way too easy
P3:14:41 <Angelo> i need people to join please

P3:16:10 <PuyoDead> very nice snowman
P3:16:12 <Quatroking> Oh snap
P3:16:23 <08Notch> i might even just open up a java api
P3:16:30 <08Notch> then people can make a lua plugin if they want
P3:16:36 <UnknownX> so what... is that 1/2 or 9/10
P3:16:37 <Angelo> :o
P3:16:38 <Angelo> awesome
P3:16:54 <vdgmprgrmr> That sounds swheet.
P3:17:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I should take a look at this LUA stuff.
P3:17:17 <Quatroking> I just had an orgasm
P3:17:32 <UnknownX> O.O
P3:17:47 <Eagle> awwweeessooommmeee
P3:18:25 <Quatroking> What would people be able to make using serverside LUA, entire gamemodes?
P3:18:38 <Quatroking> NPC's
P3:18:56 <Quatroking> custom models perhaps?
P3:19:03 <Angelo> block protection
P3:19:12 <Quatroking> I don't want block protection..
P3:19:17 <Dilt> some people do
P3:19:39 <08Notch> yeah, i'm going to have to think about how to make it clear to the player what the server is running
P3:19:47 <08Notch> just randomly joining servers is probably not fun, heh
P3:19:56 <Quatroking> use server tags
P3:20:00 <cryzed> Notch, ingame-server list?
P3:20:15 <08Notch> cryzed: Yes, with the download version at/after beta =)
P3:20:15 <cryzed> Like you see in games like CS:S or Wolfenstein
P3:20:16 <LF> Notch how about a tag command in the cmd
P3:20:22 <Quatroking> In Gmod, the server browser uses tags to indicate some well-known mods
P3:20:23 <cryzed> Notch: okay, looking forward to it
P3:20:26 <LF> and it'd list tags next to the servers
P3:20:32 <08Notch> that'll probably work. =)
P3:20:34 <cryzed> Notch: by the way, I had just a buffer overflow on my server :D
P3:20:40 <Quatroking> forexample, PHX modelpack, spacebuild, etc. It's just in the tag lines
P3:20:44 <ZomBuster> hey hey
P3:20:45 <Quatroking> really easy.
P3:20:58 <08Notch> cryzed: Did it kick everyone or just one player?
P3:20:59 <ZomBuster> tags for minecraft servers?

P3:20:59 <Quatroking> Exactly.
P3:21:03 <ZomBuster> good idea
P3:21:09 <cryzed> Notch: crashed the server, was apparently caused from one player
P3:21:18 <Quatroking> Yeah, also, serverside LUA, ZomBuster.
P3:21:24 <cryzed> SERVERSIDE LUA
P3:21:26 <cryzed> oh please
P3:21:28 <cryzed> Oh please!
P3:21:34 <Angelo> oh god!
P3:21:35 <Quatroking> look up a few lines
P3:21:35 <Angelo> :P
P3:21:43 <Quatroking> around 22:15
P3:21:51 <cryzed> Oh god
P3:21:52 <cryzed> yes
P3:21:54 <cryzed> YES
P3:21:56 <cryzed> :)!
P3:21:59 <Angelo> :D
P3:22:06 <cryzed> Then I can completely customize the server?
P3:22:11 <cryzed> For example
P3:22:15 <Angelo> yeah
P3:22:15 <ZomBuster> is that a suggestion or does Notch actually do that?
P3:22:21 <cryzed> >/teleport_player xyz to abc
P3:22:27 <cryzed> Notch is planning to
P3:22:32 <08Notch> ZomBuster: I said it's very likely
P3:22:32 <ZomBuster> ooh sweet :D
P3:22:35 <Angelo> no
P3:22:43 <Angelo> hes planning to make a java sdk :)
P3:22:44 <Quatroking> "<Quatroking> Notch, serverside LUA, what are the chances?" "<Notch> Quatroking: Very very high!"
P3:22:45 <cryzed> He said the chance is very high
P3:22:56 <Angelo> true.
P3:23:05 <ZomBuster> then people dont have to ask for features all the time
P3:23:18 <Angelo> they will
P3:23:23 <Angelo> they ask lua coders to make something

P3:23:50 <cryzed> Is anyone using Lua as a general scripting langauge
P3:23:51 <Angelo> Notch: i cannot get 13 players in my server :( i have 8/15 now
P3:23:52 <cryzed> like Python?
P3:24:29 <Quatroking> Far Cry uses a whole load of LUA..
P3:24:35 <ZomBuster> Gmod does
P3:24:43 <cryzed> because it's awesome
P3:24:53 <Quatroking> World of Warcraft also has LUA support
P3:25:00 <cryzed> <cryzed> Is anyone using Lua as a general scripting langauge
P3:25:04 <cryzed> " general scripting language "
P3:25:05 <Quatroking> SupCom and Spellforce too in fact
P3:25:16 <citricsquid> Notch: http://filebox.me/files/z54s7yjf3_minecrafttags.gif Something like that would be cool, blocks for custom mod, lock for password and music for whether or not they have custom music :D
P3:25:17 <Quatroking> Like, primary language to build in?
P3:25:27 <cryzed> Quatroking: yes
P3:25:28 <Quatroking> like minecraft is built in java
P3:25:31 <cryzed> like you would use Python
P3:25:31 <Quatroking> Not sure
P3:25:38 <cryzed> I really would like to
P3:25:44 <08Notch> =D citricsquid
P3:25:45 <cryzed> but there is still a lack of 3rd party library
P3:25:56 <cryzed> For example I just love Python and Rubys mechanize
P3:25:59 <Angelo> notch how long will you stay here ? :P
P3:26:01 <ZomBuster> I have seen a few Lua compilers.. but it's not used that much
P3:26:01 <cryzed> and html5lib to parse html pages
P3:26:02 <citricsquid> could also have a favourites system :D
P3:26:07 <Quatroking> citricsquid: needs more CSS
P3:26:21 <08Notch> Angelo: I'm not sure.. I'm not tired at all at the moment
P3:26:24 <Quatroking> so the tags are lined up to the right and not directly next to the server names
P3:26:29 <Angelo> oh
P3:26:34 <08Notch> perhaps 1-2 hours more
P3:26:40 <Angelo> heh.

P3:42:36 <cryzed> Angelo: oh :(, I want Lua :O

P3:42:58 <LF> Daidoji that's hard to do to my knowledge

P3:43:11 <LF> and the spawn can be moved
P3:43:26 <Wolfram> Well, all they need is the ability to build and the ability to reset spawn.
P3:43:30 <vdgmprgrmr2> You can make a special roof which is spawn-exploit-proof.

P3:44:15 <Angelo> oh notch: if it helps, i am using opensuse 10 (linux)
P3:44:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Basically, it's like a checkerboard layer, then an inverse checkerboard layer above it.
P3:44:22 <LF> Use solid blocks?
P3:44:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes.
P3:44:37 <ZomBuster> spawn prisons are bad mmkay?
P3:44:41 <Wolfram> How does that stop you from appearing atthe top of the map?
P3:44:47 <LF> Personally I have no problem with them
P3:45:05 <vdgmprgrmr> because if you spawn into the roof, you end up in the standard single-block prison.
P3:45:10 <Adura> Honeycomb jails above the main one work.
P3:45:20 <Wolfram> Ah, I see.
P3:45:24 <vdgmprgrmr> But it has to be two layers.
P3:45:26 <PuyoDead> you'd have to make it so you can't see the other checkerboard spots from each other, otherwise they can place blocks in another one, then go below it and spawn up through it

P3:45:52 <Parthon> so I ended up using python instead
P3:45:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Why not, eh?
P3:46:05 <vdgmprgrmr> The jails would just be tempy things anyway.
P3:46:13 <Wolfram> I can't decide if that's hilarious or just demeaning
P3:46:31 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, the things in the jails would be pretty small anyway.
P3:46:39 <Wolfram> Yes, yes. Mostly kidding with that last comment.
P3:46:48 <Wolfram> That's an improvement over the current jail situation.
P3:46:56 <Wolfram> Honestly though, I don't think many people would care for it anyway.
P3:47:01 <Wolfram> They would still want out.
P3:47:07 <vdgmprgrmr> True.

P3:47:33 <Zolyx> Spawn prisons seems a weak and time-consuming way to deal with griefers, tbh
P3:47:50 <Wolfram> Some people like them.
P3:48:04 <Wolfram> I'm one of them, even. But I respect your decision not to use them.
P3:48:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I liked the idea of locking a server from entering if there's no ops around.
P3:48:12 <PuyoDead> apparently, some server admins mainly make them to keep their servers up overnight to protect things... which is the weirdest bit of backward thinking
P3:48:20 <Angelo> agreed vdgmprgrmr
P3:48:21 <Angelo> lol
P3:48:25 <Wolfram> Yeah, I don't know about leaving it up when there's no one there.
P3:48:29 <Zolyx> Aye; I respect your choice to use them :)
P3:48:57 <Wolfram> I would prefer building permissions to prisons
P3:48:58 <vdgmprgrmr> The reason for spawn prisons is that ops can leave, and people that are still on the server can continue to do whatever they were doing.
P3:49:12 <ZomBuster> so? :P
P3:49:28 <vdgmprgrmr> So it's better than just taking the server down, I think.
P3:49:41 <PuyoDead> depends on how long the people on plan to stay there

P3:50:01 <Zolyx> I understand why they're used. I guess as a stopgap measure until a better server management feature is implemented, it's fine
P3:50:06 <Wolfram> I think having projects on a server makes you more likely to hang about.
P3:50:17 <Wolfram> At least in the people who prefer prisons in the first place.
P3:50:17 <Daidoji> yeah
P3:50:21 <Wolfram> People who want their things protected.
P3:50:22 <Daidoji> I'd rather see a whitelist
P3:50:37 <PuyoDead> that would be excellent
P3:50:41 <Daidoji> like griefers could wander around all they wanted, but only people on the whitelist could build

P3:57:09 <peerkoel> I'm ok with 1
P3:57:24 <Lmaoboat> Hey Notch, I was thinking that you should be able to make it so your server goes off the list for everyone but OPs when no OPs are on, but when an OP joins , it goes public again. That way you can make sure your server is always moderated, but don't have to take it down whenever you're off. It's like tag-team admining.
P3:57:31 <PuyoDead> if I'm building around the edge or something, 1 is usually fine. but walking around, it has to be around 2

P4:20:45 <Angelo> maybe its becuase i accidentally refreshed my firefox?
P4:20:53 <vdgmprgrmr> My IE crashed completely and without warning.
P4:21:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I wonder if it has anything to do with this computer being a piece of shit.
P4:21:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Or the fact that computers are not allowed to function correctly when I'm near them.

P4:22:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Possibly due to IE.
P4:22:14 <Rroff> 200 mile draw distance at 1/4 scale
P4:22:37 <ZomBuster> Blitz3D?

P4:24:29 <Rroff> but I just got the urge
P4:24:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Hell I use b3d for 2d projects mostly anyway now.
P4:24:51 <Rroff> :P
P4:25:04 <Rroff> with a bit more effort I can prolly get something of crysis level graphics
P4:25:09 <Rroff> without even touching dx9+
P4:25:21 <ZomBuster> would run like shit tough :D
P4:25:29 <vdgmprgrmr> People have done some amazingly pretty stuff with Blitz...
P4:25:30 <Rroff> well
P4:25:41 <Rroff> if I drop the draw distance down to half what it is
P4:25:43 <Angelo> is it a 3d engine?
P4:25:46 <Rroff> fps climbs by 10x
P4:25:58 <Rroff> so plenty of headroom
P4:28:40 <Mrangry> whut

P4:29:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I do.
