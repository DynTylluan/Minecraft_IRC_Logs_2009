A12:00:34 <Dilt> block placements are in a data type
A12:00:50 <Dilt> and changing just a single block will mess up this data type IIRC

A12:08:38 <LG_Legacy> Nay
A12:08:48 <LG_Legacy> when it's done, go jump off three blocks and hurt yourself
A12:08:50 <PixelSith64> :P
A12:08:55 <PixelSith64> Dark, survival mode is pissing me off
A12:08:59 <LG_Legacy> Count up the damage done (2 or 3. In this case it should be 2.)
A12:09:01 <PixelSith64> I made this awesome pathway over lava
A12:09:03 <PixelSith64> being epic
A12:09:05 <PixelSith64> then three creepers
A12:09:09 <LG_Legacy> If 2, then look up 18 with Next Scan
A12:09:09 <PixelSith64> randomly explode
A12:09:12 <PixelSith64> And destroy it
A12:09:14 <Visiiri> Where do I put the value?
A12:09:14 <PixelSith64> :<
A12:09:15 <Darkebrz> PixelSith64: And most of the damage I take in that is intentional
A12:09:19 <LG_Legacy> Normally only one address/value will pop up in the left.
A12:09:26 <LG_Legacy> NEXT TO HEX  You twat.
A12:09:30 <LG_Legacy> As i was saying
A12:09:32 <PixelSith64> Oh really?
A12:09:34 <LG_Legacy> Select this value on the left
A12:09:38 <LG_Legacy> Should say 18
A12:09:42 <LG_Legacy> Hit the red arrow

A12:09:55 <PixelSith64> That's my suggestion
A12:09:58 <Visiiri> D:
A12:10:00 <LG_Legacy> Don't select them
A12:10:02 <Darkebrz> I played a game with pretty much only creepers
A12:10:03 <mail2345> Eat the red mushroom

A12:41:48 <Colain> Nice LG?
A12:41:53 <asiekierka> Colain: I know you told me not to steal Minecraft TV's concept
A12:41:56 <asiekierka> And I'm not this time
A12:42:01 <asiekierka> I don't want to make a TV service ABOUT minecraft
A12:42:02 <Kratospie> Minecrafts TV?
A12:42:03 <asiekierka> Just IN minecraft
A12:42:11 <asiekierka> cuz the graphics are awesome
A12:42:16 <asiekierka> and I already made Studio A for TeamASCIItvb
A12:42:16 <Colain> You mean... somewhat a play?
A12:42:18 <asiekierka> tv*
A12:42:37 <PixelSith64> MCTV

A12:42:45 <asiekierka> for TeamASCIItv
A12:42:46 <Kratospie> MCTV!
A12:42:51 <Colain> Thats what the idea was.
A12:42:51 <asiekierka> Also I think you DO belong there, Colain
A12:43:17 <asiekierka> so... I don't think you can disagree with it without being OUT from Team ASCII :P
A12:43:17 <Kratospie> MCTV News, Sports,
A12:43:17 <LG_Legacy> Give Colain a cup-cake and he will be happy
A12:43:18 <Colain> Minecraft TV was going to be filmed in Minecraft, thus Rodifan's videos.
A12:43:25 <asiekierka> So is TeamASCIITV
A12:43:28 <LG_Legacy> Heeyyyyy
A12:43:31 <asiekierka> but Minecraft TV is about Minecraft

A6:30:35 <C418> it's like a shitty stephen king film
A6:30:38 <Marach> does this need sound?
A6:30:48 <Marach> does this HAVE sound?
A6:30:59 <Arzock> LOL
A6:31:00 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Probably because it's a REAL simulation from an official organization.

A6:36:26 <Nohbdy|Xeros> And I can never make a poem that doesn't rhyme anyway... I just don't consider it a poem lol
A6:36:41 <Siiseli> what
A6:36:47 <Siiseli> you don't consider non-rhyme a poem?
A6:36:52 <Siiseli> that's just stupid
A6:37:30 <Siiseli> rhyming poems are the old-fashioned way of doing it, it's how poems used to be, now it's more liberal. they can rhyme, they don't have to
A6:39:06 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Calm down? I didn't say "A POEM THAT DOESN'T RHYME ISN'T A POEM" I said I consider them not a poem if it doesn't rhyme... because I don't enjoy non-rhyming poems and I don't write them
A6:39:50 <Siiseli> what made you think I'm not calm
A6:40:20 <Siiseli> if you say you don't consider a non-rhyming poem a poem that means you don't think it's a poem. Which IS saying that a poem that doesn't rhyme isn't a poem

A7:45:48 <Iguana> I prefer underground caverns.
A7:46:19 <Magnulus> I hate them. I tried using them, but they always got blown apart by those goddamned creepers.
A7:46:37 <Magnulus> If you ask me, the blast radius needs to be recoded.
A7:47:22 <citricsquid> 240 players, 206 servers, 57258 registered, 1995 purchases
A7:47:23 <citricsquid> :D
A7:49:16 <Magnulus> For example that for every step out, it loses a certain amount of its force to the material it's destroying. So if the creeper is surrounded by hard materials, the blast radius is small, but if it's surrounded by sand or dirt, the blast is much bigger.
A7:49:27 <Arzock> anyone know a mod that turns the sky into a night sky/
A7:49:29 <Arzock> *?
A7:49:53 <Marach> 2000 coming soon
A7:49:56 <Magnulus> Because right now, no matter how much you fortify your buildings, a blast or two from the creepers is all it takes.
A7:51:05 <softnux> Arzock: just replace the texture
A7:51:12 <Arzock> how?
A7:51:28 <citricsquid> Arzock: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2358
A7:51:29 <Magnulus> Perhaps later you could use iron ore to craft metal plating for your walls and such, which would actually stop a creeper blast dead in its tracks, but wouldn't stop an explosive made using creeper extracts, etc.
A7:51:38 <Arzock> thanks sam

A9:13:00 <Arzock> =o
A9:13:02 <Zuriki> I suppose it's in the code somewhere.
A9:13:08 <Arzock> I'll just use normal water then

A9:21:29 <Zuriki> ...
A9:21:31 <Snowman> like skinning the enemies
A9:21:34 <Zuriki> Oh
A9:21:35 <Zuriki> Yeah

A9:22:18 <Zuriki> I had ninjas, soldiers, ghosts uh... floating eyeballs (that were square)...
A9:22:24 <Arzock> wow
A9:22:24 <Zuriki> And probably some others I forget.
A9:22:28 <Arzock> how did you make those?
A9:22:43 <Zuriki> Change the textures.
A9:22:43 <Snowman> I am turning the skeletons into alien controllers
A9:22:44 <Zuriki> :P
A9:22:52 <Zuriki> Aha.
A9:22:53 <Snowman> but they have a shitty model in hl1
A9:23:00 <Zuriki> My arrows are now yellow lines.
A9:23:05 <Zuriki> To look like crappy bullets.
A9:23:07 <Snowman> and for some reason, it has no model file, So I can't use the model viewer
A9:23:08 <Zuriki> :3
A9:23:17 <Snowman> My zrrows are just bullet models
A9:23:22 <Snowman> but a bit big :D
A9:23:30 <Marach> its BulletTime
A9:23:38 <Snowman> I also have a crowbar arm LD
A9:23:40 <Snowman> :D
A9:23:42 <Zuriki> Skeletons just have thinner arm pieces.
A9:23:43 <Arzock> somebody should make their arrows into large nipples
A9:23:44 <Marach> think of it like Matrix mod
A9:23:47 <Zuriki> Like 1.2 the size.
A9:23:49 <Zuriki> 1/2*
A9:24:01 <Snowman> Yeah I found out the hard way
A9:24:10 <Snowman> I wanted to turn them into soldiers that throw grenades
A9:24:17 <Zuriki> Heh.
A9:24:18 <Snowman> messed up legs FUUUUUUUUU
A9:24:30 <Snowman> So Now I'm turning them into alien controllers

A9:45:18 <Nohbdy> The Oddysey. Osyddius calls himself "Nohbdy" when he is captured by the cyclops... so when they finally blind the cyclops, they escape.. and the cyclops yell "Nohbdy's blinded me!" and etc.. which none of the other cyclops do anything because they think he means "Nobody".
A9:46:06 <Marach> lol
A9:46:09 <Nohbdy> :P
A9:46:25 <Nohbdy> I also have a last name for this.... it's "Ahtall".....Nohbdy Ahtall
A9:47:26 <Snowman> Yeah but I only read the Oddysey in greek
A9:47:35 <Snowman> And it's not Nohbdy in there
A9:47:49 <Nohbdy> What is it? It was in our book and the movie
A9:48:03 <Snowman> Oh idk
A9:48:05 <Snowman> long time ago
A9:48:33 <Nohbdy> Funny how the name "Xeros" actually sounds greek or something, but I just made it up long ago
A9:48:38 <Snowman> Οὔτις
A9:48:41 <Snowman> that's his name
A9:48:47 <Nohbdy> pronounced? haha
A9:48:50 <Snowman> well, the nobody, in greek

A9:49:43 <Snowman> Houtees
A9:49:54 <Snowman> Hard to pronounce in English
A9:51:18 <Snowman> Btw, Xeros looks a lot like Xenos, which means stranger in Greek

A10:00:22 <Iguana> Personally, parkour is more interesting than that...

A10:53:17 <PuyoDead> one of the "fails" was a terribly obvious photoshop
A10:53:38 <gordenfreechmen> they pretty much all are
A10:53:51 <PuyoDead> so, I pointed out the obviousness, and where you could see it. about 98% of the following comments were people bitching about people screaming "shopped!"

A10:56:34 <citricsquid> I submitted something to failblog once
A10:56:43 <citricsquid> it got featured, but no credit, so I assume someone else submitted before me.
A10:58:01 <PuyoDead> one was a drain I saw in a parking lot, that was elevated. hence, there was a giant pool of water surrounding it
A10:58:46 <PuyoDead> another was a walmart restroom, with the auto-flush thing on the toilet, but someone put that metal bad to hold on to in front of it

P12:05:42 <Haunter> maybe
P12:05:45 <]vede> Ugh.
P12:06:00 <]vede> Normally I'd just go get a CD and see if that works.
P12:06:02 <ZomBuster> try imgburn maybe that will work
P12:06:10 <]vede> But these retards don't HAVE any CDs.
P12:06:13 <]vede> Just DVDs.
P12:06:28 <ZomBuster> oh and check the MD5 checksum, maybe the iso is corrupted
P12:06:32 <Peerko> man... still 1999
P12:06:36 <Haunter> Last resort if they dont have cds is sadly uber hax :(
P12:06:38 <]vede> I know it's not corrupted.

P12:09:44 <Haunter> i thought it was 15$
P12:09:50 <]citricsquid> euros
P12:09:57 <offset> $18k only goes so far 
P12:10:05 <Haunter> for me it was 15.
P12:10:08 <Haunter> dollars
P12:10:14 <Haunter> converted
P12:10:16 <]citricsquid> Haunter: yes, 15$ is 10 euros
P12:10:21 <Haunter> :D
P12:10:28 <]vede> You paid 15 USD, but he only gets 40% of that, due to taxes and such.
P12:10:43 <]vede> 15 USD = 10 EUR
P12:10:43 <]citricsquid> So he's made 8k euros and, uh, 14k dollars. I think.
P12:10:53 <]vede> 10 EUR - 60%
P12:10:54 <Haunter> thats still pretty nice..
P12:11:05 <]vede> True.

P3:41:15 <]Snowman> your skin

P3:41:26 <Blackop2> that
P3:41:34 <Visiiri> Yes, that.
P3:41:45 <Visiiri> Not the skin, the skin is the texture placed on it.
P3:41:56 <]Snowman> Wait, you want to edit the model?
P3:42:00 <Visiiri> Yessir.
P3:42:04 <]Snowman> And how?
P3:42:10 <Visiiri> I haven't looked into it.
P3:42:12 <citricsquid> I assume that's clientside, but it'll be hard coded won't it?
P3:42:16 <]Snowman> because it is no model
P3:42:20 <]Snowman> it's hard coded

P4:29:37 <vede> Just the person.
P4:29:44 <Nohbdy> Wow...BORING lol :P
P4:29:57 <vede> But I think servers should be able to have custom textures, so all the players see it, too.
P4:30:08 <citricsquid> vede: apparently, the ircops got involved and he's not allowed back, dunno how they'd enforce that though.
P4:30:16 <Nohbdy> I hate not seeing what the majority is seeing.. because simple things like colors, or in this case textures, can change the psychiatric mood of a person.

P4:32:51 <vede> Quatroking, no, Notch doesn't want custom textures to ever be supported by Minecraft.

P4:33:02 <TestDummy> But other than that, we took no action against him.

P4:33:17 <TestDummy> Or rather, I should say the IRCop that was dealing with him did that.
P4:33:20 <Nohbdy> Singleplayer sounds fine for the texture thing I guess.. still something I wouldn't do just cause.
P4:33:20 <potato> oh
P4:33:43 <Visiiri> I had 1/2 pound of bacon, onions, cheese, and the best meat I've ever tasted.

P4:34:33 <Visiiri> Awww. TestVan isn't banned?

P4:35:12 <Nohbdy> Would this so called "The Archives" be a violater? I hear a lot about that

P4:35:27 <citricsquid> Nohbdy: archives is a custom server :)
P4:35:31 <vede> Seeing how it will forever be impossible to play Minecraft in any way except medieval fantasy.

P4:36:57 <Quatroking> cheeter
P4:37:08 <Nohbdy> That's a lot of people.... or maybe one extremely supportive Minecraft addict buying for his corporation
P4:37:12 <Peerko> except Notch already has told us that he won't implement custom tilesets
P4:37:17 <Peerko> I do not, citricsquid
P4:37:22 <]Snowman> notch doesn't want people downloading files from servers
P4:37:26 <citricsquid> oh, you didn't?
P4:37:29 <Peerko> I couldn't think of a new account
P4:37:38 <Peerko> I would if I would
P4:37:39 <vede> Right, because we definitely don't download the map file from the server.
P4:37:39 <citricsquid> The reason he doesn't want it is because of screenshots, that's what he said.
P4:37:44 <citricsquid> He wants the game to look the same everywhere
P4:37:45 <Real> ]Snowman = Snowman?
P4:37:50 <citricsquid> Real: yeah
P4:37:50 <]Snowman> Well duh
P4:37:51 <vede> If he wants t maintain screenshots, he's already failed.
P4:38:06 <]Snowman> ] makes a party hat Real
P4:38:12 <Peerko> and the reason that he doesn't want to log in to a server and all the tiles would be all weird and fscked
P4:38:14 <Nohbdy> This is off-topic, but quick question... has anyone here used "Tomb Raider Level Editor"? lol
P4:38:20 <vede> People can make Minecraft screenshots with Doom textures or whatever they want already.
P4:38:30 <Quatroking> only 3,5% of the minecraft community paid for the game
P4:38:33 <Quatroking> wow.
P4:38:41 <Real> ]Snowman: Innovative.
P4:38:51 <citricsquid> vede: he doesn't want http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2162 things like this to have graphics that aren't his own
P4:38:58 <vede> The ] party hat was actually developed at the 1000 purchase mark.
P4:39:00 <citricsquid> so he doesn't want to see magazine articles with god awful custom textures
P4:39:04 <Real> So what was all that about TestVan, citricsquid?
P4:39:17 <vede> Uh...
P4:39:24 <Quatroking> citricsquid: since when do magazines use mods in their games when taking screenshots
P4:39:36 <vede> So he thinks that someone would seriously confuse a texmod for the actual game?

P4:39:41 <Peerko> hey wait a minute..
P4:39:41 <citricsquid> Quatroking: vede is talking about servers being able to provide their own tileset
10P4:39:44 * Peerko is now known as ]Peerko
P4:39:48 <]Peerko> there :)
P4:39:48 <citricsquid> so you'd, as a player, have no choice.
P4:39:52 <Quatroking> servers shouldn't be able to do that
P4:40:00 <Quatroking> never
P4:40:01 <Nohbdy> Yeah if I had a new game coming out, I suppose I wouldn't want random people finding the game, taking screenshots of custom worlds, and then "advertising" them in their magazine or something when it isn't a part of the game.
P4:40:03 <citricsquid> Quatroking: exactly what Notch is saying and vede is disagreeing with :)
P4:40:17 <Quatroking> wait what
P4:40:21 <vede> I think that people should be able to make texture mods for Minecraft.
P4:40:24 <Quatroking> hold on

P4:40:34 <Quatroking> who wants server-enforced mods and who doesn't?
P4:40:45 <citricsquid> Quatroking: Notch DOES NOT want servers to provide their own textures
P4:40:46 <vede> I just want custom textures.
P4:40:48 <citricsquid> vede DOES want it
P4:40:53 <Quatroking> ah, okay
P4:40:57 <Quatroking> then I'm on notch's side
P4:41:02 <vede> Whether or not servers can force it on people is not my point.
P4:41:03 <]Snowman> For some themed servers it would be useful
P4:41:04 <Quatroking> mods are supposed to be client-side
P4:41:06 <citricsquid> and notch gave the reason that all screenshots will look different.
P4:41:16 <Quatroking> except for lua mods of course
P4:41:20 <vede> But I think the game should support custom tilesets.
P4:41:32 <Quatroking> but then again I doubt we're even getting lua this year
P4:41:43 <Quatroking> vede: clientside, that is.
P4:41:47 <]Peerko> it will as soon as MC becomes public domain
P4:41:57 <Quatroking> just open up the jarfile and throw in some custom textures
P4:41:57 <citricsquid> peerko: public domain?
P4:42:18 <vede> And I'd like a way for servers to send textures to clients.
P4:42:25 <vede> For large mods.
P4:42:25 <]Peerko> see the about page, citricsquid 
P4:42:46 <citricsquid> Do you mean open source?
P4:42:47 <vede> I mean, almost every multiplayer game in existence has servers with special maps or textures.
P4:42:55 <citricsquid> because open source won't be until everyone stops buying, it's years away.
P4:43:04 <vede> And you can't play on the server without using the textures.
P4:43:16 <mail2345> @vede ask people to dl the textur

P4:44:16 <]Snowman> it could be useful it you could have an EXTRA tileset

P4:44:31 <]Snowman> like have 15 blocks that are normall blank
P4:44:39 <citricsquid> you'd get problems with people swapping textures; sponge being admin etc,
P4:44:40 <]Snowman> but you can texture them
P4:44:46 <Nohbdy> And it'd say "Download this tileset to see the world as it was meant to be seen: [link]"
P4:44:51 <]Peerko> or you could just mod the downloaded client

P4:45:06 <]Peerko> and post instructions somewhere
P4:45:11 <vede> Right, because I guess we can assume that if custom server textures are implemented, EVERY SERVER IN EXISTENCE will use custom textures.
P4:45:25 <vede> AND that servers with mods don't have any flags stating that.
P4:45:26 <citricsquid> yes, the majority of the community will
P4:45:29 <]Snowman> Peerko, you can't distribute the client
P4:45:34 <]Snowman> Notch doesnt want that
P4:45:39 <Quatroking> Jim says... "I never really played a game I just stand here looking cool"
P4:45:51 <Quatroking> -PC Gamer
P4:45:52 <]Peerko> no but you can mod what you fetch from the site
P4:45:54 <citricsquid> vede: remember most people are <15 and will love to make it exactly how they want. I like consistency.
P4:46:04 <vede> So...
P4:46:14 <vede> Can I assume you don't play any multiplayer FPS games?
P4:46:16 <citricsquid> joining a server to find sponge textured as admin blocks, water as lava etc would be fucking awful.
P4:46:35 <vede> That server would most likely be very unpopular.
P4:46:42 <mail2345> lol@that on survival
P4:46:46 <citricsquid> vede: first impressions count
P4:46:49 <vede> And probably most texmods would be to change the THEME of the game, not piss people off.
P4:46:53 <Quatroking> brb gotta poop
P4:46:55 <citricsquid> so a new player finding that would assume all the games are like that
P4:46:57 <citricsquid> and ragequit minecraft
P4:46:59 <Quatroking> b-day poop
P4:47:10 <Nohbdy> and that's a good point on citric's part.. and there goes a mood killer from quatro
P4:47:10 <vede> citricsquid, that's stupid.
P4:47:33 <citricsquid> vede: maybe I'm not a normal gamer, but if I'd joined minecraft and been frustrated by it I wouldn't have come back.
P4:47:45 <vede> ALSO, you think servers wouldn't be FLAGGED (note: F-L-A-G-G-E-D) for having mods?
P4:48:11 <vede> Like, you know, in a server browser that doesn't suck entirely?

P4:48:51 <citricsquid> when I posted about minecraft on a forum, I linked to my server
P4:48:53 <vede> Where you can see little things off to the right like "CT" (for Custom Textures) or "H" (for Huge map).
P4:48:56 <Nohbdy> Oh no, a spy!
P4:48:57 <citricsquid> people formed impressions based entirely on that server

P4:49:34 <Animator> The amount of input given is enough to start it. Just need to make a logo.
P4:49:40 <vede> citricsquid, so you think a new Minecraft player will go looking for server links on a forum, and manage to find one who both has NO screenshots, and says NOTHING AT ALL about any texture mods on their server?
P4:49:45 <Animator> Maybe a skin, for fun.
P4:49:47 <Nohbdy> I once used a program called Anim8or... that was before I even thought of thinking I could try 3DS Max..then I learned about torrents and pirating....

P4:50:40 <Quatroking> Fuck this, I'm getting rid of the structure articles
P4:50:41 <vede> Maybe they should LEARN TO READ and see that the forum thread says crap about how it's using a TEXTURE MOD.

P4:52:16 <vede> OMFG Minecraft won't be a browser game forever!
P4:52:18 <citricsquid> the only way they could work is if it was automatically off and optional, to switch them to on.

P4:52:44 <vede> Even when you play it in a browser.

P4:55:11 <vede> citricsquid, you're making a point to change the whole game based on a few very, very specific instances.
P4:55:11 <citricsquid> that's the minecraft userbase - in general
P4:55:24 <Nohbdy> has not only to do with virus.. but the very small but very important "convenience".... there are HUNDREDS of small game client programs that I can download and NEVER try.. but if they're in the BROWSER.. it's like "well ok let me try this out"
P4:55:50 <vede> "Well hey, what if I send a link without any information to a person to a server that has custom textures and they don't like them."
P4:55:52 <]Snowman> lol citric, I gave you the link to garry switching to torrents :p
P4:55:54 <Nohbdy> it's like a one-click deal when looking through games.
P4:56:08 <citricsquid> ]Snowman: I had fun in that thread.
P4:56:43 <vede> Nohbdy, over 99% of all indie games you can find on the internet require you to download them.
P4:56:57 <LG_Legacy> Wheres the other %?
P4:57:02 <vede> Saying that having to download things is a negative is like saying having to breathe is a negative.
P4:57:17 <Animator> Vede's right.
P4:57:19 <Nohbdy> Exactly... and I download like 1$ of em.. but if they're browser based it costs me like so little effort that I might as well try it out.
P4:57:24 <Nohbdy> 1%
P4:57:39 <vede> The other % is indie games that get really big and can end up store shelves.
P4:57:46 <vede> *on store shelves
P4:57:52 <Animator> Like Cave Story.
P4:57:56 <Animator> And La-Mulana.
P4:58:02 <vede> ... Both of those are free.
P4:58:03 <Nohbdy> so apparently Minecraft is nowhere in the percent, and therefore not a game?

P4:58:23 <Animator> As well.
P4:58:26 <vede> So... you're still going to have to download them.
P4:58:32 <Nohbdy> I ended up playing Evony because it's used in a browser... something I'd never try if it were a download
P4:58:32 <Animator> But not for free!
P4:58:38 <vede> So?
P4:58:51 <Nohbdy> I don't have to download anything when I'm using minecraft.. it does that stuff for you
P4:58:52 <vede> I was saying that they'd require downloads, not their price.
P4:59:13 <vede> Nohbdy, so?
P4:59:21 <vede> Seriously, it DOESN'T MATTER.
P4:59:23 <Animator> So I'm using your "that percent is the one that gets on store shelves" example!
P4:59:39 <vede> Store shelves just meant you don't have to fucking download it.
P4:59:52 <Quatroking> Guys, what do you think about the minecraft "sports" on this page? http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Gameplay
P5:00:07 <Animator> Oh.
P5:00:12 <vede> If you people are just going to go crazy and make up insane situations or say that having to download things sucks, it's obvious you can't be convinced of anything at all.
P5:00:12 <Nohbdy> So.. the difference between "clicking a link" and playing immediately vs. clicking a link, saving it, installing it, and opening it. And if you're in a huge list of games like minecraft might possibly be in.. the browser based ones will probably be the first to be tried since they don't require any of that
P5:00:21 <Quatroking> I think Spleef is the only one worth being on that list even while its a gay thing to do
P5:00:32 <]Snowman> Rugby needs more detail
P5:00:32 <Animator> I find spleef a bit fun.
P5:00:50 <Animator> Why do you hate spleef, anyway?
P5:01:01 <]Snowman> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/CheckCraft
P5:01:05 <vede> Nohbdy, yes, I agree, obviously games that aren't browser based are all not worth the work or download time.
P5:01:15 <Quatroking> Probably because I fail at it and due to the fact of it being hilariously overrated
P5:01:17 <vede> And should be disregarded in any argument.
P5:01:40 <Zuriki> Spleef died.
P5:01:43 <Nohbdy> I remember I used to look for games ALL the time as a kid, and I passed many interesting games for games that were easier to try out faster.
P5:01:43 <Zuriki> It was a fad.
P5:02:07 <Animator> I wish I could still get back my old map.
P5:02:09 <vede> Trying to say having to download games is bad is completely stupid.
P5:02:14 <Nohbdy> Especially those "Top 100" and etc lists.. which I'm sure Minecraft will be a part of cuz it's the cool :P
10P5:02:16 * mail2345|afk is now known as mail2345
P5:02:28 <Animator> Quatroking, you could complie all the sports into 1 page.
P5:02:29 <vede> Spelunky required a download, and that's freaking HUGE.
P5:02:36 <citricsquid> vede: It's impossible to deny that the easier the game is to pay, the more likely it is to be played. 
P5:02:39 <Quatroking> Animator: yup.
P5:02:40 <Siiseli> haha vede 
P5:02:46 <citricsquid> easier to play*
P5:02:58 <Nohbdy> Since when did I say it was BAD!? Did you miss the first point, where I'm in the perspective of the average lazy user who is looking through a large list of games, bored wanting something to do?
P5:03:06 <Animator> The ones that require more in-depth rules and descriptions merit their own page.
P5:03:28 <Animator> But only the ones that require more than one or two paragraphs.
P5:03:45 <Quatroking> then i can just as well delete them all besides spleef
P5:03:51 <vede> Nohbdy...
P5:03:57 <vede> You said having to download was a turn-off.
P5:04:05 <Nohbdy> I will be sure to add the prefix phrase "If I was the average lazy user looking for a game to play..." to make myself clear of course >.>
P5:04:09 <Animator> Not deleting, but combining.
P5:04:17 <Siiseli> I hardly ever play browser games
P5:04:19 <Nohbdy> Yeha it's a turn-off "in comparison" to a browser based game
P5:04:23 <Siiseli> usually they're not worth my time
P5:04:23 <Animator> Deleting is a negative word and it'll give off the wrong idea.
P5:04:33 <vede> And the difference between applet games and download games' number of plays is almost negligible anyway.
P5:05:12 <Nohbdy> Well luckily Siiseli, most people looking for games the old fashioned way don't have the experience to know that browser games usually aren't as good.
P5:05:25 <Siiseli> Nohbdy, silly people
P5:05:27 <Animator> I don't see why you people are fighting about downloading and browser download times. Games are usually judged by content anyway.
P5:05:37 <Animator> Like the TouHou games. *shudder*
P5:05:39 <vede> Animator, I'm trying to say that.
P5:05:44 <Animator> Oh.
P5:05:49 <Animator> Then what the hell?
P5:05:49 <Siiseli> Animator, touhou was fun but touhou fans are retards, generally
P5:05:52 <Quatroking> HEY GUYS LETS PLAY GTA IV ONLINE, BROWSER-BASED LOPLOLOLOLOL
P5:05:54 <vede> I don't even know what the fuck we're arguing about, actually.
P5:05:57 <Siiseli> some touhou games at least were fun
P5:05:58 <Quatroking> IN JAVA
P5:05:59 <Quatroking> WOOO
P5:06:01 <Quatroking> Nah
P5:06:03 <Nohbdy> Yeah I know, but my perspective was "looking through a list of games"... in which highly doubtfully you will go through and try every one
P5:06:04 <Quatroking> Doesn't work right.
P5:06:06 <citricsquid> I got totally lost ages ago
P5:06:27 <Quatroking> I play a flash game once in a while
P5:06:32 <Quatroking> Dadgame is pretty funny.
P5:06:33 <Zuriki> Anyone played The Path?
P5:06:34 <Animator> Siiseli, the dialouge in those games weird me out overall. I dunno whether to blame translation issues or not.
P5:06:44 <Animator> But the bosses... Oh God, the bosses.
P5:06:45 <citricsquid> Zuriki: e friend told me to play that, any good?
P5:06:50 <citricsquid> Quatroking: hated the gameplay
P5:06:53 <Siiseli> Animator, I don't give a fuck about the dialog but the gameplay is fun
P5:06:57 <Animator> That was some craaaaazy shit.
P5:06:58 <Zuriki> It's not like fun.
P5:06:59 <vede> Nohbdy, so you're making an argument based on an extremely lazy user finding a big list of completely different games as a reason for Minecraft to stay in a browser?
P5:07:02 <Zuriki> It's not really a game.
P5:07:05 <vede> ...
P5:07:06 <Siiseli> and Animator I never played below insane difficulty
P5:07:17 <vede> Extremely specific situations are hardly good in an argument.
P5:07:19 <Siiseli> I was actually kind of good at touhou games but then I went all meh on them
P5:07:21 <Animator> Because you're probably good at it.
P5:07:25 <Zuriki> Basically you walk around a huge woodland finding POIs
P5:07:26 <Siiseli> I have a huge fetish for hard games :3
P5:07:28 <Nohbdy> You don't have to be "extremely lazy" to decide whether to play a game that requires an installation vs. a link
P5:07:28 <Quatroking> citricsquid: yeah, but still, it was fun to destroy a mall and rocking out really hard
P5:07:37 <vede> Um, yes, you do.
P5:07:45 <Animator> I'd usually go for normal on TouHou.
P5:07:52 <citricsquid> Quatroking: I got to the bit where you climb up a building on platforms with that helicopter and got bored.
P5:07:52 <vede> Do you have very little or no experience at all with indie games?
P5:07:54 <Quatroking> citricsquid: and I loved the final boss cameo
P5:08:14 <Quatroking> citricsquid: have you seen his first animation on newgrounds?
P5:08:15 <citricsquid> vede: You seem to assume that minecraft players are all coming with the "This is an indie game, it will be awesome" mindset.
P5:08:16 <Quatroking> with the little robot
P5:08:19 <citricsquid> Quatroking: of course :D
P5:08:24 <citricsquid> wait, uh
P5:08:28 <citricsquid> I thought you meant first DAD
P5:08:29 <vede> Where would you possibly get that, citricsquid?
P5:08:36 <vede> I'm just assuming they know it's a damn indie game.
P5:08:55 <Quatroking> citricsquid: no, walk-smash-walk
P5:09:03 <citricsquid> vede: as a casual gamer, someone who doesn't give a fuck about the history of a game just if it's fun, I would be more likely to play minecraft if it was browser based than a download.
P5:09:04 <Animator> People that like Indie Bands probably think the same way.
P5:09:05 <Quatroking> citricsquid: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/193426
P5:09:06 <Nohbdy> If I saw a small list of interesting games... and there was a category "no download required" and "download required"...(and if the website was smart enough to let you sort those categories)... I'd try out the NON downloads first... because they require very little time to try out
P5:09:09 <citricsquid> I rarely download games, but often play browser based.
P5:09:22 <Animator> AH GOD SO MANY CONVERSATIONS AT THE SAME TIME THE HEADACHE.
P5:09:23 <vede> So...
P5:09:30 <Zuriki> I wonder what games I have but not downloaded on steam..
P5:09:34 <vede> So that's a good reason for Minecraft to remain browser-based forever?
P5:09:42 <vede> What the fuck are we arguing about anyway?
P5:09:54 <Animator> Let's talk about pie.
P5:10:00 <citricsquid> vede: I didn't say it should be browser based entirely, but if it was stand alone only it'd scare away a lot of casual players.
P5:10:04 <Nohbdy> Um no.. the point was making Minecraft primarily a download client...
P5:10:11 <Quatroking> citricsquid: the enormous robot in walk-smash-walk is the final boss in Dadgame :P
P5:10:13 <Siiseli> how about both
P5:10:14 <citricsquid> I'm just saying that if possible a browser based game should always exist.
P5:10:16 <Nohbdy> which is added onto the point of your custom worlds
P5:10:20 <citricsquid> Siiseli: both would be perfect.
P5:10:22 <Animator> Citric, what if we had bot- DAMN IT SIISELI.
P5:10:27 <Siiseli> Animator, :D
P5:10:34 <Animator> ;_;
13P5:10:41 * Siiseli pats
P5:10:44 <Zuriki> ...
P5:10:53 <vede> Also, regarding your first-impression thing...
P5:10:58 <Zuriki> Some security is needed for survival etc
P5:11:03 <Nohbdy> I agree with both, but the browser-based would have to be the "primary" method of playing and not the secondary.. because non-browser clients just have more capability that you can't always copy in browser mode
P5:11:03 <vede> Does that mean servers like the archives should not be allowed?

P5:11:44 <Colain> So people are getting survival free..
P5:11:45 <Animator> A very bad line.

P5:12:10 <mail2345> too bad notch is in indonesia
P5:12:13 <Zuriki> I think it's sad that people can't pay for an indie game.
P5:12:17 <mail2345> so he can't remove them from the list
P5:12:18 <Nohbdy> It means Minecraft is the populorz.. :P
P5:12:18 <TestDummy> I wouldn't go as far as to say it was deserved, just that it was to be expected.
P5:12:19 <Quatroking> he should have his HTC with him
P5:12:22 <Quatroking> I could Tweet him
P5:12:28 <vede> Hm, okay.
P5:12:28 <citricsquid> Notch doesn't mind people playing for free if they genuinely can't afford it
P5:12:32 <citricsquid> I think that's what he said.
P5:12:35 <Colain> Tweet him then/
P5:12:38 <citricsquid> Quatroking: no reception :)
P5:12:39 <Quatroking> silly notch
P5:12:42 <Zuriki> But supplying the game for free is bad.
P5:12:44 <vede> Yeah, he said he only wants people who CAN pay to pay.
P5:12:51 <Colain> It is priacy.
P5:12:57 <Zuriki> Asking Notch for the game for free
P5:12:58 <citricsquid> vede: yeah, you'd have to be a fucking cunt to distribute it though.
P5:12:58 <Nohbdy> Aw really!? I can't genuinely afford it... but I can't genuinely run it either so playing isn't a problem with me yet x.x
P5:13:08 <mail2345> okay

P5:17:31 <Nohbdy> That actually makes sense for certain people. I mean some people who would have to pay for the game, that had no alternative in getting the game, would simply not get it. So they'd either A. Not touch the game or B. Pirate the game. No money loss is true... BUT..

P5:19:16 <vede> Also, Snowman, I do that as well.

P5:19:19 <Quatroking> colain: what is your source
P5:19:21 <Colain> I'm trying to buy Minecraft for asie.
P5:19:26 <vede> Most indie developers and Valve I refuse to pirate from.
P5:19:32 <Colain> Some people from the archives irc.
P5:19:32 <]Peerko> ]Snowman: massa is kassa
P5:19:34 <Quatroking> snowman: burnout paradise is lovely tho
P5:19:39 <Quatroking> you have to admit that
P5:19:43 <]Snowman> I respect developers who invest a lot of effort in making their game awesome
P5:19:54 <citricsquid> I refuse to pirate if I can afford it. Justifying piracy is always bad, but if you can genuinely not afford it I won't judge you for pirating.
P5:19:56 <]Snowman> never played it, I have played flatout: Ultimate Carnage though
P5:20:00 <vede> I have no care for how much work or effort is used.
P5:20:09 <vede> I care about the developer's respectability.
P5:20:09 <]Snowman> citricsquid, If I had to buy every EA game
P5:20:17 <]Snowman> I would lose like 500 dollars a month
P5:20:28 <Zuriki> If I think a game is worth the money
P5:20:29 <]Snowman> And most of them arent even awesome, they're just mediocre quality
P5:20:30 <Nohbdy> I remember when I used to play Game Maker... and then they TOOK OUT features and made you have to pay. And then "YoYo Games" took over and made new Game maker versions really hard to crack...idk what my point is..but yeah haha
P5:20:31 <Zuriki> I'll buy iy
P5:20:36 <Zuriki> But I will pirate first.
P5:20:38 <citricsquid> ]Snowman: Don't play them then.
P5:20:53 <]Snowman> Well I like some games of em
P5:20:53 <Quatroking> I pretty much only pirate stuff I cannot afford (Adobe CS4 Master Collection for example) and games I want to try
P5:21:08 <Quatroking> many games I liked after having played it are now in my game library, legal.
P5:21:12 <]Snowman> Like Mirror's Edge, awesome game, great gameplay, but the story sucked and it was way too short
P5:21:13 <Nohbdy> I do indeed like pirating as a "try before you buy"... because a lot of crap that I pirate... I use once or a few times and never use again
P5:21:15 <vede> I pirate nearly everything I play that isn't free.
P5:21:28 <Quatroking> snowman: I kept loosing track of where I was going
P5:21:33 <vede> Of course, nearly everything I play is free anyway.
P5:21:33 <]Snowman> I wouldn't shell out 65 bucks for that, just to play it for 3 days and then never play it again
P5:21:43 <Siiseli> I pirate merchandise ships

P5:28:49 <Quatroking> brb masterbating
P5:28:51 <Nohbdy> Understanding the layout of a place is silly in my opinion. I wish there were great multiplayer FPS games with VERY random maps. Because you don't usually get "good at the game" as much as you do get "good at the map you're playing"
P5:29:05 <Animator> You know the guy?

P5:29:22 <Animator> Siiseli, you know the guy?
P5:29:32 <Siiseli> Animator, am friends with the guy
P5:29:36 <Animator> That's crazy.
P5:29:37 <Nohbdy> You remember where weapon spawns are, eventually where players respawn...etc.. it's quite unrealistic but that's because I compare games to a "what if" real life.
P5:29:42 <mail2345> @citirc, viewing a post
P5:29:44 <citricsquid> srsly guys, if you have a problem explain, is that the forum?
P5:29:52 <Quatroking> Yeah

P5:36:22 <Nohbdy> And then Runescape had Java... I loved Runescape... but it's obvious that Java "isn't" my destined language to make the kinda games I want to make
P5:36:42 <Siiseli> haha, I hate runescape..
P5:36:43 <Nohbdy> but of course I will learn it since I will be told to do things as a programmer, not make em up myself
P5:36:57 <vede> Nohbdy, be awesome and make games for yourself.
P5:37:11 <Siiseli> only programming languages I really know are as3,php,java,c++
P5:37:13 <vede> Screw companies that tell you what to do.
P5:37:22 <Nohbdy> Oh hell yeah.. maybe after working for a company for a while though. to pick up some tips n tricks and really hone my skillzorz
P5:37:34 <vede> Why do that?
P5:37:42 <Nohbdy> Because you get paid lotz?
P5:37:44 <Siiseli> cos' being indie is hard?
P5:37:59 <vede> Unless you want all your money to be from making games...
P5:38:00 <Siiseli> as3 I've done as a job
P5:38:16 <Nohbdy> Didja know being Lead Programmer has a "normal" salary of $120k :D

P5:40:03 <Siiseli> yup
P5:40:20 <Nohbdy> Well cool... I had the lovely destiny of ending up being very poor so I had to start late ^.^
P5:40:20 <Siiseli> but reeally I've wasted alot of time, only recently got into openGL
P5:40:24 <vede> When you're just starting out, you really probably should just stick to trying to get programs to ask questions and stuff.
P5:40:28 <Siiseli> yay
P5:40:34 <vede> Actually doing anything useful is out of the question.
P5:40:47 <Nohbdy> Ask questions!? That's freakin easy peasy :P
P5:40:49 <vede> Nohbdy, I'm poor too.
P5:41:01 <Siiseli> vede, why bother when you can learn the basics
P5:41:05 <Siiseli> ifs fors and other loops
P5:41:10 <Siiseli> etc.
P5:41:12 <Nohbdy> And yet you can play Minecraft.... on obviously a better computer lol
P5:41:24 <Siiseli> and then you can get allegro
P5:41:26 <Siiseli> and do graphics
P5:41:27 <vede> Yeah, a better computer I got just a couple months ago.
P5:41:33 <Nohbdy> most money I've been up to was $200.. and that's from our richer branches of family
P5:41:33 <Siiseli> graphical way to learn stuff is the best way
P5:41:38 <citricsquid> Dunno why, but I've never been interested in making games.
P5:41:40 <vede> I was using a GeForce 5600 before then.
P5:41:44 <Siiseli> Nohbdy, get a job
P5:41:49 <vede> With an amazing 1GHz processor.
P5:42:04 <Siiseli> I saved up for 2 years as a kid to get my own computer
P5:42:06 <Siiseli> ;P
P5:42:08 <Nohbdy> How many people miss my stories haha? You see the "job" thing...
P5:42:18 <Siiseli> and Nohbdy if you want money make a flash game
P5:42:28 <vede> Most money I've been up to was $300
P5:42:35 <vede> And that was my dad's unemployment money.
P5:42:48 <Nohbdy> my dad works 14 hours a day as a cable guy that he's had over who knows how muxh experience with.. and he gets less money than the average teenage employee
P5:42:59 <Nohbdy> like over 5 years..maybe 8
P5:43:01 <citricsquid> Nohbdy: :|
P5:43:04 <citricsquid> How is that possible?
P5:43:11 <citricsquid> Unless he gets under the minimum wage
P5:43:23 <Nohbdy> Idk.. used to work for Direct TV.. then COX bought the company.. he gets paid half of what he used to
P5:43:34 <Nohbdy> he gets paid by the job not by the hour
P5:43:44 <vede> Average teenage employee gets nearly minimum wage, and doesn't even work full-time.
P5:44:01 <vede> If your dad works 14 hours a day and doesn't make as much as an average teenage employee, there's problems somewhere.
P5:44:04 <Animator> Heh, Cox.
P5:44:13 <Nohbdy> I'm still waiting for my mom to get enough money so I can go take the GED test... then I'll get a job.
P5:44:23 <Nohbdy> but my mom doesn't live with us anymore, tis fine
P5:44:26 <Eagle> Animator: ...
P5:44:26 <Animator> You can blame the cox for lowering his wage.

P11:13:09 <clone1018> Don't ask for ops
P11:13:10 <liq3> yeh.
P11:13:11 <TestDummy> I'm an oper, I can tell the server to give them to me.
P11:13:12 <liq3> i'm not.
P11:13:14 <vede> He's an espernet op.

P11:13:34 <TestDummy> Normally, I'm not supposed to be doing that.
P11:13:45 <vede> It's okay, I don't think anyone here minds.
P11:13:46 <TestDummy> But since all of your regular ops were AFK, I could intervene.
P11:13:47 <Kratospie> why?

P11:14:13 <liq3> hehe.
P11:14:22 <TestDummy> This is also why I can't lift bans just because you guys say so.
P11:14:26 <Drakkar> welp
P11:14:27 <Drakkar> too late
P11:14:34 <vede> Augh.
P11:14:38 <TestDummy> Yes, I am capable of carrying out the action, but I have to respect what a chan ops wants.
P11:14:40 <Drakkar> i was afi
P11:14:42 <vede> Drakkar, we need moe ops.
P11:14:44 <Drakkar> (away from irc)

P11:15:03 <LG_Legacy> I'll try to get someone to do it
P11:15:05 <TestDummy> Because that'd possibly be against what the chan ops and founder wants.
P11:15:09 <TrueWolves> Nice to know you don't abuse powers test! =D *knew an ircop who did that once...*
P11:15:09 <Griskard> Drakkar, you need to op everyone who asks to prevent any trouble on IRC!
P11:15:10 <vede> Oh puh-leeze, he won't care.
P11:15:15 <Griskard> Or it will cause trouble. Im not sure
P11:15:17 <Griskard> Meh
P11:15:22 <Drakkar> god no
P11:15:45 <Griskard> Hehe

P11:16:18 <Griskard> Anyone got some nice private servers going?

P11:16:27 <Kratospie> if everyone got op, it would be like minemaster taking control of the IRC

P11:28:40 <vede> But kicking retards as channel op is not frowned upon.
P11:28:50 <vede> channel op would most likely not be abused.
P11:29:09 <vede> Server op WOULD, because having to yield power to channel ops would be REALLY hard.
