Session Ident: #minecraft
10P5:52:06 * Now talking in #minecraft
10P5:52:06 * Topic is 'http://www.minecraft.net/  |  Forums and Wiki down, back soon.  |  I did this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIm_AKUbqh8  |  I'll be online Thursday and Friday.'
10P5:52:06 * Set by Notch!Notch@h-77-240.A165.priv.bahnhof.se on Tue Aug 04 14:18:10
P5:52:27 <Azjherben> O wow
P5:52:33 <Real> I know about the Dev Blog, thank you. I know what he did with the game today. But on IRC he answers many small questions that he wouldn't post on his blog. These answers would be posted by someone on the forums normally, but seeing as the forums are currently down, I figured I'd ask here.
P5:52:34 <Azjherben> The new mode looks awesome
P5:53:17 <doohan> It sure does Azjherben 
P5:53:55 <Azjherben> What's the third block in his inventory?
P5:54:39 <doohan> Logs?
P5:54:44 <Daveisawesome> ores?
P5:54:47 <doohan> The stuff the trees are made out of
P5:54:59 <doohan> Yeah and then later ores :)
10P5:55:08 * Niko (thegamingp@70.114.225.168) has joined #minecraft
P5:55:09 <doohan> Looks like coal to me.
P5:55:36 <Niko> hi guys
P5:55:41 <Daveisawesome> i see the name survival.. anyone know what you survive from?
P5:56:15 <Niko> zombies!

P5:56:29 <Daveisawesome> how would zombies hurt you...
P5:56:30 <fleshBasedProcessor> Anyone on here an ob on Kinoss's servers?
P5:56:47 <Niko> Have you never seen a zombie movie?
P5:57:06 <MoDx> They randomly infect you
P5:57:06 <doohan> Daveisawesome, fast zombies
P5:57:11 <doohan> The kind from 28 days later
P5:57:16 <doohan> That run and bite you up and stuff.
P5:57:19 <fleshBasedProcessor> Daveisawesome, stop asking so many question I doubt Notch knows very much himself yet. Go look in the archives in his blog, he describes his vision for survival somewhere in there.
10P5:57:25 * freddie-- (freddie@h-36-38.A204.priv.bahnhof.se) has joined #minecraft
P5:57:49 <Daveisawesome> ...it was a retorical question
P5:57:50 <Dudebro> There's also a big thing about that kind of stuff on the wiki
P5:57:58 <Dudebro> But I think the wiki is down as well.
P5:58:07 <Daveisawesome> i only asked 1 thing
P5:58:26 <doohan> Yeah wiki and forums down but citric thinks they'll be back up in a day or so.
P5:58:29 <Dudebro> AND YOU'RE A BAD PERSON FOR DOING SO
P5:58:56 <Daveisawesome> shut up noob
P5:58:58 <MoDx> http://notch.tumblr.com/post/123343045/my-vision-for-survival
P5:59:03 <Daveisawesome> i don't even care about survival mode
P5:59:06 <Dudebro> I'm kidding.

10P5:59:22 * freddie-- is now known as freddie
P5:59:22 <Daveisawesome> all i care about is how its prolly going to break what i got for my custom server so far
P5:59:57 <doohan> Well that the price you pay for early access I guess.
P6:00:06 <Azjherben> I wish Notch would release what he gets.
P6:00:20 <Azjherben> I want to collect resources now
P6:00:24 <doohan> He'll realese an update when it's ready :)
P6:00:29 <doohan> Though it does look promising
P6:00:33 <Snowman> OMG FORUMS ARE UP AGAIN!
P6:00:44 <Quatroking> yay
P6:00:56 <Snowman> Hmmm...
P6:01:01 <Snowman> noone fell for it :/
P6:01:02 <Quatroking> nah they aren't
P6:01:08 <Quatroking> dick
P6:01:11 <Snowman> :D
P6:01:12 <Hideous> I've met Notch! He is cool.
P6:01:19 <Quatroking> I've met Notch too
P6:01:20 <vede> I find comic series (plural) strange in that they seem able to just go on FOREVER AND EVER.
P6:01:21 <Quatroking> in fact
P6:01:25 <Quatroking> he lives in my basement
P6:01:29 <Daveisawesome> i fell for it..
P6:01:32 <Hideous> Haha
P6:01:36 <Hideous> His beard is awesome.

P6:02:11 <vede> I recently gained an appreciation for comic books as a medium of entertainment, and looked into a particular series on a recommendation, and saw that it's been going for TWENTY FREAKIN YEARS.
P6:02:18 <Hideous> time to sleep

P6:05:57 <doohan> :)
P6:07:14 <Real> Someone was asking for OPs of Kinoss servers earlier?
P6:08:06 <doohan> fleshBasedProcessor
P6:08:24 <fleshBasedProcessor> the underworld reborn one
P6:08:32 <Real> what about it?
P6:08:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> I was asking for an op for it
P6:09:06 <Real> for what reason...
P6:09:19 <fleshBasedProcessor> its been sealed off for a whole day, and I wish to play on it
P6:09:48 <Real> Kinoss may have a reason for the sealing.
10P6:09:57 * Mitchcm34 (Mitchcm34@c-75-66-179-168.hsd1.tn.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P6:10:06 <Real> He was resizing it before and may still need to do so.
P6:10:11 <Mitchcm34> Hi everyone, awesome new video on dev blog !!!
P6:10:20 <doohan> Hey Mitchcm34 
P6:10:30 <Real> Yep, we know.
P6:10:38 <fleshBasedProcessor> I think it is just a lack of ops. When it first got clossed off yesterday that was the only reason.
P6:10:40 <Real> It's also advertised in the greeting for this channel.
P6:10:42 <Mitchcm34> Is that going to be coming soon?
10P6:11:00 * Nalok (gdhammerbo@pool-71-176-170-10.hgrtmd.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
P6:11:06 <doohan> Mitchcm34, I guess notch would say: When it's ready.
P6:11:08 <Mitchcm34> I wasn't telling everyone to watch it Real, I was saying its awesome....
P6:11:10 <Nalok> Where's Notch?
P6:11:13 <doohan> Bed
P6:11:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> probly not unless he wants to give a few servers or singleplayer a pre-relesas. there is lots of stuff to add
P6:11:17 <Nalok> :/
P6:11:25 <doohan> It's after 1am where he is
P6:11:32 <doohan> And he has to go to work in the morning.
P6:11:37 <Nalok> Oh, hey Citric, what's the new NG server?

P6:12:18 <Eagle> INSAAANE
P6:12:30 <Nalok> Kumguat
P6:12:37 <fleshBasedProcessor> we didn't want him anyway, he used comcast
P6:12:48 <doohan> Now you're being ISPist
P6:12:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> Yes. Yes I am.
P6:12:58 <Mitchcm34> What's wrong with comcast?
P6:13:01 <doohan> You know what I miss.
P6:13:04 <doohan> Mocking AOL users.
P6:13:04 <Eagle> Comcast is still better than broadstripe
P6:13:05 <Mitchcm34> Some people only have certain options where they live
P6:13:09 <doohan> You don't see many of them these days.
P6:13:30 <Mitchcm34> Man, I love those AOL cds that came in the mail, 1 Month free!!
P6:13:44 <doohan> Yeah free coasters.
P6:13:50 <Mitchcm34> haha, yeaa
P6:14:11 <doohan> And you want to know what's wrong with comcast?
P6:14:24 <doohan> BLOOP-INSANE uses comcast.
10P6:14:25 * Chair196 (Mibbit@c-69-143-120-107.hsd1.va.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft

P6:14:39 <doohan> You must be fed up of hearing that.
P6:14:46 <Mitchcm34> anybody need an ice pack after that one?
P6:14:53 <Chair196> 'lo
P6:14:59 <doohan> hello Chair196
P6:15:05 <Chair196> only three on?
P6:15:07 <Chair196> hi, bt
P6:15:09 <Chair196> *btw
P6:15:10 <doohan> three?
P6:15:20 <Chair196> well, three "active users"
P6:15:26 <Chair196> 85 people are idle
P6:15:28 <doohan> Nah there's plenty people about
P6:15:31 <doohan> Eagle, 
P6:15:34 <doohan> say something
P6:15:39 <Eagle> Something
P6:15:42 <doohan> See
P6:15:47 <Chair196> i see indeed
P6:15:56 <doohan> They might actually be playing something.
P6:16:02 <Nalok> I'm bored
P6:16:10 <doohan> Like minecraft.
P6:16:15 <Mitchcm34> minecraft is fun :D
P6:16:24 <Chair196> thats why were here , afterall
P6:16:38 <Mitchcm34> oh, i thought this was hello kitty online irc?
13P6:16:46 * Mitchcm34 leaves.
P6:16:49 <Chair196> lol
P6:16:51 <Mitchcm34> ;)
P6:17:03 <doohan> You too eh Mitchcm34?
P6:17:16 <Mitchcm34> the game is the bomb, what can i say
P6:17:19 <Chair196> so notches progress today was the collect system?
P6:17:30 <Mitchcm34> The collect system is the bomb..
P6:18:13 <Mitchcm34> I wonder how it work for sponge/cloth/glass/etc blocks?
P6:18:13 <Eagle> I'll collect YOUR system!
P6:18:22 <doohan> Well Chair196 that's quite a large mechanic really.
P6:18:28 <Mitchcm34> you gotta use that glass to make windows, ya know?
P6:18:34 <Chair196> well, haha. i can imagine.
P6:18:43 <Eagle> Sand
P6:18:46 <doohan> As someone already pointed out that leads to some interesting things for people that play roleplay.
P6:18:52 <doohan> Sand + lava + glass
P6:18:54 <Eagle> Sand and lava equals glass
P6:18:55 <doohan> = glass
P6:19:00 <doohan> yeah :)
P6:19:02 <Mitchcm34> Well, how will you like combine them?
P6:19:08 <doohan> pick up the sand
P6:19:09 <Mitchcm34> Do you think Notch plans on doing that?
P6:19:10 <Eagle> Drop sand into lava?
P6:19:11 <doohan> take it to the lava
P6:19:15 <Chair196> im not degrading the work, just providing conversation, lol
P6:19:17 <Eagle> Or build it
P6:19:37 <Chair196> "bucket" brick. place it in water, break it, pick it up.
P6:19:40 <Eagle> Like you build sand in a 1 block deep lava pool, and instead of building sand it makes glass
P6:19:51 <Chair196> place it again, and get water
12P6:20:11 * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5FCF0.versanet.de) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
P6:20:28 <Mitchcm34> another good idea for limited trees is to be able to grow a tree with a seed block, or just plant a stump and let it frow over time maybe?
P6:20:45 <Chair196> yes.
P6:21:16 <Chair196> also, another thing. does notch often reply to emails sent to the adress on the home page?
P6:21:27 <Eagle> Talk to him on IRC
P6:21:33 <Chair196> k
P6:21:47 <Chair196> i sent a sugestion for the greifer problem some time ago, he wasnt there.
P6:21:55 <Chair196> or, he didnt respond
P6:22:06 <Mitchcm34> Ooh, me and my friend brainstormed multiple ways for anti-grief
P6:22:31 <Mitchcm34> Is Notch the only dev?
P6:22:32 <doohan> Chair196, you could always try to email him.
P6:22:36 <doohan> Mitchcm34, yup
P6:22:48 <Mitchcm34> He's a bright guy :D
P6:22:56 <Mitchcm34> I love the idea of this game, and what he has made out of it
P6:23:07 <Chair196> i thought that he would add a new op or owner only command, like "Gban" that communicates to minecraft.net. adds like a tick next to their name
P6:23:09 <Mitchcm34> I purchased :)
P6:23:21 <Mitchcm34> That's a good idea
P6:23:22 <Chair196> doohan, i did
P6:23:34 <doohan> Chair196, the problem with that is that it could be abused.
P6:23:39 <TwingeCrag> I would love if he just added in a server variable that lets them either host a resource server or a normal sandbox game.
P6:23:42 <Chair196> hasnt respnded. it was like two months ago
P6:23:44 <doohan> You could add someone just to be mean.
P6:23:52 <Eagle> But then what about those servers where the admin is all "lol u said hi BANHAMMERLOLOL" and then they get blacklisted. D:
P6:24:05 <doohan> TwingeCrag, that'll probably come when all the mods are in
P6:24:15 <doohan> He's always said there would be different mode of play.
P6:24:16 <Chair196> hm, god point
P6:24:20 <Chair196> *good
P6:24:26 <Mitchcm34> Maybe a menu for ops/owner only to see that displayed all block updates for each player, for example, how many blocks they have created/destroyed, and if you see someone's destruction count going up really fast, then you suspect griefing, and you can keep an eye on him
P6:24:43 <doohan> Mitchcm34, what about clearing an area?
P6:24:47 <doohan> Like underground?
P6:24:54 <Mitchcm34> that's why you suspect*
P6:25:00 <doohan> That's a huge amount of rapid removal.
P6:25:00 <Mitchcm34> tp to them, and see whats going on
10P6:25:14 * Daveisawesome_ (chatzilla@bas1-toronto63-1096579761.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
P6:25:17 <doohan> The greifers will vanish on the paid servers I reckon.
P6:25:22 <doohan> Or at least decrease.
P6:25:25 <Mitchcm34> it's just really hard to keep an eye on everyone, and with a menu of the sort, you would know who to visit at what time
P6:25:30 <doohan> And having private servers isn't so bad either.
12P6:25:37 * Daveisawesome (chatzilla@bas1-toronto63-1096579761.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
P6:25:40 <Chair196> what if you cobine that. when someone is Gbanned, a create vs. destroy count is sent to the  minecraft.net server, and some bot filters thorugh them
10P6:25:41 * Daveisawesome_ is now known as Daveisawesome
P6:25:55 <Mitchcm34> Yeah, I knew private servers would help a lot, but im just brainstorming :)
P6:25:56 <MoDx> Bai everibodi
P6:26:03 <Chair196> spellcheck as nessecary
P6:26:10 <doohan> Maybe a plugin for that might show up when notch gets the mod support done.
P6:26:17 <doohan> Who knows.
12P6:26:19 * MoDx (chatzilla@starget.radionet.ee) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5.2/20090729225027])
P6:26:45 <Chair196> but yeah, like you said. greifers will stop being so problematic with paid servers
P6:27:20 <Mitchcm34> true, pay to support notch peeps!
P6:27:22 <Chair196> im just exited for monsters, lol
P6:27:39 <Snowman> Don't just buy the game, DONATE TOO!
P6:27:40 <Chair196> im gonna buy it soon, i think. just need to set a time to do it, lol
P6:27:42 <Mitchcm34> I read something about there being weapons or something of the sort, is that true, or something I made up?
P6:27:51 <TwingeCrag> how about when someone respawns they drop all their resources
P6:27:52 <Daveisawesome> hai guys
P6:27:53 <Zuriki> True
P6:28:01 <Mitchcm34> Sounds fun :D
P6:28:03 <Chair196> well, it wouldnt be much of a survival mode if you didnt have to survive agains anything

P6:30:11 <Chair196> also, zuriki, a few weeks ago you had a "time lapse experemnt" server?
P6:30:19 <Chair196> what was it?
P6:30:27 <Mitchcm34> how does that work?
P6:30:38 <Chair196> pixel guns ftw
P6:31:19 <Mitchcm34> u can select the block type, then, pew pew, and floating blocks go flying towards the enemy

P6:52:25 <Chair196> doohickeys are fun

P6:52:47 <Visiiri> Is the forum still down?
P6:52:50 <navjack> yes
P6:52:51 <vede> Also, the little cubes should not float and spin (still shine), but just lay on the ground, and you have to actually press a "pick up" button to grab them.
P6:53:11 <Chair196> agree with that, too
P6:53:11 <navjack> hey im wondering a tech question. what limits the fps in minecraft? besides vsynch and gpu. because i got everything tweaked for speed and i top out at 160fps looking at the sky

P6:54:08 <Chair196> is it upside down?
P6:54:12 <vede> Also, it should take more than one small block to make one normal block, and you can drop the small blocks one at a time. (They basically act as physics objects, but you use them to make standard blocks.)
P6:54:37 <Metyknight> I still think you should have them(block) in inventory since when you removed them from the ground there cant be anywhere else than on you

P7:02:03 <Visiiri> I was gonna... make.. one...
P7:02:06 <navjack> i want better block based rendering. cuz im totally sure that my gtx280 and core 2 duo overclocked to 4ghz can do better then 160fps
P7:02:07 <KatamariManatee> But they all seem so hard..
P7:02:10 <Zuriki> By reversing the last fall movement serverside
P7:02:15 <Zuriki> But it would be jumpy
P7:02:16 <Chair196> python. its easy. 
P7:02:37 <DisturbedTK> Yea python is easy .-.
P7:02:43 <Visiiri> Python isn't quite used enough, IMO
P7:02:46 <Zuriki> HOT CHOCOLATE TIME
P7:02:48 <Zuriki> :D
P7:02:49 <KatamariManatee> Only experience I ever had was with VB.net and Logo
P7:02:50 <Chair196> talking to katamarimanatee
P7:02:50 <navjack> isnt the gravity atm 0.6 downward or something over time
P7:02:52 <Drakkar> <navjack> i want better block based rendering. cuz im totally sure that my gtx280 and core 2 duo overclocked to 4ghz can do better then 160fps < pretty sure it caps fps
P7:02:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you're totally sure about that you should try wurm online and see how much fps you can get
P7:02:55 <DisturbedTK> cryzed have been halping me on python .-.
P7:03:03 <Zuriki> No it increases by x1.5
P7:03:14 <Metyknight> I think we cant modify the gravity because Notch have already too many problem with the water in normal graivty ^^'
P7:03:14 <navjack> ahhh ok
P7:03:25 <Zuriki> Max being -4
P7:03:27 <Drakkar> it was a very deliberate choice
P7:03:29 <Drakkar> afaik
P7:03:35 <Zuriki> Well
P7:03:36 <Metyknight> Also about de fps , its a better rendering that need the game but a mid-mapping!
P7:03:38 <Chair196> right. water in alt gravety would be bad...
P7:03:41 <navjack> lol, water i never want changed cuz of the art of making your own reflections
P7:03:41 <Aron_dc> water is affected by gravity?
P7:03:41 <Metyknight> its not*
P7:03:44 <Zuriki> it speeds up then slows down like...
P7:03:55 <KatamariManatee> I see about python, it could be alright

P8:21:30 <Skywars> I can safely say Megaman Legends 3 is getting alot more attention as time goes on.

P8:23:05 <AlexVMiner> WHAT?
P8:23:07 <Visiiri> lol
P8:23:16 <Skywars> someones excited :p
P8:23:18 <Visiiri> I need to know how to get the colors and stuff?
P8:23:21 <Durnus> The way it is on my IRC client it says Forums and Wiki down, back soon. | I did this...
P8:23:21 <Visiiri> I am excited.
P8:23:25 <Visiiri> :D
P8:23:34 <AlexVMiner> colors?
P8:23:44 <Visiiri> Yeah I want to color my name on my server.
P8:23:48 <Visiiri> How do you do that?
P8:23:49 <AlexVMiner> oh
P8:23:58 <AlexVMiner> with JTE's thing
P8:23:59 <AlexVMiner> or hax
P8:24:00 <AlexVMiner> :D
P8:24:01 <LG_Legacy> Yep
12P8:24:02 * Durnus (Durnus@67.177.195.105) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P8:24:05 <Skywars> Criticsquid I see you around alot, are you a dev or something for Minecraft.
P8:24:11 <LG_Legacy> JTE Is well known for her custom name editing skills
P8:24:18 <Visiiri> Do I need JTEs thing?
P8:24:18 <Skywars> citricsquid*
P8:24:22 <LG_Legacy> Thats why her name is pink and my name is red in the server.
P8:24:25 <AlexVMiner> citric owns the wiki and forums
P8:24:29 <LG_Legacy> And JTE's thing isn't obtainable.
P8:24:29 <Skywars> Oh
P8:24:29 <Animator> Citricsquid is, yeah.
P8:24:32 <citricsquid> Notch is the only minecraft dev
P8:24:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch won't share :P
P8:24:39 <Skywars> Hmm
P8:24:41 <Visiiri> :O
P8:24:45 <citricsquid> I just spend my life on minecraft :D
P8:24:50 <AlexVMiner> I'd help if i knew how to code
P8:24:53 <AlexVMiner> :P
P8:24:56 <Visiiri> :<
P8:24:57 <Skywars> Really? I wouldve expected him to have open arms
P8:25:05 <AlexVMiner> he is greedy
P8:25:05 <Visiiri> It's better.
P8:25:08 <citricsquid> Skywars: He wants to keep the project his own
P8:25:09 <AlexVMiner> sharing money is bad
P8:25:09 <citricsquid> it makes sense
P8:25:13 <citricsquid> he wants to make it as an indie dev
P8:25:17 <Visiiri> Sometimes people can think they have a say, and fuck the whole thing up.
P8:25:22 <citricsquid> if loads of people make a game it's less credit for him.
P8:25:29 <AlexVMiner> yeah
P8:25:36 <AlexVMiner> then in the dev list
P8:25:42 <Skywars> Hmm..
P8:25:55 <AlexVMiner> it says JOE SCHMOE, BOB BOBERSON, JEFF SMITH, MARKUS PERSSON
P8:25:57 <AlexVMiner> or whatever
P8:26:01 <Skywars> I was going to say this game could be open source but then I just landed 15USD the other day :p
P8:26:12 <citricsquid> Skywars: read the about page
P8:26:13 <Skywars> pretty darn content with my purchase
P8:26:14 <AlexVMiner> It's all right here
P8:26:16 <Visiiri> Well, damn.
P8:26:21 <Visiiri> That means I'll have to figure it out...
P8:26:25 <AlexVMiner> :D
P8:26:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh yeah?  I got this Fallout wallet for $12.50 :
