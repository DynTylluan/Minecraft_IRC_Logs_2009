A12:39:51 <Nalok> lol
A12:40:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wouldn't bet on it, nor would i not bet on it, but it's most likely fake because of the events that reccurred this week

A5:12:35 <LKA> I have this issue with gold deposit blocks that makes me want to break them open the moment I see them
A5:12:42 <LKA> even if it's in an unknown part of the map
A5:13:00 <LKA> i blame the old "get the gold cubes joke" but eh
A5:13:11 <citricsquid> when someone is mining gold, the best thing is "/say <name> found 10 gold!"

A5:14:29 <LKA> well i used to but the issue with messing with the system clock came up..
A5:14:35 <Punx_Worx> i've had my 9 story castle up for atleast a week now
A5:14:51 <LKA> and since one of my friends is running an IRC server from his computer, and it freaks out when the clocks desynch
A5:14:52 <LKA> yeaaaaaah
A5:14:53 <Punx_Worx> fuly furnished :P
A5:15:15 <LKA> our previous map had the most amusing lava network
A5:15:26 <LKA> it was referred to as a "zelda 1 dungeon"
A5:15:37 <Punx_Worx> oh sweeet
A5:15:43 <Punx_Worx> yeah we had one for a while, it was nice
A5:15:52 <LKA> and we pretty much dug it all around the fort we set up
A5:16:14 <LKA> before sponge there was this massive underground lake blocking our expansion
A5:16:19 <LKA> after sponge, we flooded it with the lava <3
A5:16:27 <LKA> it was so satisfying
A5:17:00 <Punx_Worx> hah nice
A5:17:46 <JTE> I don't break mineral blocks, I just dig all around them and over them and under them obsessively seperating them from the rest of the land, and in the process, discovering all the pathways they branch off, leading to more and more larger and larger deposits. And occasionally lava.
A5:18:00 <LKA> we eventually made a game out of the network where we'd find deep, un-lava'd caves
A5:18:06 <LKA> then we'd let the nearest lava branch flow off into it
A5:18:15 <LKA> where we'd jump into the cave and just run while watching the flow
A5:18:38 <LKA> once we'd get cornered we'd dig a pathway out and just dig wildly until we have no more escape since we'd always run into other lava deposits
A5:18:57 <citricsquid> Sound is so awesome
A5:19:02 <citricsquid> shame we don't get sound on putting down blocks.
A5:19:15 <LKA> i wish we could turn off music while keeping footsteps
A5:19:25 <citricsquid> Notch mentioned allowing them a while back
A5:19:31 <citricsquid> having effects and music controlled seperately
A5:19:39 <citricsquid> whether it'll happen, who knows =D
A5:19:48 <LKA> it'll have to sooner or later
A5:20:01 <Punx_Worx> yeah that will be nice
A5:20:06 <LKA> also I need to give a shout to him since the java messing with system clocks still isnt fixed
A5:20:57 <citricsquid> G15 is the perfect minecraft keyboard
A5:21:13 <citricsquid> I have a macro mode specifically for it, I tap G1 and get "/teleport " automatically in text field, awesome =D
A5:21:15 <LKA> I'm still using the basic default Dell USB keyboard I got with my compy
A5:21:18 <citricsquid> makes admining so much easier.
A5:21:37 <LKA>  this thing is probably the most comfortable keyboard i'll ever dream of using
A5:21:53 <LKA> though my Z key is starting to die out I think.. too many shmups

A10:13:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> not as fast or efficient as the Debian ones, but it's easy
A10:13:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> perhaps because I've used Ubuntu on the desktop, and not Debian?
A10:13:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> not a huge difference, but the little things add up

A10:32:54 <JTE> I'd like to make a script which somehow keeps track of the number of various resource blocks you destroy, as useless as that is at the moment, but I think that's a little out of the way...

A11:31:39 <Dilt> just reverse-engineering the protocol and hijacking sockets should work

A11:43:27 <cryzed> On linux servers
A11:43:33 <Nalok> ..?
A11:43:40 <Nalok> wat
A11:43:50 <cryzed> I'm pretty sure I made myself clear
A11:43:52 <Dilt> it varies, cryzed, depending on how big the map is
A11:44:00 <cryzed> Let's say 
A11:44:02 <cryzed> 256^3
A11:44:04 <Dilt> minecraft's also in a very alpha version
A11:44:09 <Dilt> so we don't have solid numbers

P8:44:18 <vdgmprgrmr> The only way to get water without water is to funnel it from Da Ocean.

P9:51:03 <Wolfram> o.o
P9:51:13 <Eagle> In the map that KcL linked.
P9:51:24 <Wolfram> Oh. Must have missed it.
P9:54:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Never noticed any of the anti-semitic symbolism in Minecraft? Never caught on to any of the obvious racially-oriented attributes? Wow, you must be plain THICK or something.
P9:59:31 <Wolfram> Seriously. One time I saw a bunch of fellows building PYRAMIDS.
P9:59:34 <Wolfram> Now what does that tell you.
P9:59:50 <Wolfram> No doubt a whip-wielding nazi right around the corner.

P10:23:20 <Adura> Perhaps.
