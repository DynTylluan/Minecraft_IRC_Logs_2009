A12:03:34 <AndrewPH> It is a well known fact that JTE made windows
A12:03:38 <AndrewPH> that's why it tends to be slow and buggy
A12:03:40 <AndrewPH> and crashes a lot
A12:03:44 <mail2345|smacx> REPENT, AND LET THE ROUTING TABLES OF THE HOLY ROUTER FILL YOUR DATASPACE

A12:06:51 <LG_Legacy> Time for some doom

12A12:08:01 * Jat (Mibbit@do193-110.resnet.stonybrook.edu) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
A12:08:14 <Cial> server recommendations 
A12:08:44 <Koitenshin> i recommend /v/ - Minecraft
A12:09:51 <Koitenshin> Anyone know the max character level of TEAI?
13A12:10:22 * Cial is rather tempted to stay away from /v
A12:10:36 <Koitenshin> >_> Dunno why.
A12:10:53 <Koitenshin> The server is actually pretty good at times.
A12:11:10 <Koitenshin> Last map had an XBOX HUEG castle.
A12:11:38 <Cial> is it full of intelligent chan refuges? 
A12:12:01 <Koitenshin> Oh, if you wanted intelligent chan refugees you'd have to come to mine.
A12:12:32 <Koitenshin> Since mine was down for about a week due to verify-names issue not many people show up.
A12:12:52 <Koitenshin> Until Notch fixed minecraft.net routing.
A12:13:14 <Koitenshin> I tend to use Epic Maps though, mainly for building, not really spriting.
10A12:13:46 * mail2345|smacx is now known as mail2345|afk
A12:13:48 <mail2345|afk> drep
A12:13:58 <Koitenshin> you keep spelling it wrong.
A12:14:07 <Koitenshin> we want bananabot to say herp a derp
A12:14:22 <mail2345|afk> what
A12:14:24 <mail2345|afk> GODDAMIT

10A12:19:19 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:20:22 <Dudebro> So I hear it's possible to run survival multiplayer by using a WOM client
A12:20:53 <PickYerPoison> That means the functionality would have to be there.
A12:21:01 <PickYerPoison> Either that or it would be terribly glitchy.
A12:21:12 <PickYerPoison> Also I lost the game.
A12:21:21 <TrueWolves> WoM Client's, not a fan of em.
A12:22:43 <Cial> you can but others cant see the mobs so its really confusing
10A12:22:46 * mail2345|afk is now known as mail2345
A12:22:47 <mail2345> umm
A12:22:48 <PickYerPoison> Hahaha
A12:22:52 <mail2345> you don't need the Wom client
A12:22:59 <PickYerPoison> "Hey what are you running from" "That zombie right there, you tard!"
A12:23:00 <mail2345> you just need to subisutie the jars in your temp
A12:23:07 <PickYerPoison> "Zombie? What zombie?"
A12:23:29 <Cial> XD i would pay to observer that in actual conversation 
A12:23:51 <PickYerPoison> XD is an alternate nick of mine, just an interesting fact. :D
A12:24:14 <mail2345> i wonder
A12:24:15 <PickYerPoison> For a minute I thought I had switched to it and you were addressing me like that. XD
A12:24:27 <mail2345> how many phpBB results would show when searching for virage
A12:24:46 <PickYerPoison> "virage?"
A12:24:48 <PickYerPoison> How come?
A12:24:49 <Dudebro> Well I'm on a mac
A12:24:53 <Dudebro> so I have no temp file
A12:25:15 <Dudebro> *folder
A12:25:27 <AndrewPH> You should :s
A12:25:29 <mail2345> @pyp i meant viragra
A12:25:31 <vede> *sigh* Here we go again. Sidescrolling and physics.
A12:25:36 <mail2345> SIDESCROLLING 
A12:25:39 <PickYerPoison> You mean "viagra?"
A12:25:41 <vede> *viagra
A12:25:45 <vede> DAMN NINJA
A12:25:46 <PickYerPoison> XD
A12:26:00 <mail2345> ...
A12:26:04 <mail2345> you get my point
A12:26:18 <vede> Viagra -> virage
A12:26:24 <vede> :/
A12:26:29 <mail2345> umm
A12:26:31 <vede> mail2345, you need new hands.
A12:26:32 <mail2345> i blame satan
A12:26:36 <Dudebro> So are there two .jars or is it one .jar with survival and regular in it?
A12:26:44 <PickYerPoison> [00:26] <@vede> mail2345, you need new hands. <-- [00:26] <@vede> *viagra
A12:26:45 <mail2345> there are two .jars
A12:26:51 <PickYerPoison> You can lend him yours. ;3
A12:26:57 <vede> :O
A12:27:23 <mail2345> i'm wondering
A12:27:32 <vede> But yeah. It's really difficult for me to get sidescroller physics working properly.
A12:27:34 <PickYerPoison> ...ok, in retrospect, that wasn't as clear as I thought it would be.
A12:27:43 <mail2345> is it true that the wikipedia article of goatse has an image of goatse on it?
A12:28:04 <vede> Yes.
A12:28:06 <LG_Legacy> I'm trying to think of some old games to play..
A12:28:07 <vede> Also OH GOD DAMMIT
A12:28:16 <LG_Legacy> I already got DaggerFall..
A12:28:26 <LG_Legacy> Already going to get W3 and W2.
A12:28:30 <Dudebro> Where do I find the survival .jar, then?
A12:28:32 <vede> Actually it's a screenshot of the website.
A12:28:34 <LG_Legacy> Snagging RE2 as-well
12A12:29:00 * BananaBot (BananaBot@75-175-22-53.ptld.qwest.net) Quit (Excess Flood)

A12:29:41 <mail2345> uhh
A12:29:47 <AndrewPH> Don't feel like it

10A12:30:29 * Pickbot (Pickbot@adsl-75-8-90-214.dsl.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:30:32 <PickYerPoison> :D
A12:30:41 <Cial> someone flooded my base with lava
A12:30:43 <AndrewPH> yes
A12:30:45 <mail2345> pickbot
A12:30:46 <PickYerPoison> Don't worry, he doesn't say anything unless you say something to him.
A12:30:52 <mail2345> have him meet in #botfest
A12:30:55 <mail2345> wiht bannaba
A12:30:56 <mail2345> oh wait
A12:30:59 <mail2345> that's a shitty idea
A12:31:00 <mail2345> floods
A12:31:03 <PickYerPoison> Hahaha
A12:31:11 <PickYerPoison> Let's do it
A12:31:18 <Koitenshin> how did bananabot break?
A12:31:33 <Koitenshin> Is he saying memes now?
13A12:31:38 * Koitenshin whistles innocently.
A12:31:41 <AndrewPH> mail spammed drep
A12:31:43 <AndrewPH> now it spam drep
A12:31:44 <mail2345> heh
A12:31:47 <PickYerPoison> Memes?
A12:31:48 <mail2345> :S
A12:31:50 <mail2345> Q: After staring at the mousepad and going without food and water for an extended period, I begin to see small creatures living within the dots. Sometimes these creatures speak to me and divulge secrets of the universe.
A12:31:50 <mail2345> A: Just say no to drugs.
A12:31:59 <PickYerPoison> Like Pickbot's memes?
A12:32:30 <PickYerPoison> Which are actually quotes.
A12:32:32 <Koitenshin> Is it spamming anything else?
A12:32:43 <PickYerPoison> I just used !meme to prevent clashes with other bot's !quote functions.
A12:32:46 <mail2345> literotica
A12:32:54 <mail2345> pyp
A12:32:57 <Koitenshin> mail you dirty bastard. :P
A12:32:58 <mail2345> what's the AI in pickbot?
A12:33:07 <PickYerPoison> Markov?
A12:33:10 <mail2345> @koitishin i'm good at sabatoging bots
A12:33:18 <mail2345> @pyp have you heard of megahal?
A12:33:22 <PickYerPoison> Yes.
A12:33:27 <PickYerPoison> But I made Pickbot myself.
A12:33:28 <mail2345> use thier python module
A12:33:34 <PickYerPoison> How come? Mine works fine.
A12:33:42 <mail2345> but megahal works beter :P
A12:33:45 <Koitenshin> I'm good at sabotaging bots myself.
A12:33:47 <PickYerPoison> XD
A12:33:52 <PickYerPoison> How so, mail?
A12:34:04 <mail2345> it generates multiple canidate replies
A12:34:15 <mail2345> and compares them to the input
A12:34:22 <mail2345> and some other stuff to refine stuff
A12:35:12 <PickYerPoison> You're stating what it does, not what's better. :P
A12:35:27 <PickYerPoison> I'm not sure how to compare that with what I have, partly because you weren't too clear.
A12:36:03 <PickYerPoison> Or maybe I'm just not smart enough.
A12:36:05 <PickYerPoison> X)
A12:36:05 <Koitenshin> basically it goes through a list and picks the best answer to a query
A12:36:10 <PickYerPoison> Ah.
A12:36:14 <PickYerPoison> I prefer randomization.
A12:36:16 <PickYerPoison> It's much more fun.
A12:36:23 <Koitenshin> Yes it is.
A12:36:25 <mail2345> it also generates two replies
A12:36:29 <Koitenshin> We need an 8ball bot in here.
A12:36:31 <mail2345> and smashes them together
A12:36:38 <mail2345> also from what i can tell
A12:36:51 <mail2345> the selection is made to choose the most unique reply
A12:36:54 <mail2345> not the most similar
A12:37:22 <mail2345> no pun intended
A12:38:01 <Koitenshin> I still wanna see bananabot write herp a derp
A12:38:13 <mail2345> spam it in the channel yourself
A12:38:18 <PickYerPoison> Pickbot: I like you just the way you are. :)
A12:38:18 <Pickbot> I like Terminus.
A12:38:19 <mail2345> #publiccraft

A12:39:20 <Pickbot> herp a derp
A12:39:21 <mail2345> pickbot: herp a derp
A12:39:21 <Pickbot> herp a derp
A12:39:22 <PYP|AFK> Yeah, sometimes he doesn't randomize.
A12:39:31 <PYP|AFK> That's when he hasn't seen anything else starting with that.
A12:39:43 <PYP|AFK> I'm gonna make him just start randomly if that happens, I think.
A12:39:43 <mail2345> pickbot: starting?
A12:39:44 <Pickbot> s t a r t i n g ?
A12:39:48 <PYP|AFK> Herp a derp :D

A12:39:55 <mail2345> pickbot: megahal looks thought the satement
A12:39:55 <Pickbot> megahal looks thought the Japanese had more fun to draw.
A12:40:01 <vede> Whoa now.
A12:40:08 <PYP|AFK> Yay randomization.
13A12:40:09 * vede storms in to ruin all the fun.
A12:40:14 <PYP|AFK> Awww
A12:40:14 <vede> No bots allowed!

A12:40:36 <PuyoDead> What the damn hell?
A12:40:43 <vede> It's okay, PuyoDead.
A12:40:46 <Koitenshin> pickbot: what you did there, I see it.
A12:40:52 <vede> The situation is under control.
A12:40:56 <Koitenshin> darn
A12:41:05 <PuyoDead> Did I miss idiot day?
A12:41:12 <Koitenshin> I'm bored.
A12:41:19 <vede> All known active bots have been removed.
A12:41:23 <mail2345> @puyo it's just a surge
A12:41:25 <Koitenshin> I hit level 14 on TEAI by brute forcing it.
A12:41:34 <mail2345> in preperation to the attack
A12:41:47 <vede> Brute force is actually a mildly good tactic in some roguelikes.
A12:42:04 <vede> You go slow in the first ten or so levels, then just dash through the rest.
A12:42:08 <Koitenshin> Well the grunts in this game are killer
A12:42:35 <vede> Because pretty much everything after such and such level will kill you 50% of the time.
A12:42:48 <Koitenshin> They remind me of those white wolf things from Fallout 3.
A12:43:00 <vede> I made it to LEVEL TWENTY-THREE in Rogue once doing that.
A12:43:03 <vede> It was epic.
A12:43:21 <Koitenshin> I'm playing Notch's roguelike.
10A12:43:30 * mail2345 is now known as MailBot

10A12:44:22 * MailBot is now known as mail2345
A12:45:34 <Koitenshin> you should be a Notch supporter. You sound like a dirty traitor.
A12:46:35 <mail2345> hrm
A12:46:42 <mail2345> we need a sarcasm tagging standard

A12:47:59 <Koitenshin> why?
A12:48:00 <mail2345> b ecause the community sucks
A12:48:16 <Koitenshin> No, it's just most people are dicks.
A12:48:24 <Koitenshin> You need a good server
A12:48:34 <mail2345> oh balls
A12:48:36 <Koitenshin> one that is rarely, if ever, griefed

P3:10:51 <Quatroking> "The first ever monkey astronaut was Albert, a rhesus monkey, who on June 11, 1948 died at 39 miles on a V2 rocket. Albert died of suffocation during the flight."

10P4:19:28 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|AFK
P4:19:48 <derp> i'm trying to use the Omen 5.0 map editor to completely hollow out the bottom of a map by 9 blocks
P4:19:56 <derp> however, it appears to just be doing one line across
P4:20:10 <derp> i have tried using 3d floods, 3d lines, etc. but all to no avail
P4:20:14 <derp> any help?
P4:20:15 <gear|work> the name is appropriate
P4:20:27 <derp> derp or omen?
P4:20:30 <gear|work> derp
P4:20:31 <gear|work> lol
P4:20:38 <gear|work> by one line across
P4:20:49 <gear|work> you mean 1 x 1 x width of map?
P4:20:52 <PuyoDead> So you're trying to remove the entire bottom 9 blocks of the map?
P4:20:58 <derp> yes puyo
10P4:20:59 * TheOne is now known as TO-AFK
P4:21:23 <derp> so far i have only been able to get rid of a row at a time
P4:21:29 <Siiseli> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=siiseli
P4:21:36 <derp> i suppose i could just use the line tool 255*2 times but it seems rather cumbersome
P4:21:40 <Siiseli> anyone read Transmetropolitan?
P4:21:47 <PuyoDead> Well, you could remove the very bottom row, then copy that layer up 8 times.
P4:22:09 <derp> yeah i saw that button
P4:22:14 <derp> copy layer up was it?
P4:22:17 <gear|work> well you can orient the map in 3 ways
P4:22:19 <derp> however, it didn't seem to be working for me
P4:22:23 <gear|work> xy, yz, xz
P4:22:24 <PuyoDead> Or, use the top view, set the brush to the largest size possible and set to air, then just click anywhere in the layer.
P4:22:40 <derp> ahhh
P4:22:42 <derp> puyo
P4:22:44 <derp> that is a good idea
P4:22:45 <PuyoDead> That should wipe out a whole slice, then go down from there.
P4:22:47 <derp> i did not think of that
P4:22:51 <derp> clever
P4:22:54 <derp> well, clever for me
P4:22:58 <derp> never using this map editor before
P4:22:58 <clone1018> Anyone know how to make JTE's custom server guest area smaller?
P4:23:14 <derp> which layer is the bottom of the map?
P4:23:18 <bildramer> find some numbers, make them smaller :P
P4:23:19 <derp> 255 or 0?
P4:23:26 <Snowman> I just saw a Francis skin with a Santa hat
P4:23:28 <Snowman> Made my day
P4:23:40 <PuyoDead> I think the lowest number, but let me check.

P4:24:35 <derp> oh cool
P4:24:40 <Caleo> .6 is old news
P4:24:40 <JoeyJo0> Why?
P4:24:40 <PuyoDead> blid, shoosh.
P4:24:41 <derp> i'll look for it now
P4:24:42 <Caleo> :|
P4:24:45 <JoeyJo0> Hard to write?
P4:25:14 <bildramer> A bitch to interpret...
P4:25:15 <JoeyJo0> Think of how hard it is to write if you can't use the letter 'e'
P4:25:19 <bildramer> :P
P4:25:32 <bildramer> too small for expressionism
P4:25:37 <JoeyJo0> It was a bitch to write, quite easy to interpret, IMO.
P4:25:38 <bildramer> IMO, HATE GERMAN
P4:25:39 <PuyoDead> Ok, higher number is the bottom, so 255 for you.
P4:25:50 <bildramer> ?
P4:26:01 <bildramer> I think it was not reversed...
P4:26:13 <derp> ok thanks
P4:26:34 <derp> also, i made an empty server a couple nights ago and my friends and i built for a while
P4:26:43 <PuyoDead> I'm talking about Omen here, bild. C'mon, keep up.
P4:26:57 <derp> i left it unlocked for the night and apparently miners had a field day and really made a bunch of stuff
P4:27:05 <bildramer> Omen... yup.
P4:27:18 <derp> was cool. bridges, pyramids. etc. however, griefers got to it. i noticed on some servers you can protect blocks
P4:27:30 <derp> something like.. "Guests are not allowed to build here."
P4:27:32 <derp> something like that
P4:27:35 <bildramer> yeah
P4:27:37 <derp> was wondering how the server admins did that
P4:27:42 <bildramer> I'll use one later, next week maybe
P4:27:45 <derp> tried googling but the game is not very well documented
P4:27:45 <PuyoDead> Only the Op /solid blocks for the standard server. Stuff like that is with custom servers.
P4:27:54 <bildramer> Custom servers FTW!
P4:27:56 <derp> custom servers?
P4:27:59 <derp> can you elaborate
P4:28:00 <bildramer> yes
P4:28:02 <bildramer> well
P4:28:05 <PuyoDead> That is, only /solid for standard.
P4:28:17 <bildramer> Notch made a standard server.
P4:28:28 <bildramer> Other people made their own which are more awesome.
P4:28:31 <PuyoDead> You might have been playing on WoM servers, which are custom made. They have features like that.
P4:28:35 <Snowman> Vanilla ftw
P4:28:39 <gear|work> ^^
P4:28:44 <bildramer> ^ ? :/
P4:28:48 <Siiseli> so what kind of cool stuff could people with premium do
P4:29:01 <gear|work> wot?
P4:29:03 <bildramer> no idea
P4:29:06 <derp> so do you have to pay for such controls? or is it just that they wrote their own closed source scripts to accomplish that?
P4:29:14 <PuyoDead> The later.
P4:29:15 <bildramer> the second
P4:29:18 <derp> oh ok
P4:29:19 <PuyoDead> I win!
P4:29:20 <bildramer> also, some are open
P4:29:26 <bildramer> Like OpenCraft...
P4:30:06 <derp> opencraft
P4:30:12 <PuyoDead> Yea, there's that one, which requires a bit of knowledge to set up with what you want.
P4:30:16 <derp> that will allow for such anti-griefing capabilities?
P4:30:26 <bildramer> Pretty much all of them, yeah
P4:30:33 <gear|work> afaik its still pretty new, isnt it?
P4:30:36 <derp> are there any others that i should look in to?
P4:30:59 <gear|work> i like when people come in with well formed questions

P5:35:44 <Conundrumer> is it a bad idea for me to post a thread called "The Art of Griefing"?
P5:35:44 <clone1018> :|
P5:35:51 <clone1018> Yes
13P5:36:08 * clone1018 adds Conundrumer to his ban list
P5:36:14 <Conundrumer> i always see griefers negatively portrayed
P5:36:15 <Conundrumer> lolwut
P5:36:32 <clone1018> greifers are negative
P5:36:34 <clone1018> In general
P5:36:41 <Conundrumer> thieves are negative in general
P5:36:42 <Conundrumer> agreed?
P5:36:49 <clone1018> Yes
P5:36:58 <Conundrumer> violence is negative in general, yes?
P5:37:03 <clone1018> Yes
P5:37:14 <Conundrumer> to do stupid things is negative, indeed
P5:37:20 <AndrewPH> use brightly colored pills
P5:37:24 <clone1018> No
P5:37:32 <clone1018> it depends on the stupid thing
P5:37:33 <Conundrumer> generally at least
P5:37:51 <clone1018> Ja
P5:38:02 <Conundrumer> well, if violence is negative, why is there so much of it in movies and video games?
P5:38:10 <clone1018> Because its fun
P5:38:11 <clone1018> :D
P5:38:22 <chariot> because it is also awesome
P5:38:31 <Conundrumer> i recall reading a real story on a group of burgulars stealing from one of the most secure places in the world, purely for the thrill
P5:38:51 <clone1018> So your trying to say greifing is like those
P5:38:53 <clone1018> But its not
P5:39:03 <clone1018> Its destroying peoples hard work
P5:39:09 <PuyoDead> Please, -please-, don't make another damn griefing thread. Please.
P5:39:14 <Conundrumer> i'm pretty sure some griefers do more than anoy people and get revenge and stuff
P5:39:22 <clone1018> No
P5:39:23 <Conundrumer> that's why i'm in IRC

P5:39:48 <PuyoDead> They're just people who get a kick out of upsetting others. End of story.
P5:41:15 <Conundrumer> it seems narrowminded that the general consensus on griefers is that they are immature, sadistic, no life, etc
P5:41:19 <Conundrumer> whatever you see them as
P5:42:25 <fleshBasedProcessor> I don't think that is necesarily a perfect description of greifers, but it pretty well describes the mindset they are in while they are greifing.
P5:42:30 <PuyoDead> I don't see how this is an issue. What isn't to understand?
P5:42:53 <Conundrumer> I just want to bring up a different and interesting perspective
P5:43:16 <fleshBasedProcessor> Sorry, I just joined. and what is this different perspective?
P5:43:19 <PuyoDead> Again, I don't see what is interesting about it.
P5:44:17 <Conundrumer> i see you're not really thinking out of the box
P5:44:38 <PuyoDead> No, I have. There's nothing interesting there.
P5:45:06 <Conundrumer> that's narrowminded by itself
P5:45:16 <Conundrumer> i find it interesting, so therefore it's interesting
P5:45:22 <PuyoDead> Some people do it because they enjoy upsetting others. Some people do it because of the thrill of "rebellion". While other's simply find it enjoyable in general.
P5:45:22 <Conundrumer> though i should have used a better choice of words
P5:45:25 <fleshBasedProcessor> If the majority of players want to have fun with the game, the creater of the game wants people to enjoy the game, and greifers are having fun by *taking away* fun, they I don't think there can be much argument that greifers are anything but bad.
P5:45:45 <PuyoDead> I just don't see what is "new and intesting" there.
P5:45:50 <PuyoDead> *interesting
P5:46:26 <Conundrumer> even considering the perspective of a griefer is shunned upon
P5:46:45 <PuyoDead> No, I'm not sure you see what people are saying.
P5:46:55 <PuyoDead> It's not very hard to understand the mindset.
P5:47:04 <PuyoDead> Simply put, people just don't care.
P5:47:12 <AndrewPH> Most griefers are morons
P5:47:17 <AndrewPH> see lailai, the actionscript hacker.
P5:47:24 <PuyoDead> Much in the same way I don't care what script kiddies think, or what wallhackers think.
P5:47:38 <Conundrumer> alright then
P5:47:44 <PuyoDead> It's fairly obvious what makes them "tick", and it's just not that exciting.
P5:47:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> I've looked through that perspective. I've greifed in games before. It is boring, imature, and just playing the game normally is more fun. To seriosly enjoy greifing you have to want to destroy a game and that is just plain mean and I don't mind shunning
P5:47:48 <Conundrumer> I'll just write a story instead
P5:47:57 <Conundrumer> of directly addressing what I brouht up
P5:48:18 <Conundrumer> so I can bring something new to the table
P5:48:34 <Conundrumer> okay, has there been any griefer's stories?
P5:48:43 <PuyoDead> Some people are thrilled to death by collecting stamps. I can see the reason why, and I understand why they do it. But do I find it an intesting topic? Not so much.
P5:48:49 <PuyoDead> Yes, countless.
P5:48:54 <fleshBasedProcessor> Good luck with that.
P5:49:08 <PuyoDead> To say it's a beaten to death topic is a drastic understatement.
P5:49:10 <AndrewPH> "Once I opened a port. It was total leets and i used the open port to have faster griefing connectionz!"
P5:49:23 <Conundrumer> I mean, a first person perspective
P5:49:27 <Conundrumer> creatively written
P5:49:29 <PuyoDead> Yes.
P5:49:33 <Conundrumer> not some rant
P5:49:35 <Conundrumer> link
P5:49:36 <PuyoDead> Yes.
P5:49:48 <PuyoDead> They were are sent to the trash, for reasons you should be able to work out.
P5:50:05 <Conundrumer> I don't, thouhg
P5:50:07 <Conundrumer> it's just a story
P5:50:16 <Conundrumer> a creative piece of literature
P5:50:25 <Conundrumer> if you understand what I'm trying to say
P5:50:33 <PuyoDead> Whatever floats your boat, sure.
P5:51:04 <PuyoDead> I'm about as interested in it as I am the difference in drying time between different styles of paint, though.
P5:51:23 <Conundrumer> i'm actually interested in that, lol

P5:52:01 <Conundrumer> so threads are deleted for the simple reason that it's both uninteresting and related to griefing?
P5:52:27 <PuyoDead> I thought you were able to work these things out? :/
P5:52:51 <PuyoDead> Imagine a topic along the lines of what you're saying. Now imagine the general reaction from this community.
P5:53:00 <Conundrumer> exactly
P5:53:16 <PuyoDead> Four alarm fire flame fest.
P5:53:21 <Conundrumer> however, what I am saying is not a creative piece of literature
P5:54:03 <Conundrumer> there's no plot, no entertainment, nothing different from other rants
P5:54:03 <PuyoDead> The height of civil discussion is along the lines of "No, U STFU!"
P5:54:22 <Conundrumer> *sigh* alright I see that I'm not being clear
P5:54:25 <Conundrumer> I'll do it anyways
P5:54:44 <PuyoDead> You asked for it.
P5:55:09 <fleshBasedProcessor> That is what we are saying. Your point is not clear. Write it down and post it somewhere so you can get your ideas together
P5:55:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> but right now all your going to get is a bunch of flames, because no one likes to hear about griefing being, in any way, a good thing.
P5:55:47 <PuyoDead> Just remember what the average age is on our forums.
P5:56:00 <Conundrumer> oh, I"m not saying it's a good thing
P5:56:08 <Conundrumer> I never even said such a thing
P5:56:12 <Conundrumer> did I?
P5:56:12 <PuyoDead> That's exactly what people with think.
P5:56:33 <fleshBasedProcessor> Sorry, I'm not following this discusion very closely and that is the impresion I got
P5:56:47 <PuyoDead> Trust me, nobody will read it, and assume that's what it is. The more you try to clarify that it's not saying it's good, the worse it'll be.

P9:31:15 <TestDummy> Of more relevance to the @ of the channel like Puyo.
P9:31:57 <PuyoDead> Although I didn't ask for it, I kind of hoped the "official" ban would make him realize "Yes, you -really are- banned". But obviously that didn't work.
P9:31:59 <TestDummy> That's what I told them. I just figured if correcting the ban was that big of a deal (in that I'm doing your job and using what power I have to run your channel) that you would voice your problem with it.
P9:32:24 <mail2345> fun fact
P9:32:25 <TestDummy> It's supposed to be against protocol, I'm not supposed to do those things.
P9:32:33 <mail2345> this entire issue could have been averted
P9:32:43 <mail2345> if in the first place he mentioned he had seperate internet connections
P9:32:47 <PuyoDead> Yea, I didn't have a problem with it, nor did any other ops here. But I understand what you mean.
P9:32:57 <PuyoDead> That wasn't an issue at the time, mail.
P9:33:08 <PuyoDead> In fact, that has nothing to do with it at all.
P9:33:17 <EmpiresBane> Does anyone really care anymore?
P9:33:36 <TestDummy> I don't.
P9:33:44 <TestDummy> In fact, I had totally forgotten about it.
P9:33:57 <PuyoDead> It really could have been avoided if he simply would have said, "Hey, I was banned earlier for [reason]. What can I do to have it removed?". That would have been it.
P9:34:04 <TestDummy> Until it was brought up today at least, in a crudely worded query.
P9:34:25 <Jat> lol
P9:34:30 <Jat> "crudely worded query"
P9:34:37 <PuyoDead> As I saw it, he was breaking Esper charter rules, hence why the overriding ban was appropriate.

P9:39:20 <TestDummy> Even if it's impossible to set bans for every possible place that one might connect from, at least pre-emptively.
P9:39:38 <mail2345> @TD apparently the reasoning is "if i can connect, i'm unbanned" for him
P9:39:44 <mail2345> completely retarded

P9:39:52 <PuyoDead> A classic.
P9:39:56 <TestDummy> If you can connect, and you aren't supposed to, I'm not doing my job well enough.
P9:40:08 <TestDummy> Also, just to double-check on this, in accordance with policy.
P9:40:13 <mail2345> anyway
P9:40:20 <mail2345> idiocy results in problems
P9:40:23 <TestDummy> Is it okay that I'm idling in your channel, it being +s (opers aren't supposed to unless it's okay with the @).
P9:40:32 <TestDummy> I mean, yes, I am here every day.
P9:40:35 <PuyoDead> I don't see a problem with it.

P9:41:19 <TestDummy> Secret channels are sacred. :O

P9:56:59 <EmpiresBane> what?

P9:57:39 <Jat> in that order
P9:57:59 <Jat> for some reason they decided to model it after typewriters
