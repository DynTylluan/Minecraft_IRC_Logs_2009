A5:35:52 <]TrueWolves> I was sleep deprived writting it o.o
A5:35:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Can't wait to see more.
13A5:36:01 * ]TrueWolves has not writtin anything before o.o
A5:36:27 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, just the idea is really good.
A5:36:28 <]TrueWolves> Well then, I'll continue it this weekend and keep my promess of making a real chapter longer then that intro and such
A5:36:30 <]TrueWolves> ahh
13A5:36:44 * ]TrueWolves will put work in to it he guesses o.o
A5:36:53 <vdgmprgrmr> And I can see lots of things being really cool in it. Admincrete, for example.
A5:37:14 <]TrueWolves> lots of fun stuff will be in it
A5:37:33 <]TrueWolves> It's set in a world where minecraft has become it's... own world
A5:37:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Some kind of epic battle between the mysterious griefers and an even more mysterious secret protector society known as "the operators".
A5:37:40 <]TrueWolves> XD
A5:38:09 <]TrueWolves> I might take well known servers, ask the admin's for permission, and have them as old ruins of power in the story
A5:38:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Can the blochs trust a guardian when they don't even know who it is?
A5:39:02 <]TrueWolves> Right now though I don't have the time, I'll be gone in an hour and a half, so I'm working on a Tree biuld map
A5:39:07 <]TrueWolves> who knows?
A5:39:38 <]TrueWolves> proubly not at first, I mean, what would happen if super powerful aliens fought on earth?
A5:39:53 <]TrueWolves> then there was more aliens trying to protect us?
A5:40:14 <]TrueWolves> 90% of the people at first wouldn't know the diffrince, there both powerful and unknown
A5:40:47 <vdgmprgrmr> This is definitely going to be awesome.
A5:41:00 <]TrueWolves> =3
A5:41:53 <Parthon> or what about when the griefers start disguising themselves as regular blochs .. then the mysterious operators don't know who is who
A5:42:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh god!
A5:43:02 <vdgmprgrmr> It's like freakin' Vietnam!
A5:43:07 <vdgmprgrmr>  D:
A5:43:38 <]TrueWolves> Right now all the griefers look like the defualt skin, I planed for a rare few to look otherwise (as is the case once in a while) though.
A5:44:00 <]TrueWolves> The biggest diffrince is normal blochs are bound by the rules of survival mode

A7:17:10 <Ausfriendlaptop> alright thanks

10A7:50:45 * DarkWolf (Mibbit@80.101.112.30) has joined #minecraft
A7:50:46 <Quatroking> by chance, I've downloaded ubuntu three weeks ago through the torrents
A7:50:55 <Quatroking> 1 megabyte a sec
A7:51:00 <Quatroking> download finished after 12 minutes
A7:51:09 <Quatroking> considering my connection was being maxed out by the download, I find that rather fast
A7:51:10 <offset> which ISP are you with aus?
A7:51:13 <Ausfriendlaptop> mmm
A7:51:13 <DarkWolf> I've got a question
A7:51:14 <Ausfriendlaptop> TPG offset
A7:51:18 <offset> waix?
A7:51:21 <offset> or east?
A7:51:26 <Quatroking> darkwolf, shoot
A7:51:36 <Ausfriendlaptop> and when i started my download, i got 2mBs, then it slowed down really quickly averaging to 60kBs
A7:51:40 <Ausfriendlaptop> which is really weird
A7:51:43 <DarkWolf> Well
A7:51:44 <Ausfriendlaptop> offset: east
A7:51:50 <DarkWolf> Someone wants to gift me Minecraft
A7:51:51 <offset> ah, okay
A7:52:00 <DarkWolf> Trouble is, He can't unless he knows my password
A7:52:06 <DarkWolf> (Paypal payment)
A7:52:25 <DarkWolf> And I can't change the password of my minecract
A7:52:27 <DarkWolf> craft*
A7:52:28 <Quatroking> get your own paypal account, and let him gift the money
A7:52:35 <Quatroking> zing
A7:52:42 <DarkWolf> He uses a card
A7:52:44 <Ausfriendlaptop> whats the current version of ubuntu anyway?
A7:52:46 <DarkWolf> Not paypal
A7:52:48 <Ausfriendlaptop> 9.04?
A7:52:58 <Quatroking> darkwolf: that sucks.
A7:52:58 <Ausfriendlaptop> Darkwolf: all payments go through paypal ultimately
A7:53:06 <DarkWolf> Hmm?
A7:53:09 <Quatroking> ausfriendlaptop: yeah
A7:53:18 <Quatroking> 9.10 comes out in october
A7:53:31 <DarkWolf> So he can gift the money
A7:53:32 <Ausfriendlaptop> thanks
A7:53:35 <DarkWolf> And then I can use it?
A7:53:40 <DarkWolf> Even with a card
A7:54:11 <Quatroking> if he wants to buy a premium account he has to use a paypal account no matter what
A7:54:21 <DarkWolf> Ah
A7:54:23 <Ausfriendlaptop> Quatroking: no you don't
A7:54:25 <Ausfriendlaptop> but its easier
A7:54:29 <Ausfriendlaptop> to have an account
A7:54:35 <citricsquid> hey guys
A7:54:37 <DarkWolf> He doesn't
A7:54:39 <citricsquid> guess what?
A7:54:49 <Quatroking> citricsquid, you're pregnant?
A7:54:56 <citricsquid> no, even better
A7:54:58 <Ausfriendlaptop> oh wow
A7:55:02 <Quatroking> you have TESTICLES?
A7:55:02 <Ausfriendlaptop> 168kBs on a torrent
A7:55:04 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/4c90edjhh_changemc.jpg
A7:55:05 <citricsquid> !!!
A7:55:08 <Ausfriendlaptop> good work 24/7 bot seeders
A7:55:31 <citricsquid> how to purchase for someone else without having their password.
A7:55:37 <Quatroking> oh cool.

P2:51:19 <Wolfram> Are you a dude typing random nonsense
P2:51:22 <DarkCybrid> what dark?
P2:51:23 <Wolfram> With other dudes watching you do it
P2:51:28 <PuyoDead> seems like it
P2:51:32 <DarkCybrid> i'm not?
P2:51:45 <Wolfram> Why would you do it alone? That's so...weird
P2:51:57 <AlexVMiner> CITRIC
P2:51:57 <DarkCybrid> that's what she said
P2:52:05 <DarkCybrid> or did she?!?!?
P2:52:18 <AlexVMiner> is there a person on that is an op in citric's hell map?
P2:52:22 <PuyoDead> that's not even close to an appropriate use of that :P
P2:52:28 <Wolfram> Guess not, Al
P2:52:30 <DarkCybrid> :O
P2:52:41 <Wolfram> I was there earlier and it was prisoned off and empty
P2:52:57 <Wolfram> That's what she said, PuyoDead
P2:52:57 <Wolfram> Bahaha
P2:53:10 <PuyoDead> ok, THAT works
P2:53:14 <Wolfram> I know!
P2:53:52 <TrueWolves> I don't know if I'm an op in all his channels x.x;

P3:02:38 <AlexVMiner> he is blaming us for his doings

P3:03:42 <FSlSlayer> So hmm what do you get for buying minecraft?
P3:03:44 <Wolfram> Don't be absurd, and don't give him what he wants. Ignore that fool
P3:03:46 <FSlSlayer> do you get ur own world or something!?
P3:03:55 <TrueWolves> FSL, you can get your own server for fre
P3:03:57 <TrueWolves> free*
P3:04:01 <Wolfram> Access to the modes and features already in development, FSISlayer
P3:04:19 <Wolfram> As well as custom skins access
P3:04:23 <AlexVMiner> just please ban him
P3:04:24 <FSlSlayer> you can get your own server for free!? O.o..
P3:04:28 <FSlSlayer> wait what?
P3:04:35 <TrueWolves> Servers are free
P3:04:42 <Wolfram> Yeah, just download the software.
P3:04:59 <AlexVMiner> why can't you ban him?
P3:05:02 <TrueWolves> you get skins and things like survival (when they come out) for buying
P3:05:18 <FSlSlayer> where can i download the software?
P3:05:24 <FSlSlayer> or does buying it give me the link to download the software!?
P3:05:26 <Wolfram> Should be a link on the top of the server list
P3:05:27 <TrueWolves> on the server's page
P3:05:35 <TrueWolves> its easy as hell to see
P3:05:40 <TrueWolves> I don't know how you missed it

P3:07:52 <Oat> Or
P3:07:57 <Oat> Does anyone know if it is possible?
P3:08:13 <TrueWolves> citric!
P3:08:14 <Wolfram> No idea, Oat. No experience with Godaddy whatsoever.
P3:08:21 <Oat> Hrm.
P3:08:26 <TrueWolves> Aparently there is a troll in your hell map
P3:08:30 <Wolfram> No luck googling it?
P3:08:33 <Oat> nope
P3:09:08 <Wolfram> You'd think they'd have some guides or something for you to read.
P3:09:40 <Oat> Well
P3:10:05 <Oat> SSH is only on their linux shared hosting customer setups
P3:10:09 <Oat> And the account I've got
P3:10:14 <Oat> Is not that, basically.
P3:10:35 <Wolfram> I see.
P3:11:01 <AlexVMiner> i am bored now
P3:11:04 <Wolfram> It's a frustrating problem in that I have no idea what direction to point you in, even.
P3:11:10 <Oat> SSH is absolutely necessary, correct?
P3:11:19 <Wolfram> Go build something on TrueWolves' server, Alex
P3:11:24 <Wolfram> That place is pretty cool.
P3:11:28 <AlexVMiner> nevermind :D
P3:11:35 <Wolfram> Not sure, Oat. I'm really no expert
P3:11:36 <AlexVMiner> Castle Build is up
P3:11:40 <TrueWolves> There is a video of it
P3:13:29 <FSlSlayer> so hm...
P3:13:36 <FSlSlayer> I bought it?
P3:13:48 <FSlSlayer> All i have to do is wait!/
P3:13:56 <Wolfram> It was instant for me. o.o
P3:14:08 <FSlSlayer> Wait i get something for buying it?
P3:14:19 <Wolfram> Access to custom skins.
P3:14:23 <DarkCybrid> yes
P3:14:25 <Wolfram> That's the immediate bonus
P3:14:25 <DarkCybrid> YESH
P3:14:44 <DarkCybrid> go to the minecraft forums and there's a thread about skins
P3:14:48 <DarkCybrid> that you can dl and use
P3:14:56 <Wolfram> Yeah, there's tons to choose from already if you don't want to make your own.
P3:15:08 <Wolfram> Just click preferences at the Minecraft site to set it.
P3:15:09 <FSlSlayer> woah cool
P3:15:12 <citricsquid> http://minecraftskins.net :O
P3:15:17 <DarkCybrid> :O
P3:15:17 <Wolfram> That, too.
P3:15:19 <FSlSlayer> Thanks for the help.
P3:15:34 <Wolfram> No problem
P3:15:44 <citricsquid> I didn't realise how widespread minecraft hacks were
P3:15:47 <Wolfram> By the way, DarkCybrid
P3:15:50 <Wolfram> Nice creepy skin
P3:16:03 <Darkebrz> citric, they are becoming very popular
P3:16:04 <Wolfram> I regard them as a problem, citricsquid
P3:16:16 <citricsquid> I dislike them also, they suck.
P3:16:30 <citricsquid> my brother is using them and helping them be distributed, it's annoying.
P3:16:32 <Wolfram> I really just can't understand why anyone would not only refuse to oppose them
P3:16:35 <Wolfram> But ENCOURAGE them
P3:16:57 <Wolfram> "Oh but I only use my powers for good"
P3:16:57 <Snowman> AH DARKCYBIRD
P3:17:00 <Wolfram> Bah
P3:17:01 <Snowman> you skin
P3:17:03 <Snowman> its creepy
P3:17:08 <Wolfram> The abusers will always outnumber the users, for one thing
P3:17:15 <Wolfram> And allowing ANY hacks is just ASKING for
P3:17:16 <DarkCybrid> ty snowman
P3:17:18 <Wolfram> you guessed it
P3:17:20 <Wolfram> MORE hacks
P3:17:25 <PuyoDead> I've noticed a heavy flood of hacks lately
P3:17:27 <DarkCybrid> :O
P3:17:31 <DarkCybrid> yeah, i have hax
P3:17:31 <Wolfram> I shudder to think what evils could eventually be wrought
P3:17:35 <DarkCybrid> but only for admin powers
P3:17:47 <Snowman> No, not even for that
P3:17:49 <PuyoDead> people building stuff, then expecting me to be proud of something they made while flying
P3:17:56 <citricsquid> yeah
P3:18:00 <Wolfram> Amen
P3:18:15 <Snowman> Takes the skill out of building
P3:18:27 <PuyoDead> might as well make it in Omen
P3:18:38 <PuyoDead> not that I'm against Omen, I love it
P3:18:41 <Wolfram> Doesn't it seem like every concession made in the name of reducing effort just leads to more people asking for it to be even easier?
P3:18:45 <Wolfram> That really drives me nuts
P3:19:00 <PuyoDead> "why can't we just import a model!?"
P3:19:06 <PuyoDead> lazy bastages
P3:19:10 <Wolfram> And the people coming in with these concessions already implemented
P3:19:19 <Wolfram> They don't know what it was like before, so they don't know how to appreciate it
P3:19:22 <TrueWolves> I only make stuff in omen for map biulds
P3:19:32 <citricsquid> the achievement in minecraft is not the final product, it's the effort and skill required.
P3:19:34 <PuyoDead> yea, that's what Omen is for, setting up maps
P3:19:36 <TrueWolves> I handcraft everything else (like my Eagle 3)
P3:20:07 <Wolfram> I really hope Notch is able to do something about all the hacks.
P3:20:12 <PuyoDead> likewise
P3:20:22 <Wolfram> We'd be buying time at best, but something is better than nothing
P3:20:24 <citricsquid> wolfram: He can and most likely will; more verification will make most useless.
P3:20:29 <Wolfram> I'd rather cheaters have to jump through as many hoops as possible
P3:21:03 <DarkCybrid> you's convinced me to delete mah hax
P3:21:14 <Wolfram> Taking care of it before Survival is crucial
P3:21:17 <PuyoDead> in comparison to most FPS, you don't really see that many hacks. yet so far, they're spreading in MC far more quickly
P3:21:26 <Snowman> Hacks in survival would be really bad
P3:21:30 <DarkCybrid> hax=deleted
P3:21:31 <DarkCybrid> :D
P3:21:39 <Wolfram> Well done, DarkCybrid
P3:21:42 <PuyoDead> they take the spirit of the game right out
P3:21:56 <Snowman> Hacks in survival would be really bad
P3:22:00 <Snowman> ugh
P3:22:04 <Snowman> pressed arrow key >.>
P3:22:05 <DarkCybrid> yewah
P3:22:07 <DarkCybrid> yeah*
P3:22:07 <Wolfram> Haha

P3:22:12 <PuyoDead> and I don't care if someone makes the Taj Mahal with one, I'm not impressed
P3:22:13 <Wolfram> Well, it deserves to be said twice.
P3:22:34 <Wolfram> I was on a server where someone had built the Omaha beach earlier
P3:22:41 <DarkCybrid> wow
P3:22:44 <PuyoDead> I saw that one
P3:22:52 <Snowman> OMG WANNA SEE
P3:22:54 <DarkCybrid> musta been incredible
P3:23:03 <Wolfram> I liked it.
P3:23:07 <DarkCybrid> did they use hax?
P3:23:10 <Wolfram> I think it was mostly the fact that I recognized it

P3:23:16 <Wolfram> Rather than any insane detailing
P3:23:21 <Wolfram> No, by hand as far as I can tell
P3:23:21 <DarkCybrid> yeah
P3:23:25 <DarkCybrid> neat-o
P3:23:28 <Wolfram> I'll try to remember which server it was
P3:23:50 <PuyoDead> it was quite impressive. full beach, infantry boats, gun turret bunkers, even trenches behind them
P3:24:05 <DarkCybrid> i wonder how quickly the griefers changed that
P3:24:34 <PuyoDead> from the screenshots I've seen of the Goon servers, they've been the most impressive
P3:24:38 <Wolfram> They moderate pretty well, there
P3:24:46 <DarkCybrid> good
P3:25:05 <PuyoDead> Facepunch used to have some top-notch (no pun intended) stuff, but their servers went to shit
P3:25:14 <DarkCybrid> ha
P3:25:16 <DarkCybrid> nice pun
P3:25:30 <PuyoDead> you'd think the people working with GMod could do better
P3:25:36 <DarkCybrid> yeah
P3:25:40 <Wolfram> Omaha is on this server: http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=68ae2a703041cbd58671ddcda0cce43
P3:25:45 <Wolfram> But I think it's locked up for now
P3:25:49 <Wolfram> Only one other dude online.
P3:26:36 <DarkCybrid> what's the name of it?
P3:26:49 <Wolfram> Err
P3:26:52 <Wolfram> Kain's Server?
P3:26:53 <Wolfram> I think.
P3:27:05 <DarkCybrid> i think so...
P3:27:09 <PuyoDead> there was one point in time that one of the FP servers was FULL, FULL of excellent stuff, no griefing
P3:27:22 <PuyoDead> I think that was the peak :P
P3:27:23 <DarkCybrid> way back when? lol
P3:27:26 <Wolfram> I've never even been to a Facepunch server.
P3:27:28 <PuyoDead> yea, long ago :P
P3:27:32 <Wolfram> I generally avoid heavily populated servers.
P3:27:43 <PuyoDead> we even made Rapture
P3:27:52 <PuyoDead> -before- sponges, damnit
P3:28:02 <Wolfram> Christ, man
P3:28:06 <Wolfram> I bet that was a pain in the ass
P3:28:27 <PuyoDead> tunnels between the water-proofed skyscrapers, billboards out in the water
P3:28:34 <TrueWolves> The Eagle 3 was a huge space ship 100% underwater made by me and a friend over 10 hours before sponges x.x
P3:28:47 <TrueWolves> not quite like rapture though
P3:28:55 <Wolfram> I never built anything crazy underwater before sponges
P3:29:00 <Wolfram> But I did my fair share of deflooding
P3:29:02 <Wolfram> And then some.
P3:29:11 <PuyoDead> but the most popular FP server now is "Nazi Regime" so yea, you can imagine how it is now
P3:29:15 <Wolfram> One measly leaf block at a time
P3:29:26 <Snowman> FP?
P3:29:30 <PuyoDead> facepunch
P3:29:39 <Snowman> Oh

P10:54:44 <JimRaynor> nice to meet you bob, i hail your efforts with a hearty 'o/' to permanently destroy what I created, but I got 25 screenshots of it, so oh well
P10:55:00 <Bob_The_Builder> good for you buddy
P10:55:19 <Bob_The_Builder> i see in the logs that you are fed up and dont care if you get banned

P10:55:36 <Bob_The_Builder> i had my fun
P10:56:19 <PuyoDead> what's with the sudden flood of idiocy in here?
P10:56:38 <PuyoDead> did I miss a meeting or something?
P10:57:10 <JimRaynor> ah yes, I built a full scale behemoth battlecruiser and denied bob here flying hacks because he wasnt an op, and he decided to destroy my creation, and everything else on the server
P10:57:34 <Bob_The_Builder> u missed the part where i made my own hacks which have more features :)
P10:57:40 <PuyoDead> well, not just that, I mean it seems like the griefing folks are visiting irc now
P10:57:44 <Undeadsteak> Yo.
P10:57:45 <Undeadsteak> Bob.

P10:58:49 <Undeadsteak> Some program, I take it? 
P10:58:52 <PuyoDead> might want to look into how proxies work, there
P10:58:55 <JimRaynor> just 3, it wouldve taken 21 without flying hacks
P10:59:01 <Bob_The_Builder> ssh with port forwarding
P10:59:25 <Bob_The_Builder> btw i took some screenshots too

P11:32:09 <Saer> You are barely safe in your own home
P11:32:17 <Perogi> pl0x what is your server?
P11:32:27 <Undeadsteak> what does it say when connecting to a server you're banned in
P11:32:38 <Saer> "You're BANNED!"
P11:32:40 <Pl0x> first of all
P11:32:44 <Pl0x> If you want to grief
P11:32:44 <Saer> lol
P11:32:48 <Pl0x> there is no point
P11:32:49 <Undeadsteak> oh then im not bannedz.
P11:32:51 <Saer> I was banned from some server called Roleplay
P11:32:55 <Pl0x> as i keep backups.
P11:32:56 <Saer> I dunno why
P11:32:57 <Eagle> Sounds kinky
P11:33:00 <Saer> I should ask the forums
P11:33:13 <Pl0x> secondly if you be an idiot (really) you get teh banhammer
P11:33:14 <Pl0x> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=e0d3fe6b18c913a8a2c8fbb93e30635d
P11:33:33 <Pl0x> here.
P11:33:34 <Pl0x> if you want to grief go ahead.... 
P11:33:42 <Pl0x> But you will just waste you're time.
P11:34:07 <Pl0x> :)
P11:34:27 <Undeadsteak> wtf is 151chan
P11:34:28 <Undeadsteak> wtf
P11:34:35 <Undeadsteak> gay ass chan servers
P11:35:28 <Pl0x> hur undeadsteak is not intreasted in joining.
P11:35:48 <Undeadsteak> give me the name of srvr
P11:35:49 <Undeadsteak> ill come
P11:35:50 <Undeadsteak> otherwise nah
P11:35:54 <Undeadsteak> also im on another servar
P11:36:34 <Darkebrz> Plox
P11:36:37 <Darkebrz> Ill be on later
P11:36:46 <Pl0x> 	http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=e0d3fe6b18c913a8a2c8fbb93e30635d
P11:36:50 <Pl0x> there is the link ;0
P11:37:02 <Pl0x> k darke
P11:37:26 <Perogi> I'll go grief when I can get inbetween your backups
P11:37:28 <Perogi> see you then
P11:37:37 <Pl0x> lol no
P11:37:45 <Pl0x> well try it then?
P11:39:00 <Pl0x> you can't use " I can get inbetween your backups " because i have backup one when i first logged in, meaning if you log on later and screw everything, i can just restore to the first one i saved, and bam everything fixed
P11:39:23 <Perogi> you obviously have periodic backups
P11:39:27 <Perogi> I will grief just before an auto backup
P11:39:41 <Pl0x> no i have manual saved ones
P11:40:03 <Pl0x> Im smart enough to prevent griefing.
P11:40:26 <Pl0x> come on then you try it, you think it will work?
P11:40:55 <Perogi> I will when you least expect it
P11:41:02 <Perogi> one day you will backup without thinking
P11:41:06 <Perogi> and when you go back and look closely
P11:41:08 <Perogi> half your shit will be gone
P11:41:10 <Pl0x> i never forget.
P11:41:20 <Pl0x> and my server is only up when im HERE
P11:41:37 <Pl0x> it's not a dedicated server
P11:42:02 <Pl0x> sorry but there's no way to grief my server, you see even hackers fail in my server.
P11:42:12 <Eagle> Fail to hack?
P11:42:30 <Pl0x> No they try to use grief hacks but fail
P11:42:42 <Pl0x> meaning they are banned before they get the chance
P11:42:45 <Perogi> lol careful you bob might take that as a challenge
P11:42:53 <}AlLnAtuRalX> Pl0x, when you get these sorry morons' IPs just send them over
P11:43:02 <}AlLnAtuRalX> I'll add em to our banlist, which a few other servers use
P11:43:10 <Pl0x> ok add these ips then
