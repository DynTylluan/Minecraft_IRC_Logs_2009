A12:01:33 <Prime_2> auuugh
A12:01:38 <Prime_2> disconnect = :(
A12:01:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Disconnect = >:(
A12:02:10 <Prime_2> I had almost finished restoring the blemishes
A12:02:18 <skullxreaper> No one has any idea?
A12:02:19 <Syndlig> Any of you guys experts of map hacking Minecraft?
A12:02:25 <Prime_2> nope
A12:02:28 <PuyoDead> not I
A12:02:34 <Syndlig> :(
A12:02:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Define "expert"
A12:02:48 <Syndlig> "knows how to do it in any capacity"
A12:02:58 <Syndlig> I'm trying to edit a map to be 128 tall.
A12:03:01 <Syndlig> But I have no idea how.
A12:03:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I know how to do it in any capacity.
A12:03:16 <greenslimy> Get rosetta's tool
A12:03:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I'd like to point you to Rosetta's to...
A12:03:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Dangit.
A12:03:28 <Prime_2> ...
A12:03:34 <Syndlig> He released his tool?
A12:03:35 <Prime_2> falling lava server
A12:03:40 <Syndlig> Only one I know of is Minecrap.
A12:03:41 <Prime_2> someone make one
A12:03:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
A12:03:57 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not actually a very user-friendly thing, but it works.
A12:04:07 <Prime_2> and it certainly could never do that orb
A12:04:19 <vdgmprgrmr> You have to manually code the levels in markup-like language, but it works.
A12:04:32 <Prime_2> oh
A12:04:42 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm thinking of writing a frontend for it.
A12:04:48 <Prime_2> I thought you selected a coordinate, and it showed all planes intersecting with it, allowing for you to edit each tile
A12:04:59 <vdgmprgrmr> No, not Rosetta's tool.
A12:05:11 <vdgmprgrmr> But Rosetta's tool allows you to resize the map.
A12:05:26 <Syndlig> Okay
A12:05:28 <Syndlig> Not what I wanted.
A12:05:35 <Syndlig> Oh wait, it resizes maps?
A12:05:38 <Syndlig> I'm not seeing that :O
A12:05:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep, you can resize the map.
12A12:05:50 * Eagle (BLELELEL@c-24-56-213-79.customer.broadstripe.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:05:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Do you have the tool?
A12:06:06 <Prime_2> and are you going to conquer the world with it
A12:06:13 <Syndlig> Indeed.
A12:07:03 <vdgmprgrmr> If you'd like, I can write a config for it that'll generate a flat map that's 128 units tall.
A12:07:13 <Syndlig> That's not what I want though.  >_>
A12:07:23 <Syndlig> I just wanna take the maps generated by the game itself and increase their height.
A12:07:32 <greenslimy> do this
A12:07:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, I don't know if resizing a pre-existent map will increase the size in one or both directions.
A12:07:46 <vdgmprgrmr> But I know it can be done.
A12:07:54 <Syndlig> Just increasing the size will increase the size underground.
A12:08:00 <Syndlig> But generate it as air and be completely empty.
A12:08:05 <greenslimy> 	<Input>
A12:08:05 <greenslimy> 		<File path="server_level.dat"/>
A12:08:05 <greenslimy> 	</Input>
A12:08:07 <vdgmprgrmr> That can be fixed.
12A12:08:09 * skullxreaper (skullxreap@2001:0:cf2e:3096:0:fbf9:833a:de9f) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
A12:08:38 <Syndlig> What it needs to do is take the generated map, increase the height by 64, move the block data down 32 levels, and convert the bottom 32 levels to stone.
A12:08:40 <greenslimy> width="64" depth="1024" height="128" 
A12:08:54 <greenslimy> (not 1024 depth though lol)
A12:09:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Move the block data down 32, then convert the bottom 32 levels to stone?
A12:09:46 <Syndlig> Yeah.
A12:09:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Won't that result in most of the generated level being overwritten with stone?
A12:10:00 <Syndlig> No
A12:10:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure moving the existent block data down 32 would suffice.
A12:10:12 <Syndlig> If you just double the height the map won't move anything down.
A12:10:24 <Syndlig> Well, it would except
A12:10:33 <Syndlig> Then you'd have 32 height levels of open air below the map.
A12:10:38 <Syndlig> You'd dig down and suddenly fall 32 floors
A12:10:45 <Syndlig> And if you had water following you you'll crash the server.
A12:10:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Are you sure it ONLY increases the depth downward?
A12:10:55 <Syndlig> Yes
A12:11:09 <Syndlig> If you're increasing the height of the map it's just going to add the extra data onto the end of the file, is it not?
A12:11:09 <vdgmprgrmr> That doesn't sound very intuitive.
A12:11:20 <vdgmprgrmr> The map data starts at the bottom.
A12:11:31 <Syndlig> It does?
A12:11:37 <vdgmprgrmr> The first 256x256 characters are the very bottom of the map.
A12:11:40 <Syndlig> Oh.
A12:11:45 <Syndlig> Well.
A12:11:49 <Syndlig> That would work too except...
A12:11:57 <Syndlig> The water level would be 32 levels above the old water level.
A12:12:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Yup.
A12:12:04 <Syndlig> Still easily susceptible to flood-and-crash syndrome.
A12:12:14 <Syndlig> So then.
10A12:12:23 * Sl1N0 (Nilsoinas@dsl-roibrasgw1-feb8dc00-106.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
A12:12:31 <Syndlig> It's "add 64 height levels, move the map up 32, add 32 levels of stone to the beginning"
A12:12:34 <vdgmprgrmr> So you'd resize, move UP 32, then conver the bottom 32 to stone.
A12:12:39 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Yeah.
A12:13:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't think that can be done with Rosetta's tool, or any map-editing tool yet.
A12:13:50 <Syndlig> I don't see why not.  :P
A12:14:05 <Syndlig> Is it that hard to put data in before other data?
A12:14:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, not through any simple or easy methods.
A12:14:36 <vdgmprgrmr> No, but it is if you have to do it manually.
12A12:14:44 * NgLF (moor.t7@ppp-69-148-16-250.dsl.austtx.swbell.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

A12:15:42 <nickm> So, whats the deal on "dirty" words in server names?
A12:15:49 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A12:16:04 <nickm> Like, can i have a bad word in my server name
A12:16:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno.
A12:16:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't see why you'd want to, though.
A12:16:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Just seems kinda pointless for a server-name.
A12:16:35 <nickm> Thats true. I probably can't, anyway.
A12:16:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't see why you wouldn't be able to.
A12:17:19 <nickm> I don't know, maybe little children access the site
A12:17:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Just a sec, I'll try it.
A12:17:43 <Syndlig> You can
A12:17:55 <Syndlig> Most goon-run servers have bad words in them :V
A12:17:59 <Syndlig> And swastikas
A12:18:01 <Syndlig> And dick golems
A12:18:02 <vdgmprgrmr> There you go, I guess.
A12:18:03 <Syndlig> And more swastikas.
A12:18:05 <nickm> Sorry that probably sounded sarcastic the way i said "i don't know", my bad
A12:18:27 <nickm> Thanks for the help, guys :)

A12:20:50 <Syndlig> 7 years
A12:20:58 <vdgmprgrmr> That's an awful long time.
A12:21:28 <liq3> Heh.

A12:26:34 <LazyWaffle> did he START the wiki?
A12:26:36 <Kaidane> I can do some basic editing, but I'm not an expert by any means.  :P

A12:58:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Jesus...
A12:58:57 <vdgmprgrmr> This program is ridiculously inefficient, but I guess it's getting the job done.
A12:59:30 <LazyWaffle> made a diglet

A1:11:08 <vdgmprgrmr> What were you talking about?
A1:11:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> is that the size of a ... level?
A1:11:52 <vdgmprgrmr> No, not nearly.
A1:12:17 <vdgmprgrmr> It's the size of a level if you want the whole thing in a Rosetta's MCTool config file, though.
10A1:12:22 * paul|2 (grif392@209.65.247.45) has left #minecraft
A1:12:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> that
A1:12:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> is crazy
A1:12:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not really caring about efficiency here, so...
A1:13:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm almost certain there's a better way to do it.
A1:13:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> there's always a better way to do it
A1:13:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> but it takes time figuring out
A1:13:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Especially when the way you're doing it is ridiculous.
A1:14:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I probably could have lumped all the huge runs into a single cube.
A1:14:26 <vdgmprgrmr> (That is, one cube per run.)
A1:14:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> but it does what its supposed to, doesn't it?
A1:14:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno.
A1:14:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Been "testing" it for the last twenty minutes.
A1:15:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> so how are the clients going to gather the data
A1:15:34 <vdgmprgrmr> My language-of-choice is moronic, and doesn't allow the " character inside of strings at all, so I have to perform an edit-replace on this enormous text file.
A1:16:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> well good luck on that one

A1:21:27 <vdgmprgrmr> It still works.

A8:53:28 <ez> was fun as hell tho
A8:53:42 <Rroff> the whole lobby thing was really badly broken - and thats the damn easiest part of the whole game to program

A8:57:22 <ez> we played all on expert except the finalies... we only managed them on hard :(
A8:57:23 <citricsquid> ez: Yeah, me and 3 friends, was amazingly difficult :(
A8:57:31 <ez> yeh!
A8:57:33 <citricsquid> Took us around 30 tries on average per finale
A8:57:35 <Snowman> I got all l4d achievements :D
A8:57:42 <C418> I never got through an expert map in l4d
A8:57:53 <Rroff> :O
A8:58:07 <ez> lol, we tried the mercy final on expert a few times, then just had to realize all finalies gonna be on hard

A8:58:53 <ez> oh 30 tries citricsquid, maybe we shoulda tried more then
A8:59:01 <Rroff> how did it take you 100 hours on expert?
A8:59:03 <ez> think we had 10 tries or so
A8:59:12 <ez> don't remember really
A8:59:15 <Rroff> seems quite long
A8:59:16 <ez> but it was fun!
A8:59:26 <Rroff> me and my bro completed it on expert in under 5 hours
A8:59:35 <ez> cause expert is..... difficult!
A8:59:43 <citricsquid> ez: It was all about finding the best place to go and work together, we spent most tries finding a good spot and once we had it they were easy =D 
A8:59:45 <ez> showoff lol
A8:59:52 <Rroff> after you worked out how to handle the first finale tho
A9:00:01 <Rroff> its a lot quicker after that

A9:01:03 <Arzock> Anybody who hasn't got a super powerful computer here than can actually play minecraft?
A9:01:10 <Rroff> you only need one player slightly faster ot slower to down the entire team
A9:01:21 <citricsquid> Arzock: Check the forums, quite a few people with the same problem :)
A9:01:26 <Snowman> I got a lappy, that's not super powerful

A9:04:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> for word processing and all

A10:47:47 <Maulrus> but I am paving an underground fortress in colors
A10:47:51 <Maulrus> each level is a different color
A10:47:58 <nolan694> cool
A10:48:15 <CreepyYlleStatue> Idk the coloured blocks easily end up being too much
A10:48:27 <CreepyYlleStatue> but you can make great effects with them too
A10:48:40 <unknownczar> I think the color blocks are FABULOUS
A10:48:44 <nolan694> i saw an awesome megaman mural made with them
A10:48:45 <Maulrus> yeah but if used in moderation they look awesome
A10:48:55 <Maulrus> gold is awesome if you use it only occassionaly
A10:49:00 <Maulrus> buildings of gold = ugly
A10:49:11 <nolan694> agreed
A10:49:14 <smn> i think glass still looks shite even tho notch hinted otherwise
A10:49:15 <unknownczar> gold blocks look pretty bad. they look nothing like gold
A10:49:27 <Maulrus> glass has sorta grown on my
A10:49:30 <Maulrus> I like it 
A10:49:32 <Maulrus> *me\
A10:49:34 <nolan694> they need to make placeable water
A10:49:37 <nolan694> or lava
A10:49:38 <CreepyYlleStatue> I love glass
A10:49:41 <unknownczar> glass is fine if notch added some opacity
A10:49:41 <Quatroking> yay I'm eating pie
A10:49:45 <CreepyYlleStatue> Glass looks amazing with lava imo
A10:49:49 <nolan694> but not the infinte kind
A10:49:51 <Maulrus> it's only good-looking function right now  IMO is used as windows above ground
A10:49:52 <smn> glass = fugly
A10:50:09 <smn> :D
A10:50:16 <nolan694> im glad they put sand back in
A10:50:23 <nolan694> that was my go to guy for climbing
A10:50:32 <CreepyYlleStatue> Yesterday 
A10:50:42 <CreepyYlleStatue> I set up so I could play minecraft with a controller.
A10:50:51 <nolan694> tnice
A10:50:57 <nolan694> *nice*
A10:51:04 <CreepyYlleStatue> Eeeeh.... I guess it was okay but I still prefer mouse+kb
A10:51:36 <nolan694> someone needs to mod it for use with wiimote and nunchuck
A10:51:57 <unknownczar> Hmm... that doesn't sound too bad of an idea... I think i will give joytokey a try.
A10:52:14 <CreepyYlleStatue> yeah the hard part was binding the mouse to a joystick

A10:55:05 <Bobobo> there needs to be some block interaction :D
A10:55:10 <Bobobo> i want block programming
A10:55:26 <Nalok> Here's the front of the castle I'm working on for my RP---http://tinypic.com/r/1z38abo/5
A10:55:32 <Maulrus> minecraft is still really early on, and it's amazing
A10:55:47 <Maulrus> I have total faith that Notch is gonna make more and more awesome things
A10:55:56 <Rroff> I hope so
A10:55:57 <Bobobo> nalok
A10:56:00 <Nalok> ?
A10:56:00 <Bobobo> how small is that pic
A10:56:01 <Bobobo> lol
A10:56:02 <Bobobo> its tiny
A10:56:10 <Nalok> I know, lol
A10:56:26 <Nalok> You can atleast see it though, lol
A10:58:03 <Reset> I dont think finite water is going to be good.
A10:58:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> fine shot
A10:58:09 <Bobobo> taking a screenshot now
A10:58:19 <Bobobo> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=ifuark&s=5
A10:58:22 <Bobobo> i made the flower
A10:58:27 <Bobobo> a friend made the other two
A10:58:33 <Rroff> the only thing I miss but I see it being difficult to implement is mover blocks
A10:58:42 <Bobobo> i went out to dinner and then someone built a helicopter in my server haha
A10:58:44 <Rroff> so you can have lifts and simple back and forth trains
A10:58:46 <Nalok> Here's a screenie of the WIP inside > http://tinypic.com/r/33ekjfo/5 (It's bigger,lol)
A10:58:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> moving blocks?
A10:58:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> i want those too
A10:58:54 <Bobobo> moving blocks would be cool
A10:59:06 <Nalok> I want switches and buttons
A10:59:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> they should be possible
A10:59:08 <Rroff> they'd be hard to implement simply tho :S
A10:59:10 <Bobobo> switches yeah
A10:59:18 <Bobobo> but too much detail isnt good
A10:59:18 <Bobobo> like
A10:59:22 <Rroff> you'd have to have a way to group blocks as an entity
A10:59:23 <Bobobo> part of the appeal is the simplicity
A10:59:30 <CreepyYlleStatue> wth..
A10:59:40 <CreepyYlleStatue> there's someone named atr on my non-public server
A10:59:45 <Bobobo> lol
A10:59:47 <Rroff> tho movement paths wouldn't be too bad as simple a start and end point would be enough
A10:59:57 <Bobobo> i say
A11:00:11 <Bobobo> incorperate the euphoria physics engine into the game
A11:00:12 <Bobobo> :)
A11:00:17 <Rroff> lol
A11:00:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> that would cause massive lags
A11:00:26 <Rroff> it couldn't handle that many blocks
A11:00:27 <Bobobo> ah well
A11:00:28 <Bobobo> haha
A11:00:34 <Bobobo> realistic block stacking
A11:00:36 <Rroff> more than about 200 would lack out any normal CPU
A11:00:48 <Rroff> tho
A11:00:49 <Bobobo> could just throw a block into a structure and it'd tumble down
A11:00:52 <Bobobo> it'd be cool though
A11:01:09 <Rroff> as the entire world is just blocks you could simplify the physics and prolly throw around 4000 active RBs
A11:01:37 <Rroff> but I think most engines cap out at around 64K objects including sleeping ones
A11:02:02 <Rroff> the normal map has like 4million doesn't it?

P2:31:28 <Quatroking> i think they're pretty fucked up.
P2:31:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> k iran
13P2:32:34 * vdgmprgrmr doesn't know anything about Iran.
P2:32:34 <Quatroking> I find it funny how the government there is hating the west because we tell the truth to their people while their government is telling lies
P2:32:48 <Quatroking> they're even cutting off interwebs ._.
P2:32:56 <Zuriki> Yay Iran!
P2:32:59 <citricsquid> no minecraft for the iranians!
P2:33:00 <vdgmprgrmr> What is their government telling them?
P2:33:02 <Quatroking> woo
P2:33:06 <Quatroking> I dunno
P2:33:18 <Zuriki> It's full of corrupt minded whiners who are never happy with the way things are!
P2:33:20 <citricsquid> that the votes weren't tampered with or rigged =D
P2:33:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> The Internet hates freedom
P2:33:22 <Quatroking> but apparantly the itnernet is bad influence for the iran people
P2:33:42 <Zuriki> I agree.
P2:33:47 <vdgmprgrmr> ... So you say that their government is lying to them with no actual examples to back it up.
P2:34:06 <vdgmprgrmr>  :/
P2:34:12 <Zuriki> The internet is full of darn westerners, infidels.
P2:34:22 <Zuriki> The votes were rigged.
P2:34:23 <Quatroking> their government is saying the west is corrupting their people
P2:34:30 <citricsquid> vdg: Have you seen the shit that's going on in the country?
P2:34:33 <Zuriki> That's not true.
P2:34:41 <Quatroking> or something
P2:34:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, so I'd like reliable information.
P2:34:51 <Zuriki> The votes were rigged, that's it.
P2:34:55 <Quatroking> watch some cnn or something
P2:35:00 <Zuriki> News says so. Riots say so.
P2:35:01 <citricsquid> People being killed by the governments forces, is that not enough proof that they're lying to the people? Why would they need to do what they're doing if they were truthing?
P2:35:16 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P2:35:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Sarcasm?
P2:35:28 <citricsquid> oh =o
P2:35:29 <Quatroking> they even cut off the itnernet so the iran people can't access outside sources of news and stuff
P2:35:33 <Arzock> Because they have very naughty people?
P2:35:40 <Quatroking> *internet
P2:35:41 <Testvan> we debating roras again?
P2:35:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope.
P2:35:50 <Quatroking> we're debating the love of iran
P2:36:05 <vdgmprgrmr> And I vowed never ever to do that ever again, Testvan. It's painful.
P2:36:22 <Testvan> doin it for the devil
P2:36:27 <Arzock> What is roras?
P2:36:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> debates are funny
P2:36:31 <Quatroking> all the iran people are now communicating with each otehr through proxies
P2:36:32 <citricsquid> I saw a mock account on twitter of their president, it was hilarious. Stuff like "brb, surpressing the people" and "afk having citizens murdered!" 
P2:36:41 <Quatroking> lol
P2:36:54 <Empty> Bugged again?
P2:37:00 <Testvan> iran will be cool when the old people die
P2:37:01 <Zuriki> That's why there is no internet there.
P2:37:06 <Kapow> they didn't even try to hide that the vote was rigged
P2:37:09 <Rroff> "out to lunch, whole village needs 're-education'"

P2:38:24 <Zuriki> You need to join Fig Hunter my friend.
P2:38:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Why nuke Iran?

P2:39:28 <Quatroking> fuck greenpeace
P2:39:29 <Kapow> I bet you have the most hilarious t-shirts dude
P2:39:31 <Zuriki> I say we launch every nuke in every country and target the equator.
P2:39:36 <Zuriki> End the misery.
P2:39:45 <Quatroking> Gotta blow shit motehrfuckers GREEEEEEEEENPEACE
P2:40:12 <Zuriki> I say: MASS EUTHANASIA!
P2:40:13 <Quatroking> I wonder what would happen if we nuked the moon
P2:40:21 <Zuriki> It'd blow up.
P2:40:28 <Quatroking> cool
P2:40:52 <Zuriki> Probably destroying earth too.
P2:41:02 <Quatroking> hey yeah, in all those stupid movies about asteroids that are about to hit the earth, why don't they ever nuke them
P2:41:08 <Kapow> in Iran they were supposed to wait 3 days after the election to review the results and accept any challenges from candidates, and then have the Council of Experts certify the winner before the Supreme Leader (Khamenei) gives final approval
P2:41:10 <Zuriki> Something to do with the sea or giant meteors if you nuked it enough.
P2:41:12 <Quatroking> I mean come on the USA alone has enough to blow the world up 40 times
P2:41:24 <Quatroking> not to mention russia
P2:41:25 <Zuriki> Because.
P2:41:26 <Kapow> instead Khamenei just announced that Ahmed won immediately after the ballots were "counted"
P2:41:29 <Zuriki> Radiation.
P2:41:37 <Kapow> and called it a divine proclamation and shit
P2:41:39 <Zuriki> Fragment effects.
P2:41:44 <Quatroking> meh
P2:41:48 <vdgmprgrmr> What the hell kind of an election was it?
P2:42:00 <Quatroking> they flipped a coin
P2:42:01 <vdgmprgrmr> A Supreme Leader has to give approval?
P2:42:17 <Kapow> supreme leader is above the elected president
P2:42:21 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P2:42:24 <Kapow> it's really screwy
P2:42:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> shit's screwed up
P2:42:34 <Kapow> they don't have real democracy there
P2:42:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Why doesn't the Supreme Leader just CHOOSE if he has veto power \?
P2:42:40 <Quatroking> obviously
P2:42:50 <Kapow> because then this happens
P2:42:51 <Quatroking> ever noticed how they never have a democrazy in lands like iran and iraq
P2:43:00 <Quatroking> *democracy
P2:43:00 <Kapow> you're seeing what happens when he just chooses
P2:43:01 <Zuriki> Why doesn't EVERYONE JUST ACCEPT THINGS.
P2:43:21 <Quatroking> blow up the goddamn desert
P2:43:25 <Quatroking> good for nothing
P2:43:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Zuriki... That was sarcasm?
P2:43:38 <Zuriki> Cholerics are the problem. That includes me.
P2:43:45 <Zuriki> To an extent, yes.
P2:43:52 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Okay.
P2:43:56 <Kapow> anyway, the respect that the Iranian people had for the Supreme Leader is down the fucking drain no matter how this turns out
P2:44:04 <citricsquid> everyone should just stfu and play minecraft =D
P2:44:07 <citricsquid> all the worlds problems solved
P2:44:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> okay
P2:44:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> let's play
P2:44:21 <Arzock> I would play minecraft, but there is too muhc lag D:
P2:44:33 <vdgmprgrmr> ... that's a terrible thing to say, citricsquid. We weren't even fighting!
P2:44:55 <Zuriki> I wonder what would happen if the minecraft forums all of a sudden went down. Would there be a mini IRC riot?
P2:45:01 <citricsquid> vdg: I saw you kick him under the table! Don't deny it >:(
P2:45:10 <vdgmprgrmr>  :(
P2:45:13 <Zuriki> Would people say it's non-democratic.
P2:45:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
P2:45:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> ?
P2:45:27 <Quatroking> I'm going to colonize the freaking moon and blow up the lands I don't like with my moonlaser

P3:36:53 <Lmaoboat> I was unware 16 counted as massive
P3:37:16 <vdgmprgrmr> My idea: We take the standard FPS weapons, and warp them to look like medieval weapons, so we have throwing knives instead of the classic-weak-ass-pistol, bow or crossbow instead of sniper rifle, wooden bomb-launcher instead of rocket launcher, etc.

P3:41:13 <smn> 100 players, huge-map.
P3:41:15 <Quatroking> actually I do see that happening one day
P3:41:19 <smn> me too
P3:41:23 <Rroff> it could happen now
P3:41:30 <Rroff> assuming there no memory limitations in the code
P3:41:33 <smn> it could have happened yesterday!
P3:41:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure Notch has said he's going to have Survival mode, which will be RPG-ish, classic FPS modes, which are FPS-ish, and zombie-siege mode, which will be a zombie game, and a random dungeon thingy, which will be RPG-ish, but more than Survival, methinks.
P3:41:45 <Nalok> I hope Notch does that
P3:41:52 <Lmaoboat> 100 player maps sounds horrible, and not just  because of lag
P3:41:56 <Quatroking> I don't really know if we're able to get a server run 100 players
P3:41:59 <vdgmprgrmr> And it's got SP AND MP so we can't classify it as MP-anything.
P3:42:01 <Quatroking> without crashing
P3:42:08 <smn> wut
P3:42:14 <smn> mc server barely uses memory
P3:42:15 <vdgmprgrmr> The only real binding factor between all the parts of MC are first-person.
P3:42:18 <smn> and cpu
P3:42:21 <Nalok> Oh man, the anti-grief bunker we built on one of Arzock's servers would be a good zombie siege map
P3:42:21 <Rroff> well neither CPU or memory would be an issue
P3:42:31 <vdgmprgrmr> So I suggest that MC start the FPE genre, which First-Person-Everything.
P3:42:35 <smn> just need some smoother net code
P3:42:41 <smn> to cut the bandwidth a bit
P3:42:51 <Rroff> and I've never seen the server use more than ~800Kbit/s combined up and down even when really really busy
P3:42:52 <Quatroking> so Minecraft would be MOFPSB? Massive Online First person SandBox
P3:42:58 <smn> like, less frequent updates for players in other chunks
P3:42:59 <smn> and whatnot
P3:43:03 <Quatroking> Well then
P3:43:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, because it's not necessarily online.
P3:43:13 <vdgmprgrmr> And not all the game modes will be sandbox.
P3:43:14 <Rroff> and 100Mbit and decent bandwidth allowance costs next to nothing

P8:30:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P8:30:33 <Quatroking> Exactly.
P8:31:06 <Quatroking> It's funny how citricsquid hosts a lot, but doesn't really have much technical knowledge :P
P8:31:18 <Maulrus> anybody see Liam in a server they're on?
P8:31:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm gonna take a look at the other chatroom
P8:31:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> aww
P8:31:45 <Quatroking> talking about a slow loading page..
P8:31:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> bob ross is in there all alone by himself
P8:31:52 <Quatroking> LOL
P8:32:03 <Quatroking> it's not even loading for me
P8:32:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> with the chatroom bot as a companion
P8:32:17 <Quatroking> refreshing..
P8:32:42 <Quatroking> nope, not loading

P8:34:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> well
P8:34:24 <Quatroking> Did anyone else notice how that Bob Ross guy really doesn't like good things
P8:34:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> it requires flash
P8:34:30 <Quatroking> he's such a downer
P8:34:49 <Quatroking> Dude, I have the debug flash player

P8:35:12 <Quatroking> after like, 3 refreshes the console popped up with parameter errors
P8:35:20 <Quatroking> I own Flash CS4
P8:35:30 <Quatroking> it comes with a modified flash player
P8:35:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's odd

P8:35:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> just ordinary generic flash 10
P8:36:07 <Quatroking> Could be because I'm using a nightly of Firefox
P8:36:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> also i happen to think bob ross wants a hostile takeover of the chatrooms
P8:36:16 <Quatroking> oh well
P8:36:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> but that could be a wild guess
P8:36:47 <Quatroking> bob ross is just one of those guys who can't accept it that they can't have everything
P8:37:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> iran :v
P8:37:16 <Quatroking> Why would anyone want iran
P8:37:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> i dunno
P8:37:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> guys were having a debate on iran and they brought up that phrase
P8:38:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> and did you see this: http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=368
P8:38:37 <Quatroking> Yeah, I started that debate
P8:38:42 <Quatroking> I say we nuke 'em
P8:38:46 <Quatroking> Hold on
P8:39:22 <Quatroking> heheh

P8:49:50 <Eagle> Like a banhammer sounds like somebody is going to get hurt. A bat just reminds me of fragile wooden bats.
P8:50:20 <Quatroking> Shall I block him from editing pages for 917 years or just one week?
P8:50:47 <Eagle> 917 years.

P10:04:13 <Maulrus> problem
P10:04:20 <Quatroking> Hmm?
P10:04:23 <Maulrus> I had a level save called server1 save5.dat
P10:04:26 <Maulrus> which was a backup
P10:04:54 <Maulrus> I renamed it to server-level.dat and put it back in the server folder
P10:04:54 <Maulrus> but start server.bat says there's no level file
P10:04:54 <Maulrus> this is a huge problem

P10:08:32 <PuyoDead> shouldn't it be server_level.dat?
P10:10:43 <Zuriki> I so wish there was one line to win a womans heart.
P10:10:51 <Zuriki> It would really make my job easier.
P10:10:57 <Maulrus> yeah

P10:11:27 <Zuriki> I mean, luring women into your house to slaughter them is no easy task with the slaughtering aside.
P10:11:29 <Maulrus> I reverted it back
P10:11:39 <Maulrus> but it was already griefed before the first server reset

P10:25:18 <Maulrus> 15 minutes perhaps?
P10:28:44 <Maulrus> oh god problem
P10:28:51 <Maulrus> is there any way to manage my server remotely?

P10:49:52 <Maulrus> or what it does now?
P10:50:27 <Dragoon_Jett> It would raise

P10:55:10 <Trashman> oh ok
P10:55:14 <Maulrus> then switch it back to server.properties when you're done
P10:55:17 <Trashman> thanks
P10:55:18 <Maulrus> before you start the server
P10:55:20 <Maulrus> np
P10:58:16 <Maulrus> hmm

P10:58:54 <Maulrus> wait
P10:58:56 <Maulrus> something like that
P10:59:00 <Dragoon_Jett> Maulrus, I fixed your city sign
P10:59:05 <Maulrus> you did?
P10:59:07 <Inschato> That sounded confusing right from the start o.O
P10:59:12 <Maulrus> I didn't makee it, waht was wrong
P10:59:13 <Maulrus> Okay
P10:59:19 <Inschato> Python is kind of like BASIC, and what you just said made no sense
P10:59:26 <Maulrus> yeah I know

P11:02:08 <Maulrus> to be griefed
P11:02:08 <LazyWaffle> is it private?
P11:02:10 <Maulrus> and public but >_>
P11:02:28 <LazyWaffle> make it private and i'll get my non-griefing friends to join
P11:02:30 <Inschato> linky or uhm..?
P11:02:40 <LazyWaffle> thusly getting it more popular with less griefs
P11:02:49 <Maulrus> I don't wanna make it private just yet
P11:02:53 <Maulrus> or at all maybe
P11:02:55 <LazyWaffle> just trust me
P11:03:01 <Maulrus> hrm
P11:03:02 <Inschato> Oh there it is
P11:03:06 <LazyWaffle> all public servers are going to hell
P11:03:10 <Maulrus> I know
P11:03:12 <Maulrus> well
P11:03:14 <LazyWaffle> the Ocean Build server had craploads of awesome statues

P11:03:34 <Maulrus> yeah...
P11:03:39 <Maulrus> I might do it tomorrow
P11:03:40 <LazyWaffle> seriously, i coulg et alot of people to join

P11:04:27 <LazyWaffle> thanks
P11:04:27 <Maulrus> only a bit of griefing so far
P11:04:35 <Maulrus> not that I consider that to be permanent
P11:04:38 <LazyWaffle> so you're making it private tomorrow?
P11:04:40 <Maulrus> gonna write a backup script
P11:04:41 <Maulrus> maybe
P11:04:46 <Maulrus> I need to tell some people first
P11:04:49 <Maulrus> but they are asleep now
P11:04:51 <LazyWaffle> ok
P11:04:57 <LazyWaffle> thanks
P11:05:19 <Maulrus> is there any easy way to just make a permanent loop in python?
P11:05:21 <Maulrus> easily?
P11:05:46 <Inschato> Doesn't it have some sort of do while thing?
13P11:05:59 * Inschato hasn't read any python code in a long time
P11:06:01 <Maulrus> yeah it does
P11:06:06 <Maulrus> do while what?
P11:06:13 <Inschato> do while true?
P11:06:16 <Maulrus> isn't that just like a while loop that executes it at least once?
P11:06:19 <Maulrus> oh dur
P11:11:00 <Maulrus> ITT I forget how to copy files
P11:15:41 <notjotham> it concerns me i have to write a raycaster/voxel engine to make a decent viewer for minecraft

P11:23:45 <Maulrus> my terrible script failed
P11:23:53 <notjotham> what's it do
P11:24:02 <notjotham> while True: btw
P11:24:12 <notjotham> but you probably want to sleep it
P11:24:21 <Maulrus> ah
P11:24:25 <Inschato> I hate programming..
P11:24:31 <Maulrus> I want a script to periodically back up my server
P11:24:36 <notjotham> programming is my job and hobby
P11:24:38 <Inschato> I used to like things.. back when it was QBASIC and it was really easy to see what everything was doing
P11:24:41 <notjotham> Maulrus: minecraft server?
P11:24:44 <Maulrus> yes
P11:24:48 <Maulrus> and yes I want it to sleep
P11:24:49 <notjotham> ok
P11:24:53 <Inschato> My brother makes a 6-7 figure income from programming, I still hate it >_>
P11:24:57 <Maulrus> but I thought I could just put a sleep in at the bottom
P11:25:02 <notjotham> first of all i'd suggest using cron rather than a while loop
P11:25:03 <Maulrus> of the while loo
P11:25:06 <notjotham> that's what cron is for
P11:25:06 <Maulrus> loop
P11:25:08 <Maulrus> ...
P11:25:08 <Maulrus> cron
P11:25:09 <Maulrus> wat
