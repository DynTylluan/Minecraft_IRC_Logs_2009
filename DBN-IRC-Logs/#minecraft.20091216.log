A2:38:12 <mloc> Im going to play some MC now
A2:38:14 <sf17k> refrush your baked goodes
A2:40:55 <OpalMist> My desktop recently died. I haven't been able to play since then. My laptop sort of plays it, but doesn't have nearly as much grunt. Since minecraft's newer updates, it seems to have increased the resource demand on the computer, meaning using my laptop to play hasn't been as much on an option...
A2:42:40 <OpalMist> For something so "simple", minecraft is insanely resource heavy.

A2:43:02 <OpalMist> My graphics card on the desktop fan goes like a jet engine.
A2:43:10 <OpalMist> graphics card fan
A2:45:29 <mloc> Resource heavy?
A2:45:29 <mloc> What fog do you use?
A2:45:59 <OpalMist> Closer, rather than further. It used to run fine.
A2:46:12 <OpalMist> It was after some updates a while ago.
A2:46:20 <OpalMist> then it just ground

A2:47:58 <OpalMist> FF
A2:48:00 <OpalMist> XP

A2:48:25 <OpalMist> But I suppose a reinstall wouldn't hurt.
A2:48:29 <sf17k> java did update recently
A2:48:33 <OpalMist> It is a slightly older laptop
A2:48:33 <sf17k> but I don't think it was major
A2:48:36 <mloc> Use javara
A2:48:42 <OpalMist> I need more RAM
A2:48:44 <mloc> Remove all old javas
A2:48:55 <OpalMist> but the thing is, it USED to be able to run fine
A2:49:03 <mloc> http://raproducts.org/
A2:49:08 <mloc> Try javara
A2:49:13 <OpalMist> javara...hm
A2:49:21 <mloc> Then reinstall java
A2:49:41 <OpalMist> Hm. Righty...
A2:50:09 <OpalMist> oh, wow, hang on
A2:50:20 <OpalMist> the newer WOM wrapper seems to be starting up for a change

A4:12:58 <Parthon> what does If run in atm?
A4:13:09 <Roadcrosser> huh
A4:13:23 <Parthon> what does IF currently run in at the moment?
A4:13:23 <Roadcrosser> interactive fiction is a genre
A4:13:40 <Roadcrosser> to play you need a story file
A4:13:44 <Roadcrosser> and an interpretter
A4:13:55 <Roadcrosser> i have no idea how to patch one so it runs through the bot
A4:13:59 <Parthon> yeah, that's what I mean
A4:14:00 <Roadcrosser> only
A4:14:11 <Roadcrosser> there are many if interpretters
A4:14:14 <Parthon> is there only one main interpretters or many?

A4:24:33 <Roadcrosser> its not neccesary to patch it

A8:20:25 <Drakkar> and I am kind of sad the third was not made
A8:20:34 <Marach> what games? @_@
A8:20:41 <Drakkar> still zelda games
A8:20:58 <PuyoDead> I'm hoping they get back to making good portable games like those again someday.
13A8:21:10 * Marach needs to educate about zelda
A8:21:16 <PuyoDead> The latest DS ones have been pretty disappointing.
A8:21:26 <Drakkar> I liked phantom hourglass
A8:21:28 <Drakkar> except the ship bits

A8:21:41 <Marach> but Minish Cap is really good
A8:21:51 <Drakkar> minish cap felt like half of a zelda game tbh
A8:21:55 <PuyoDead> Replace "ship bits" with "train on a pre-set track", and you get the new one.

A8:21:58 <Drakkar> too short
A8:22:00 <Drakkar> yeah I'm aware
A8:22:05 <Marach> why?
A8:22:08 <PuyoDead> It's painfully boring.
A8:22:11 <Drakkar> shoooort
A8:22:12 <VurtualRuler98> I want a floating train.
A8:22:16 <VurtualRuler98> That'd be awesome.
A8:22:16 <Drakkar> its just not enough of a zelda game for me
A8:22:26 <Drakkar> like I can beat minish cap in an afternoon
A8:22:28 <Drakkar> it was really easy
A8:22:31 <Marach> it took me really long
A8:22:35 <Marach> it was hard!
A8:22:37 <PuyoDead> Yea, Minish Cap was pretty short (the side quest stuff seemed to be made to fill that space), but I think it was pretty good still.
A8:22:38 <Marach> rofl
A8:22:49 <Drakkar> yeah I usually ignore the side quests
A8:22:53 <Marach> final boss took ages
A8:22:55 <Drakkar> unless they're new items
A8:22:58 <PuyoDead> I will say, the last boss marathod was a PITA.
A8:23:03 <Drakkar> oh yeah
A8:23:04 <PuyoDead> *marathon
A8:23:15 <Marach> a what?
A8:23:19 <Drakkar> I do like minish cap though
A8:23:21 <Drakkar> 'pain in the ass'
A8:23:24 <Drakkar> PITA
A8:23:30 <Marach> a.
A8:23:57 <Drakkar> I'm kind of a special case when it comes to zelda though
A8:23:59 <Marach> PH is even shorter game
A8:24:03 <Drakkar> as I don't like most of the 3d entries
A8:24:03 <Drakkar> and yeah
A8:24:07 <Drakkar> PH is definitely too short
A8:24:10 <PuyoDead> Spirit Tracks may be the only one in the series I don't finish.
A8:24:12 <SMP> I'm making a mayan/south american ruins skin, what should the bookcase be?
A8:24:20 <Drakkar> stone!
A8:24:24 <Marach> im stuck in it second time alredy
A8:24:37 <Drakkar> I really dug how they did area maps though
A8:24:40 <Drakkar> and the drawing puzzles
A8:24:52 <Roadcrosser> if ya missed it, tinyurl.com/muppetbloopers and tinyurl.com/donoteverevereverclickthis
A8:24:55 <Marach> and first time, it was definetely game's fault

A8:26:20 <Marach> >:(
A8:26:25 <Marach> you should warn me
A8:26:26 <PuyoDead> Yea, that's the biggest problem, the total lack of an overworld (ST doesn't have one whatsoever).
A8:26:28 <Drakkar> vehicles should clearly be dealt with like epona in OoT
A8:26:49 <Drakkar> yeah the overworld is really key
A8:26:58 <Drakkar> I -like- exploring the world
A8:27:15 <PuyoDead> At least in PH, you could move around what was there, even if it wasn't an overworld like normal. ST simply doesn't have one.
13A8:27:25 * Marach points at Ludum Dare entries
A8:27:31 <Drakkar> I'm aware
A8:27:35 <Drakkar> I half-participated in it
A8:27:48 <PuyoDead> Yea, I can't say I've put too much effort into it.
A8:27:51 <Marach> in ST there were even some hidden islands
A8:28:03 <Drakkar> its coo'
A8:28:23 <Drakkar> I didn't finish but I'm very happy with how far I went with my game
A8:28:26 <Marach> as opposing to hidden train stations -_-'
A8:28:39 <Drakkar> you mean PH
A8:28:51 <Marach> ah yes
A8:29:01 <Drakkar> xD
A8:29:13 <Marach> ...
A8:29:30 <Roadcrosser> ...
A8:30:09 <Marach> so which one of older ones i should play first? :D
A8:30:25 <Drakkar> pretty much all of them
A8:30:31 <Drakkar> just go in chronological order
A8:30:36 <Drakkar> you'll pick your favorites as you go
A8:31:08 <Marach> i dont think my pc will handle N64 emu
A8:31:14 <bildramer> ...?
A8:31:15 <Marach> PSP barely does
A8:31:30 <PuyoDead> You might not like the first one, due to not having played it already (it's showing its age, obviously)
A8:31:33 <Drakkar> skip it then
A8:31:39 <Drakkar> yeah zelda 1 is also unfairly hard
A8:31:53 <PuyoDead> Yea, pretty damn difficult without knowing what to do.
A8:32:02 <PuyoDead> It just drops you off... and that's it.
A8:32:08 <PuyoDead> G'luck.
A8:32:08 <Marach> i want to see "IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE!"
A8:32:29 <PuyoDead> Well, you'll see that.
A8:32:40 <PuyoDead> Unless you have a thing against caves.
A8:32:58 <Marach> was there a game missing those shooting blobs?
A8:33:09 <PuyoDead> Chus?
A8:33:20 <Marach> whatever
A8:33:22 <PuyoDead> Octaroks?
A8:33:43 <Marach> you could deflect the bullets with a shield in some
A8:34:13 <Marach> let me see the dictionary
A8:34:15 <bildramer> Marach: easy
A8:34:16 <PuyoDead> Probably octaroks. Those have been there since the very first one. I think there are some missing them, though.

A11:18:24 <Caleo> :P
A11:18:38 <Quatroking> hmm
A11:18:40 <Quatroking> Yeah
A11:20:22 <Caleo> well, I wouldn't necessarily say shit specs, but you can get more for your money elsewhere
A11:20:45 <Caleo> Quattro cards are aimed at professional graphics artists, there's really nothing special that they do
A11:20:57 <Caleo> quadrowhatever
A11:21:11 <Quatroking> pro graphical artists?
A11:21:22 <Quatroking> artists need a lot more power for their work
A11:21:28 <Quatroking> not a shitty expensive card
A11:21:44 <Caleo> In introducing the Quadro, NVIDIA were able to charge a premium for essentially the same graphics hardware in a different market. To differentiate their offerings, NVIDIA used driver software and firmware to enable features vital to segments of the workstation market; high performance anti-aliased lines and two-sided lighting were reserved for the Quadro product. In addition, improved support through a certified driver program was put in plac
A11:21:44 <Caleo> e.
A11:21:58 <Caleo> CAD, 3D rendering, etc
A11:22:45 <Caleo> Quadro cards tend to have more ram than usual
A11:22:55 <Quatroking> Yeah
A11:22:57 <Quatroking> Just noticed that
A11:23:02 <Caleo> but other than that their price is unjustified
A11:23:08 <Quatroking> a 3500 euro card with 4GB vram
A11:23:13 <Jat> but they do have better support from nvidia which can be important in a setting like they are used in
A11:23:22 <Quatroking> and their resolution seems to be rather high

P12:02:18 <bildramer> I'm putting books at the corners to let air flow
P12:02:28 <Quatroking> my temps are 22c on both hdd's, 45 on the cpu, 35 on the gpu and 30 on the mobo
P12:02:29 <bildramer> the fans don't run at full speed, though :|
P12:02:36 <Quatroking> throw them on 100%
P12:02:41 <Marach> hah, i already saw db2, 3 and 4 failing
13P12:02:46 * bildramer wonders if this will fail
P12:03:12 <bildramer> nothing happened
P12:03:19 <MonkeyDKS> Also make sure there's room around the vents, and there's no dust in the filters
P12:03:24 <bildramer> in fact, the temps of the CPUs have been higher
P12:03:25 <MonkeyDKS> Any temp changes will happen slowly
P12:04:07 <Quatroking> you mean you put your fans all up in this bitch and nothing happened at all
P12:04:22 <Quatroking> is your fan even working
P12:04:26 <bildramer> I mean I tried to put up the fans and nothing happened at all
P12:04:36 <bildramer> and I still wonder, WTF Dell
P12:04:42 <Quatroking> oh
P12:04:44 <Quatroking> say no more
P12:04:49 <bildramer> the fan speed depends on the CPU temp?
P12:04:49 <Quatroking> Dell=hell
P12:04:59 <bildramer> :|
P12:05:07 <Quatroking> oh you should be able to disable that in the bios if I'm not wrong
13P12:05:14 * bildramer guesses best plan is to heat up the CPU, but rethinks it
P12:05:20 <Quatroking> have it run at a fixed speed instead of temp-dependent
P12:05:40 <bildramer> should I try the "100% fans on leave" SpeedFan option?
P12:05:57 <Quatroking> uh
P12:06:01 <Quatroking> no idea
P12:06:06 <bildramer> *tries
P12:06:16 <bildramer> oh ffff-
P12:06:18 <Quatroking> sounds like that'll throw your fans on 100% until the system is cooled down when your shutting off your pc
P12:06:22 <Quatroking> my PSU does that
P12:06:22 <MonkeyDKS> Speedfan is telling me my fan temp is 117F
P12:06:23 <bildramer> nothing happens at all

P12:06:28 <Quatroking> sort of
P12:06:29 <MonkeyDKS> I'm not sure I believe that
13P12:06:48 * bildramer believes the temp sensor is crazy
P12:07:03 <bildramer> I guess it cannot have gone 40 degrees up in 5-7 minutes
P12:07:16 <Quatroking> lemme try speedfan
P12:07:26 <Quatroking> I always have Everest Ultimate running, you see
P12:07:32 <bildramer> oi
P12:07:37 <bildramer> enabled Dell support
P12:07:47 <bildramer> hmm...
P12:07:50 <Quatroking> windows vista/7 sidebar support which is pretty awesome
P12:07:52 <bildramer> Temp1 is 81 C
P12:08:06 <bildramer> CPU and GPU burning
P12:08:15 <bildramer> DIMM alright at 48
P12:08:24 <Quatroking> thats your ram?
P12:08:31 <Quatroking> thats NOT alright
P12:08:32 <bildramer> Temp4 and Temp5, whatever those are, at 42C
P12:08:43 <bildramer> ...?
P12:08:45 <bildramer> well
P12:08:48 <Quatroking> My ram is barely reaching the 30
P12:09:12 <bildramer> but it's a green checkbox-like V for me
P12:09:17 <bildramer> :|
P12:09:21 <Quatroking> but then again I've got this buffalo ram with heatsinks
P12:09:22 <bildramer> CPU fell at 50, GPU 58
P12:09:29 <bildramer> lol
P12:09:35 <bildramer> HD0 at 39..
P12:09:45 <Quatroking> does it always take so long to load speedfan
P12:09:48 <bildramer> wtf, Temp1 must be a random sensor
P12:09:52 <bildramer> a little, yeah
P12:10:11 <bildramer> also the fan is at 3266RPM
P12:10:18 <bildramer> and I'm wondering why I have a single fna

P12:11:12 <bildramer> :/
P12:11:14 <bildramer> fuck Dell
P12:11:53 <bildramer> hmm...

P12:12:26 <bildramer> whatever, it's the only thing in the ACPI group
P12:12:33 <bildramer> maybe it's in Fahrenheit?
P12:12:42 <bildramer> :/
P12:12:58 <bildramer> then it would be 45 C, pretty plausible
13P12:13:30 * bildramer tries FULL FAN SPEED which obviously doesn't work
P12:13:42 <Quatroking> wut
13P12:13:46 * bildramer wants to punch Dell in the face
P12:13:53 <Quatroking> according to speedfan 50c on my cpu means its overheating?
P12:14:13 <bildramer> again, it's 80,5 C
P12:14:13 <Quatroking> what a bullshit the emergency shutdown is at 110c
P12:14:18 <stefanstyle> Lawl Translator=win
P12:14:19 <bildramer> lmao
P12:14:27 <bildramer> set it down, quickly
P12:15:11 <bildramer> I guess mine should be at 80 :|
P12:15:45 <bildramer> the CPU temps are oscillating, pretty weird
P12:15:59 <bildramer> 48, 52, 48, 52, 48...
P12:16:13 <stefanstyle> 
P12:16:26 <bildramer> aaargh turn up the goddamn fan!
P12:16:32 <bildramer> 2943 RPM
P12:16:51 <Quatroking> I have 3 speed settings of which only one works
P12:16:54 <Quatroking> ._.
P12:17:00 <stefanstyle> Abcdefghijklmnopqrstu - vwxyz **
P12:17:02 <bildramer> mine doesn't work at all
P12:17:13 <Quatroking> andthe one that works works only half

P12:17:19 <bildramer> :|
P12:17:21 <gea1> i havent bothered trying to see about updates
P12:17:24 <gea1> its just full on
P12:17:26 <gea1> all the time
P12:17:28 <bildramer> at least I can cook eggs
P12:17:34 <Quatroking> its now at 100% but when I throw it at 0% the fan just halfs the speed
P12:18:17 <bildramer> I believe it is a Fahrenheit -> Celsius fail
P12:18:33 <bildramer> well, Celsius would be 45
P12:18:42 <bildramer> just alright
P12:19:04 <gea1> lol
P12:19:17 <Quatroking> anyways
P12:19:24 <Quatroking> for temp reading everest is a lot better
P12:19:30 <bildramer> also, Dell is very helpful

P2:06:13 <Snowman> I tell em to shut up, religion is a lie
P2:06:36 <PuyoDead> Agnostic.
P2:06:42 <Jat> no
P2:06:45 <Jat> ignostic

P2:08:13 <Snowman> Lol, anyone on the forums that doesn't know TI-Basic?
P2:08:16 <PuyoDead> Sounds downright silly.
P2:08:52 <Jat> what does?
P2:09:05 <PuyoDead> Ignosticism
P2:09:08 <Jat> why?

P2:09:23 <Snowman> Omg
P2:09:29 <Snowman> Need 2 more people for the Christmachinima
P2:09:31 <Jat> its like a form of agnosticism... the problem with just saying youre an agnostic is that people seem to interpret that as meaning different things
P2:09:37 <PuyoDead> Sounds like an even weaker version of agnosticism
P2:09:48 <Jat> yep
P2:09:56 <SMP> snowman: you got my link, right? lol. I didn't see a S(checkmark) next to my name in the post >..
P2:10:05 <Jat> whats wrong with not havign a strong stand on the issue? :|
P2:10:05 <Snowman> It has one, refresh the page
P2:10:29 <Snowman> Agnosticism is atheism for pansies
P2:10:37 <SMP> k
P2:11:07 <Jat> atheism is based just as much on faith as religion :|

P2:13:33 <bildramer> if religion seems not serious, no need to... take it seriously, duh
P2:13:36 <Jat> thatd epends on what cnocept of god you are referring to
P2:13:43 <Snowman> ALl forms
P2:13:46 <PuyoDead> The problem is that people take the term atheism too litteral. You won't find many atheists who strictly say "I know there is no god"
P2:13:50 <Jat> there are many ways to interpret the judaiochristian god which i assume id what youre talking about
P2:14:03 <bildramer> agnosticism is like "no idea, dude"
P2:14:12 <bildramer> if I translated correctly
P2:14:14 <Snowman> I talk about every god, Normal God, Allah, Buddha, etc.
P2:14:24 <Jat> puyo the term atheism usually is used to refer to the belief that there is no god but there are different kinds of atheism technically
P2:14:28 <Snowman> bildramer, agnosticism is "dunno, lol"
P2:14:33 <bildramer> yes
P2:14:43 <PuyoDead> It's more of a "I don't beleive in the idea of a god; I don't find it possible". Not "I know there is no god"
P2:14:47 <Jat> but when people say atheism it is often assumed they are strictly denying the existence of any gods
P2:15:01 <Jat> otherwise you have to specify
P2:15:05 <Jat> your specific beliefs
P2:15:08 <PuyoDead> To be technical, most of us would be considered Agnostic Atheist

P2:36:30 <Jat> i dont think that function you just gave will be particularly interesting

P3:17:42 <frogger> Okay just making sure... I sent becuase the first one sucked
P3:17:42 <Quatroking> just recently
P3:17:49 <Quatroking> doesn't make a lot of difference
P3:17:56 <Wareya> okay
P3:18:00 <frogger> i sent 2
P3:18:02 <Wareya> but it's 3 ghz
P3:18:14 <Wareya> either you're lying or what ran like shit is terrible optimized
P3:18:16 <Snowman> The end is a bit cut off, but not bad
P3:18:26 <Quatroking> I'm not lying
P3:18:33 <frogger> its like that in the video.
P3:18:33 <Wareya> okay so it's the other
P3:18:37 <Quatroking> its probably software developers
P3:18:39 <Wareya> what were you running?
P3:18:46 <Snowman> I mean you stopped the recording too early :p
P3:18:51 <Quatroking> mirror's edge was horrible with physx, for example
P3:19:01 <Wareya> yes
P3:19:03 <Wareya> yes it was
P3:19:06 <Snowman> So it's like: "And everyone is singi-"
P3:19:17 <Quatroking> all I could run with physx enabled, and smoothly were games like crazy machine fluid edition
P3:19:35 <frogger> you want me to add some air time for the next line to come in?
P3:19:46 <Wareya> :O
P3:19:49 <Wareya> how much RAM

P3:20:19 <Quatroking> thats the pre-release for cool kids
P3:20:33 <Quatroking> you know, the release magazines get
P3:20:33 <Wareya> so it's  a little faster than vista
P3:20:34 <frogger> k
P3:20:40 <Wareya> and you only have 4 GB for 64-bit

P3:21:08 <Wareya> go get AVG 8.0 free and Clamwin
P3:21:14 <Quatroking> but released a few weeks earlier
P3:21:14 <Quatroking> hah
P3:21:16 <Wareya> RTM is cool
P3:21:17 <Quatroking> avg hell no
P3:21:20 <Snowman> Nah it isn't completely finished :p
P3:21:26 <Snowman> Still has final bugs
P3:21:28 <Wareya> avg doesn't rape your system if it's not scanning
P3:21:29 <Quatroking> snowman, yes, it is.
P3:21:35 <Wareya> no it's not
P3:21:37 <Snowman> But those are fixed with WIndows Update :p
P3:21:41 <Wareya> it's a prerelease
P3:21:47 <Quatroking> avg yells at me constantly when I'm running programs that use memory injections and stuff
P3:21:53 <Quatroking> snowman: so...?
P3:22:01 <Wareya> then disable that part of AVG
P3:22:03 <Wareya> :P
P3:22:03 <Quatroking> thats pretty logical
P3:22:05 <Wareya> but seriouslty
P3:22:06 <Annihilator> stop using avg then
P3:22:09 <Wareya> he did

P6:17:41 <Iguana> All of mine are shit.
P6:17:49 <clone1018> New processor
P6:17:52 <Caleo> depends what you have Iguana 
P6:17:58 <Stoov> Monitors, while important, don't affect performance.
P6:18:02 <Caleo> but chances are if you're upgrading your processor you're going to have to buy a new mobo & ram
P6:18:02 <Iguana> I know.
P6:18:07 <Stoov> If your processor is the bottleneck, replace it.
P6:18:13 <Stoov> Same goes for the video card.
P6:18:16 <TKLeader> That was before ultramon
P6:18:17 <TKLeader> Btw
P6:18:24 <TKLeader> You can have two wallpapers without ultramon

P6:20:34 <Stoov> Well we need more than the speed
P6:20:34 <TKLeader> 2 gigs of ram
P6:20:36 <Caleo> so the only thing I'd upgrade is my video card
P6:20:37 <Stoov> The name for one

P6:22:01 <Stoov> Not true.
P6:22:14 <Stoov> If the processor isn't so old that he'd have to upgrade the socket
P6:22:17 <Stoov> He wouldn't have to
P6:22:22 <Caleo> chances are he's got an old pre-PCIE mobo
P6:22:26 <Stoov> And the ram can still be used, as long as the sockets fit
P6:22:32 <Stoov> Most likely, yes.
P6:22:36 <Stoov> But he might luck out
P6:22:37 <Caleo> it's possible but unlikely 
P6:22:40 <Caleo> doubtful.

P6:31:50 <clone1018> With 1000 dollars :D
P6:31:50 <Caleo> shit
P6:32:01 <Caleo> I was going to play minecraft but I don't have java on my netbook -.-
P6:32:02 <Stoov> Or better yet
P6:32:10 <clone1018> <Caleo> chrome is pretty nice except for the lack of firefox like addons
P6:32:12 <Stoov> Go build a desktop, piece by piece, for 400 dollars
P6:32:21 <clone1018> https://chrome.google.com/extensions
P6:32:23 <Stoov> And it'll beat the pants off of most market laptops.

P6:33:21 <Caleo> none of the stuff I use
P6:34:25 <Annihilator> give em some time
P6:34:42 <Annihilator> firefox probably didn't have those when they just began developing
P6:36:12 <Snowman> Iguana, get a Dell XPS M1530
P6:36:29 <Caleo> my netbook is going to hate me for this

P6:41:02 <Visiiri> (Alex is my brother; eighth grade)
P6:41:16 <Visiiri> Four students were arrested. Here's the run down:
P6:41:32 <Visiiri> Before school: To girls brought gin in water bottles.
P6:41:43 <Visiiri> Before school: *two; They chugged it.
P6:42:11 <Toadbert> ok
P6:42:13 <Visiiri> Third Period: one goes into the bathroom and drinks more. She passes out and is dying from alchohol poisoning.
P6:42:15 <AndrewPH> VLK ARGH I DON'T WANT TO RETYPE IT ARLHSJD
P6:42:23 <vLK> wut
P6:42:26 <sf17k> holy shit
P6:42:37 <AndrewPH> If it's as easy to modify as JTE's, I'll gladly use it.
P6:42:38 <Visiiri> Fourth Period, the other original girl and one more had more of it.
P6:42:49 <Visiiri> Fourth Period, someone turned them in.
P6:42:53 <Caleo> lol, yeah
P6:42:56 <vLK> Well it won't be easy to modify if you don't know C++
P6:42:57 <AndrewPH> Retarded girls.
P6:42:59 <Snowman> 8th grade is what age?
P6:42:59 <Visiiri> Between Fourth and Fifth period: someone caught them.

P6:43:17 <Caleo> 1-10fps in minecraft on a moderate size server (256x256x128) with lots of user-built stuff
P6:43:17 <Visiiri> Sixth Period: they were pulled out of the school.
P6:43:20 <AndrewPH> vLK, I meant add commenting so that It's obvious what things do.

P6:43:21 <Caleo> on my netbook
P6:43:27 <vLK> Yeah of course
P6:43:31 <Caleo> more than I expected since java's a piece of shit
P6:43:46 <Toadbert> java really sucks on this comp
P6:43:47 <Toadbert> :(
P6:43:57 <AndrewPH> I don't know even a tiny bit of perl, but I managed to add several modifications since it has basic commenting.

P6:45:11 <AndrewPH> You can
P6:45:14 <AndrewPH> It's just not easy.
P6:45:19 <clone1018> Exactly
P6:45:20 <AndrewPH> I took me four hours to get it working right.
P6:45:21 <Caleo> I love this thing, overclocked quite easily from 2.66 -> 3.66ghz
P6:45:31 <sf17k> Visiiri: what then
P6:45:47 <Caleo> turbo speeds for 1-2 core threads (while the other cores are inactive) = 4.1GHz
P6:45:51 <Caleo> so it's pretty win
P6:46:04 <clone1018> I wish I could over clock
P6:46:14 <clone1018> But my laptop would burst into flames
P6:46:24 <AndrewPH> My Q6600 is better than your i5
P6:46:36 <Toadbert> god damn
P6:46:40 <AndrewPH> because everything in the name is higher in value (derp derpa)
P6:46:45 <Toadbert> does anyone know how to make minecraft take up less memory

P6:49:30 <Caleo> I facepalm every time someone insists higher frequency is ALWAYS better
P6:49:57 <Caleo> righto, chap.. you're going to tell me a 3.8ghz P4 is better than my 3.66ghz Intel Core CPU
P6:50:32 <Caleo> not only do I have 4 more cores than you do, I've got more processing power per clock which means with my 3.66ghz on a single core I can calculate more operations than your P4 can at 3.8GHz
10P6:51:34 * mail2345|offline is now known as mail2345|smacx
P6:51:36 <Caleo> plus, my 3.6ghz i5 has a turbo mode that steps up the multiplier if other cores are inactive for single thread processing
P6:51:46 <Caleo> which means I get something like 4.1GHz on up to 2 cores
10P6:52:11 * mail2345|smacx is now known as mail2345
P6:53:07 <Caleo> lets see... 171 bus *21 multiplier = 3.6ghz... 171 * 24 multiplier (which is what it steps up to for turbo mode) = 4.1ghz

P6:57:15 <vede> Since the idea behind adding the abilities to the standard client is to make it so less people can use third party hacks, so server owners can combat "hacks" better.

P8:27:39 <vede> God this keyboard sucks.
P8:27:51 <vede> It's only about... fifteen or so years old.
P8:28:18 <Iguana> Does your computer suck more than mine?!
P8:28:23 <Iguana> INHUMANLY POSSIBLE, I SAY.
P8:28:25 <vede> Can't very well get a new one. So if this one ever breaks, I have to fix it myself.

P8:29:19 <Iguana> Well, oldest computer I have in my house is something running '98.
P8:29:32 <vede> My monitor is nice, my mouse is OKAY (scroll wheel has seizures occasionally), but my keyboard is nightmarish.
P8:30:04 <Iguana> On the computer that runs '98, all I can find is something that says Baby Blue.
P8:30:05 <vede> Keys missing, space bar doesn't spring back up, and there's about six or seven pads missing between the keys and the connection sheet.
P8:30:06 <Iguana> Wtf.
P8:30:09 <Iguana> It's beige...
P8:30:29 <PuyoDead> I'm fairly sure you could kill a man with a Model M.
P8:30:40 <revenant> I prefer Model H
P8:30:46 <revenant> hover jump and dual swords.
P8:30:47 <Iguana> Keyboard?
P8:30:48 <revenant> Very nice.
P8:30:56 <revenant> No, I was thinking Megaman.

P10:11:59 <mail2345|homework> i'm making people quit
P10:12:05 <mail2345|homework> just by talking to myself
P10:12:12 <mail2345|homework> when i should be doing homework
P10:12:14 <mail2345|homework> watch
P10:15:23 <sf17k> homework numbs your brain
P10:15:44 <sf17k> there's really no good reason to do it
P10:16:35 <sf17k> psychologists have studied the nature of learning for years and it's well-understood that learning happens through self-motivated experience
P10:17:23 <mail2345|homework> ehh
P10:17:29 <sf17k> so not only will homework always fail if the student is not interested in the subject, but it teaches more about how to write words in blanks than the subject itself
P10:17:30 <mail2345|homework> i still have to do it
P10:17:43 <mail2345|homework> i am interested in the subject
P10:17:47 <mail2345|homework> however the assignment sucks
P10:17:58 <mail2345|homework> making a flip book of mitosis
P10:18:09 <sf17k> that's the most retarded thing I have ever heard of
P10:18:21 <mail2345|homework> it
P10:18:22 <sf17k> what would happen if you didn't do it
P10:18:28 <mail2345|homework> i would get down to a B
P10:18:30 <mail2345|homework> instead of an A
P10:18:34 <sf17k> why is that bad
P10:18:40 <sf17k> it's worth not doing it imo
P10:18:52 <mail2345|homework> my parents will kill me
P10:19:02 <sf17k> I'm sorry then
P10:19:06 <sf17k> your parents are misguided
P10:19:09 <sf17k> guess that's not their fault

P11:21:49 <EmpiresBane> I've completely forgotten how to initialize things in C#!
P11:22:08 <Jat> initialize <code>
P11:22:41 <EmpiresBane> luckily, I have C# for Dummies!
P11:24:30 <mail2345|homework> C#
P11:24:45 <EmpiresBane> yeah, what about it?
P11:24:45 <mail2345|homework> C# is the bastard child of C++ and java
P11:25:10 <Jat> c# is a musical note
P11:25:16 <Jat> i dont know what youre doing trying to program with it
P11:25:41 <EmpiresBane> I like it cuz it's faster than Java if done right, but the syntax is similar to Java
P11:25:48 <EmpiresBane> which I know a little bit of
P11:26:27 <Jat> what are you programming?

P11:26:44 <EmpiresBane> currently, I'm making a .log reader/filter
P11:26:49 <mail2345|homework> empires
P11:26:53 <Jat> then speed doesnt really matter
P11:26:56 <mail2345|homework> i bet i could do that in python
P11:26:58 <mail2345|homework> in ohh
P11:27:00 <Jat> you should just program it in the easiest language
P11:27:04 <mail2345|homework> less than 1 min
P11:27:06 <Jat> like python
P11:27:10 <mail2345|homework> given the correct data

P11:28:22 <Jat> stop collecting so much porn
P11:28:38 <EmpiresBane> I store that on flash drives
P11:28:50 <EmpiresBane> that way  i can watch it at night on my xbox

P11:31:53 <EmpiresBane> if i change again, I'll never actually get committed to a language

P11:37:07 <EmpiresBane> so, I'm debating whether I should load each line into a array of strings at the beginning and reading from those when filtering
P11:37:09 <EmpiresBane> or...
P11:37:10 <EmpiresBane> just reading through the file each time I run a filter

P11:39:33 <clone1018> :D
P11:39:38 <vede> :D
P11:39:49 <EmpiresBane> the program is designed to filter .log files based on users or op commands

P11:40:25 <mail2345|homework> empires
P11:40:34 <mail2345|homework> the time you have took wondering how to code it

P11:40:48 <clone1018> ^^^
P11:41:04 <EmpiresBane> I would come across the same problem in Python

P11:41:54 <mail2345|homework> what kind of filter?
P11:42:26 <mail2345|homework> regexp?
P11:42:28 <mail2345|homework> easy
P11:42:33 <EmpiresBane> It only outputs the lines that pertain to the selected users or op commends
P11:42:37 <mail2345|homework> oh
P11:42:38 <mail2345|homework> k
P11:42:54 <vede> Why would you use a command to get console output?

P11:43:10 <mail2345|homework> f = open('minecraft.log')
P11:43:10 <vede> I mean, why get lines from log files?

P11:44:02 <EmpiresBane> I'm sure I seem confusing
P11:44:04 <vede> No really, I just don't see why you need to get lines out of the log file?
P11:44:20 <vede> What would it be used for?
P11:44:27 <EmpiresBane> I'll get a prototype working then ask about optimization

P11:48:42 <vede> Jat, reading a log file each time someone does a command is a really brute-force option, though.
P11:48:43 <mail2345|homework> right
P11:49:00 <mail2345|homework> cat file | grep pattern > newfile.log
P11:49:07 <Jat> wait it does it each time someone does a command?

P11:49:39 <vede> You could just go through it once, make a nice, organized list of, say, who banned who, when such-and-such joined, and then just read the server output, and update the list when needed.
P11:50:01 <vede> There's no need at all to read it each time, or even keep the whole log in memory.
P11:50:29 <Jat> i have no idea what hes doing then
P11:50:33 <EB|Coding> the point is to filter AFTER the server has been closed
P11:50:39 <EB|Coding> not while it's running
P11:50:40 <Jat> thats what i thought
P11:50:55 <vede> But EB|Coding, you said it would be based on ops' and users' commands.
P11:50:57 <EB|Coding> I wouldn't use the .log if the server is running
P11:51:09 <vede> Ops and users can't very well do a command when the server isn't running, now can they?
P11:51:36 <EB|Coding> You search through the .log looking for every thing a user has said
P11:51:47 <EB|Coding> or everytime a certain command was used
P11:51:54 <Jat> use regexp
P11:52:05 <Jat> in c# i mean
P11:52:07 <EB|Coding> i have no idea what that is...
P11:52:07 <vede> ... You're having trouble figuring out how you would do THAT?
P11:52:16 <mail2345|homework> whee
P11:52:19 <mail2345|homework> as i said
P11:52:20 <EB|Coding> I know 2 ways to do it
P11:52:26 <mail2345|homework> the time spent debating
P11:52:33 <mail2345|homework> could be used downloading python
P11:52:37 <mail2345|homework> taking a quick tutorial
P11:52:40 <vede> I could have had that done before I went to school yesterday.
P11:52:42 <mail2345|homework> and making it
10P11:52:45 * mail2345|homework is now known as mail2345|afk
P11:52:48 <mail2345|afk> mmm
P11:52:50 <mail2345|afk> food
P11:52:52 <mail2345|afk> DEAD SHRIMP
P11:52:56 <EB|Coding> one would be faster but could use lots of memory in large .logs
P11:53:10 <EB|Coding> the other would be slower, but would use almost no memory
P11:53:45 <EB|Coding> besides, the point of this isn't to get a filter, it's for me to get some experience with programming
P11:54:22 <Jat> oh ok
P11:54:31 <EB|Coding> and now, I'm out of time....
P11:54:34 <vede> If you want to figure out programming, just to get a feel for how it works, you should especially use Python, I think.
P11:54:42 <EB|Coding> God damn rules
P11:55:58 <EB|Coding> I've programmed before. It's just that over the summer, I didn't do any. I want to do something that at least has a use now, even if not much of one.
