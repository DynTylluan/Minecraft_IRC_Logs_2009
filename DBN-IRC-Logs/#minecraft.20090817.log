A12:19:34 <LG_Legacy> Speaking of octopus
A12:19:41 <LG_Legacy> How many of you have actually sent money to the squid?
A12:20:10 <PuyoDead> I would, if I could
A12:20:14 <mail2345|semi-afk> same
A12:20:48 <LG_Legacy> Huh you know, i got this odd feeling we're in this circle
A12:21:08 <PuyoDead> problem is, I need to get one of those job things, first
A12:21:35 <LG_Legacy> Puyo, me, mail, unknownx, quatroking, annihilatorbeta, and i think someone else.
A12:22:22 <mail2345|semi-afk> holy fucking christ
A12:22:35 <UnknownX> I never gave him money :(
A12:22:38 <mail2345|semi-afk> a bmp of a 3MB png takes 100x the sie
A12:22:39 <Jeffman12> I made a lava pit and someone made a mess of my server
A12:22:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> jeez
A12:22:50 <UnknownX> The only way i could have is if i mailed it to him
A12:23:09 <UnknownX> Or were you not talking about the money
A12:23:38 <mail2345|semi-afk> my last three lines were about hte retardedness of bmp
A12:24:08 <Super-Dot> I think it's cuz bmp is uncompressed
A12:24:27 <Super-Dot> Which is useful sometimes
A12:24:54 <Super-Dot> But it means that it's really silly to use bmp as a default save format in an image editor

A6:09:42 <Marach> TheOne, if i make you a new lava survival map, will you use it?
A6:10:06 <TheOne> what are you thinking of for a map?
A6:10:09 <Marach> my idea is to flood layer by layer, automatically
A6:10:21 <Marach> lava starts at ceiling and splits
A6:10:35 <Marach> with dillerent "fuse" times will flood higher and higer areas
A6:10:37 <Jakkarra> when the dungeon mode comes out, lava survival will be a LOT easier
A6:10:39 <Marach> different*
A6:10:41 <TheOne> I'd have to see the map

A6:54:58 <Quatroking> you have the "oh god I'm so fat but I don't care om nom nom hahaha i'm eating all the time" kind of fat and you have the "i'm fat, thats it." kind of fat
A6:55:08 <liq3> what's that rule? the one about porn fetishes for everything.
A6:55:23 <citricsquid> a fetish for being an IRC op!
A6:55:33 <liq3> Quatroking: Do them a favor, and give them as much food as they want. In a few months/years they'll be dead. ;]
A6:55:39 <Tich> How do you call for phone sex like that
A6:55:58 <Quatroking> they're fucking up our planet by eating so much
A6:56:01 <Tich> asking: "pretend you are a server and you make me op on you."
A6:56:09 <liq3> Quatroking: no, the people who provide the food is.
A6:56:17 <liq3> Although I agree fat people are stupid for being fat.
A6:56:18 <citricsquid> "Hello, sex line!" "I have joined your channel." "Channel sets mode +o you" "oh baby I like that."

A6:57:41 <citricsquid> not done excercise since like, 2 years ago

A6:58:06 <Quatroking> how the hell can you do american football without running

A6:58:52 <liq3> hehe, rolling fat boy.
A6:59:01 <liq3> rofl.
A6:59:01 <Quatroking> it happened a few times that he just completely random fell over because he was too fat

A6:59:34 <citricsquid> I must do at least 4k calories a day, probably more.
A6:59:41 <Quatroking> citricsquid you can't put widgets in your food
A6:59:52 <liq3> citricsquid: because this guy did an experiment, eating nutin but mcdonalds for a month. Put on huge amounts of weight.

A7:06:01 <liq3> rofl.
A7:06:03 <Tich> 20- is underweight and 25+ is overweight or something
A7:06:11 <citricsquid> liq3: Yeah, but some people are naturally larger than others.
A7:06:15 <liq3> Yeh BMI isn't really accurate.
A7:06:20 <citricsquid> 18.5 is underweight :)
A7:06:22 <liq3> You gotta get proper measurements done.
A7:06:24 <Tich> but BMI doesn't take into account the density of your muscles or the proportions of your body
A7:06:45 <Quatroking> people shouldn't have things like "every friday french fries"
A7:06:47 <liq3> Tich: Yes. Proper measurements can be done to find fat percentage. :P
A7:06:56 <Tich> I have longer legs then average but a normal torso
A7:07:00 <Quatroking> I eat fries once a month or something
A7:07:05 <Tich> And I'm classified as underweight
A7:07:07 <liq3> Quatroking: They shouldn't have junk food full stop.
A7:07:13 <liq3> It does NOTHING for your body.

A7:08:23 <citricsquid> doesn't mean everyone does.

A7:08:53 <liq3> Quatroking: No you're not.
A7:08:57 <Quatroking> i am.
A7:09:08 <liq3> No. food is a source required by the body to give it energy and nutrients.
A7:09:09 <citricsquid> No you're not Quatroking.
A7:09:14 <liq3> TV is an entertainment system.
A7:09:17 <liq3> Thy're completely different.
A7:09:22 <Quatroking> there's nothing wrong with junkfood, as long as you eat it just ONCE IN A WHILE
A7:09:25 <Tich> Let survival of the smartest do it's role
A7:09:41 <liq3> Quatroking: no, even a little bit of junk food is unhealthy.
A7:09:41 <citricsquid> Quatroking: whenever you eat it the effects will be negative
A7:09:48 <citricsquid> but if you eat it once in a while they won't be as noticable.
A7:09:51 <liq3> Also, junk food is extremely redundent. There's plenty of healthy food that tastes INSANELY good.

A7:54:14 <maurits150> hmm ok
A7:54:14 <Marach> i fyo change it, it will just go back to 3
A7:54:17 <Marach> if you*
A7:54:28 <liq3> i think it's max connections from one IP
A7:54:36 <Tich> probably
A7:55:48 <maurits150> hmm.. so if I change it to 0 then I won't be able to connect. I'm gonna test that..
A7:56:00 <Marach> no!

A7:58:19 <maurits150> I can't join in 2 different browsers on this server now, with max-connections=1
A7:58:25 <maurits150> now it should work if i change it to two
A7:58:52 <TheOne> so max connections from an address?
A7:59:44 <citricsquid> per IP.

P1:44:36 <Eagle> Hello.
P1:44:41 <PuyoDead> something like madworld wouldn't have existed in the 90's
P1:44:47 <PuyoDead> but now they allow stuff like that
P1:45:22 <Eagle> Madworld is like the Wii is trying to get people to say "GOD YES WII IS SO HARDCOOOOORE" even though it's just one game.
P1:45:32 <PuyoDead> no more heroes
P1:45:41 <Eagle> I've never played that. :/
P1:45:53 <PuyoDead> it's just as much (if not more) violent
P1:45:59 <Eagle> Well then,
P1:46:01 <Eagle> Two games.
P1:46:28 <PuyoDead> point being, nintendo simply didn't allow anything close to that during the snes days
P1:46:45 <PuyoDead> they would censor alcohol, violence, crosses, tons of weird things
P1:46:46 <Eagle> Well most game systems didn't do that either.

P2:34:55 <Jeffman12> New, or old?
P2:35:10 <Jeffman12> Why do they call it python?
P2:35:15 <Jeffman12> I assume it's just a name
P2:35:24 <KatamariManatee> Because of Monty Python
P2:35:25 <gear|work> BECAUSE IT IS AN EFFICIENT KILLING MACHINE
P2:36:21 <gear|work> An important goal of the Python developers is making Python fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name (based on the television series Monty Python's Flying Circus)
P2:36:57 <geektoo> i was having fun with python earlier

P6:15:09 <Veronika> Well if you're bored, you could always decompile and reverse engineer the original server code, then write wrappers to extend and modify the behavior of the original software.
P6:15:13 <ONI> WoM is custom
P6:16:00 <Darkebrz> aera has the best custom server IMO
P6:16:04 <Darkebrz> A network of different worlds
P6:16:10 <Darkebrz> With portals and water physics
P6:17:39 <geekahedron> idk
P6:17:47 <geekahedron> the functionality of the wom server is pretty impressive
P6:18:13 <Darkebrz> Why?
P6:18:20 <PuyoDead> I'd easily put the water physics and multiple maps far above the little bit wom has
P6:18:26 <Darkebrz> As far as I can see, The Archives has everything WoM has and much much more
P6:18:28 <geekahedron> tile histories and per-user undo functionality, in-game block copying and tile filling
P6:18:36 <geekahedron> does andrew's do that
P6:18:40 <Darkebrz> Yep
P6:18:47 <Darkebrz> Dunno about tile histories
P6:18:57 <Darkebrz> Well
P6:19:03 <Darkebrz> Now that I look at it
P6:19:09 <Darkebrz> It doesnt have the undo thing :/
P6:19:09 <PuyoDead> JTE's does most of that, actually
P6:19:22 <Darkebrz> But still, the thing about WoM is simply how LARGE it is
P6:19:26 <Darkebrz> Er
P6:19:28 <geekahedron> that's the nicest thing about wom I think
P6:19:29 <Darkebrz> The Archives
P6:19:41 <Darkebrz> It has like, 50 different maps linked with portals
P6:19:46 <geekahedron> you don't need separate worlds and super-tight restrictions
P6:19:53 <Darkebrz> Er
P6:19:59 <TheOne> ok, that takes care of the random... now to make it op only...
P6:20:01 <Darkebrz> WoM has super tight restrictions
P6:20:03 <geekahedron> you can have a quasi-public "flatgrass" server without worry of griefing
P6:20:20 <geekahedron> signing up on the website it not supertight
P6:20:22 <Darkebrz> You can't even build unless you file some sort of application
P6:20:26 <geekahedron> and it's really superfluous

P9:19:57 <vede>  D:
P9:20:02 <vede> But why?
P9:20:14 <Darkebrz> Before I can focus on the ignorance that abounds in Vede's ramblings, I must qualify Vede's character, his sources, and even his personal frame of mind towards me. Let us note first of all that Vede teaches workshops on voyeurism. Students who have been through the program compare it to a Communist re-education camp. If you've read any of the detestable slop that he has concocted, you'll sincerely recall his description of his
P9:20:14 <Darkebrz>  plan to inspire a recrudescence of slovenly fatuity. If you haven't read any of it, well, all you really need to know is that Vede's half-measures are based on a technique I'm sure you've heard of. It's called "lying". It is clear from what I have already written that when you tell Vede's foot soldiers that Vede is crazier than a road lizard, they begin to get fidgety and their eyes begin to wander. They really don't care. Th
P9:20:15 <Darkebrz> ey have no interest in hearing that if this letter did nothing else but serve as a beacon of truth, it would be worthy of reading by all right-thinking people. However, this letter's role is much greater than just to navigate a safe path between the Scylla of Vede's satanic schemes and the Charybdis of fascism.

P11:53:00 <Super-Dot> I think Unicode has happy and sad faces

P11:53:15 <Jat> i know it has a snowman
P11:53:18 <Jat> but that doesnt really count

P11:53:36 <Eagle> Are you saying that snowmen have no emotions?
P11:53:49 <Eagle> Racist much? >:O
P11:53:50 <mail2345|semi-afk> There. Added a little help thing on the whois.
P11:54:05 <Eagle> Also it's name should be Bot.
P11:54:12 <Eagle> Or JusticeBot. For justice.
P11:54:15 <mail2345|semi-afk> oh, right forgot that

P11:54:41 <Jat> well one of the problems with the snowman ascii character is that its so detailed that its almost impossible to tell thats its even a snowman at normal font sizes
P11:54:49 <Jat> i mean unicode not ascii
P11:54:59 <Eagle> Now you're saying that all snowmen look alike?
P11:55:06 <Darkebrz> Link to snowman?

P11:55:41 <Eagle> !8ball?
P11:55:41 <mail2345|semi-afk> only on /msg and /notice to avoid spam
P11:55:45 <Eagle> Ah.
P11:56:06 <Jat> http://unicodesnowmanforyou.com/
P11:56:20 <mail2345|semi-afk> ?
P11:56:22 <Eagle> All snowmen wear hats?
P11:56:23 <mail2345|semi-afk> ...
P11:56:29 <mail2345|semi-afk> irc is breaking ?
P11:56:29 <Eagle> This is all so much racism Jat.
P11:56:36 <Eagle> You should be ashamed.
P11:56:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> hehe lol
P11:56:51 <Jat> D:<
P11:57:04 <Eagle> It's like saying that all Asians wear glasses
P11:57:08 <mail2345|semi-afk> hye wait, if you copy the ?, it turns into a snowman
P11:57:11 <Jat> and are good at math
P11:57:20 <Eagle> Jat! >:O
P11:57:22 <Jat> its supposed to be a snowman without copying anything
P11:57:49 <mail2345|semi-afk> well, mIRC renders it wrong
P11:57:55 <Jat> i think its part of a weather set because i think there are also an umbrela and a cloud and a sun and mabe some rain
P11:57:57 <Jat> or something
P11:58:13 <Jat> and maybe a snowflake
P11:58:35 <Jat> probably intended for use in cell phones for things like saying what the weather is
P11:58:41 <Jat> using text
P11:59:11 <Eagle> A snowman's only job is to show weather? Jesus Jat.

P11:59:24 <Eagle> It's a snowman and you assume that it's there to explain weather.
