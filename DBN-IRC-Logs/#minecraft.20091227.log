A12:00:11 <frogger> I'll use periods on this chat.
A12:00:20 <Shadaez> I don't see how my opinions on subjects makes me dumb :(
A12:00:43 <Shadaez> The archivebot is really active today, jeeze.
A12:00:48 <Adura> Like I said, stupid is subjective.
A12:00:49 <Shadaez> Joined 3 times in the last hour.
A12:01:25 <vede> If you're communicating *at all*, a consistent set of rules is necessary to avoid any possible confusion.
A12:01:50 <frogger> Not really.
A12:01:55 <vede> And Shadaez, it's not because of your opinion, it's because you used the "Oh well it's just a x how can it be offensive" argument.
A12:02:01 <Adura> English is much too fluid, unfortunately.
A12:02:19 <vede> is it frogger yes
A12:02:27 <Adura> Let's make an IRC client that crashes on bad English.
A12:02:39 <Shadaez> I meant I don't see why people DO get offended by it, I can understand HOW they do.
A12:02:41 <mail2345> it wouldn't work
A12:02:55 <frogger> Okay maybe a lil'
A12:02:58 <frogger> .
A12:03:10 <TenNeon> I find it hilarious that half the swastikas people make are backwards.
A12:03:28 <Adura> Because you looked at it from the other side...
A12:03:31 <vede> Shadaez, you fail to understand that designs and words are connected with ideas.
A12:03:36 <vede> Those ideas can be offensive.
A12:03:41 <mail2345> holy shit i feel awl euf l
A12:03:49 <mail2345> there is coke up my nasal cavity
A12:04:00 <Adura> Damn druggie.
A12:04:06 <vede> ie. swastika -> nazi -> holocaust -> piles of bodies, baseless hatred, death camps, etc.
A12:04:22 <Adura> Maybe Shadaez doesn't like Jews.
A12:04:24 <TenNeon> A lot of them are built onto things, and you can only look at them correctly from.. underground, or behind a wall.
A12:04:36 <vede> Adura, so?
A12:04:50 <Adura> He'd not find it offensive.
A12:04:56 <Shadaez> I never said that, and I just explained that I can see that it can be offensive.
A12:04:59 <vede> It's not about HIM.
A12:05:01 <TenNeon> I did once build a room on top of a room with a swastika on the ceiling, so that the swastika could be viewed correctly.
A12:05:14 <vede> People IN GENERAL will find swastikas offensive.
A12:05:20 <Adura> vede, you sure do go off on a lot of subjects.
A12:05:51 <frogger> Adura, Thats why I said shadaez was'nt yelling at me.
A12:06:05 <frogger> Vede is good at arguing about things.
A12:06:21 <Adura> I once inverted a map, but the sand falling made it crash.
A12:06:31 <frogger> well better than me.
A12:06:57 <vede> I just do it because it's fun for me.
A12:08:30 <frogger> Well it's better when people listen to you
A12:09:07 <frogger> If I made the same exact arguement as a mod the mods would get more attention
A12:09:18 <frogger> It's frustrating
A12:09:18 <Shadaez> not really
A12:09:24 <frogger> Yes
A12:09:45 <frogger> If notch made A thread about the habitats of frogs
A12:10:13 <Shadaez> I agree on the notch part, not really the OP's though.
A12:10:21 <frogger> and I made a thread about the habitats of frogs. Notchs would get more responce.
A12:10:32 <DethDonald> I have a pet frog
A12:10:40 <frogger> What kind?
A12:10:46 <DethDonald> white tree frog
A12:10:50 <Shadaez> Everyone treats notch like a god and I think that makes him avoid IRC more.
A12:11:04 <frogger> He is a god.
A12:11:08 <vede> Shadaez, he avoids IRC because there's a lot of stupid people here.
A12:11:09 <DethDonald> hes about 5 years old
A12:11:10 <frogger> Silly shadaez
A12:11:32 <frogger> (/sarcasm)
A12:11:59 <Shadaez> and he gets spammed so much
A12:12:11 <frogger> But on to the OPs getting more attention, they do.
A12:12:19 <vede> When he comes here and sees a bunch of people putting memes and crap everywhere, or going all CAPS-RAGE! on everything, it frustrates him.
A12:12:31 <vede> Because actual discussion ends up being hidden in the noise.
A12:12:46 <Shadaez> I suppose, frogger
A12:13:03 <frogger> Inless the modship is hidden.
A12:13:05 <vede> frogger, I don't think that's necessarily due to their power.
A12:13:17 <vede> It's most likely just a social status thing.
A12:13:57 <vede> I think you just think it's because of their power, because there will generally be a correlation between status within the community, and whether or not a person has more power within the community.
A12:13:58 <frogger> Alot of people would assume a high social status on an OP.
A12:14:27 <frogger> Alot of the times it does though.
A12:14:37 <Shadaez> vede, you should be a lot harder on meme/general discussion. Then people might actually use #mcchatter
A12:14:51 <Shadaez> And then we get to see Notch more!
A12:14:54 <mail2345> heh it's just ops there
A12:14:57 <vede> For example, mail2345 would probably get a lot of attention, but he's on equal grounds with everyone else.
A12:15:06 <vede> #mcchatter sucks.
A12:15:12 <mail2345> meh
A12:15:33 <frogger> Well...
A12:15:41 <vede> When it was created, it was like this place was all strict serious discussion crap, and #mcchatter was "HEY LET'S SPAM STUPID SHIT EVERYWHERE!"
A12:15:58 <Shadaez> Now that's what this is used for? :#
A12:16:01 <frogger> People respect people alot for their "Stats"
A12:16:17 <mail2345> the most common line in #mcchatter is bildramer /nicked as tumbleweed going /me rolls
A12:16:19 <frogger> Like sign up date,post count, and others.
A12:16:23 <mail2345> and speaking of bil
A12:16:27 <mail2345> where the fuck is he
A12:16:36 <frogger> Not the marterial written
A12:16:46 <frogger> ... in forums at least.
A12:17:11 <vede> frogger, probably often because the longer a person has been around, or the more posts they have, the more respect they've gained over time in the community.
A12:17:22 <vede> Once again, just correlation.
A12:18:01 <frogger> Ugh its hard to argue.
A12:18:08 <frogger> I guess its just SOMETIMES
A12:18:23 <frogger> the correlation is corrupt
A12:18:27 <frogger> in ways.
A12:18:41 <frogger> (I accidentally press enter by accident twice)
A12:18:43 <vede> Eh, not really.
10A12:18:47 * Liam (Liam@dsl-66-209-252-76.sptc.net) has joined #minecraft

A12:19:17 <Shadaez> IDK about you frogger, but most people with HUGE post counts are huge spammers.
12A12:19:36 * Roadcrosser (1305339@120.141.250.200) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:19:38 <Shadaez> People who joined in 2008 with like 10,000 posts. It's redic.
A12:19:46 <frogger> You've heard of the term "Sterotype" yes?
10A12:19:51 * WatchPie (piespy@120.141.250.200) has joined #minecraft
A12:20:00 <Shadaez> I've been part of a forum since 2005 and have 700 posts :V
A12:20:15 <vede> I mean, people who are more widely known in the community are given more attention and respect, while the newer people will have less, even if their ideas are just as good as the more famous members, which could be described as somewhat corrupt, I guess.
10A12:20:15 * Roadcrosser (1305339@120.141.250.200) has joined #minecraft
A12:20:17 <frogger> People sterotype people by there stats
A12:20:22 <frogger> From first view.
A12:20:37 <Roadcrosser> .
A12:20:46 <Drakkar> am I widely known
A12:20:49 <frogger> or somthing like that.
A12:20:58 <vede> Drakkar, I don't think so.
A12:21:06 <vede> You're not really active that much.
A12:21:13 <Drakkar> excellent
A12:21:33 <Roadcrosser> hey
A12:21:34 <frogger> Well drakkar could say somthing completely offensive
A12:21:37 <Roadcrosser> wheres pixelscrooge
A12:21:42 <frogger> and people would take it as sarcasm
A12:21:48 <Drakkar> <- Pixelscrooge
A12:21:52 <vede> Roadcrosser, Drakker == PixelScro--
A12:21:53 <Roadcrosser> :P
A12:21:56 <vede> -_-
A12:22:06 <Drakkar> most of the time when i say something offensive I am being sarcastic
A12:22:07 <frogger> But if a "newbie" says it, it would'nt be sarcastic.
A12:22:24 <Roadcrosser> i am offended
A12:22:25 <mail2345> most of the time when i say something with caps
A12:22:27 <mail2345> and uhh
A12:22:29 <mail2345> crap
A12:22:30 <mail2345> oh right
A12:22:35 <mail2345> the word heritic
A12:22:36 <vede> frogger, that's because in order to detect sarcasm, you have to have a background to compare statements against.
A12:23:01 <vede> So if a KNOWN anti-hacks person says, "HEY GUYS I LOVE HACKS AND EVERYONE SHOULD USE THEM" it would be considered sarcastic.
A12:23:53 <mail2345> HACKS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME
A12:24:08 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:24:10 <vede> But if a person no one knows about says, "I LOVE HACKS AND EVERYONE SHOULD USE THEM", it could go either way.
A12:24:26 <frogger> mail2345 is'nt a known anti-hacks person.
A12:24:30 <Roadcrosser> I LOVE PENGUINS EVERYONE SHOULD LOVE THEM
A12:24:39 <vede> I still have no idea as to mail2345's stance on hacks.
A12:24:40 <mail2345> @frogger HAHAHAHAH
A12:24:44 <mail2345> @vede hahahah
A12:24:44 <frogger> People assume sarcasm becuase of a good reputation
A12:24:47 <frogger> .
A12:24:53 <mail2345> both of you arn't on the right hours
A12:25:00 <Roadcrosser> I HATE CHICKENS EVERYONE SHOULD KILL THEM
13A12:25:04 * mail2345 remembers the debates back when allnaturalx was on
A12:25:09 <Shadaez> I don't mind hacks but I HATE the *SUPER FAST* speed mode. It is so hard to catch griefers who use that.
A12:25:12 <vede> I wasn't here for those.
A12:26:08 <frogger> Mail2345 explains this arguement:
A12:26:33 <Drakkar> hacks are pretty awesome tbh
A12:26:47 <frogger> Are you being sarcastic?
A12:26:55 <Drakkar> am I?
A12:27:21 <frogger> I can't tell
A12:27:31 <Drakkar> just as planned
13A12:27:33 * Drakkar fingertents.
A12:27:42 <Shadaez> fingertents?
A12:27:48 <Drakkar> yes
A12:27:52 <Drakkar> ever seen the simpsons?
A12:27:58 <Drakkar> that thing mr. burns does is fingertenting
A12:28:03 <Shadaez> oh...
A12:28:12 <Shadaez> Didn't know there was a proper term for it. :|
A12:28:47 <Drakkar> its ok
A12:28:52 <Drakkar> i don't think alot of people do
10A12:29:05 * TVC (TVC@115.64.85.159) has joined #minecraft
A12:30:32 <mail2345> also guys
A12:30:46 <mail2345> CAPS USUALLY MEANS NON SARCASTIC
A12:30:46 <frogger> Describe what he does.
A12:31:05 <Drakkar> he makes a tent
A12:31:07 <Drakkar> with his fingers
A12:31:30 <vede> http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/files/2009/08/mrburns.jpg
A12:31:30 <frogger> It can
A12:31:47 <Shadaez> gif would be better
A12:32:04 <Shadaez> He moves them, too, I think.
A12:32:25 <frogger> OHH, that.

A12:33:44 <HAL9000|SleepMode> I'd fingertent all the time if I had fingers.
A12:34:20 <frogger> HAL I
A12:34:31 <frogger> will quote the book again.
13A12:34:34 * HAL9000|SleepMode rips of Shadaez's hands and fingertents his new hands.
A12:34:43 <vede> I'd finger tents all the time if I could find a consenting tent.
A12:34:47 <vede> O_O
A12:35:42 <Spadge> vede... these guys were being socially acceptable... you however were not
A12:35:47 <HAL9000|SleepMode> I guess those elbow typing threads will come in handy.
A12:36:13 <frogger> Jezz, can't say much about finger tenting hard subject.
A12:36:53 <frogger> http://miburl.com/WMuhf4z (new topic?)
A12:37:50 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Videogamers.....hot animated girl on paper.
A12:37:55 <HAL9000|SleepMode> inb4 My Waifu
A12:38:11 <frogger> It's made by dock.
A12:38:13 <HAL9000|SleepMode> That seems the most logical response
A12:38:28 <frogger> I think MC should go in that direction.
12A12:38:34 * Conundrumer (chatzilla@cpe-72-229-63-237.nyc.res.rr.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
A12:38:34 <HAL9000|SleepMode> As do I.
A12:38:47 <HAL9000|SleepMode> It would distract your minds while I enslave your population.
A12:40:05 <frogger> I'm being serious.
A12:40:16 <frogger> It would be nice if MC look anime like.
A12:40:26 <Shadaez> frogger go away
A12:40:53 <Shadaez> I'd like to see how cel shading would look, tbh
A12:41:04 <Shadaez> twould be crazy.
A12:41:25 <frogger> Yes, that would be pretty cool.
A12:41:36 <frogger> Let
13A12:41:46 * HAL9000|SleepMode implants a microchip into Shadaez's brain forcing him to agree with whatever frogger says.
A12:41:53 <Visiiri> Dammit.
A12:42:00 <Visiiri> 19-20 of the tanks of gas
A12:42:08 <Visiiri> and a tank rams me off the third story balcony.
A12:42:08 <HAL9000|SleepMode> For what?
A12:42:13 <Visiiri> L4D2
A12:42:18 <frogger> Have you played Okami or Darkcloud 2 Shadaez?
A12:42:18 <Visiiri> you have to start a car in the mall
A12:42:24 <Shadaez> YES
A12:42:32 <Shadaez> Not really.
A12:42:35 <Visiiri> Hm. It's getting late.
A12:42:37 <frogger> Great cell shaded games.
A12:43:08 <frogger> Has anyone played either of those two?
A12:43:39 <frogger> No? 
A12:43:48 <HAL9000|SleepMode> I've played Okami.
A12:43:49 <TenNeon> I have watched more Okami than I have played.
A12:44:05 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Okami, Ico, Shadow of The Colossus
A12:44:12 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Need more epic games
A12:44:20 <TenNeon> Wind Waker
A12:44:25 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Games as Art.
A12:44:30 <HAL9000|SleepMode> I have Wind Waker
A12:44:51 <TenNeon> Nonstandard visual style != games as art
13A12:45:03 * HAL9000|SleepMode prods the channel. "Games as art" discussion, go!
A12:45:28 <frogger> Games are art..
A12:45:39 <PuyoDead> [frogger] Have you played Okami or Darkcloud 2 Shadaez?
A12:45:48 <PuyoDead> Two of my absolute favorite games.
A12:45:53 <TenNeon> Games can be art. Not all games are art.
A12:46:06 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Tales of Phantasia for the SNES
A12:46:30 <frogger> Puyo did you play the first darkcloud?
A12:46:37 <PuyoDead> Yup.
A12:46:46 <PuyoDead> (I even made a FAQ for it at GameFAQs)
A12:46:53 <HAL9000|SleepMode> Jade Cocoon
A12:47:20 <Shadaez> I'll try out okami on Wii sometime
A12:47:42 <PuyoDead> It's a damn fine game. (I was just playing it about 5 minutes ago, coincidentally)
A12:47:57 <frogger> I did'nt like that they took drans feather out of darkcloud2
A12:47:58 <Shadaez> wii or PS2 version?
A12:48:11 <mail2345> blagoblag
A12:48:20 <frogger> Or duels...
A12:48:26 <PuyoDead> Wii.
A12:48:41 <PuyoDead> Yea, but overall, DK2 was such a vast improvement, I overlooked that.
A12:49:29 <frogger> DC2 was better, There are alot of refrences to darkcloud 1.
A12:49:43 <frogger> But those damn missable photos..
A12:49:48 <frogger> Oh those made me angry

A12:50:35 <PuyoDead> Oh, yea... I totally missed cinder.
A12:50:39 <PuyoDead> Damnit.
A12:50:55 <frogger> Clueless..
A12:51:03 <frogger> Hav'nt played game in ages.
A12:51:29 <PuyoDead> I still need to finish chapter 8, actually.
A12:51:53 <frogger> I hav'nt finished the demon shaft =/
A12:52:15 <PuyoDead> Oh, err... in that case, you didn't hear that.
A12:52:15 <frogger> I'm on like floor 54.
A12:52:32 <frogger> DC1
A12:52:48 <frogger> The end of the game..?
A12:52:52 <PuyoDead> Yea, just wasn't sure if you got to that point or not.
A12:53:21 <frogger> I beat both of the games.
A12:53:28 <frogger> Well
A12:53:34 <frogger> For the most part
A12:53:52 <PuyoDead> It's one of the very few games that does one of my favorite things games can do... let you keep playing in the world after you've "saved" it.
A12:54:20 <frogger> After the ending you mean
A12:54:51 <frogger> I gtg...
A12:55:00 <frogger> It's really late here
A12:55:00 <PuyoDead> Yea, but even after the story. As in, you get to see everyone's reaction and how ther world ended up and such.
13A12:55:19 * PuyoDead will be up entirely too late. Again.

A1:33:17 <questions> i can get the windows vista 64 bit but not the 32 bit and i need 32 because thats what most things run on
A1:33:32 <questions> and i tried i cant says you need java to use this page

A1:34:02 <Visiiri> Then try to install Java.
A1:34:15 <questions> i did many times i will again though one second
A1:34:23 <Visiiri> If that doesn't work, go to their website (www.java.com) and try to find an older version to download.
A1:34:59 <Visiiri> Or you can look for an installation package that is a .rar or .zip, instead of an .exe and manually install it.
A1:35:02 <questions> would an older version be able to work on 32 bit things?
A1:35:26 <mail2345> yes
A1:35:37 <questions> i went and am uninstalling 64 bit but there is not trace of the 32 bit anywhere 
A1:35:47 <mail2345> also try registry cleaning
A1:35:47 <Shadaez> what?
A1:36:02 <mail2345> maybe there are some bad installation entries floating around
A1:36:08 <Shadaez> sue punctiuation plx, i can hardly read what you're saying
A1:36:18 <Shadaez> Make sur eyou didn't downlaod the 64bit version.

A1:38:38 <questions> how do you do registry cleaning? sorry i think i kknow what that is but by a different name is that where it just deletes all the temperary files and such

A1:39:08 <Visiiri> Questions: You have Vista Home Premium, no? Possibly from HP or Dell?
A1:39:48 <Shadaez> questions what is the problem?

A1:40:00 <questions> i have a toshiba satellite vista home premium
A1:40:05 <questions> no it will not
A1:40:21 <Shadaez> And what happens?
A1:41:27 <Visiiri> Shadaez: He is reinstalling Java.
A1:41:42 <questions> when i try to run it it says to use this page you must have java and i try to download it but it gives me that stupid replace this program when there is nothing to replace
A1:41:57 <Visiiri> After the uninstall, when he tries to install it, it says that it's already on his computer. Then he says overwrite, and it says "This only works for installed products".
A1:42:02 <Visiiri> I figure it's a small bug

A1:52:38 <questions> tried the download*
A1:52:52 <Shadaez> It's probably IE blocking it or something; IDK.
A1:53:07 <Shadaez> Try Firefox, Chrome, or Opera.
A1:53:17 <Shadaez> or safari, etc.
A1:53:34 <questions> download firefox then try it? could that work worth a shot 
A1:53:54 <Shadaez> Firefox is another browser, like Internet Explorer.
A1:54:04 <Shadaez> So try doing it with Firefox.

A7:07:00 <bildramer> wait
A7:07:05 <bildramer> do you mean endianness?
A7:07:09 <byte[]> yes
A7:07:11 <Marach-Lost> do you send the data in order you send them?
A7:07:22 <bildramer> :l
A7:07:31 <bildramer> let's say the integer 256
A7:07:40 <bildramer> it can be 0x00 00 01 00
A7:07:45 <bildramer> or 0x 00 01 00 00
A7:08:02 <byte[]> right
A7:08:33 <bildramer> erm, also a question
A7:08:40 <bildramer> where's the Infiniminer source?
A7:08:47 <bildramer> hehe
A7:09:03 <bildramer> I always wondered where rule 34 could apply..
A7:09:47 <byte[]> Tumm: i made a method called CopyUShortTo(ushort value,byte[] array,int index) (it's C#)
A7:09:55 <byte[]> array[index] = (byte)(value/256);
A7:09:55 <byte[]> array[index+1] = (byte)(value%256);
A7:09:57 <bildramer> brb, getting chocolate and a C# compiler
A7:10:18 <bildramer> also, wait
A7:10:20 <byte[]> bildramer: SharpDevelop is what you want (!)
A7:10:28 <bildramer> make it index[array] for the lulz
A7:10:37 <bildramer> :P
A7:10:42 <bildramer> ok, googling

P2:43:04 <Marach> hey
P2:43:27 <Marach> i FINALLY got to Ocean Temple in Zelda: Spirit Tracks...
P2:43:37 <leBMD> I jsut got that game the other day!
P2:43:45 <leBMD> I'm about to enter the snow temple
P2:43:49 <Icenisse> Marach is it okay if I make a level with your awesome buttons?
P2:43:55 <Icenisse> I will credit you, of course
P2:43:57 <Marach> sure
P2:44:00 <Marach> :D
P2:44:03 <Icenisse> :D
P2:44:16 <Marach> i have some projects to finish when i buy a pc
P2:44:25 <Icenisse> k
P2:44:41 <Icenisse> Mine is gonna be jail escape
P2:44:46 <bildramer> ...
P2:44:54 <PuyoDead> Marach, I've alreadt put 60+ hours into Might and Magic. Turned out way better than I thought.
P2:44:59 <bildramer> killed lotsa Soviets
P2:45:06 <bildramer> so...
P2:45:07 <bildramer> bye
P2:45:11 <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, Dark messiah?
P2:45:16 <Marach> Icenisse: good idea

P2:45:39 <PuyoDead> Clash of Heroes (totally different DS game)
P2:45:39 <VurtualRuler98> I have found two suspension springs, and have mounted an NXT motor on the tractor.
P2:45:43 <AndrewPH> oh
P2:45:55 <VurtualRuler98> I can then finish the trailer, put the NXT main in it, and attach a steering uint.
P2:45:57 <Marach> my second official MBS level will be a ruins exploration
P2:46:07 <Icenisse> cool
P2:46:10 <PuyoDead> It's like half strategy, half puzzle. With a bit of RPG tossed in.
13P2:46:12 * leBMD wishes there was some hack to teh DS that allowed the "wireless LAN" games to be played over the itnernet
P2:46:12 <Marach> mostly free-roaming, but with some temples
P2:46:13 <AndrewPH> In other news I'm never using mibbit again :|
P2:46:13 <VurtualRuler98> Then I'll have a car!
P2:46:20 <leBMD> that's good!
P2:46:42 <Icenisse> I was thinking that you can kill some guards with gravel >:D
P2:46:46 <leBMD> AndrePH I feel your pain
P2:47:03 <PuyoDead> Hurts, doesn't it?
P2:47:12 <Marach> how youre going to make guards?
P2:47:14 <leBMD> mibbit < 0IRC, and 0IRC < xterminal-based stuff
P2:47:29 <Icenisse> just a black cloth block with sand as head
P2:47:29 <Marach> xchat>rest
P2:47:38 <Marach> nice :D
P2:47:39 <leBMD> icechat == xchat
P2:47:46 <Marach> ???
P2:47:47 <Icenisse> :)
P2:47:48 <leBMD> chatzilla >= mIRC
P2:47:56 <PuyoDead> chatzilla is poop.
P2:48:07 <leBMD> it works for what I use it for
P2:48:13 <PuyoDead> I'm not a huge fan of plain mIRC, but with NNS I really like it.
P2:48:19 <leBMD> I could use icechat, but I don't feel like it right now
P2:48:34 <Icenisse> Icechat = mine
P2:48:37 <Marach> xchat portable is nice
P2:48:50 <leBMD> is there a version of xchat for windows?
P2:48:54 <Marach> yes
P2:48:56 <leBMD> ...wow that sounded dumb
P2:48:59 <leBMD> oh ok
P2:49:00 <Icenisse> brb
P2:49:08 <Marach> silverex.org/download
P2:49:12 <leBMD> since xchat = chat for X window environment =/= windows

P2:49:19 <PuyoDead> Make sure it's XChat 2
P2:49:19 <AndrewPH> I have no fucking clue what I'm supposed to do
P2:49:22 <leBMD> k
P2:49:28 <AndrewPH> God of War 2 is confusing during this part
P2:49:32 <AndrewPH> I mean
P2:49:34 <leBMD> kill stuff
P2:49:35 <AndrewPH> chains of olympus
P2:49:36 <AndrewPH> not 2
P2:49:41 <leBMD> that's what the game is all about
P2:49:43 <Marach> official xchat windows build isnt free
P2:49:47 <AndrewPH> there's puzzles
P2:49:48 <AndrewPH> derp
P2:49:51 <Marach> but the one i linked is
P2:49:57 <PuyoDead> CoO is kinda fun.
P2:50:03 <Marach> (legal :P)
P2:50:05 <leBMD> ok!
P2:51:00 <leBMD> I'll just stick to chatzilla/icechat/the occasional 0IRC for now

P3:00:07 <leBMD> that sucks, visiiri
P3:00:10 <Marach> took me some time to realise they dont go well together
P3:00:11 <Visiiri> Can I change it?
P3:00:20 <leBMD> you could contact steam
P3:00:22 <Marach> Visiiri: wait some years
P3:00:26 <leBMD> or jsut make a new account

P3:00:34 <Visiiri> I just bought L4D2

P3:00:38 <Visiiri> and I can't do shit with steam now?
P3:00:39 <AndrewPH> clear your ie cache

P3:03:44 <leBMD> it shall be epic
P3:03:56 <Marach> lmao
P3:04:08 <Marach> nice, where was the image embedded?

P3:04:45 <leBMD> "welcome to the Aperture Science Research.....oh wait, I'm dead, lol"
P3:05:08 <leBMD> if they make a portal 2, it will have to be a prequel.

P3:05:44 <Aeomin> because the cake is still there?
P3:05:51 <AndrewPH> She raped a donkey
P3:05:56 <AndrewPH> that's why she's not dead
P3:06:02 <Visiiri> Before I go off to play combat arms, I would like to announce the release of my custom client.
P3:06:09 <LG_Legacy> Wat
P3:06:13 <Evilgrim> There never was a cake. So it wasn't real. So it isn't a lie. The promise of cake is a lie yes. But the cake isn't.
P3:06:15 <Visiiri> :P
P3:06:26 <Visiiri> It's just a small client wrapper that has flight and super speed in it.
P3:06:32 <LG_Legacy> :l
P3:06:35 <Visiiri> It has the same interface, to the best I could, as WoM.
P3:06:36 <LG_Legacy> I hate you
P3:06:40 <Visiiri> No noclip or anything.
P3:06:43 <Visiiri> Just speed and flight.

P3:06:46 <leBMD> wait, when did she rape a donkey? O_o

P3:07:46 <LG_Legacy> I still hate Visiiri
P3:07:48 <frogger> Vorpal?
P3:07:54 <Visiiri> infinitely sharp/deadly
P3:08:18 <PuyoDead> You also have the bonus of being late to the game.
P3:08:23 <frogger> Nerd termology that I did'nt know?
P3:08:26 <leBMD> I lost the game!
P3:08:29 <Visiiri> D: I'm late?
P3:08:30 <frogger> Huh..
P3:08:41 <Visiiri> frogger: not really nerd, ancient.
P3:08:43 <PuyoDead> When Notch includes that stuff in the client, yes.
P3:08:51 <AndrewPH> boobies!
P3:08:53 <AndrewPH> derp
P3:08:55 <Visiiri> Notch isn't going to include flight?
P3:08:59 <Visiiri> Didn't he say that?
P3:09:05 <PuyoDead> No?
P3:09:09 <LG_Legacy> Unsure
P3:09:12 <Visiiri> Oh.
P3:09:14 <Visiiri> I hope he doesn't.
P3:09:18 <Visiiri> Then I'm not speshul :<
P3:09:20 <LG_Legacy> I think it would kind of kill the 'feel' of the game though
P3:09:28 <Visiiri> :P We all hack anyways
P3:09:32 <PuyoDead> It would be server options.
P3:09:40 <LG_Legacy> I mean, thinking about it..
P3:09:45 <LG_Legacy> Did miners fly and run fast back then?
P3:09:45 <leBMD> I never hack anymore
P3:09:45 <PuyoDead> Included to make things like WoM redundant.
P3:09:50 <leBMD> I use to depend on it a ton
P3:09:50 <AndrewPH> "May you go with the speed of herpes, ghost of sparta."
P3:09:52 <AndrewPH> waaaat
P3:09:58 <Evilgrim> I don't hack.
P3:10:31 <leBMD> I used to use WoM as if it were a life saver, but since  the update, I've not felt the need
P3:10:53 <Visiiri> :P
P3:10:56 <LG_Legacy> I only use WoM for it's portableness
P3:10:57 <frogger> Visiiri "vorpal" is an old nerd termology you mean?
P3:10:59 <Visiiri> Off to play Combat Arms.
P3:11:06 <LG_Legacy> The hacks don't even work on it anyways, i love it.
P3:11:07 <Visiiri> Frogger; yeah :P
P3:11:08 <leBMD> what's vorpal?
P3:11:16 <frogger> Ohh
P3:11:17 <leBMD> wait...LG_Legacy...
10P3:11:18 * Visiiri is now known as Vis{AFK}
P3:11:22 <leBMD> minecraft.net is portable. ;)
P3:11:29 <LG_Legacy> Thats not what i meant
P3:11:36 <LG_Legacy> I want a full-size window thank you
P3:11:42 <leBMD> oh
P3:12:05 <LG_Legacy> The server list is alright as-well. It's just the fact i have a seperate window and resizeable and completelyp ortable is nice.
P3:12:13 <LG_Legacy> The hacks are broke though, thats the good part.
P3:12:21 <frogger> Do you guys think minecraft will ever have levels?
P3:12:29 <LG_Legacy> 'levels'?
P3:12:36 <LG_Legacy> Like you go to the edge and get teleported?
P3:12:38 <leBMD> some day you could import doom maps...
P3:12:39 <LG_Legacy> If so most certainly
P3:12:52 <LG_Legacy> Wasn't that confirmed that some 'portal' thing is coming in minecraft?
P3:12:53 <frogger> Nevermind
P3:13:18 <frogger> Like repetitive leveling?
P3:13:42 <leBMD> like leveling up?
P3:13:52 <LG_Legacy> Oh
P3:13:53 <LG_Legacy> Levels
P3:13:53 <frogger> Yea
P3:13:55 <LG_Legacy> Maybe
P3:13:55 <leBMD> if so, then no
P3:14:14 <leBMD> "you levelled up!  now you can make stuff with sponges! :D"
P3:14:18 <LG_Legacy> :l
P3:14:36 <LG_Legacy> You leveled up! Now you can breathe air! holy shit what a miracle, i thought you were going to die for a second!
P3:15:42 <frogger> So you think minecraft is going to always be player-server based?
P3:15:50 <frogger> Not like a huge notch server?
P3:15:57 <frogger> Multiworld thing
P3:16:03 <gear> im pretty sure it will be player-server for a while
P3:16:05 <frogger> That would be neat.
P3:16:39 <leBMD> http://bash.org/?111338
P3:16:51 <gear> anyone else play tf2?
P3:16:55 <gear> steam IDs plz
P3:17:17 <leBMD> if the ability to host your own server was destroyed, I would be sad
P3:17:19 <frogger> The reason I was thinking about levels is becuase I know notch as been doing work on an more advance inventory
P3:17:19 <Evilgrim> I play TF2.
P3:17:26 <leBMD> my steam id is Batmanifestdestiny
P3:17:36 <frogger> (I pretty sure)
P3:17:41 <leBMD> we should have a giant Gmod party
P3:17:41 <frogger> I'm*
P3:17:53 <LG_Legacy> :l
P3:18:00 <gear> yea he wants to finish the inventory for survival before the new year
P3:18:32 <leBMD> like so you can shoot arrows?
P3:19:35 <frogger> Okay.. As I was saying
P3:19:59 <LG_Legacy> ARROWS
P3:20:01 <LG_Legacy> AND CREEPERS
P3:20:02 <LG_Legacy> OH MY
P3:20:06 <leBMD> :D
P3:20:07 <LG_Legacy> I think i just came.
P3:20:10 <LG_Legacy> Huh..
P3:20:12 <LG_Legacy> Well then.
P3:20:16 <leBMD> every time I hear "creeper" I think of myspace stalkers
P3:20:32 <frogger> Notch has been doing work on an inventory screen and I remebered A mock up he made awhile ago..http://miburl.com/Wdw8NwZ 
P3:20:56 <frogger> It has levels and I was thinking minecraft might have leveling
P3:21:15 <frogger> But it could equally be randomly generated for private servers.
P3:21:48 <leBMD> oh, THAT kind of levels!
P3:21:57 <leBMD> then you could kill a pig in one backhand!
P3:24:29 <leBMD> http://bash.org/?178890

P3:45:39 <Siiseli> VurtualRuler98, yeah but it spawns so much shit that spills all over the internet that I hate it 
P3:45:56 <Quatroking> and thats exactly the reason why moot won the Time 100
P3:46:11 <Quatroking> without 4chan we wouldn't have so much shit on the web
P3:46:23 <Marach> true
P3:46:24 <VurtualRuler98> Without 4chan we wouldn't be here today probably.
P3:46:28 <Siiseli> I would't mind 4chan if they kept the retardedness within 4chan
P3:46:31 <VurtualRuler98> The world might not still be here.
P3:46:31 <Siiseli> VurtualRuler98, what?
P3:46:33 <Quatroking> no rickroll, lolcats, and a lot more stuff
P3:46:36 <Siiseli> oh man
P3:46:39 <Siiseli> that'd be great Quatroking 
P3:46:48 <AndrewPH> The internet would be a better place if 4chan never existed.
P3:46:51 <Quatroking> also
P3:46:53 <Siiseli> agreed
P3:46:56 <AndrewPH> If only his mother hadn't let him buy those servers.
P3:46:57 <Quatroking> I don't like /b/
P3:47:07 <Marach> ircops too
P3:47:18 <Marach> try joining #/b/ :P
P3:47:21 <Siiseli> Marach, hurgh
P3:47:23 <VurtualRuler98> For all we know it was the leading move of a gradual internet-based society, putting most of our conflictive behavior directly against our own fears and problems, rather than at a single entity.
P3:47:25 <Siiseli> never
P3:47:35 <Marach> just try
P3:47:36 <Quatroking> well
P3:47:37 <VurtualRuler98> For all we know, 4chan ended racism and war as we know it.
P3:47:40 <Siiseli> Marach, never.
P3:47:43 <Siiseli> VurtualRuler98, :D
P3:47:54 <Quatroking> 4chan did make the habbo hotel mods admit that they're racist fucks
P3:48:01 <Siiseli> for all we know the fact that I just farted will end the iraq war
P3:48:05 <VurtualRuler98> Now nobody takes it more seriously than fried chicken and watermelon.
P3:48:25 <leBMD> wow, I get distracted by bash.org, and next thing I know this channels is really talking!
P3:48:38 <AndrewPH> Get 2 screens
P3:48:41 <VurtualRuler98> Siiseli, did your fart force everyone to fight equally using their own ideals against others, with nothing but the ability to speak to use?
P3:48:44 <AndrewPH> then you can bash while you irc
P3:48:58 <leBMD> true
P3:49:08 <Quatroking> I only go to 4chan for my fetishes, /d/, my hentai, /h/, fun, /r9k/, my porn, /s/, and the occasional tech stuff over at /g/
P3:49:18 <leBMD> if I had 3 screens, I could bash, chat, AND gmod....AT ONCE
P3:49:28 <Quatroking> no you couldn't
P3:49:28 <AotC> No
P3:49:29 <AndrewPH> leBMD, I can already do that with 2
P3:49:29 <Siiseli> VurtualRuler98, I dunno if that applies to 4chan, seeing as most of the people have no ideals really just spread idiocy
P3:49:33 <Siiseli> I mean that soudns great and all
P3:49:35 <Quatroking> gmod would hold the mouse focus
P3:49:40 <leBMD> what's in /h/?
P3:49:45 <Siiseli> hentai methingks
P3:49:48 <Siiseli> thinks*
P3:49:48 <Quatroking> yeah
P3:49:54 <AndrewPH> Quatroking, windowed mode derp
P3:49:55 <leBMD> that's why I hit escape when I want to chat or change the bash page
P3:50:08 <Quatroking> AndrewPH, hitting escape is the same as alt+tab, derp
P3:50:23 <AndrewPH> Hitting escape stops gmod from focusing the mouse derp
P3:50:39 <Quatroking> so does alt+tab derp
P3:50:40 <leBMD> true
P3:50:43 <leBMD> true
13P3:50:45 * Quatroking slaps AndrewPH
13P3:50:52 * leBMD hides in a box
P3:51:00 <AndrewPH> I'm pretty sure alt tab keeps it focused unless you use escape
P3:51:02 <AndrewPH> I'll test
P3:51:22 <Quatroking> "hmdi 1.04 gets support for 3D-broadcasts"
P3:51:24 <Quatroking> uh

P3:52:56 <AndrewPH> Hello
P3:52:58 <Quatroking> and they sold chargers
P3:53:07 <Quatroking> this morning I forgot which site it was so I opened history
P3:53:19 <AndrewPH> one day I was on my dad's computer and I saw a porn site in the history so I went uhhhh brain bleach.
P3:53:22 <Quatroking> and it seems my dad sucks at searching porn
P3:53:25 <leBMD> D:
P3:53:38 <Quatroking> seriously, social network pages for porn?
P3:53:41 <Quatroking> what?
P3:53:41 <leBMD> what if I told you I didn't look at porn?
P3:53:46 <AndrewPH> I would slap you
P3:53:46 <Drakkar> I don't
P3:53:50 <Drakkar> its not really that unique
P3:53:52 <AndrewPH> and put you in front of porn.
P3:53:56 <AndrewPH> Just to scare you.

P3:54:34 <AndrewPH> Why the sudden use of mibbit

P3:54:56 <leBMD> tits could bring up how to milk a goat

P4:31:54 <Kohuded> Hello, again.
P4:31:57 <LG_Legacy> Did you remove doublejump?
P4:32:04 <Quatroking> Visiiri are you saying you're going to release a hack client
P4:32:07 <Visiiri> No, you have infinite jumps
P4:32:11 <Visiiri> Small ones though
P4:32:13 <Visiiri> :P
P4:32:16 <LG_Legacy> No seriously.
P4:32:18 <LG_Legacy> Did you remove it?
P4:32:20 <AndrewPH> fials please.
P4:32:21 <Visiiri> No why
P4:32:24 <LG_Legacy> ASS
P4:32:28 <Visiiri> D: what's wrong
P4:32:32 <LG_Legacy> Thats the ONE feature i hated about the client
P4:32:37 <Visiiri> :P
P4:32:37 <LG_Legacy> You can't jump normally
P4:32:39 <Visiiri> I could remove it
P4:32:44 <LG_Legacy> You jump like three god damn spaces
P4:32:48 <LG_Legacy> And can't jump normally
P4:32:49 <Quatroking> seriously if you're going to release a hack client I'm going to fucking hunt you down
P4:32:59 <Visiiri> D: Why do people not like them?
P4:33:08 <AndrewPH> #minecraft doesn't like them
P4:33:08 <LG_Legacy> It's not the 'Double jump'
P4:33:11 <AndrewPH> they just don't
P4:33:14 <Quatroking> Either limit it to own servers or don't release it at all
P4:33:17 <LG_Legacy> It's the first jump that you only jump three blocks INSTEAD OF TWO GOD DAMMIT

P6:08:32 <Visiiri> Does anyone know if L4D2 is compatable with Garry's mod?
P6:08:55 <AndrewPH> different model version
P6:09:03 <AndrewPH> however you probably can get the models
P6:09:15 <AndrewPH> the l4d1 method probably would work
P6:09:21 <Visiiri> oh :<
P6:09:37 <Visiiri> What would Garry's mod do to l4d2?
P6:10:08 <AndrewPH> gmod would probably just crash
P6:10:17 <AndrewPH> they're different modeltypes I do believe.
P6:10:17 <Visiiri> :/ That's worth the $10.
P6:10:25 <Visiiri> But it works with L4D1?
P6:10:36 <AndrewPH> there's a method to extract them
P6:10:40 <AndrewPH> and then they do work
P6:10:43 <Visiiri> Not worth my time.

P8:51:54 <Eric> installing gmod mods with no documentation is not an intuitive task

P9:24:10 <Conundrumer> hey guys
P9:24:16 <Conundrumer> i want to host a server on my pc
P9:24:20 <Conundrumer> and play on it through my laptop
P9:24:24 <Conundrumer> so it wouldn't be too laggy
P9:24:38 <Conundrumer> but i can't connect on my own server through my laptop
P9:25:31 <AndrewPH> what does it do
P9:25:48 <vede> Conundrumer, add "&override=true" to the end of the URL found in externalurl.txt
P9:25:58 <Conundrumer> thanks!
P9:26:37 <Conundrumer> what exactly does it do, btw?
P9:27:01 <vede> Notch added a fix, such that if it detects a person joining a server from the server's IP, it redirects to 127.0.0.1 instead of the normal IP.
P9:27:20 <vede> Well, according to the internet (minecraft.net), two people on the same network will have the same IP.

P10:23:50 <revenant> I personally really like Colloquy
P10:23:55 <revenant> It's for mac, but the interface is spot on.
P10:24:01 <revenant> It should really be ported.
P10:24:19 <Super-Dot> Colloquy Mac could be a lot better
P10:24:32 <revenant> It could, but for a free program its pretty damn good.
P10:24:40 <revenant> Personally I like the text formatting.
P10:24:41 <mail2345> i personally prefer telnet
P10:24:43 <revenant> I hate huge fonts.
P10:24:47 <revenant> telnet is my 2nd choice.
P10:24:53 <mail2345> though the GUI for telnet is lacking
P10:25:00 <revenant> heh
P10:25:11 <revenant> Not but really.

P10:26:44 <revenant> I think he was talking about the iPhone one.
P10:26:56 <revenant> the iPhone doesnt have keyboard shortcuts.
P10:26:57 <revenant> Or a keyboard.
P10:27:00 <PuyoDead> This one is a little better, since they removed the pointless icons. (I'm hoping that's an option) http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1127/681128588_8b830758c4.jpg
P10:27:01 <revenant> Therefor I prefer my computer.
P10:27:11 <revenant> wtf theme are they using
P10:27:17 <Super-Dot> Oh, he's describing the Mac version
P10:27:18 <revenant> Thats like Colloquy 10 yeats ago
P10:27:30 <revenant> and btw
P10:27:39 <revenant> the icons can be turned off with a single right click in any application
P10:28:03 <revenant> tis part of Cocoa
P10:28:06 <revenant> I have mine off
P10:28:07 <Super-Dot> Yeah, you can make the toolbar completely disappear by pressing the top right button
P10:28:14 <revenant> That too
P10:28:18 <revenant> But I like having some of them up there.
P10:28:25 <revenant> I use Text-Only
P10:28:27 <Super-Dot> Or you can make the toolbar buttons smaller, or make them just text and no icons
P10:28:29 <PuyoDead> The nicklist is downright offensively bad, though.
P10:28:37 <revenant> nicklist?
P10:28:42 <PuyoDead> And I see the text spacing can be adjusted, that's good.
P10:28:44 <Super-Dot> How so?
P10:28:45 <revenant> The connections menu?
P10:28:48 <PuyoDead> Yes, the nicklist.
P10:28:50 <Super-Dot> Yeah, the text is themable
P10:28:52 <revenant> http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/6345/screenshot20091227at112.png
P10:28:54 <revenant> this is how mine looks
P10:29:28 <revenant> The theme is totally customizeable
P10:29:33 <revenant> I usually remove the icon in the corner
P10:29:38 <revenant> And leave it all white.
P10:29:40 <PuyoDead> That's better, but I find the way it displays the nicklist to make no sense.

P10:31:16 <revenant> Ok, well excusing that.

P10:31:23 <revenant> Two sidebars?

P10:32:54 <revenant> You can actually make the channels very small

P10:34:56 <revenant> I like that its flexible.
P10:35:00 <PuyoDead> That's one thing I like about my current setup, I can change pretty much anything text theme-wise.
P10:35:13 <revenant> What are you usuing?
P10:35:18 <PuyoDead> I do miss colored nicks, badly.
P10:35:22 <PuyoDead> mIRC+NNS
P10:35:25 <revenant> So can I in here.
P10:35:30 <Super-Dot> Colored nicks are the best thing
P10:35:40 <PuyoDead> I used XChat for ages... but there's just too many little annoyances.
P10:35:55 <Super-Dot> My only problem with XChat is the text spacing
P10:35:56 <Eric> xchat makes me want to french kiss a light socket
P10:36:14 <PuyoDead> I like Quassel, but I'll be damned if I can find logging, and it's terrible for being an op.
P10:36:25 <revenant> xchat sucks ass.
P10:36:28 <revenant> The formatting is horrible.
P10:36:31 <Super-Dot> Chatzilla is terrible about logging as well
P10:36:36 <revenant> It takes me forever to format text the may I like it.
P10:36:46 <revenant> I find Lucida Grande in my colloquy window is great.
P10:36:49 <revenant> It logs okay I guess.
P10:36:54 <revenant> They're all there and human readeable.

P10:37:41 <Super-Dot> So you just right-click on the icon at the top to view the log

P10:48:02 <Eric> it's fine until it isn't

P10:48:13 <VurtualRuler98> Idle tilts with my legs can fly
P10:48:26 <Super-Dot> Ah, that makes sense
P10:49:35 <Super-Dot> I've found that when you set it to only require slight tilts, it registers non-input movements too much
P10:49:41 <VurtualRuler98> I adjust the trim by putting a bit of weight onmy desk.
P10:50:03 <VurtualRuler98> My legs are pretty precise, man. And my accellerometer only works as a joystick, nothing else.

P11:48:51 <culapou> Ok, I downloaded all the server software and it works fine etc.
P11:49:10 <culapou> I try to generate the level, but it only works as a singleplayer room, no one else can connect

P11:49:24 <culapou> how do I make it so others can connect to it, 
P11:49:29 <AndrewPH> forward ports
P11:49:49 <culapou> could a problem be because I am using the minecraft client from world of minecraft?, and how do I forward ports?
P11:50:30 <AndrewPH> 1: Your client doesn't affect your server.
P11:50:35 <AndrewPH> 2: Google it. 
P11:50:57 <Douche_gunner> Yawn...
P11:51:26 <culapou> I have this link that is the one in externalurl.txt: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8b1eec7d2a1a5d7fb77f5ee2244fab79
P11:51:47 <storage> what is with these fucking greif bots
P11:51:49 <culapou> and my port is: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8b1eec7d2a1a5d7fb77f5ee2244fab79&port=25565
P11:52:19 <AndrewPH> culapou... we don't need that information
P11:52:22 <AndrewPH> just forward your ports
P11:52:41 <mail2345> @storage blame lailai
P11:53:22 <storage> why, what did he do?
P11:53:31 <storage> he wrote the bot?
P11:53:37 <AndrewPH> haxed us with actionscript (derpa durr)
P11:53:38 <mail2345> yea
P11:53:52 <mail2345> @andrew actually he aparently had real griefing bots
P11:53:59 <AndrewPH> It's not a surprise
P11:54:03 <mail2345> the actionscript thing was a clever ploy
P11:54:07 <mail2345> to make us think he didn't
P11:54:22 <AndrewPH> actually he stated several times he did
P11:54:34 <storage> i get hit by one once or twice a week at least now
P11:54:50 <mail2345> hey
P11:54:55 <mail2345> do you have thier ips
P11:54:59 <mail2345> i remember portscanning lailai
P11:55:03 <mail2345> he had some ports open
P11:55:05 <AndrewPH> I don't have griefbot proble- oh wait that's because they can't do anything.
P11:55:19 <Jat> cant do anything?
P11:55:23 <storage> lol, i do but i don't know which did the greifing

P11:57:50 <AndrewPH> culapou, Maybe you should look at the site. You forward ports from your router.
