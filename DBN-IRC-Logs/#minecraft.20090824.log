A1:14:41 <Gaeel> I hope there won't be some big game-breaking bug, since Notch'll be on holiday for a few weeks
A1:15:12 <Gaeel> Also, I believe I saw zombies in that last Youtube vid?
A1:15:18 <LG_Legacy> Notch usually only releases it when it's playable
A1:15:36 <Gaeel> I bet, but you never know
A1:15:54 <Gaeel> There might be some wierd compatibility bug or something
A1:16:06 <Gaeel> even the greatest make some silly mistakes
A1:19:49 <gordenfreechmen> like when my TF2 copy was f**ked up for 2 weeks
A1:20:01 <LG_Legacy> o_o
A1:20:06 <offset> I'm sure he'll do some testing before going on holiday
A1:20:14 <Gaeel> For example
A1:20:31 <Gaeel> I'm sure it'll be fine
A1:21:47 <Gaeel> gordenfreechmen: My UT3 got messed up in an update, apparently Epic forgot that some people use 8800 cards in cojunction with Intel processors

A1:31:48 <LG_Legacy> Too many buildings
A1:32:03 <LG_Legacy> We need something new..
A1:32:29 <gordenfreechmen> I like Theone's lava
A1:32:37 <gordenfreechmen> it makes into a challenge-based game
A1:35:37 <tarkata14> Is 'The One's lava' up at the moment?

A1:38:09 <gordenfreechmen> melee mode only :O
A1:38:32 <tarkata14> Hm. There haven't been any fun, populated servers up in a while.
A1:38:59 <tarkata14> Unless someone can direct me to one.
A1:39:35 <Gaeel> I think the game needs a few new things to get the ball rolling again
A1:39:44 <gordenfreechmen> yeah
A1:39:46 <gordenfreechmen> like notch said
A1:39:51 <gordenfreechmen> it becomes old once mastered
A1:42:52 <Gaeel> There was talk of integrating Lua or some other scripting language, if people got to make their own game modes I think it could work

A1:43:34 <mail2345> wait
A1:43:39 <Gaeel> recap :
A1:43:46 <gordenfreechmen> Gaeel: He suggested mod support
A1:43:47 <Gaeel> tarkata14	Hm. There haven't been any fun, populated servers up in a while.
A1:43:53 <Gaeel> Gaeel	I think the game needs a few new things to get the ball rolling again
A1:44:00 <mail2345> it's called Lua
A1:44:01 <Gaeel> gordenfreechmen	like notch said 08:40	gordenfreechmen	it becomes old once mastered
A1:44:24 <Gaeel> mail2345: then I mentioned the talk about integrating Lua
A1:44:50 <tarkata14> When will that happen?
A1:45:04 <tarkata14> The lua support, I mean.
A1:45:17 <gordenfreechmen> I havent played king of the hill yet
A1:45:19 <gordenfreechmen> wonder if its good
A1:45:24 <mail2345> idk
A1:45:25 <gordenfreechmen> because im about too
A1:46:23 <Gaeel> My main internet is down, so I haven't played KoTH either
A1:46:44 <mail2345> curretnly on AI Wars
A1:47:08 <Gaeel> tarkata14: what will happen is that server owners will be able to write scripts that control game elements in Lua
A1:47:45 <tarkata14> I know what it entails, I was just wondering when it was being implemented.
A1:47:50 <Gaeel> For example they could make an automated Spleef pitch that doesn't require filling in
A1:48:01 <Gaeel> Oh, When will that happend
A1:48:03 <Gaeel> sorry
A1:48:40 <Gaeel> I'm up early waiting for the internet fixing guy
A1:48:58 <Gaeel> And before someone asks, public WiFI

A2:04:32 <LG_Legacy> This is ofn http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LYP4yq-sX0
A2:04:47 <mail2345> there are multiple people
A2:05:09 <liq3> mail2345: good, because who ever wrote the article is an idiot.
A2:05:09 <Xeros> First of all... that's not funny lol because... I go through that kinda stuff that you'd consider OFN all the time because back when people had normal computers, I had a black n white macintosh.. and when high speed internet came out I had 56k eheh
A2:05:38 <mail2345> eh, while 9/11 is debateable, homeopathic medicine is rubbish
A2:05:59 <Xeros> Oh of course dude... that thread is in the "Testing Forum" where only the randomness of the random go, and they don't count towards everyone's post count.

A2:06:52 <Xeros> And you can't blame them for spending time putting together a thread like that... the 3dmm community is dying =/

A2:08:03 <Gaeel> Thx, that's my music BTW
A2:08:12 <Xeros> :o lol
A2:08:35 <Gaeel> http://www.gaeel-music.com/listen.php  Big Beats on this (I know it's ugly) page
A2:09:17 <Gaeel> Page also needs to be updated I just noticed ^^
A2:10:21 <Xeros> Permission to show your website to the Art Gallery section of the 3dmm forum? I know they'd be interested
A2:10:35 <Gaeel> Er, sure
A2:10:52 <Gaeel> It's ugly as hell since I only bashed it together like real quick
A2:11:46 <Gaeel> What's 3dmm about anyway?
A2:11:59 <Gaeel> (besides youtube spam, lol)
A2:12:40 <Xeros> 3dmm stands for 3D Movie Maker. It was an old 1995 microsoft kids program for making animated movies using 3d models, in fact it's made for kids ages 8+ but put it into the hands of...well not kids and...my god lol.
A2:13:24 <Gaeel> I had a demo of that!
A2:13:36 <Xeros> So yeah the site is a place for the program, it's unoffical of course. Microsoft ignores it like it never existed, you can barely even find info about it.
A2:14:06 <Xeros> Because of this though, you can download it right from there without a torrent or anything. Pretty sure it's legal since nothing has happened.
A2:14:27 <Gaeel> lol
A2:14:49 <Xeros> But yeah... my god I've seen some hilaarious and amazing movies made with that program. I wish I could show you but it would require the program, and it's kinda big.
A2:15:00 <liq3> Xeros: It's probably not legal, and most likely MS doesn't know about it.
A2:15:10 <liq3> If they did, they'd probably do everything they can to crush and market it.
A2:15:20 <Gaeel> Well if you post a link to my site, music is free to be used in non-commercial productions, and if anyone uses it in a movie, an email to a link is always nice
A2:15:21 <Xeros> Actually people from the site have tried contacting Microsoft, including myself because I love it so much.
A2:15:59 <Xeros> Absolutely Gaeel, they always put credits in their movies unless it's some newcomer who's making their first movie lol.
A2:16:27 <Gaeel> It's not so much about the credit, it's about getting to see my stuff being used
A2:17:00 <Xeros> wait you mean you want an email to the movie, or the movie linking to your site?
A2:17:27 <mail2345> btw, i'm trying out ai wars
A2:17:30 <mail2345> seems interesting
A2:17:35 <liq3> mail2345: :D.
A2:17:41 <Gaeel> Well the guy who makes the movie emails me and says "Check it out, I made this with your tune : link"
A2:17:43 <mail2345> i can see how you can stuff that many ships on the game

A2:53:56 <Marach> lol is the universal word
A2:53:59 <Xeros> I just use "lol" a lot... it's hard not to....
A2:54:12 <Magnulus> What do people use to indicate ACTUAL amusement these days?
A2:54:13 <Xeros> usually as a sign of... not seriousness
A2:54:15 <Marach> lol can mean everything

A2:56:55 <Magnulus> Thing is that nobody actually interprets it the same way.
A2:57:05 <Gaeel> This stoopid connection won't let me join a server  
A2:57:05 <Marach> you forgot the xD
A2:57:10 <Marach> and XD
A2:57:13 <Roadcrosser> :P
A2:57:21 <Xeros> :o but I used xD a lot... about as much as "lol"
A2:57:24 <Marach> xD<XD
A2:57:31 <Xeros> definitely
A2:57:31 <mail2345> i'm reminded of in wolfhunt where I killed darkebrz for spamming a longcat
A2:57:45 <mail2345> turned out luckinly that he was a wolf

A2:57:54 <Roadcrosser> i used lotsa ...
A2:58:07 <Roadcrosser> ...
A2:58:08 <Roadcrosser> ...
A2:58:14 <Marach> ...
A2:58:17 <Xeros> I use "..." for trying to portray a pause in my text speekinz
A2:58:31 <Marach> its easybto type without the stylus
A2:58:33 <SMP> Hey guys, where would I go to, to get my own dedicated server running?
A2:58:47 <Xeros> So I can.... you know.... portray my.... uh.... emotion? No....
A2:59:12 <Marach> another texture copypasted!
A2:59:21 <Gaeel> I use "..." to imply that my sentence isn't finished but the meaning can be understood
A2:59:31 <Xeros> 3 periods is usually a pretty neutral overall sign of things such as "wtf" or "okayy" etc
A2:59:45 <Xeros> whereas seeing 2 periods seems like a sign of annoyment
A2:59:47 <Gaeel> wtf isn't neutral
A3:00:07 <Xeros> if you try to imagine wtf with less exclamation
A3:00:12 <Magnulus> Really nice Companion cube, dude.
A3:00:25 <Xeros> in fact I see it as wtf<what the fuck
A3:00:31 <Xeros> when you spell it out it really makes it different
A3:00:50 <SMP> Thanks for the help...
A3:00:50 <Gaeel> I really see wtf as what the fuck
A3:00:54 <Gaeel> SMP
A3:01:01 <SMP> Yeah?
A3:01:07 <Marach> you really ran out of good ideas for a conversation lol
A3:01:09 <Gaeel> I think since the forum is down you can't DL the software
A3:01:16 <SMP> :/
A3:01:17 <mail2345> wat
A3:01:20 <mail2345> what sofware
A3:01:21 <Roadcrosser> ...
A3:01:28 <Gaeel> Server software
A3:01:29 <mail2345> oh nvm
A3:01:29 <SMP> I just need a place to host the server
A3:01:36 <Xeros> but a neutralish version of wtf... a wtf! with an exclamation mark almost loses a hint of seriousness, and is usually used in jokingly situations
A3:01:37 <Gaeel> Oh, your comp?
A3:01:37 <mail2345> well i have a server host
A3:01:41 <SMP> dedicated
A3:01:44 <mail2345> but my ram is filled
A3:01:47 <mail2345> and it is dedicated
A3:01:49 <Gaeel> Don't turn it off?
A3:01:50 <Xeros> a wtf... with periods usually shows much more seriousness, or akwardness
A3:01:51 <mail2345> to minecraft
A3:01:52 <SMP> my internet isnt that stable, and utorrent is running 24/7
A3:02:01 <mail2345> things running
A3:02:05 <mail2345> 4 minecraft servsers
A3:02:06 <Marach> i also use '...?' as similiar of 'lol wtf'
A3:02:11 <mail2345> 1 irc ot
A3:02:14 <SMP> I crash every 1.5 hours when playing MC
A3:02:14 <mail2345> 1 proxy
A3:02:17 <Xeros> lol same here
A3:02:23 <Gaeel> Well put a DL/UL cap and since you have a machine on 24/7 you're good to go
A3:02:45 <mail2345> oh wait 3*
A3:02:46 <mail2345> not for
A3:02:48 <mail2345> anway
A3:02:53 <Xeros> sometimes I even use "lol" just to show that I am trying to be nicer than it may sound in words that I'm tryping
A3:02:53 <mail2345> 2 are on adura's script
A3:02:57 <mail2345> and 1 is cmss
A3:02:59 <Gaeel> Otherwise, a dedicated machine can be expensive
A3:03:00 <SMP> how much upload/download speed would i need at minimum to host a 16 man server
A3:03:02 <Xeros> without actual laughter.. just a show of innocence
A3:03:12 <SMP> cause i've got my mac here that i dont use
A3:03:21 <mail2345> what is your ul?
A3:03:21 <Magnulus> Xeros: I thought smilies were for that sort of thing.
A3:03:24 <SMP> but still, my internet crashes
A3:03:26 <Xeros> big difference in "Wtf is wrong with you?" with "Wtf is wrong with you lol?"

A3:03:31 <mail2345> anyway, it might be your provider
A3:03:31 <Magnulus> Hello ^_^
A3:03:33 <mail2345> ahh
A3:03:35 <mail2345> that is crappy
A3:03:36 <Magnulus> Hello lol
A3:03:37 <mail2345> i have 10x that
A3:03:38 <SMP> yeah 
A3:03:46 <SMP> thats the fastest i can get around here
A3:03:55 <mail2345> what is it?
A3:04:01 <mail2345> isp?
A3:04:05 <SMP> charter
A3:04:07 <Gaeel> SMP, how much are you willing to spend per month?
A3:04:12 <SMP> uh i dunno
A3:04:16 <mail2345> i would offer it free
A3:04:19 <SMP> i was asking you guys to find out where i could do it
A3:04:22 <Bobobobo> :D
A3:04:25 <Gaeel> lol
A3:04:32 <Xeros> I've tried a lot to keep "lol" out of my text-talking... but it brought it out of me after being in this chat so long.
A3:04:33 <Bobobobo> currently downloading an episode of true blood at 1.3mb/s
A3:04:35 <Bobobobo> :D
A3:04:35 <mail2345> but zach and darkebrz have not given their space p yet
A3:04:45 <Magnulus> I wonder what the internet is like to people a lot younger than me, people who've basically grown up with it most (if not all) of their lives.
A3:04:47 <SMP> well mail, I'm not so sure my pals would trust the WoM script being on someone else machine. They're pretty uptight about it
A3:04:57 <Bobobobo> Magnulus i've had it most of my life
A3:05:00 <Magnulus> It must FEEL different in some intangible way.
A3:05:03 <Gaeel> I'll look around, I was thinking of getting a dedicated myself, I'll let you know if I find a cheapie
A3:05:03 <mail2345> oh that
A3:05:05 <mail2345> well.
A3:05:07 <SMP> yeah
A3:05:10 <Marach> me too
A3:05:13 <Bobobobo> i'm 21
A3:05:15 <mail2345> peroggi think's i'm sort of idiot
A3:05:17 <mail2345> so no
A3:05:19 <Xeros> I never "lol" much at all in the 3dmm forums because well.. they're a tightly-knit community.. very harsh to those who aren't a part of them. In fact they can be extremely douchey at times haha but I adapted
A3:05:22 <Bobobobo> and been internetting since i was like, 10?
A3:05:23 <mail2345> he will disapprove
A3:05:25 <SMP> peroggi =/= wom
A3:05:27 <Roadcrosser> ...
A3:05:27 <SMP> he just runs the script
A3:05:31 <Magnulus> See, I've had the web for about half my life, which is to say since I was 14.
A3:05:41 <mail2345> also he will just say i'll leak it
A3:05:45 <mail2345> lets see
A3:05:49 <SMP> he's not in charge...
A3:05:52 <Bobobobo> but seeing as back then all there was was dailup... 
A3:05:54 <mail2345> i thought he was
A3:05:55 <SMP> whatever, lets not get into that
A3:05:57 <SMP> nope
A3:06:00 <SMP> he has his own server
A3:06:04 <Bobobobo> we did about 5% of the surfing we would have now
A3:06:05 <Bobobobo> :P
A3:06:21 <Magnulus> Well, I don't SURF as much these days.
A3:06:28 <Xeros> Iiii remember dial-up... in fact when I first downloaded the full version of 3dmm it was on dial up... it was about 100mb so it took a good... half a day lol it was worth it
A3:06:32 <Magnulus> Back then, I would actually properly surf the web.
A3:06:41 <Bobobobo> lol yeah xeros
A3:06:46 <Bobobobo> i remember downloading ragnarok online
A3:06:48 <Bobobobo> took a day or so
A3:06:50 <Magnulus> Type various phrases and words into search engines, etc.
A3:07:00 <Roadcrosser> im surfing!
A3:07:04 <mail2345> oh wait
A3:07:06 <mail2345> i have room
A3:07:08 <Bobobobo> i also remember having 4 gig of hard drive space for myself on my dads computer
A3:07:12 <Gaeel> I remember my first mp3
A3:07:14 <Bobobobo> so when i installed diablo 2
A3:07:16 <Bobobobo> i had no space
A3:07:20 <Gaeel> about an hour of DL
A3:07:23 <Magnulus> Nowadays, I only ever google to check facts  or information.

A3:07:31 <Gaeel> bubuye
A3:07:35 <Bobobobo> you mean you use google to...
A3:07:36 <Magnulus> Also, no one ever said "Let me Altavista that for you. ^_^"
A3:07:38 <Bobobobo> search the internet/
A3:07:45 <Xeros> You know what's sad? When I had dial up and a crap computer... I had SO much I wanted to do if I had a good computer and internet.... THEN I "get" a good computer and internet, and there's "too" much to do that I forget everything I wanted to do and become lazy and do nothing
A3:07:47 <Bobobobo> what else do you google for?

A3:08:22 <Bobobobo> oh
A3:08:24 <Xeros> it's like "hey now I can finally run this program... but there's so many other better programs that I can't even stand to waste my time on it..."

A3:08:41 <Bobobobo> just randomly

A3:08:52 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:08:57 <Bobobobo> never found it
A3:08:58 <Magnulus> Heheh.
A3:09:02 <Bobobobo> they're either pay to play, or crap
A3:09:06 <Bobobobo> or runescape
A3:09:07 <Xeros> ahaha I did that after trying out Runescape
A3:09:08 <Bobobobo> which is a good effort
A3:09:11 <Bobobobo> :P
A3:09:11 <LG_Legacy> Atlantica
A3:09:19 <Xeros> but Runescape inevitably became a part of my life..... for 3 years straight....*sigh*
A3:09:31 <Bobobobo> lol i played for a while too
A3:09:34 <Magnulus> I was too old for Runescape by the time it rolled around.
A3:09:36 <Bobobobo> i log in occaisionally
A3:09:44 <Gaeel> I got bored of runescape after 10 minutes
A3:09:47 <Bobobobo> i have a few items from holiday events from years ago
A3:09:53 <Bobobobo> and people follow me around asking how to get them
A3:09:56 <Xeros> I used to be a merchant... buy low sell high... I learned so many tricks of the trade on my own that I could honestly say it helped me in real life haha
A3:09:58 <Magnulus> Or should I say... LOLLED AROUND?!
A3:09:58 <LG_Legacy> I played around easter
A3:10:01 <Magnulus> Haw haw!
A3:10:13 <LG_Legacy> Got that stupid carrot thing
A3:10:15 <LG_Legacy> Stopped playing
A3:10:20 <LG_Legacy> The easter bunnys son is an asshole.

A3:10:33 <Bobobobo> and a snowball maker
A3:10:33 <Bobobobo> :p
A3:10:39 <Gaeel> Xeros, try that in Eve online, it's a lot harder when the other traders aren't 8 year olds
A3:10:39 <Xeros> I stopped playing after a new skill came out called "Farming"... I was so disappointed in that boring skill I quit for a while
A3:10:41 <LG_Legacy> I still got osme snow
A3:10:49 <Bobobobo> i love farming in mmorpgs
A3:10:50 <Bobobobo> but yeah

A3:11:54 <Bobobobo> anyone ever try starwars galaxies?

A3:12:20 <Xeros> in that one do you walk around?
A3:12:26 <Bobobobo> yeah
A3:12:33 <Xeros> I will never play WoW lol
A3:12:34 <Bobobobo> you can be anything you want though
A3:12:41 <Magnulus> Playing WoW right now, actually. ^_^
A3:12:48 <Gaeel> WoW is fun with friends
A3:12:49 <Bobobobo> you can build a house anywhere outside the main cities
A3:12:54 <Bobobobo> other buildings and whatnot
A3:13:02 <Bobobobo> i had a big mining facility i built myself on tatooine

A3:13:39 <Xeros> that's cool that you can build houses in wow though...never knew that...but now I have Minecraft lol

A3:13:43 <Magnulus> Sony fucked it up completely at one point, I hear.
A3:13:47 <Bobobobo> so they patched it
A3:13:49 <Bobobobo> and made it like
A3:13:54 <Gaeel> People were amazed when they saw all four of us level up simultaneously
A3:13:59 <Bobobobo> instead of you being a random person in the star wars universe
A3:14:01 <Bobobobo> you were like
A3:14:05 <Bobobobo> luke's best friend
A3:14:11 <Bobobobo> and they took out all the good professions
A3:14:14 <Bobobobo> and made it more action based
A3:14:15 <Xeros> ew... I hate story based games
A3:14:24 <Xeros> I prefer free-roam sandbox do-whatever-you-want games
A3:14:24 <Magnulus> Eh?
A3:14:28 <Bobobobo> yeah
A3:14:30 <Bobobobo> thats what it was
A3:14:32 <Magnulus> Oh, right.
A3:14:43 <Bobobobo> i played for a few months when it was originally good
A3:14:44 <Magnulus> But you will always need some form of narrative.
A3:14:48 <Bobobobo> and i never actually fought anyone
A3:14:53 <Bobobobo> i spent my time mining and farming
A3:14:53 <Gaeel> I like story, I just don't like MMO's where they pretend you're the most important person in the game universe
A3:14:55 <Bobobobo> doing quests
A3:14:57 <Xeros> only story based game I truly loved...was Half-Life 2 lol... and Portal...
A3:15:00 <offset> If you have to pay per month you're doing it wrong
A3:15:06 <Bobobobo> why?
A3:15:20 <Magnulus> Like Bethesda's titles. Extremely story-driven, just not one single straight-forward one.
A3:15:22 <Bobobobo> i played wow to level 70, i feel it was worth the... 45 dollars i ended up paying
A3:15:25 <LG_Legacy> Only story game i liked was Oddworld
A3:15:34 <Xeros> and I liked Red Faction the first one cuz you could make caves and destroy the walls.... see.. I was destined for games like minecraft lol
A3:15:35 <Bobobobo> i like anything blizzard does
A3:15:36 <LG_Legacy> And winback
A3:15:42 <Bobobobo> and little big planet
A3:15:43 <Bobobobo> and rockstar 
A3:15:45 <Bobobobo> well
A3:15:46 <offset> I agree, but most people end up spending 100's more
A3:15:48 <LG_Legacy> Xeros, i love Red Faction II
A3:15:54 <Bobobobo> rockstar and blizzard are companioes
A3:15:56 <Bobobobo> companies :P
A3:16:02 <doohan> vhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsWFFuYZYI
A3:16:06 <Marach> i love all zelda's!
A3:16:12 <Xeros> oh yeah Fallout 3 I loved for the little amount I played it.. and I always loved Oblivion until I got tired of it
A3:16:24 <LG_Legacy> Oblivion... like it but not my style
A3:16:34 <Xeros> Red faction 2? I played it but didn't like that they took out the ability to make caves and stuff lol
A3:16:36 <LG_Legacy> Diablo II got me hooked for three years straight
A3:16:40 <LG_Legacy> Xeros
A3:16:45 <LG_Legacy> The multiplayer bombed it
A3:16:45 <Bobobobo> diablo 3 monk looks sweetttt
A3:16:46 <Xeros> Diablo 2 was another that I loved
A3:16:55 <LG_Legacy> I got bored of Diablo II ..
A3:16:59 <LG_Legacy> So now i play Median XL
A3:17:00 <Bobobobo> what do you guys think of gta 4?
A3:17:13 <offset> Doesn't bring much new, but its fun :)
A3:17:15 <LG_Legacy> Gta IV: Swingset glitch and playign with ragdoll physics
A3:17:18 <Xeros> San Andreas was best GTA I've ever played....
A3:17:28 <LG_Legacy> Xeros: I preffered that because of the Bike
A3:17:32 <offset> Yeah, SA was awesome
A3:17:41 <Bobobobo> gta 4 is by far the best video game i've played in the last few years
A3:17:41 <Magnulus> Bethesda are an interesting company. They make games that have that certain "je ne sais quoi" that most games lack, but they're usually also extremely flawed.
A3:17:42 <doohan> SA is my favourite of the lot too.
A3:17:49 <Bobobobo> san andreas was fine for the first city
A3:17:50 <Xeros> I also like it because of the huge area including forests and etc to explore.
A3:17:54 <Marach> i dont like any gta
A3:17:57 <LG_Legacy> Magnulus
A3:17:59 <Bobobobo> but the other cities had no effort put into them
A3:18:01 <Bobobobo> so bare
A3:18:02 <Bobobobo> and crap
A3:18:07 <LG_Legacy> Daggerfall
A3:18:08 <LG_Legacy> :P
A3:18:11 <Magnulus> I used to play the old GTA. The first two.
A3:18:19 <offset> Daggerfall is massive :d
A3:18:23 <Magnulus> (As in the 2D ones)
A3:18:23 <LG_Legacy> It is
A3:18:27 <LG_Legacy> But it's fucking awesome
A3:18:29 <Xeros> but again... I only really played GTA for the freeroam portion... I only did the missions to unlock things to do myself
A3:18:30 <LG_Legacy> And it's freeware now
A3:18:33 <Magnulus> Yeah, I remember getting the demo for Daggerfall.
A3:18:35 <offset> yup, and arena right?
A3:18:41 <Xeros> I played GTA 2 and loved that very much as well as a kid
A3:18:49 <Bobobobo> GTA4 is the best balance between ultra simplicity and ultra detail
A3:19:00 <Bobobobo> its beautiful
A3:19:04 <Bobobobo> i would have sex with it
A3:19:09 <Bobobobo> if it wasn't so wierd
A3:19:09 <LG_Legacy> Possible
A3:19:11 <Bobobobo> and possible
A3:19:19 <Xeros> oh I know why I didn't like gta 4 a lot... because they took out all the extremely fun CHEATS! and that's the only I game I really cheat in
A3:19:20 <Bobobobo> i can have sex with the actual game
A3:19:27 <Bobobobo> they have cheats...
A3:19:38 <Bobobobo> in gta 4
A3:19:39 <Xeros> I used to run into a car, the car would start floating up... and I'd get on top of it
A3:19:44 <LG_Legacy> It was fun putting in a cheat or two
A3:19:47 <Xeros> I'm talking about these cheats
A3:19:50 <Bobobobo> you can modify car properties
A3:19:54 <Xeros> flaoting cars etc
A3:19:58 <LG_Legacy> Parachute + m16 + Plane = Parachuting terror :D
A3:19:59 <Bobobobo> my friend modded a car so it was super heavy
A3:20:03 <Bobobobo> so every car it hit
A3:20:06 <Bobobobo> would go flying
A3:20:10 <Xeros> did they have planes and trains in gta4?
A3:20:15 <LG_Legacy> No
A3:20:17 <Bobobobo> helicopters
A3:20:19 <Bobobobo> they have trains
A3:20:20 <LG_Legacy> Oh wait
A3:20:21 <Xeros> grr another reason lol
A3:20:21 <LG_Legacy> Yes
A3:20:23 <LG_Legacy> Though
A3:20:28 <Xeros> the helicopters were cool though in gta4
A3:20:32 <LG_Legacy> Airplanes = Gone due to symbolism of terrorism
A3:20:33 <Bobobobo> i would just stand and shove civilians in front of the trains
A3:20:38 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:20:45 <LG_Legacy> Really?
A3:20:51 <LG_Legacy> It's more fun to shove em off cliffs in gta iv now
A3:20:53 <Bobobobo> airplanes = held for a later expansion
A3:20:54 <LG_Legacy> Ragdoll physics
A3:21:01 <Bobobobo> its rockstar we're talking about
A3:21:11 <Bobobobo> they wouldnt hold planes back due to terrorist whiny fags
A3:21:18 <Xeros> I remember random things happened to me in gta.. SA at least... I was in front of a adult store or something... and for some reason a plane crashed into a sign that was right above me.... it just amazed me lol
A3:21:30 <liq3> lol wtf?
A3:21:33 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:21:39 <Bobobobo> i loved san andreas with multi theft auto
A3:21:41 <Bobobobo> or whatever it was
A3:21:48 <liq3> "GTA, where pilots fly way, way too low."
A3:21:50 <Bobobobo> me and friends used to just ride mountain bikes off that huge mountain
A3:21:54 <LG_Legacy> Hahaha liq3
A3:21:56 <LG_Legacy> Nice
A3:22:04 <LG_Legacy> Really?
A3:22:10 <LG_Legacy> I floated off it with the hybird car/boat
A3:22:14 <LG_Legacy> It's so fun :D
A3:22:16 <liq3> Eh?
A3:22:19 <Xeros> Yeah gta online is something I always wanted.. and gta 4 seemed to do it but... it didn't seem to do it "as well" as I thought it would
A3:22:22 <liq3> Was it that hovecraft thing Legacy?
A3:22:28 <LG_Legacy> Yep
A3:22:37 <LG_Legacy> Xeros i got a copy of SA with multiplayer somewhere
A3:22:39 <LG_Legacy> Fun times
A3:22:58 <liq3> Haha yeh. I loved how far you could "fly" with it.-
A3:22:59 <offset> Do the civilians remain? :3
A3:23:03 <Xeros> I just remembered something... there coming out with a game :O
A3:23:09 <liq3> What was really really fun, was the flying cheat in SA> :D
A3:23:13 <LG_Legacy> Who? What?
A3:23:15 <Xeros> I believe it's called "All Points Bulletin"
A3:23:16 <liq3> Flying cars was just epic.
A3:23:21 <LG_Legacy> It was
A3:23:26 <liq3> So was watching the helis totally spaz out.
A3:23:28 <LG_Legacy> I remember driving a monster truck into a building or car.

A3:25:22 <liq3> Oh, it's got the territory control I've always wanted to see in an MMO.
A3:25:32 <Magnulus> in the original GTA, I would hang around a piece of road and steal cars. I would place them all together, blocking the street. Then I'd wait for the cops to come around and I'd blast the cars apart, creating a chain reaction that would destroy the police cars (and the police) as well.
A3:25:55 <Gaeel> bam, 6 stars
A3:26:16 <liq3> Where you basically have 24/7 battles going for territory control, and when one team
A3:26:18 <Xeros> "For example, several Gang players may rob a convenience store within the game; the game will then seek out one or more Law Enforcement players of equivalent skills and other criteria, and will issue an all points bulletin for them to stop the robbery."
A3:26:19 <liq3> woohs
A3:26:28 <liq3> Xeros: wow, it's claiming to be skill based.
A3:26:33 <liq3> Lets see if it fails or not. :D
A3:26:52 <liq3> The last MMO that tried that failed.
A3:26:59 <Xeros> What was it?
A3:27:24 <liq3> Darkfall.
A3:27:44 <liq3> Was supposed to be a skill based MMO focuses on hardcore pvp. Ended up a giant grind fest for stats.
A3:27:47 <Xeros> well I hope it works APB also claims it will be the first MMO title where the player's skill determines the character's progression, as opposed to the normal model of time investment.

A3:28:54 <Xeros> Its an online sandbox. Many players will gain fame, fortune or notoriety. Alliances will be formed, rivalries will be bitter. One thing we do know, every player will be unique. Thanks to leading edge technology, players can personalize their looks, clothing, vehicles and music.
A3:29:02 <liq3> Xeros: I hope so too. The kind of game it is I've basically being dreaming about for years.
A3:29:36 <Xeros> It says it's being made by the guy who did the original GTA.. and also another one of my fav games: Crackdown
A3:29:51 <Gaeel> liq3 : everytime I've said that about a game, I've been dissapointed

A3:30:46 <liq3> Gaeel: Darkfall for example, made tons of promises, and blew half of them.
A3:30:52 <Magnulus> Like with Spore. So many people treated it like The Second Coming or something.
A3:30:53 <Snowman> Ello
A3:31:27 <Magnulus> Then, when it just turned out to be a pretty good user-generated-content-based game, they thought it was terrible.
A3:31:30 <Magnulus> Hey, Snow.
A3:31:32 <Gaeel> Anyone noticed how video game websites ask to type in your age, and porn just ask "Are you over 18?"
A3:31:40 <Xeros> I loved spore but... it definitely wasn't as "continue playing" as I thought.. .once you hit space it got kinda repetitive
A3:31:56 <liq3> Gaeel: Rofl, that's so true.
A3:31:56 <liq3> xD
A3:32:09 <Magnulus> Actually not so much, Xeros.
A3:32:11 <liq3> Porn websites are actually doing it legal reasons I think.
A3:32:13 <Xeros> I mean outer space.. not the space bar xP
A3:32:20 <liq3> Games I swear are just doing it to be fucktards.
A3:32:29 <Magnulus> There are many things you can do once you get to space, you just have to decide yourself.
A3:32:49 <Magnulus> Since there is no narrative or story drive to it, you have to sandbox it and find your own fun
A3:32:52 <liq3> I'd probably pour some water into a fish tank.

A3:33:53 <Bobobobo> lol spore
A3:33:57 <Xeros> yeah but doing the missions was repetitive like crazy... which you needed to do to unlock cool abilities. I once found a black hole that took me sooo close to the center of the galaxy... and I was getting DESTROYED by those alien guys that infested the center lol

A3:34:39 <Bobobobo> just took a few colonisation kits 
A3:34:43 <Bobobobo> theres a cutscene
A3:34:46 <Magnulus> Basically, you have to get a bunch of health "packs" and energy things.
A3:34:49 <Bobobobo> and you get some scepter
A3:34:55 <FalseFoxes> The game could be improved greatly if you were not the ONE ship your nation biult, and if they didn't focus on space so much in general
A3:34:57 <Bobobobo> which instantly makes a planet colonisable
A3:35:11 <Xeros> ...what? that's no fun lol
A3:35:27 <Xeros> I like putting it through all the terraforming..things
A3:35:27 <Bobobobo> i got banned off spore online
A3:35:29 <FalseFoxes> it only has 25 or 50 (more then enough) uses though I think.
A3:35:33 <Xeros> it just..is expensive
A3:35:33 <Magnulus> It looks AWESOME when you use it. ^_^
A3:35:45 <Magnulus> I like me some Terraforming too.
A3:35:59 <Magnulus> Well, terraforming pays for itself if you do it selectively.
A3:36:08 <Bobobobo> EA banned me for making this spore creature,

A3:36:58 <FalseFoxes> ...
A3:37:04 <FalseFoxes> that thing is epic
A3:37:06 <Bobobobo> spore had some really neat features
A3:37:09 <Bobobobo> but the game itself
A3:37:11 <Bobobobo> was rather crap
A3:37:32 <Bobobobo> for me anyway
A3:37:32 <FalseFoxes> Truth
A3:37:36 <Bobobobo> after i played through it once
A3:37:41 <Bobobobo> put it on my shelf
A3:37:44 <Magnulus> Yeah, I'd like for the individual stages of the game to be more fleshed out.
A3:37:49 <Xeros> it did... I was following spore before it was released and I kinda wish they woulda kept it like it was... they made it all "user friendly" and...eugh
A3:37:51 <Bobobobo> indeed
A3:37:56 <Bobobobo> the tribe stages were boring
A3:37:59 <Bobobobo> and the civ stages...
A3:38:10 <Bobobobo> i hated how they made war and religion the same thing
A3:38:11 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:38:14 <Bobobobo> they just called it different
A3:38:18 <Bobobobo> instead of shooting bullets
A3:38:20 <Magnulus> Yeah, that was a bit silly.
A3:38:23 <Xeros> ahaha oh yeah!
A3:38:23 <liq3> bobobobo: since when was there a difference,  even in RL?
A3:38:26 <Bobobobo> you shot... lies and religion

A3:38:36 <Bobobobo> same thing

A3:39:21 <liq3> man...
A3:39:32 <Magnulus> When he Creature Creator came out, I actually spent an entire week just making creatures.
A3:39:34 <liq3> should like carry some stone that's carved into the word "Words"
A3:39:43 <liq3> and like everytime someone says that, smack them with it. :D
A3:39:44 <Magnulus> I made a ton of Blizzard-based ones.
A3:39:47 <Xeros> I was hoping the wars would be more in depth too.. like I actually wanted to "be" one of my vehicles and attack.. and see what I shoot fall to peices
A3:40:07 <Bobobobo> i just made different sex positions
A3:40:08 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:40:09 <liq3> Xeros: Battlezone 2 was like that. :D
A3:41:13 <Xeros> I restarted the video of your spore creature.. I think I laughed even more
A3:41:47 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:41:58 <Xeros> the beginning throughout the music... and 1:10-1:20 was amazing
A3:41:58 <Bobobobo> it was even funnier playing with it
A3:42:11 <Bobobobo> giant creatures chasing it
A3:42:13 <Bobobobo> was so funny
A3:42:17 <Bobobobo> looked like they got caught
A3:42:22 <Bobobobo> and didnt bother stopping
A3:42:24 <Bobobobo> while running away
13A3:42:25 * FalseFoxes is going to choke to death laughing
A3:42:48 <Xeros> why must the music fit "so" well
A3:42:56 <Bobobobo> i didnt like all the false ideas they gave out during the development of spore
A3:42:57 <Bobobobo> like
A3:43:02 <Bobobobo> they claimed your creature kinda...
A3:43:03 <Bobobobo> evolved
A3:43:07 <Magnulus> I feel that the creature stage could have done with some heavy tweaking.
A3:43:16 <Bobobobo> but i found myself just changing all my parts to suit what i needed to do at the time
A3:43:24 <Magnulus> Like that it could matter how many legs you have.
A3:43:35 <Xeros> seriously.. you could be a completely different creature when you evolved
A3:43:36 <Bobobobo> yeah
A3:43:43 <Bobobobo> and the legs thing
A3:43:47 <Magnulus> Perhaps the second pair of legs would only add 50% the bonuses.
A3:43:50 <Bobobobo> made no difference how you set anything up
A3:44:11 <Bobobobo> you could make a completely different creature with the same parts and it would be no different
A3:44:25 <Magnulus> That too, I suppose, but that's hard to change.
A3:44:41 <Bobobobo> yeah, but they kinda made out like it did make a difference
A3:44:53 <Magnulus> Though I guess they could make it so that animals with a colour similar to their surroundings would be harder to spot and such.
A3:44:57 <Xeros> I was even sad that they took out miniscule things that I would enjoy.. like how it would bite down on a dead animal and you could move the creature and drag it
A3:45:06 <Bobobobo> they could have used some sort of intelligent physics thing
A3:45:10 <Bobobobo> but that would be complicated
A3:45:11 <Bobobobo> lol
A3:45:44 <Xeros> and when they talked about the tribal and civilization stage... I still wanted to be my creature walking around =/
A3:46:15 <Magnulus> On the topic of being able to completely change an animal during its "evolution" I don't see that as a bad thing. It's up to you, then, to evolve it one way or the other.

A3:46:49 <Magnulus> Well, they never talked about tribal and civ as anything but what they are now as far as I recall.
A3:47:05 <Magnulus> Though I agree that tribal was just... a bit pointless.
A3:47:24 <Snowman> But EA games never meet expectations, so it's not weird Spore didn't.
A3:48:01 <Magnulus> I think that has more to do with how much expectation they build up around their games than anything else.
A3:48:45 <Magnulus> I mean, no Molineux-backed game has ever met expectations, but that's because Mr M always spends a few years going "THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING SINCE THE MICROWAVE!!!"
A3:49:03 <Magnulus> Black and White, Fable, etc etc.

A3:49:36 <liq3> Fable 2?

A3:50:00 <liq3> Snowman: EA games are mostly just all money cows. They're not really games anymore.
A3:50:11 <Snowman> Yup
A3:50:36 <Snowman> Valve is the best atm imo
A3:50:43 <liq3> oh yeh.
A3:50:44 <liq3> easily.
A3:50:59 <liq3> Blizzard are pretty good too, but Valve is better. <3
A3:51:11 <Snowman> Although they just keep delaying ep3 :/
A3:51:26 <liq3> I don't really like Half-life, so doesn't bother me. :p
A3:51:37 <Snowman> best sp game imo
A3:51:46 <liq3> ...Portal.
A3:51:53 <Magnulus> Portal was amazing.
A3:51:56 <Snowman> Yeah portal was awesome but a tad short
A3:52:04 <Magnulus> But was of course not a Valve title as such.
A3:52:04 <liq3> eh, not really.
A3:52:10 <liq3> I think how short it is actually ADDS to the game.
A3:52:29 <liq3> ...nvm, I think my tiredness made me say that.
A3:52:30 <liq3> sigh.
A3:52:43 <Snowman> go to bed :p
A3:52:46 <Magnulus> It was a direct transposition of a game some students made. Valve gave them money and the HL2 engine and went "Turn this into a PROPER game!"
A3:52:49 <Snowman> I just woke up :p
A3:52:49 <liq3> i want food first. :p
A3:52:51 <doohan> liq3, you mean it leaves you wanting more.
A3:52:56 <doohan> Too much would make it boring.
A3:52:57 <Magnulus> Yeah, Portal is the right length for me.
A3:53:08 <liq3> doohan: yeh basically. if it was any longer it'd probably have gotten boring.
A3:53:11 <doohan> There's not that much to actually do in portal.
A3:53:13 <Magnulus> Was it ever sold as a full-price game?

A3:53:27 <doohan> Apart from maybe on steam
A3:53:47 <Snowman> And if you got it with the Orange Box you even pad less
A3:53:54 <Snowman> paid
A3:53:59 <liq3> Like, Portal is essestionally a puzzle games. The biggest defining factor between good and bad ones, is that good ones NEVER repeat puzzles, they always make the new ones unique.
A3:54:04 <Magnulus> Yeah, I got it for the Orange Box on PS3.
A3:54:45 <liq3> So, Portal couldn't really be any longer, it'd ruin the game. :/
A3:54:55 <Magnulus> Yup.
A3:54:56 <liq3> Not to mention make a Portal 2 even harder. 
A3:55:01 <Magnulus> Also, GladOS makes it worth it.
A3:55:02 <liq3> Also Portal 2 is being made. :D

A4:39:11 <Snowman> Oh well, here in Antarctica we have basically no porblems
A4:39:36 <Xeros> Noo we're just using currency wrong. If an apocolyptic disaster comes we will have to create things ourselves to trade for other things... eventually we will create a currency since we can't make thousands of things to trade for something valuable
A4:39:41 <liq3> Snowman: Just because they lack currency does not make them effective. Fuck, such an obvious fallacy.

A4:47:20 <Xeros> Honestly, I think by the time humanity would ever allow such a change... that will be the time we will be thriving in space and colonizing planets. Then there will be many new organizations, on entire planets.
A4:47:35 <Xeros> Which with that... would make it very possible.

A4:48:06 <Xeros> The Project Venus thing? Or colonizing planets?

A4:48:27 <liq3> There's powerful people... Some are dark, some are light.

A5:08:17 <Xeros> The scary thing is nothingness, simply non-existence... unexplainable.. I think of "blackness forever" but even colors wouldn't exist... I think that's why religions are popular.. because of the fear of that possibility
A5:08:29 <Bobobobo> yeah
A5:08:31 <liq3> I remember some guy I respect came up with a reason for this not being a computer sim, but I can't remember it.
A5:08:35 <Bobobobo> that is exactly why religion is around
A5:09:23 <liq3> Xeros: I think the real reason is because they're an easy way to get accepted intto a group. Also a lot of people learned them from birth, which is extremely hard to unlearn.
A5:09:40 <Xeros> You know, I don't believe in "scientology" but I do believe it is very possible that we were put here by "aliens" lol... and the reason is.. we will someday have the technology of advanced genetic engineering that we may create intelligent creatures
A5:09:49 <liq3> I also would expect the creation of most religions was to control people, then it spiraled out of control.
A5:10:07 <Xeros> and with space travel... the idea of "experimenting" with these creatures by putting them on a livable planet and observing... that's... just what "we" would do
A5:10:20 <Xeros> I agree with you liq3
A5:10:27 <liq3> Xeros: Actually, knowing us, we'd probably do it to ourselves.
A5:10:34 <liq3> If you get what I mean.
A5:10:36 <Xeros> and I believe it was a very effective method back in those days to control people... but in the modern world ehhh
A5:11:04 <Xeros> Do what ourselves? because if it's what I think then, that's what I'm saying
A5:11:05 <Xeros> lol
A5:11:07 <liq3> Xeros: Yes, it doesn't really work anymore, and it's grip is getting worse and worse.
A5:11:19 <liq3> Xeros: Put some humans on a planet, and observe them. :P
A5:11:36 <liq3> Of course, you'd somehow do it in a way so they don't know we exist.
A5:11:55 <Xeros> of course... because we would "easily" do that... even secretly because no amount of moral laws will stop us when we have the power to... so the idea that we are an experiment or something seems realistic to me
A5:12:09 <liq3> Xeros: Heh.
A5:12:13 <liq3> Xeros: Maybe.
A5:12:20 <Xeros> But I am personally Agnostic... I believe that us humans simply don't know what or if there is something.
A5:12:21 <liq3> Xeros: What's fun is that reality is actually subjective. :]
A5:12:33 <Bobobobo> Xeros: saaameeee
A5:12:39 <Bobobobo> i dont believe theres nothing
A5:12:41 <liq3> Xeros: There are no laws of physics or anything like that. :P
A5:12:45 <Bobobobo> but i dont believe anyone can know 
A5:12:57 <liq3> bobobobo: try being spiritual.
A5:13:11 <Bobobobo> naww, i dont really believe in anything 
A5:13:13 <Bobobobo> like
A5:13:17 <Bobobobo> i just havent ruled it out
A5:13:19 <liq3> There are spirits, and they can communicate with us.
A5:13:24 <Bobobobo> well
A5:13:25 <Xeros> I have an outlook on life that some people might think is weird.
A5:13:28 <liq3> Just most people shut them out.
A5:13:31 <Bobobobo> i'm not so into ghosts and crap
A5:13:37 <liq3> I don't mean ghosts.
A5:13:38 <Bobobobo> i think thats a very "see what you want to see" type thing
A5:13:44 <Bobobobo> like tarot cards or something
A5:13:49 <Xeros> Everything bad or negative that happens to me... I usually always take as a "positive" thing.. as positive experience only making me stronger no matter how bad it is
A5:13:52 <liq3> I don't mean using tarot or anything.
A5:14:04 <liq3> The kind of communication I'm talking is probably closest to telepathy.
A5:14:06 <liq3> anyway, brb.
A5:15:04 <Xeros> I'm not too sure... but if I had the option to visit Hell(if it exists) for like a day... or an hour... I might do it. As long as I come out physically fine and it's just a mental type of thing...but even pain would be felt while there
A5:15:30 <Xeros> I could imagine being tortured in a million ways within an hour... I bet it'd be the worst thing ever if it's a hell like that haha and I'd still experience it
A5:15:32 <Bobobobo> i think i'd do it just because then i'd Know theres something more
A5:15:44 <liq3> Xeros: Hell is mostly likely a mental state.
A5:15:45 <Bobobobo> but on the other hand
A5:15:54 <Bobobobo> people come out of wars all mentally messed up
A5:15:59 <Bobobobo> imagine actual hell
A5:16:16 <Bobobobo> i mean... i could think of ways to destroy my mind myself
A5:16:33 <Bobobobo> imagine what... some horrible demon whos had eternity to practise would do
A5:16:34 <Xeros> Wanna know my back-up attempt if heaven and hell exist like it says in the Bible? Well since I like neither heaven nor hell... you see demons have their weaknesses, holy water, exorcisms... I believe angels have weaknesses too ^.^
A5:17:01 <Xeros> Since supposidly in the bible it says after the apocalypse... god will try to take over earth....pshhh
A5:17:03 <Bobobobo> what are you talking about?
A5:17:04 <Bobobobo> lol
A5:17:09 <Bobobobo> those are things from movies
A5:17:16 <Xeros> I'm saying if hypothetically the bible were true....
A5:17:19 <Bobobobo> ah
A5:17:29 <Xeros> no the apocalypse is in the bible.. and god plans on building a kingdom here supposedly.
A5:17:38 <Bobobobo> wanker
A5:17:39 <liq3> You guys might find this interesting. http://www.erinpavlina.com/blog/2009/06/how-to-get-out-of-hell/
A5:17:57 <Peerko> no thanks
A5:18:04 <liq3> Peerko: Hrm?
A5:18:17 <Peerko> I don't want religion
A5:18:23 <liq3> it's not religion.
A5:18:31 <liq3> it's an idea,  a theory. Read it, see if you agree with it.
A5:18:43 <Bobobobo> yeah if i had three wishes, the first would be to rid the human race of their need for religion
A5:18:44 <liq3> blindly accepting that as fact would be stupid.
A5:18:50 <Bobobobo> make every free minds
A5:18:59 <Peerko> no I just wanted to voice my opninion, now I'm going back to work
A5:19:03 <Xeros> Hah.. I love myself... I'll admit that I'm not proud of myself through my life so far since I have done nothing for humanity and I'm jus...lazy... but I plan on redeeming myself in my own way.
A5:19:03 <liq3> bobobobo: how are they free if they can't choose religion? :p
A5:19:30 <Bobobobo> well maybe my wish would just be to... make everyone that little bit smarter so they can see how stupid they look
A5:19:49 <Xeros> If I had three wishes.. my first wish would be "the power to do anything imaginable"... then I wouldn't even need more wishes because I could do anything basically lol
13A5:20:30 * FalseFoxes coughs "In the great words of Notch 'Look! Pigs!' and no that had nothing to do with any of this"
A5:20:44 <Xeros> and using that power I would idk... give myself infinite knowledge and wisdom so that I could know everything before making more powerful choices lol
A5:20:53 <Bobobobo> that'd be crap
A5:21:01 <Bobobobo> i want to learn from my experiences
A5:21:02 <liq3> Xeros: That's a terrible tihng to wish for. It'll just lead to you creating humanity. :P
A5:21:15 <Xeros> Hey no.. I'd go find my own planet don't worry >.>
A5:21:20 <Bobobobo> how lonely
A5:21:22 <liq3> No, you don't understand.
A5:21:27 <Xeros> lol
A5:21:33 <Bobobobo> you'd basically wish to be dr manhatten?
A5:21:40 <liq3> If you could do anything imaginable, you'd quickly become infinitely smart. This would pretty much lead you to becoming a god.
A5:21:42 <Xeros> no idea who that is lol
A5:21:46 <liq3> And perfect in every way.
A5:21:57 <FalseFoxes> ... lol, the 2 active channels I'm in right now are talking about 2 of the 4 unspeakables, in this case religion and politics (unspeakable becuase 70% of the time some troll or onesided person turns it in to a flamewar)
A5:22:03 <liq3> and that would lead to you create life, the universe and everything.
A5:22:09 <Xeros> well no t's just that I wouldn't trust my power if I didn't know the consequences of every action
A5:22:45 <Xeros> I'd never wish for "world peace" in a heartbeat because it could cause disasterous things.. even if it were to be.. infinite boredom
A5:23:11 <liq3> World Peace would never be boring.
A5:23:18 <liq3> Peaceful conflict is not an oxymoron. :P
A5:23:41 <Xeros> I guess you can't get bored with a limited lifespan...
A5:23:52 <liq3> you just start studying things.
A5:23:57 <liq3> or recreating.
A5:24:18 <liq3> like, for example, making games. even if no money was involved (but they have enough supplies to life a lifetime and make games), people would still amke games.
A5:24:19 <Xeros> I myself think I could live.. a very very long time if I had the ability. Sure maybe someday I "will" become so [something] that I might jst wanna kill myself but... either way I'm gonna die
A5:24:48 <liq3> Xeros: Haha.
A5:24:58 <liq3> Mabye you should have the same quest as me, to bend reality. ;]\
A5:25:38 <Xeros> how about instead of infinite knowledge I had to power to hold infinite knowledge and access it easily. I mean maybe our brains can hold infinite knowledge but idunooo
A5:25:53 <liq3> our brains are only limited by our beliefls.
A5:26:03 <FalseFoxes> Hey liq3, can I join you, I'm on the same quest XD
A5:26:03 <Xeros> then I could lock myself in a room where time stood still and read a bunch of "for dummies" books and etc
A5:26:10 <liq3> FalseFoxes: Really? :D
A5:26:24 <FalseFoxes> I keep my eyes open, srsly, why not
A5:26:43 <liq3> FalseFoxes: My life long goal (yes, goal not dream), is to fly. ;]
A5:26:57 <FalseFoxes> If the 1 peice of reality that I will ever see buckling next to me happens, I'll see it =/ it don't distract me from my daily life, and I need one insane goal
A5:26:58 <Xeros> The most realistic thing I'd like to do that...well it wouldn't bend reality. But like you were talking about us as computer simulations... I would like to create such a computer simulation :P
A5:27:10 <Xeros> Except I would probably let them know they were a simulation.
A5:27:38 <liq3> Xeros: And give them an out.
A5:27:45 <liq3> Like, if they say a certain phrase or word.
A5:27:50 <Xeros> in a virtual world of course... not physical beings
A5:27:52 <liq3> or indicate in any real way they wish to leave.
A5:28:25 <Bobobobo> and make an avatar to play as
A5:28:27 <Bobobobo> and send it in
A5:28:32 <Bobobobo> and do hax
A5:28:34 <FalseFoxes> XD
A5:28:36 <Xeros> yes... they may have to come accross the will to "not be there anymore" on their own.. because it wouldn't be true intelligence if I programmed them to think like that
A5:28:39 <liq3> haha, i just remembered this story, of this guy who decided to clone himself every year, so he'd always be 21.
A5:28:45 <Bobobobo> and then tell everyone that if they kill you then their sins are forgiven
A5:28:51 <liq3> Thing is, cloning himself means that his original, well, DIES.
A5:28:58 <liq3> The clone can never rememebr that tho.
A5:29:08 <liq3> So this guy ends up dying, thousands and thousands of times. >.>
A5:29:16 <Xeros> oh yes an avatar... omg you know what my other idea is? it's that when I die I'd like my memories and thoughts to be transferred to my simulation self.. so that I may continue to live even though it isn't me
A5:29:30 <liq3> Xeros: That's what I think the Afterlife is.
A5:29:45 <liq3> oh
A5:29:46 <liq3> wait nvm.
A5:29:50 <liq3> it's not the same. :P
A5:29:52 <Xeros> And then real people could still teach me and ask me questions and I would answer as if it were me
A5:30:14 <liq3> Xeros: you ever watch stargate?
A5:30:24 <Xeros> I don't watch TV much lol
A5:31:05 <liq3> well.
A5:31:08 <FalseFoxes> OOC (out of conversation): Why the hell do I spend hours on Omen?
A5:31:22 <Snowman> Cause you like mapping?
A5:31:24 <liq3> There's this race in it called the Asgard. There a race that live for thousands of years each (i.e. most advanced... nearly).
A5:31:43 <liq3> Except, they can't reproduce normally anymore, and they have an "eve" that has like the ability to reproduce or some such.
A5:32:19 <Xeros> continuuue
A5:32:35 <liq3> that's about it. I never really figured it out properly. :(
A5:32:39 <Xeros> lol
A5:32:56 <Xeros> Make it into a 3dmm movie :P
A5:33:00 <liq3> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3ejDkmvRKo&eurl=http://www.google.com/reader/view/&feature=player_embedded#t=130
A5:33:02 <Xeros> :d
A5:33:40 <Magnulus> Asgard? sgard? The home of the norse Gods?
A5:33:43 <liq3> i love the music.
A5:33:50 <liq3> Magnulus: possibly.
A5:33:58 <liq3> My memory may be way off. xD
A5:34:00 <liq3> I'll check.
A5:34:01 <Bobobobo> yeah it is
A5:34:10 <Bobobobo> their names are all greek gods
A5:34:11 <Bobobobo> like
A5:34:12 <Bobobobo> Thor
A5:34:17 <liq3> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgard_(Stargate)
A5:34:26 <Bobobobo> greek?
A5:34:28 <Bobobobo> norse rather
A5:34:30 <Bobobobo> whatever
A5:34:46 <Magnulus> Oh jeez.
A5:34:53 <Magnulus> Can't they make up anything themselves?
A5:35:01 <liq3> aha.
A5:35:05 <liq3> They posed as norse gods. :P
A5:35:28 <Magnulus> They don't quite LOOK like Norse gods, though...
A5:35:35 <Xeros> lmao @ the video
A5:35:42 <Magnulus> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thorstargate.jpg != Thor
A5:35:53 <liq3> Magnulus: They used holograms.
A5:35:59 <Magnulus> Ahh.
A5:38:05 <Xeros> My inspiration for making virtual intelligent...things... is from some silly time of me watching ANIME(out of the few I ever get to watch) called Chobits ahaha. Those are "Persacoms" though that are robots walking around that look and act human
A5:38:29 <Xeros> btw the song in this video is... so unexpected ahah
A5:38:37 <liq3> haha xID
A5:38:49 <liq3> Xeros: You may like AI War.
A5:38:56 <liq3> It's got the best AI in any game I've seen so far.
A5:39:31 <Xeros> I keep hearing about it but... I don't wanna put my hopes in another game till I'm off og this Crapintosh... I mean sorry.... Ma...Macin.... Macintass-this-out-the-window...
A5:39:42 <liq3> lol.
A5:39:46 <Xeros> toss*
A5:39:52 <liq3> You could use some windows VM.
A5:40:13 <Xeros> oh...I did... I was that desperate to play minecraft multiplayer lol... and especially to try getting 3DMM to work on here
A5:40:20 <liq3> did it work?
A5:40:26 <Xeros> I've only got 1 more day on this mac though
A5:40:28 <Xeros> nope it suure didnt
A5:40:39 <liq3> oh ok.
A5:40:44 <liq3> well try Ai War in a few days.
A5:40:51 <liq3> Heh, I just remember one defining feature about it...
A5:41:09 <Xeros> is AI war... "too cool" visually? because I have baaad computers....
A5:41:18 <Magnulus> Man, it must be hard for you to use a computer than can dual-boot between a really stable, well-made OS and Windows.
A5:41:21 <liq3> It's an RTS, you only play against AI, SP or Co-op. Cool thing about co-op, is that if one player loses, they aren't "out". Their allies can give them enough units to allow them to rebuild everything. ;]
A5:41:26 <Magnulus> Tough times.
A5:41:27 <Magnulus> ^_^
A5:41:40 <Xeros> they can't even run minecraft without lagging even on the closest fog but.. maybe I didn't give it enough time and I'll try again
A5:41:43 <liq3> Magnulus: He has Mac, not Unix. ;]
A5:41:56 <Xeros> Actually I've never had a good computer in my life lol... we're just that poor
A5:42:03 <liq3> Xeros: Oh?
A5:42:08 <liq3> (
A5:42:09 <liq3> :(
A5:42:19 <Xeros> my dad's computer was given to him...by me... which I got from my friend... and my new one my dad found in the trash :D
A5:42:29 <liq3> lol...
A5:42:35 <Xeros> As long as it can play 3dmm I'm fine haha
A5:42:42 <liq3> "Hey son, I found a PC in the trash. I checket out the parts, it's better then your current one!"
A5:42:43 <liq3> >.>
A5:42:51 <Magnulus> You can have a computer that's stable and doesn't cost an arm and a leg, you'd just have to spend a lot of time doing research and building it from parts.
A5:43:00 <liq3> Magnulus: not really.
A5:43:07 <liq3> you can build a half decent PC for like $300 US.
A5:43:18 <liq3> albiet, that's just the box...
A5:43:19 <liq3> >.>
A5:43:23 <Magnulus> I'm not talking about top specs here.
A5:43:28 <Siiseli> Magnulus, it's not alot of work
A5:43:28 <liq3> I assume you have keyboard, mouse, moniter, sound. :P
A5:43:35 <Xeros> I'm not even gonna step up the ranks of computers.. I'm saving up for an Alienware and that's it lol
A5:43:46 <liq3> Magnulus: neither am I. i'm talking low end office PC that has some game playing ability.
A5:43:54 <liq3> stuff like a 2ghz duel core.
A5:43:55 <Magnulus> It can be, Siiseli, if you want to make sure all the components work well together.
A5:44:00 <Xeros> hey I can find all those things in the trash... moniter keyboard mouse and sound! those aren't too picky
A5:44:10 <liq3> Xeros: :D
A5:44:12 <Siiseli> Magnulus, but it's still not
A5:44:13 <Siiseli> I've done it
A5:44:23 <liq3> Yeh, so have I.
A5:44:26 <liq3> I built my current Pc.
A5:44:34 <liq3> I mostly just picket out parts and made sure they worked together.
A5:44:41 <Xeros> Building a PC sounds interesting to me though... I'm into "salvaging".
A5:45:01 <doohan> Why would you buy an alienware rig?
A5:45:01 <Xeros> in any degree... I'm not experienced at all but I'd like to learn
A5:45:02 <liq3> Xeros: The only real diff is the way we aquire parts. ;]
A5:45:08 <doohan> It's horrendously overpriced.
A5:45:12 <Magnulus> I always had bad luck when I bought computer components. Either that particular series of RAM doesn't like the make of the Graphics card, or the CPU would rather I used a different motherboard.
A5:45:15 <liq3> Xeros: Building a pc is easy as piss. It's like legos. :D
A5:45:16 <Xeros> Well unless I find a better computer than alienware thenn
A5:45:28 <Xeros> is it like minecraft xO
A5:45:35 <liq3> lol not that simple! :P
A5:45:38 <Magnulus> I guess I just wasn't cut out for doing that sort of thing.
A5:45:40 <Xeros> ahahah
A5:45:44 <liq3> It's mainly like...
A5:46:13 <Magnulus> Which is why it's nice to have a machine that was built to work extremely well with a very limited range of hardware.
A5:46:17 <Magnulus> Like my mac.
A5:46:29 <Xeros> Speaking of a computer "rather" not having that motherboard.. I'd like to use the intelligence to have my computer be able to talk to me of course
A5:46:30 <Magnulus> Sure, I can't upgrade it, but I really don't have to as much.
A5:46:37 <Xeros> lol
A5:46:43 <liq3> Screw in mobo into case, then PSU into case, then plug in PSU into mobo. Then put CPU, HDDs, CD ROM drives, floppy (maybe), RAM, Vcard, sound card (maybe) networkcard (maybe) into mobo. 
A5:46:46 <liq3> That's about it.

A5:46:55 <Xeros> I've always loved chatbots like Alice but those are pre-programmed messages... Alice is the best though
A5:47:20 <liq3> Magnulus: You can't upgrade it? dear god...
A5:47:20 <liq3> >.>
A5:47:23 <Xeros> I'm gonna have Alice help us out
A5:47:25 <Magnulus> What I mean is that sometimes, even though parts are technically compatible, they don't work as well together as they would have with others.
A5:47:38 <doohan> dr sbaitso was the best
A5:47:42 <Magnulus> I would have spent about a full computer's worth of money on upgrades by now anyway.
A5:47:57 <doohan> But there's no justification for alienware
A5:47:58 <liq3> Magnulus: Yes, must ave that extra 1/100th of a frame! -_-
A5:48:07 <doohan> You're paying thousands for a case.
A5:48:18 <Bobobobo> i paid 400 for a case
A5:48:21 <liq3> Doohan: Macs are just as bad.
A5:48:22 <Magnulus> Actually, my graphics card tended to crash my machine because it didn't like my RAM.
A5:48:28 <doohan> I agree liq3 
A5:48:33 <liq3> Their laptops are basically the same specs as my Desktop, but cost 4x as much.
A5:48:33 <Bobobobo> and its not as good as my old case that i found on the side of the road
A5:48:33 <doohan> But they're underpowered cases
A5:48:50 <Magnulus> So it's not just that I get a couple extra frames per second, liq3.
A5:48:57 <Magnulus> Anyway, I have to get going.
A5:49:04 <liq3> Magnulus: That's completely different to what you were saying. :P
A5:49:07 <Xeros> Human: Hello Alice ALICE: Hi there! Human: Do you play games? ALICE: We are playing a game right now.
A5:49:19 <Magnulus> It's not, liq3.
A5:49:28 <liq3> Yes, you said "work well together".
A5:49:34 <liq3> i assume by that they already have no problems like crashing.
A5:49:40 <Xeros> Human: Have you met liq3? ALICE: That information is confidential. Human: Why is it confidential? ALICE: Why do I exist? Human: I don't know. ALICE: It was a rhetorical question.
A5:49:43 <liq3> and that you are now only going for extra performance.
A5:49:49 <doohan> work well means stable to me
A5:50:02 <doohan> It's entirely subjective liq3 
A5:50:05 <liq3> doohan: stable for me means "work". :P
A5:50:10 <doohan> I mean I had a machine that worked, but not in the cold.e
A5:50:21 <doohan> But once it had heated up it was stable
A5:50:23 <liq3> i'd probably call that "works, mostly."
A5:50:33 <Xeros> Human: What is your CPU? ALICE: You can run me on almost any computer. At present I am running on an Lisp. Human: I heard about Lisp! ALICE: That is a cool site. Human: Lisp is a site? ALICE: When is Lisp not a site? Human: What? ALICE: No big deal.
A5:50:50 <liq3> anyway.

A9:38:22 <citricsquid> zagabar: long story, but basically.
A9:38:23 <ChJees> Obviously
A9:38:39 <Peerko> it's a story of about 3 weeks?
A9:38:39 <zagabar> Cause I have a server computer. Dunno if it is possible for me to host it? At least temporarily?

A11:23:24 <LG_Legacy> Minecraft Down? 'FUUUUUUUUUUU' Internet Down? 'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU' Notch not on? 'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU'
A11:23:30 <Dilt> hey notch
A11:23:35 <Dilt> it's time for your weekly dilt report
A11:23:36 <tyteen4a03> -_-
A11:23:41 <08Notch> =D
A11:23:42 <citricsquid> Notch: but it's monday! get out, you're not allowed here on mondays! :O:O:O
A11:23:44 <Dilt> it's a thumbs up this week though
A11:23:47 <tyteen4a03> lol
A11:23:48 <Dilt> i see no issues with your latest updates
A11:23:55 <Dilt> though i have a sudden urge to want to make bacon
A11:23:57 <08Notch> haha
A11:24:00 <Nalok> Needs moar blog update
A11:24:02 <Nalok> :D
A11:24:03 <Dilt> speaking of, needs moar fire
A11:24:06 <08Notch> i know, nalok. =)
A11:24:10 <ChJees> Needs moar stairs
A11:24:14 <Dilt> wait, we have magma
A11:24:15 <Dilt> i'm good.
A11:24:17 <08Notch> I was going to do a vid this weekend, but then wolfenstein and dinner happened, hehe
A11:24:23 <Nalok> You know about the archives right?
A11:24:23 <Miclee> Oh, Notch! I had questions but I forgot them, now.
A11:24:28 <LG_Legacy> CitricSquid, you should probably put that in the motd so people shut up.
A11:24:33 <08Notch> what about the archives?
10A11:24:37 * Minotour (Minotour13@adsl-75-25-13-176.dsl.irvnca.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A11:24:44 <Nalok> You should team up with the creator
A11:24:44 <LG_Legacy> The Archives bore me.
A11:24:49 <Minotour> Notch, out of curiosity, will there be weapons in the minecraft zombie mode?
A11:24:56 <Dilt> Minotour: i can answer that
A11:24:56 <08Notch> yes, but no guns
A11:24:57 <Dilt> 'yes'
A11:25:01 <Minotour> :O
A11:25:04 <Minotour> What kinds?
A11:25:07 <Dilt> if there aren't any, then i'm pretty sure there'll be some modded in
A11:25:11 <08Notch> Nalok: I'm not teaming up with anyone. :D
A11:25:15 <08Notch> too much politics
A11:25:17 <Dilt> but i know notch way too well for this
A11:25:24 <Dilt> there will be weapons and they will be loved
A11:25:26 <Minotour> lol Notch
A11:25:26 <Nalok> But he has dynamite.
A11:25:35 <08Notch> that's great =D
A11:25:36 <Nalok> And finite water.
A11:25:36 <Minotour> :o
A11:25:38 <08Notch> modding = cooling
A11:25:51 <tyteen4a03> Minecraft = roblox+?
A11:25:53 <Nalok> And tree spawning.
A11:25:57 <Dilt> tyteen4a03: don't even go there
A11:26:01 <Minotour> Notch, if I was rich, I'd donate like $10000 to you 8D
A11:26:05 <08Notch> omg =D
A11:26:05 <Dilt> minecraft has no correlation to roblox or blockland
A11:26:12 <Dilt> if anything it's most related to infintiminer
A11:26:14 <Minotour> Notch, seriously though
A11:26:16 <08Notch> survival mode has tree spawning as well now =D
A11:26:18 <Minotour> if I hit the jackpot some day
A11:26:20 <Dilt> YES
A11:26:24 <Dilt> notch i wanted you to add that
A11:26:25 <Minotour> I'll donate like $1000 to you
A11:26:26 <08Notch> plant a bush in sunlight, wait a long time, and POP, it's a tree
A11:26:31 <Peerko> if I was rich, then somebody probably donated $100000 to me
A11:26:34 <Dilt> you gained a gold dilt star
A11:26:35 <Miclee> Okay... Okay... Question: Notch, when will we get movable doors?
A11:26:36 <tyteen4a03> lol
A11:26:38 <Minotour> Notch
A11:26:39 <Nalok> Citric, make forums happen, Notch, make videos happen :D
A11:26:40 <Dilt> for getting a dilt-feature before he even suggested it
A11:26:43 <ChJees> Notch, will trees be considered as a "island" of blocks :P?
A11:26:46 <ChJees> With that
A11:26:48 <08Notch> Miclee: No, but maybe in the expansions
A11:26:48 <tyteen4a03> LOL
A11:26:49 <Minotour> I think a better idea would be make a wooden block under the dirt and a tree grows
A11:26:52 <Magnulus> I love how you knocked it down to a tenth within a minute, Minotour. ^_^
A11:26:53 <Minotour> because people build with bushes
A11:27:00 <08Notch> "island" of blocks?
A11:27:03 <Dilt> Minotour: actually, uhh
A11:27:08 <Dilt> i don't like that idea because i don't want trees
A11:27:11 <Dilt> randomly growing out of my fort
A11:27:11 <Minotour> lol
A11:27:14 <ChJees> Cut the trunk and all will fall down a level :P
A11:27:14 <Dilt> because i put dirt as a roof
A11:27:19 <Minotour> oh
A11:27:25 <08Notch> ChJees: I'm not sure!
A11:27:25 <Nalok> Or place a shrub below the dirt
A11:27:26 <Minotour> well then i think either way we're screwed D:
A11:27:29 <tyteen4a03> I wanna turn on wonderserer but the wire in Taiwai broke so users in America wont connect normally :(
A11:27:33 <Marach|semiafk> will we be able to make levels in sandbox then use them in survival?
10A11:27:38 * Marach|semiafk is now known as Marach
A11:27:42 <Nalok> Also mushrooms should be able to last underground'
A11:27:43 <08Notch> when I started the game, I definitely wanted floating islands of stuff to fall down
12A11:27:47 * C418 (C418@p5B3D5D63.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A11:27:48 <Dilt> Marach: maybe, i think that's an intended feature
A11:27:53 <08Notch> but as I played the game, I started to like the floating
A11:27:59 <Dilt> i'm OK with the floating
A11:28:00 <Minotour> same
A11:28:05 <Magnulus> It can be cool, used right.
A11:28:05 <Dilt> some things like trees? i actually uh
A11:28:09 <Dilt> sorta laugh at the floating tree tops
A11:28:14 <ChJees> Me too :P
A11:28:14 <LG_Legacy> Oh, Notch. Why is everything invurn to lava? Like plants and hedges? :<
A11:28:17 <tyteen4a03> treehouse LOL
A11:28:24 <Dilt> LG_Legacy: because DEATH is JUST being coded
A11:28:25 <Evil-Ville> I think stuff falling down would be a cool option though
A11:28:27 <08Notch> LG_Legacy: Because I havne't made them burninate yet
A11:28:33 <Minotour> stuff DOES fall down
A11:28:34 <Peerko> burn!
A11:28:35 <Peerko> yes!
A11:28:38 <Marach> did you consider improving the map generator?
A11:28:38 <Minotour> make that weird sand stuff and it falls
A11:28:43 <Evil-Ville> Yes sand and gravel

A11:28:49 <Minotour> 8D
A11:28:52 <tyteen4a03> Does MC use any physics engine?
A11:28:57 <Minotour> i dont think it would
A11:29:00 <Marach> currently the only setting is map size...
A11:29:01 <Minotour> except for the obvious gravity physics
A11:29:04 <08Notch> not any third party one, no
A11:29:06 <Dilt> tyteen4a03: you just keep saying things that fail
A11:29:10 <08Notch> it has very simple AABB based physics
A11:29:12 <Minotour> what did you make MineCraft in?
A11:29:15 <08Notch> java
A11:29:16 <tyteen4a03> Kava
A11:29:18 <ChJees> :P

A11:29:22 <tyteen4a03> Kava WTF
A11:29:38 <Dilt> still
A11:29:41 <C418> around this time I usually have my daily router reset
A11:29:41 <ChJees> If i added another dimension to my AABB physics it would be 3D @_@
A11:29:44 <08Notch> hey C418 =)
A11:29:46 <Dilt> i'm back in school notch, i'm way too happy

A11:30:17 <Minotour> lol
A11:30:21 <Minotour> out of curiosity
A11:30:23 <ChJees> Custom materials would be awesome :3
A11:30:24 <Marach> there are 256 places in terrain.png
A11:30:32 <Minotour> I just typed the "Notch:" but how do you make it so it like auto-does it
A11:30:35 <tyteen4a03> custom coding?
A11:30:36 <Minotour> as if you're directed it towards them
A11:30:43 <Dilt> type 'not' then type tab

A11:31:29 <Minotour> Notch: Bye
A11:31:32 <citricsquid> Notch: before you go, quick question: What dev environment (right word? what program? do you use?) Someone wanted to know yesterday!

A11:31:54 <08Notch> Magnulus: It's outside the scope of the game I'm trying to make
A11:31:58 <Magnulus> All right.
A11:32:04 <Dilt> OH RIGHT
A11:32:06 <08Notch> i think it's a technically interesting idea, though. =)

P1:25:55 <BoirG> ok srry was afk
P1:27:09 <BoirG> ok. if i could get permission from the crappycomic owner to up the minecraft client without the minecraft.jar file, with a readme in its place, detailing where to get said file, would you allow people to use it?
P1:27:22 <BoirG> just like wom
P1:29:21 <BoirG> ok, nvm
P1:29:28 <Snowman> Then it would basically just be a hack pack?
P1:29:29 <citricsquid> BoirG: If you distribute anything Notch made, you're breaking the terms.
P1:29:34 <08Notch> as long as you don't distribute the client or a modified version of the client, yes
P1:29:57 <BoirG> i emailed him last night about this. he re upped it WITHOUT the client but a downloader to check for updates. 
P1:30:21 <BoirG> officially it conforms to your standards notch
P1:31:20 <BoirG> you can download the client without fear of notches wrath, for it has been fixed i guess

P3:51:19 <Snowman> to die
P3:52:00 <vede> I hear that despite all the anti-dying people, 100% of all people eventually end up doing it anyway. Peer pressure, I think.

P4:57:07 <citricsquid> I agree, where are the squids?!?!??!
P4:57:14 <Xeros> Squids would work...
P4:57:38 <Griskard> Notch. The people! Your people! They demand squids!
P4:57:43 <Xeros> he should put tremors.. not little quakes but giant worms that sift through the ground.
P4:57:53 <Xeros> :D
P4:58:35 <Xeros> Or actually.. make random events... like... a meteor crash.... and...other stuff =/ lol

P5:03:55 <Xeros> but if you stay in a confined room within lava it will also damage(not as bad as being next to it though)....yeahhhh :p
P5:04:18 <Xeros> then we can make gasses... combustable..etc... fire maybe.
P5:07:40 <Xeros> sadly I can think of a few un-needed things that work the same way water and lava does(except staying on one level).. like making sound(invisible blocks of sound would expand, allowing NPC creatures to hear you and either run or attack)

P5:13:01 <Dudebro> What?

P6:07:20 <fleshBasedProcessor> Is the port that Minecraft uses 25565 or 25655?
P6:07:23 <triddin> they block minecraft specifically, or inadvertently?

P7:23:24 <Daidoji> squids would be great, but I wouldn't want to animate it
P7:23:26 <vede> Ooh, monsters that become resources upon death.
P7:23:30 <Nalok> Cows.
P7:23:33 <Nalok> We need dem
P7:23:34 <Griskard> Cows
P7:23:35 <vede> Or become lava or water!
P7:23:43 <08Notch> vede: Yes! That's make you want to hunt them! =D
P7:23:45 <Griskard> Dragon that becomes lava on death
P7:23:55 <Griskard> Oh shit its flying away1
P7:24:01 <Griskard> -shoots it-
P7:24:04 <Daidoji> guys guys, notch can just use everything from wurm. I don't think it counts ripping yourself off right.
P7:24:04 <Griskard> YAY! I got it!
P7:24:09 <vede> Fire elemental dies and turns into a block of lava.
P7:24:12 <Griskard> "You friggin moron! You flooded the map!"
P7:24:18 <vede> Or, yeah, damn, dragon that becomes lava.
P7:24:19 <Daidoji> I mean the animal types
P7:24:23 <vede> That'd be crazy.
P7:24:24 <Nalok> Maybe on Death dragon's heads explode
P7:24:26 <Daidoji> plus they were pretty common anyway
P7:24:26 <Nalok> :D
P7:24:28 <Eagle> Kill the unicorn and harvest it's very expensive horn
P7:24:34 <vede> Random monster type generator?
P7:24:36 <PuyoDead> I've put about 5 hours into professor layton already
P7:24:41 <Daidoji> the new one?
P7:24:43 <Griskard> Why? I already have an awesome horn...
P7:24:46 <PuyoDead> yea
P7:24:50 <08Notch> video is processing..
P7:25:05 <Griskard> Ready to Watch and orgasm guys?
P7:25:08 <Eagle> if you die, do you drop everything in your inventory?
P7:25:16 <08Notch> if you die, it's game over. =)
P7:25:20 <Eagle> Well
P7:25:22 <vede> What about MP?
P7:25:22 <Eagle> In multiplayer
P7:25:26 <Griskard> In multiplayer
P7:25:27 <Griskard> In
P7:25:28 <08Notch> quite possibly in mp as well. ;)
P7:25:31 <Griskard> ...
P7:25:31 <vede>  D:
P7:25:37 <vede> That's not good, Notch.
P7:25:39 <Eagle> Wait if one person dies it's gameover for the whole team?
P7:25:40 <Eagle> :OOO
P7:25:41 <vede> Just plain not good.
P7:25:49 <Nalok> Lets see, critters we need: Deer, Pigs, Bears, cows, fish, squid, turtles, foxes, birds, rats,,,

P7:25:56 <08Notch> it won't be THAT severe, Eagle.
P7:25:57 <Griskard> That would suck. As long as its "Optional" its ok
P7:26:05 <08Notch> but somehow, death should be horribly severe
P7:26:08 <Nalok> Maybe your character can be revived
P7:26:17 <Eagle> I mean if one person dies, can the rest of the team scavenge your dead body's belongings?
P7:26:20 <Griskard> Lose ALL your blocks, and something or other...
P7:26:27 <08Notch> oh, yes, Eagle, that's the plan
P7:26:28 <Daroh> a simple lose all items, temp only have half health and respawn at the start sounds fair?
P7:26:30 <Snowman> Hehe, would be cool if this was in the game. :/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VefS9oOqJc&feature=related
P7:26:53 <Eagle> Could you like sacrifice a cow or something to bring you back?
P7:27:00 <Griskard> I clicked that thinking it was notch
P7:27:00 <Eagle> *bring a person back?
P7:27:04 <Griskard> DAMN YOU SNOWMAN
P7:27:09 <08Notch> something like that could work, eagle
P7:27:11 <Snowman> ?
P7:27:19 <Griskard> Im waiting for notch to link his vid
P7:27:20 <Eagle> Well maybe more than just a cow
P7:27:20 <Nalok> "Oh shit, <Name> is down!" "...I CALL HIS SWORD!" "I got the bow!" "I get the enchanted armor!"
P7:27:25 <Snowman> lol
P7:27:37 <Snowman> Just watch that vid, it's awesome
P7:27:40 <08Notch> perma death in mp until your friends ressurect you could definitely work
P7:27:42 <Nalok> Oh yeah, we need elephants, and hippos
P7:27:46 <Eagle> If you die can you at least spectate?
P7:27:51 <08Notch> yes, eagle
P7:27:53 <Eagle> :D
P7:28:01 <Nalok> Maybe you could have horse riding?
P7:28:08 <vede> Insane animal sacrifice for revival.
P7:28:19 <vede> Ooh!
P7:28:21 <Daroh> and you say you want this game E rating :P
P7:28:32 <Nalok> If you find a horse out in the map you can mount it by pressing the Use key.
P7:28:40 <08Notch> it's not sacrifice, it's animal cuddling! (with a knife)
P7:28:44 <vede> Assuming that there's enemies that are still really hard to kill, but not insane like dragons, you could make it so those monsters drop ressurection crystals.
P7:28:55 <vede> (Or something.)
P7:28:59 <08Notch> that could work
P7:29:19 <Eagle> You should make an enemy that makes people think: An angel or something. It doesn't try to attack you, it's rare, but if you kill it, it has enchanted swords and stuff. However you get incredibly bad luck for doing so.
P7:29:19 <Nalok> Oh yeah, and they could also be used for storage
P7:29:19 <Daroh> petting animals using sharp objects, that might get round a few rating issues...
P7:29:20 <vede> And when someone dies, you have to use a ressurection crystal, which you either already had, or obtained somehow.
P7:29:21 <08Notch> if ultra hard isn't fun to play, I'll nerf it
P7:29:31 <08Notch> but my goal is to make the game really difficult

P7:29:59 <ZomBuster> yeh hard is cool
P7:30:02 <Eagle> Will you sell it through Steam?
P7:30:05 <ZomBuster> cus we're HARDCORE
P7:30:13 <ZomBuster> *flex gamer muscles*
P7:30:27 <08Notch> Eagle: I'd love to. I don't think they accept java games, though
P7:30:32 <Eagle> Oh right.
P7:30:34 <Nalok> Maybe if you dig to the bottom of the map you get eaten by an eldritch abomination :D
P7:30:40 <vede> I don't like it when developers force people to either have shit-tons of skill, or not play the game.
P7:30:44 <Snowman> If it's good enough, they'll accept anything :D
P7:30:47 <Eagle> A giant thing with forty faces
P7:30:55 <Eagle> Seventeen thumbs
P7:31:03 <BoirG> omg notch ur still here?
P7:31:04 <Nalok> and six eyebrows
P7:31:05 <Eagle> negative four mouths
P7:31:08 <BoirG> wut time is it there?
P7:31:14 <vede> I mean, if the game can be fun and not difficult at the same time, why restrict the game from those who don't want a really big challenge from playing?
P7:31:17 <Snowman> it's 2:30 for Notch :p
P7:31:22 <BoirG> omg
P7:31:40 <Eagle> It has less than 0 mouths
P7:31:40 <ZomBuster> vede they can play wii games if they dont want a challenge grrr
P7:31:43 <Eagle> it has anti mouths
P7:31:48 <Griskard> Notch, hows the video going?
P7:31:52 <vede> Zombuster, that was sarcastic, right?
P7:31:53 <08Notch> processing
P7:31:54 <Snowman> Agreed ZomBuster
P7:32:00 <Nalok> Maybe, in the distant future, you could choose the time period
P7:32:03 <ZomBuster> :P
P7:32:10 <Eagle> Build a time machine
P7:32:11 <Nalok> That'd be neat, but hard
P7:32:15 <Eagle> Go into the future
P7:32:19 <Eagle> kill a robot
P7:32:29 <Nalok> Like a boss
P7:32:32 <Eagle> Come back with it's advanced technology
P7:32:36 <Nalok> Like a boss
P7:32:36 <08Notch> vede: I think games like nethack, adom and dwarf fortress are good BECAUSE they don't let you play it on easy
P7:32:37 <Eagle> End up creating the robot that you  killed
P7:32:38 <ZomBuster> talking about time machine
P7:32:43 <Nalok> Like a boss
P7:32:59 <08Notch> i'm keeping creative mode for people who just want to mess around.
P7:33:00 <ZomBuster> I have 4d minecraft all worked out on paper lol
P7:33:04 <vede> Notch, I disagree on Dwarf Fortress, at least.
P7:33:04 <Nalok> So will there be food?
10P7:33:07 * Jesse (Jesse@206.168.41.254) has joined #minecraft
P7:33:08 <08Notch> People who want a game will get a gosh darned game
P7:33:13 <Eagle> ZomBuster: Time? O.o
P7:33:17 <08Notch> yes, nalok, it's the only way to regain health
P7:33:23 <vede> I disagree regarding DF simply because Minecraft is fun as it is.
P7:33:23 <BoirG> notch i have to say there should at least be hax allowed, like normal.
P7:33:28 <Nalok> The first time I played DF, I was lost
P7:33:33 <08Notch> BoirG: Oh, absolutely. =)
P7:33:39 <Daroh> oh, any plans on different environments? such as setting it to desert means very little water, less food etc, arctic would make water harmful over extended periods that kind of thing?
P7:33:42 <Nalok> Nothing made sense XD
P7:33:54 <08Notch> Daroh: You will probably be able to tweak map generation setting, yes
P7:34:08 <Eagle> How about fairy springs deep underground, I mean you already have the health system that resembles Legend of-COPYRIGHT PROTECTION CUTOFF
P7:34:13 <Griskard> notch i have to say there should at least be hax allowed, like normal.
P7:34:15 <vede> However, NetHack is probably fun because of its difficulty, but that's because without the difficulty, it's basically nothing.
P7:34:19 <Griskard> That sounds like ruination
P7:34:24 <Nalok> Desert map would be fun, maybe you could have flasks for water
P7:34:27 <Griskard> Survival with flyhack would be... easy?
P7:34:29 <vede> Minecraft, on the other hand, can still be fun without insane difficulty.
P7:34:35 <Nalok> YOU CANNOT GET YE FLASK
P7:34:41 <Snowman> Notch, how far is the uploading done?
P7:34:44 <vede> This has already been proven, I think, seeing how it's fun right now.
P7:34:47 <08Notch> Griskard: Yes, of course. =)
P7:35:04 <vede> So I think you should at least allow difficulty to be chosen.
P7:35:06 <08Notch> vede: I'm going to try making this difficult first. If it's not fun, I will fix it. =)
P7:35:18 <08Notch> that's quite likely, yes
P7:35:20 <Griskard> Erm. That was me copy/pasting Notch, not what I think, On my server hacks will be fof
P7:35:22 <Griskard> off
P7:35:25 <vede> Okay.
P7:35:37 <08Notch> but I'd like to start with the game I've got envisioned. =D
P7:35:38 <Eagle> I for one can't wait to try out "European Insane Mode"
P7:35:43 <Griskard> Because at least that way theres some CHALLENGE... Especially to high rise and bridge building
P7:35:44 <Nalok> "Guys my char is low on health, I need water" "Dude there's barely any left" "Yeah man, and there's nothing but desert" "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"
P7:35:50 <vede> I don't like when developers don't even let people play the game on a non-insane difficulty.
P7:36:05 <Nalok> I love making hilarious scenarios
P7:36:13 <08Notch> I'll try not to go crazy, vede. =)
P7:36:17 <08Notch> feel free to tell me when I mess up. =D
P7:36:18 <Snowman> Notch, how far is the video upload?
P7:36:18 <vede> Because they're just locking people out of an otherwise-fun games.
P7:36:21 <Eagle> I love living out hilarious scenarios
P7:36:23 <vede> *game
P7:36:27 <08Notch> Snowman: Done, youtube is processing it now
P7:36:41 <Griskard> Hey guys, try bridge building at 70 squares elevation, without flyhack
P7:36:43 <Griskard> Hehehe
P7:36:47 <08Notch> the first video, the one that broke, had a pretty fun moment
P7:36:52 <Griskard> With death
P7:36:53 <Snowman> oh
P7:36:59 <BoirG> wut is teh vid aboot?
P7:37:03 <ZomBuster> cool idea griskard
P7:37:03 <Nalok> "LFG RED DRAGON, LFG" "D0od, I soloed t3h dr@g0n w1th H@X" "Oh god damnit"
P7:37:04 <Eagle> Notch: What?
P7:37:05 <08Notch> I was digging around in a mine, and I mined up. A skeleton fell down, and I was already low on health
13P7:37:06 * Snowman keeps refreshing Notch's youtube page
P7:37:07 <vede> Griskard, done it.
P7:37:08 <Griskard> <Notch>	[#minecraft] Griskard: Yes, of course. =)
P7:37:10 <ZomBuster> a survival map with floating islands
P7:37:16 <Nalok> lol
P7:37:18 <08Notch> to it started chasing me around the cave until I managed to wall it off
P7:37:18 <vede> Oh, with death...
P7:37:21 <vede> Not done that...
P7:37:34 <08Notch> but it attacked me over the low wall, and I tried to mine out some stairs to get away
P7:37:37 <Eagle> Why do the skeletons want to kill you anyways
P7:37:43 <ZomBuster> haha
P7:37:48 <Snowman> BRAINSSSSSSS
P7:37:48 <Nalok> Because they're DEAAAAAAAADDDDDD
P7:37:52 <ZomBuster> they want your flesh
P7:37:53 <vede> Eagle, is that a question that seriously needs asked?
P7:37:54 <08Notch> then I fell into an underground lake and swam around. You can only hold your breath for 15 seconds, then you start losing health
P7:38:02 <Nalok> And...
P7:38:04 <ZomBuster> they are sad because they do not have flesh :(
P7:38:04 <08Notch> I managed to swim to an air pocket, then swam even deeper
P7:38:04 <vede> They are not human, THUS, they want to eat people.
P7:38:05 <Nalok> You died
P7:38:09 <Nalok> :D
P7:38:10 <08Notch> no more air down there, and I drowned
P7:38:14 <BoirG> notch instead of making difficulty levels, why not make settings. you know "Mine Speed: 1-3" or "Health: 10-100"
P7:38:15 <Snowman> lol fail
P7:38:18 <Nalok> Epic fail!
P7:38:19 <08Notch> I was just trying to find some nice caves :D
P7:38:32 <ZomBuster> will there be undeground monsters too?
P7:38:36 <08Notch> I prefer difficulty settings to that, BoirG, as then you can compare to others
P7:38:36 <Snowman> So how many monsters are there atm?
P7:38:40 <Griskard> Rockslugs
P7:38:48 <08Notch> ZomBuster: There already is. But just the three mobs I've got so far
P7:38:50 <BoirG> or "lung Capacity: 100-1000"
P7:38:52 <ZomBuster> ah
P7:38:53 <Nalok> I can't wait two weeks for Survial! >:(
P7:38:53 <vede> How about the way System Shock did it?
P7:38:56 <08Notch> I think there's a swimming underground pig in the video
P7:38:57 <Griskard> Maybe difficulty levels, then "Custom" ?
P7:39:01 <ZomBuster> haha
P7:39:03 <BoirG> ah ok
P7:39:05 <Eagle> XD
P7:39:14 <BoirG> gris thats a nice idea
P7:39:18 <Eagle> Can pigs drown?
P7:39:20 <Nalok> Swimming underground pig? Win
P7:39:21 <vede> You can do "Combat difficulty" "Environment difficulty" or some crap.
P7:39:43 <08Notch> Eagle: No, not yet. The code is there for both drowning and falling damage on mobs, but they don't have health yet, and you can't attack them
P7:39:43 <Eagle> OR
P7:39:59 <Nalok> "Oink blub, Oink glub blub Oink"
P7:40:04 <08Notch> haha
P7:40:09 <Griskard> Hey theres an idea
P7:40:14 <Griskard> We could kill a dragon easy
P7:40:15 <Eagle> Will animals make noises?
P7:40:20 <BoirG> notch thatll be ready for september 1st right?
P7:40:20 <Griskard> Build a pit
P7:40:22 <Griskard> Fill with water
P7:40:23 <08Notch> yes, hopefully
P7:40:26 <BoirG> yay
P7:40:27 <vede> Lure the dragon into a cave and drown it?
P7:40:29 <Real> whoa what are you doing on so late on a sunday, Notch?
P7:40:31 <08Notch> BoirG: Attacking? yes, definitely

P7:40:43 <Nalok> Will critters have weight?
P7:40:48 <Real> monday, of course
P7:40:49 <08Notch> weight?
P7:40:52 <ZomBuster> I had this giant water trap
P7:40:55 <Eagle> Notch: By tomorrow you mean later today, right? :D
P7:40:56 <Real> typo ;)
P7:41:00 <vede> You'd have to make a somewhat complex underground cage system.
P7:41:01 <08Notch> sshhh Eagle. ;)

P7:41:05 <Eagle> :O
P7:41:07 <Griskard> Bye

P7:41:26 <Daidoji> while you're here
P7:41:30 <Snowman> Can monsters break blocks in survival?
P7:41:31 <Nalok> As in, if you put them over a chasm with only one line of blocks, would the blocks collapse depending on the weight of the dragon?
P7:41:31 <BoirG> so mobs can destroy too?
P7:41:40 <Dilt> did ya get my message notch-chief?
P7:41:42 <Daidoji> have you had any reports of a server creating a new server hash at random
P7:41:44 <Eagle> I think it'd be hilarious to see a dragon jumping around trying to get out of the water
P7:41:49 <08Notch> which message, Dilt?
P7:41:51 <Eagle> in fact
P7:41:52 <vede> Dragons without the ability to LITERALLY destroy cities are ghey.
P7:41:52 <Dilt> the PM
P7:41:57 <Nalok> ...Couldn't it just fly out?
P7:42:03 <Eagle> I think it'd be hilarious to see a pig jumping around
P7:42:04 <08Notch> no, dilt
P7:42:06 <Dilt> i was asking about if you released the source code to that uh
P7:42:07 <Daidoji> like my modem ip doesn't change at all, but somehow my server gets assigned a new hash link
P7:42:08 <vede> Nalok, you block the top of the cave.
P7:42:09 <ZomBuster> dragons should randomly shoot out 10 block long fireballs
P7:42:10 <Dilt> tower game you made awhile back
P7:42:10 <08Notch> mobs can't destroy blocks yet
P7:42:14 <ZomBuster> which destroy everything
P7:42:16 <BoirG> yeh notch: collapsing would be SWEET. if you had a certain armour amout or something you fell through blocks.
P7:42:32 <BoirG> that way you could also make safe areas in multi. 
P7:42:32 <Daidoji> so I have to reset the router entirely and then the server, otherwise people can't connect
P7:42:35 <vede> That would be freakin hilarious.
P7:42:42 <Eagle> Will we be able to get dogs? Dogs could help attack mobs
P7:42:44 <Daidoji> usually this happens after running the server for a few days
P7:42:53 <Eagle> And hunt
P7:42:53 <Nalok> And the color of the fire changes depending on the dragon's color
P7:42:55 <Eagle> hunting dogs

P7:45:17 <Snowman> wait, how do you put text on the signs?
P7:45:22 <Daidoji> notch is that a viewpoint model?
P7:45:27 <Dilt> i mean there are places it can be improved, of course, but it was a nice little game
P7:45:27 <Dilt> :D

P7:47:47 <vede> ...
P7:47:50 <BoirG> why do mobs spawn altogether?
P7:48:07 <Daidoji> like if a zombie/skeleton bites you, have an obnoxious and gratuitous amount of blood particles fly out
P7:48:07 <vede> Can't see it on Notch's YouTube account...
P7:48:09 <Daroh> do trees grow?
P7:48:10 <PuyoDead> so, considering this is survival, will there be some kind of timer? just to show how long you've gone
P7:48:12 <Nalok> So you will be able to throw blocks at movs?
P7:48:17 <Nalok> mobs*
P7:48:19 <Eagle> vede he linked to it here
P7:48:21 <Eagle> croll up

P7:53:26 <Snowman> or shrub, log, another log, leaves, more logs, more leaves etc.
P7:53:31 <Nalok> It could be from 0-5 hearts
P7:53:41 <Dilt> I sorta do too, Nalok
P7:53:44 <Dilt> even if it's just 1 damage
P7:53:51 <Dilt> (a single rock isn't going to kill someone)
P7:54:09 <Nalok> For example, if I threw a stone block at a zombie, it would possibly cause atleast 5 damage
P7:54:26 <Nalok> and said zombie has 10 hearts
P7:54:47 <Nalok> Throw a second block at the zombie and boom, dead undead

P7:56:57 <Daidoji> when the pig lands from a pigapult it turns into a ham
P7:57:10 <Daidoji> or maybe a shower of pork cutlets

P8:10:52 <ZomBuster> wait notch about the air pockets thing
P8:10:59 <PuyoDead> oh man, that looks so much better
P8:10:59 <ZomBuster> cant you just make your own air pockets
P8:11:05 <08Notch> you can, yes =)
P8:11:11 <Snowman> takes some time to mine em though
P8:11:12 <08Notch> But I like not doing so, it's very fun =D
P8:11:20 <ZomBuster> or maybe make digging really slow while swiiming
P8:11:27 <08Notch> yeah, ZomBuster, considering doing that
P8:12:09 <Dilt> yeah, i like slowing the digging
P8:12:13 <Dilt> it's better than having air be spent
P8:12:17 <Dilt> or having no change at all
P8:12:21 <Snowman> Notch, you cant get cobblestone or any stones from the non-original block pack?
P8:12:22 <Dilt> so you have to keep coming up for air
P8:12:33 <Dilt> and getting an 'air pocket' together is mandatory for cave digging
P8:12:35 <08Notch> Snowman: Not yet =)
P8:12:45 <Snowman> k

P8:14:17 <Nalok> I'm talking about the very first version of minecraft

P8:14:25 <Eagle> I rememeber when water was a new thing
P8:14:34 <ZomBuster> ha the bad old times

P8:15:34 <Eagle> Dilt it was totally a team vs team experience
P8:15:35 <ZomBuster> community games
P8:15:47 <ZomBuster> pass on a singleplayer map
P8:15:51 <Snowman> When griefers were not even mentioned
P8:15:58 <vede> Multiplayer tests were insane, usually full, and filled with giant penises, towers, and griefers.
P8:16:00 <Snowman> oh the community maps were awesome
P8:16:13 <Eagle> Remember the first multiplayer test
P8:16:18 <vede> Of course, I guess MP Minecraft is still basically like that.
P8:16:30 <Eagle> notch didn't even tell us it was multiplayer until we went into the server
P8:16:35 <vede> Except for the full part.
P8:16:36 <Nalok> Yeah, the first days of griefing
P8:16:44 <Eagle> We were just talking about something and notch gave us a link
P8:16:56 <Meizlizard> Notch, are we ever going to get gestures, like pointing, waving, sitting down, clapping?
P8:17:02 <Eagle> and we were all like "Notch this is just a mapWOAH IT'S MULTIPLAYER"
P8:17:09 <08Notch> I don't know. The models are a bit.. limited. :D
P8:17:30 <vede> Notch, actually, I think you should really try for some good non-verbal communication with them.
P8:17:38 <Eagle> ... Clapping without elbows
P8:17:40 <Eagle> ... XDDD
P8:17:41 <Meizlizard> Bah
P8:17:45 <Snowman> oooh found 3D glasses for just 2
P8:17:45 <Meizlizard> It'll be cool
P8:18:14 <Eagle> Red-Blue 3D doesn't work too well with colorblind people. )))):
P8:18:25 <vede> I think seeing them doing the gestures would add to the silly-ish nature of the game.
P8:18:34 <vede>  D:
P8:18:34 <Snowman> well im just a tiny bit colourblind, so it wont mind
P8:18:46 <ZomBuster> we def need a fart taunt tough
P8:18:51 <ZomBuster> pfffrrrtt
P8:18:53 <vede> Nah...
P8:18:59 <08Notch> vede: I think I like the gesture idea :D
P8:19:02 <Eagle> ZomBuster with the sound and everything
P8:19:08 <Eagle> prrrat
P8:19:09 <ZomBuster> I loved doing that in wurm
P8:19:19 <ZomBuster> "hey where are you I cant find you"
P8:19:26 <ZomBuster> "oh just follow the farting noises"
P8:19:51 <fydo> Notch: do we get to skin the pigs? lol pigskins
P8:20:11 <08Notch> no. :D
P8:20:12 <Meizlizard> Did vede also suggest gestures?
P8:20:20 <ZomBuster> poor piggie
P8:20:24 <Meizlizard> Like, earlier?
P8:20:28 <ZomBuster> what everyone wants to do with him
P8:20:28 <vede> I recommended them, after you suggested them, meizlizard.
P8:20:33 <Meizlizard> Ah cool
P8:20:38 <Meizlizard> Pointing!
P8:20:42 <ZomBuster> shoot him from a catapult, cook him, skin him
P8:20:46 <Meizlizard> No more "On the yellow block"
P8:20:48 <vede> Notch expressed doubt, and I was like, "NO WAY YOU GOTTA DO DEM"
P8:20:55 <Snowman> Notch, what food do we get from pigs? Steak? :D
P8:21:04 <Jesse> will we get to skin our armor?
P8:21:06 <Meizlizard> Hamsteaks!

P8:22:02 <Snowman> Eagle what was it?
P8:22:05 <ZomBuster> how you turn pig into chicken nuggets
P8:22:11 <Eagle> "Game over man, game over!"
P8:22:20 <Eagle> When he was dying in lava.
P8:22:21 <Snowman> lol
P8:22:38 <Snowman> Ugh I'll order one of those #d Glasses tomorrow
P8:22:41 <Snowman> 3D
P8:22:44 <PuyoDead> I love that movie
P8:22:51 <vede> You cut a pig into smaller pieces called BEEF, which is what you put on burgers.
P8:22:54 <fydo> ZomBuster: by skin the pig, I meant provide textures for it
P8:23:00 <ZomBuster> ph :P
P8:23:05 <vede> Or you cut those pieces into SMALLER pieces, which make chicken nuggets!
P8:23:12 <Snowman> of course you meant that eh?
P8:23:20 <fydo> hehe
P8:23:24 <Eagle> Chicken nuggets are not made out of beef
P8:23:25 <Eagle> O.o
P8:23:27 <Snowman> vede, chicken nuggets from a pig?
P8:23:31 <vede> YES
P8:23:32 <ZomBuster> and beef is not made out of pig
P8:23:38 <Eagle> I thought he said cow
P8:23:38 <ZomBuster> it shoudl be
P8:23:39 <Eagle> :P
P8:23:46 <fydo> turducken
P8:23:50 <vede> You guys realize I'm being sarcastic, yeah?
P8:23:51 <Eagle> Also chicken nuggests generally aren't made out of chicken either
P8:23:52 <Eagle> XD
P8:23:54 <ZomBuster> pig -> pig meat -> BACON
P8:24:07 <Eagle> Pig -> Football
P8:24:12 <Snowman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuts_of_pork#Cuts
P8:24:13 <vede> I figured on the internet, to properly communicate sarcasm, be as insane as possible.
P8:24:21 <Eagle> We should be able to make pigs into footballs
P8:24:28 <vede> I figured pigs becoming chicken nuggets was pretty far out there...

P11:07:17 <mail2345> people who think the minecraft server has ready avaiable epxloits
P11:07:39 <mail2345> the logic isn't sound, why attack a target of about 100 servers whith no prevoius knowlage
P11:10:09 <Siiseli> because someone's bored?
P11:10:22 <vede> Because... shit like that seriously happens?
P11:10:30 <mail2345> yes, but why attack minecraft

P11:10:34 <mail2345> it's a harder target
P11:10:41 <Siiseli> it's a challenge
P11:10:42 <mail2345> go hit some IIS servers
P11:10:42 <vede> So?
P11:10:45 <Siiseli> cures boredom
P11:10:57 <mail2345> much easier. anyway.
P11:11:19 <mail2345> if it was just for fun, it probably would not be released
P11:11:23 <mail2345> or used to damage
P11:11:39 <Siiseli> why not

P11:11:42 <vede> Like griefing.
P11:11:45 <Siiseli> what vede said
P11:11:49 <Siiseli> and releasing it is like
P11:11:51 <vede> You piss people off -> fun
P11:11:55 <mail2345> right, but you can do way more damage
P11:11:55 <Siiseli> "look, I'm fucking great."
P11:12:01 <mail2345> attacking bigger games/servers
P11:12:08 <Siiseli> but that's something people haven't done before
