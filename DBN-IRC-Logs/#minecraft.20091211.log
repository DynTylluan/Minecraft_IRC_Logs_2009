A8:46:17 <bildramer> and more hilarious games would be there
A8:46:20 <PuyoDead> It works fine in Firefox, and the plugin for Chrome is the latest release.

11A8:48:38 <DBN> i wonder if, since notch is messing with the servers again, he might consider making the read-only / access list servers

A11:47:53 <Roadcrosser> guys whatya think of http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Roadcrosser
A11:49:26 <Ceical> looks good, but the helmet seems more intricate than the body. Some body shading or such would look sweet.
A11:49:42 <Roadcrosser> ?
A11:49:48 <Roadcrosser> oh ok
A11:49:57 <Roadcrosser> im no good at that
A11:50:03 <Roadcrosser> whats intricate?
A11:50:18 <Ceical> lol well its shaded or looks shaded

A11:50:39 <Roadcrosser> it suppose to look mechanical
A11:50:53 <revenant> In general.
A11:50:56 <revenant> You need shading.
A11:51:02 <revenant> Highlights/shadows in general.
A11:51:25 <revenant> The body is nicely shaded on the sides (although simply
A11:51:33 <revenant> but the helmet should have a teeny bit I think
A11:52:04 <Roadcrosser> ?
A11:52:20 <Roadcrosser> im no good at shading
A11:52:22 <bildramer> teeny/tiny?
A11:52:27 <bildramer> :P
A11:52:30 <Ceical> Dark spots thrown around with lighter spots is what I would imagine shading being.
A11:52:47 <Ceical> But I lack patience and creativity, so my advice might not be the best.
A11:52:54 <Roadcrosser> and this is the first time im doing shading on the sides
A11:53:21 <Roadcrosser> does the helmet look a bit like hair?
A11:53:25 <Ceical> I'll already commend you on making your own.
A11:53:36 <Ceical> I thought helmet when I first looked at it.
A11:54:54 <Roadcrosser> ok
A11:55:00 <Roadcrosser> i shaded the glasses thingy
A11:55:07 <Roadcrosser> and a bit of the hands
A11:55:11 <Roadcrosser> whatya think?

A11:55:59 <Roadcrosser> personnaly i think the glasses thingy is quite good
A11:56:07 <Ceical> I liked the hands without the shading.
A11:56:13 <Roadcrosser> meh thought so
A11:56:14 <Ceical> I like the visor.
A11:56:17 <Roadcrosser> ill remove it
A11:56:38 <Ceical> It gives a sci-fi feel to it.
A11:56:40 <Roadcrosser> hands unshaded

P12:59:20 <Jat> i forgot about that
P12:59:23 <Magnulus> It occurs to me that a halved resolution for Minecraft would work quite well. How much it would do to conserve CPU power, I don't know..
P12:59:36 <Jat> try using wom and resizing the window

P2:51:19 <gdude2002> mail don't be  fool

P2:51:29 <gdude2002> also mail rev wants you #archives

P2:51:34 <Drakkar> anyone in here speak chinese of some sort?
P2:51:34 <Jat> hes not trolling :|
P2:51:37 <Evilgrim> Hmm.. This may be elitist of me.. But I REALLY hate all those new people going "Can I haz premium" >_< They'll get it then move on to another game. I can tell. And as such they'll have wasted a premium that could have went to a decent person.. 
P2:51:38 <Animator> You're off my Christmas list.
P2:51:46 <Darkebrz> Whether something is or is not free is not an opinion, it is a FACT
P2:51:53 <clone1018> Dude
P2:51:54 <Darkebrz> Evilgrim, same here.
P2:51:58 <clone1018> It is free and premium
P2:52:11 <Darkebrz> PART of it is free.
P2:52:13 <clone1018> I am about to play minecraft right now
P2:52:15 <clone1018> For free
P2:52:16 <Darkebrz> You cant see the whole of Minecraft is free.
P2:52:20 <Arcanus> hi
P2:52:22 <Quatroking> Anyone here with at least 200 forum posts that doesn't have premium

P2:53:18 <Darkebrz> Also people that use /ignore because they lost an argument are failure.
P2:53:18 <Iscalar> Haha
P2:53:21 <Iscalar> nice skin jat ^-^
P2:53:21 <Evilgrim> Minecraft creative will always be free.
P2:53:23 <Evilgrim> I thought..
P2:53:24 <Jat> thanks

P2:53:31 <clone1018> C:\Users\clone1018\Documents\Downloads\minecraft-server (2)
P2:53:31 <mail2345> there is one legit use of /ignroe in an argument
P2:53:31 <clone1018> :D
P2:53:32 <mail2345> it is
P2:53:41 <mail2345> when the other person is ignoring your counter aguments
P2:53:45 <mail2345> and repeating the same argument
P2:53:46 <mail2345> over
P2:53:47 <mail2345> and

P2:53:49 <Darkebrz> mail2345, yes.
P2:53:51 <mail2345> over
P2:53:53 <mail2345> ya
P2:53:56 <SMP> -_-
P2:53:57 <mail2345> like that minimanz idiot
P2:53:58 <serp> or uses newline instead of space
P2:53:58 <Iscalar> Hello SMP
P2:54:00 <Darkebrz> But not if its a debate over a fact.
P2:54:04 <Arcanus> Can someone give me free premium account? ;3
P2:54:07 <Darkebrz> Then using /ignore is just a dumb idea
P2:54:09 <LG_Legacy> Oh huh it's Notch
P2:54:20 <mail2345> the part that sucked was that all the active pro-hack people
P2:54:22 <Darkebrz> Arcanus, why should we give it to you?
P2:54:29 <mail2345> actually thought i was being immature for ignorining minimanz
P2:54:36 <Arcanus> I'm only asking ;3
P2:54:40 <mail2345> when minimanz was ignoring every single counter argument thrown at him
P2:54:40 <clone1018> Oh yay
P2:54:45 <clone1018> Someone gave me minecraft
P2:54:46 <Evilgrim> Arcanus, this may be me being a bitch but you have < 5 forum posts. As such you're a stranger to just about EVERYONE in this IRC.. And well.. I doubt you'll stay for long after you get it.
P2:54:47 <mail2345> and repeating the same arguments over and over again
P2:54:51 <clone1018> Thanks whoever it was
P2:54:51 <Darkebrz> No, I want to know why. This cost me $10, Ill give it to you if you have a good reason.
13P2:54:57 * mail2345 bitches about minimanz
P2:55:03 <mail2345> actually
P2:55:07 <mail2345> in retrospect
P2:55:12 <mail2345> he's probably a troll
P2:55:14 <Arcanus> because I'm poor
P2:55:21 <mail2345> and the other pro-hack people who jumped in havn't been seen in irc
P2:55:22 <mail2345> okay
P2:55:24 <Darkebrz> Thats not a reason. Any proof of your longevity?
P2:55:25 <clone1018> Me mail2345?

P3:02:51 <Animator> I already have it.
P3:02:52 <Jat> i have no friends to use it with ;_;
P3:02:53 <Evilgrim> Never used it.
P3:02:57 <Evilgrim> I've SEEN it as well. :D
P3:02:59 <Snowman> Same Jat
P3:03:07 <Iscalar> I have a account with some invite keys
P3:03:08 <Darkebrz> oh, I got my invintation
P3:03:39 <Animator> With approximately 3,000 people with premium, a couple people complaining about it won't help your cause of elitism.
P3:03:48 <Snowman> btw Ashleigh, darn you
P3:03:57 <Darkebrz> AGGH
P3:04:01 <clone1018> Anyone want an invite I have 33
P3:04:07 <Jat> actually i dont even know much about google wave aside from the fact that its supposed to be some sort of super real time collaborative thing
P3:04:10 <Darkebrz> Do I need to watch the hour long video of google wave?
P3:04:41 <Jat> is it possible to set up a minecraft... thing... in google wave?
P3:04:49 <clone1018> no
P3:04:52 <Animator> And if anything, it should finally put down the belief that those with premium aren't griefers.
P3:05:06 <Darkebrz> Animator, thats a good thing?
P3:05:11 <Animator> Kinda.
P3:05:20 <Darkebrz> And notch takes suggestions from users all the time
P3:05:30 <Iscalar> it is yes
P3:05:30 <Iscalar> but
P3:05:33 <Iscalar> youd need some friends
P3:05:36 <Animator> I do still see it's negative benefits.
P3:05:39 <Iscalar> or a way to join a community group which i dont know how to do yet
P3:05:45 <mail2345> you know
P3:05:48 <Evilgrim> I agree there Animator. >_>
P3:05:48 <Darkebrz> There is no positive benefits!

P3:05:52 <mail2345> lets make a message
P3:05:59 <mail2345> do not give your gift randomly
P3:06:07 <mail2345> please do background checks
P3:06:10 <Animator> You can't say that, Dark, because then you'd be viewing the argument idiotically.
P3:06:23 <Evilgrim> There are a FEW. My friends get more active. But.. That's it. >_> People gifting randomly and people begging are the downsides.

P7:13:19 <EmpiresBane> I think I'm going to need to get some help with this. It's so simple, but it's not working.
P7:13:35 <copyboy> *sigh*
P7:15:45 <JTE> *mew* :3
P7:15:48 <EmpiresBane> using a while statement means that it won't execute the code if the condition is false, right
P7:16:06 <JTE> Consider it a looping if statement.
P7:16:06 <serp> that is the meaning of while, yes
P7:16:25 <JTE> It'll KEEP doing it until it is FALSE. :x
P7:16:37 <EmpiresBane> that's what i thought, that means the problem is somewhere else
P7:16:59 <serp> there is an ancient debugging technique called "printf debugging"
P7:17:07 <EmpiresBane> what?
P7:17:10 <JTE> Wisdom in printf debugging.
P7:17:29 <serp> just add a lot of prints in your code and you can see how the code flows
P7:18:11 <serp> while (stuff) { printf("here we go!!!\n"); stuffstuff(); }

P7:19:10 <EmpiresBane> the problem isn't too many loops
P7:19:20 <ZomBuster> I always use std::cout lol
P7:19:24 <serp> EmpiresBane: well then you could yourself answer that question
P7:19:27 <serp> about whiles
P7:19:31 <serp> by just trying it out
P7:20:04 <JTE> cout is stupid. It doesn't even exist in C.
P7:20:05 <EmpiresBane> i knew that, that was it did. I just wasn't sure if i was going insane.
P7:20:18 <serp> EmpiresBane: ok then your question was justified :)
11P7:20:32 <DBN> jte: cout doesn't work without OO
P7:20:40 <JTE> OO is stupid. I do not use it.
11P7:20:44 <DBN> lol
11P7:20:52 <DBN> good luck with that
P7:20:57 <EmpiresBane> object-oriented?
11P7:21:02 <DBN> ja
P7:21:04 <ZomBuster> like uh c++
P7:21:32 <EmpiresBane> i don't like structured. OO is easier for me
P7:21:51 <serp> i like structure in my code
P7:21:56 <serp> otherwise it gets messy
11P7:22:06 <DBN> i use whatever is appropriate
P7:22:06 <JTE> I am functional AND structured. =^^=
P7:22:26 <EmpiresBane> isn't structured what the other type is called?
P7:22:44 <serp> imperative programming perhaps
P7:22:50 <JTE> I think you mean sequential?

P7:32:55 <EmpiresBane> why do i fail to make this work? It's so simple.
P7:33:10 <JTE> O_o;
P7:33:11 <Annihilator> is this some cave story things
P7:33:13 <serp> JTE: so anyway... when you write old tech and small things, there is no need to new fancy paradigms... it's when you get into the industry they are needed
P7:33:14 <EmpiresBane> it's supposed to switch the current weapon
P7:33:28 <EmpiresBane> no, it's for my game
P7:33:54 <EmpiresBane> there's an array 0-2 which stores the weapons
P7:34:20 <JTE> Oh it's not that I don't know them or anything, it's just that I hate not having the code right there. I like to put all the graphics code in the graphics code file (for the appropriate rendering engine) and all of the sound code in the sound code file, etc.
P7:34:20 <TestDummy> So, how's #minecraft today?
P7:34:23 <EmpiresBane> obviuosly max_weapon = 2
P7:34:35 <serp> why do you start off by increasing player_hasweapon?
P7:34:58 <serp> JTE: that's sound, but you can't do that when your graphics code is 100k lines
P7:35:04 <EmpiresBane> what else would i do?
P7:35:23 <serp> you're later treating player_hasweapon as an array
P7:35:24 <JTE> Split off effects into gfx_motionblur, etc. helps. o.o
P7:35:35 <JTE> but yeah, I guess. :<

P7:36:39 <serp> enter oo
P7:37:39 <EmpiresBane> didn't change a damn thing
P7:38:27 <serp> EmpiresBane: so when will you exit the loop if all player_hasweapon[..] are false?
P7:38:34 <EmpiresBane> player_hasweapon[0]=true [1]=true and [2]=false
P7:38:41 <JTE> nevar, apparently.
P7:38:43 <serp> aha
P7:38:46 <EmpiresBane> er... didn't check for that
P7:39:21 <EmpiresBane> but the problem is, it stays at player_weapon stays at 1
P7:39:36 <JTE> ./..
P7:39:37 <JTE> wait wait
P7:39:41 <EmpiresBane> forget the 1st "it stays at"
P7:39:44 <JTE> Why are you increasing player_hasweapon if it's an array?
P7:40:00 <EmpiresBane> that was a typo, i fixed tht
P7:40:02 <serp> EmpiresBane: the first >= should probably be >
P7:40:34 <serp> o wait nm
P7:40:40 <JTE> nya, okay... it stays at one because player_hasweapon[1] == true
P7:40:41 <JTE> duh.
P7:40:57 <JTE> because 0 = true, 1 = true, 2 = false.
P7:41:16 <serp> but the next run player_weapon would reset to 0
P7:41:17 <JTE> player_hasweapon[1] == true, so player_hasweapon[1]!=true evaluates to FALSE, so it never enters the loop.
P7:41:17 <Snowman> <JTE> because 0 = true, 1 = true, 2 = false.
P7:41:19 <Snowman> Doesn't get
P7:41:26 <Snowman> But it's probably just me
P7:42:08 <JTE> and the next time it increases by one and then enters the loop, and comes out of the loop with weapon = 0

P7:46:05 <JTE> It stays at one because it never increases past one.
P7:46:15 <EmpiresBane> what? how?
P7:46:17 <serp> there is an initial increase of it
P7:46:17 <JTE> :/ You has your logic backwards so it never enters the loop.
P7:46:37 <JTE> It will always stop when it finds a weapon you do has.
P7:46:55 <JTE> rather than one you don't.
P7:47:04 <EmpiresBane> but it's supposed to increase before it checks
P7:47:07 <serp> but the next time he calls the function it will increase by one and then do the loop
P7:47:18 <JTE> It increases before it checks and that's why it stays at one.
P7:47:36 <JTE> It checks, sees that you has that (it IS true) and then stops there. :3
P7:47:58 <EmpiresBane> I tried removing the first increase but then nothing happened
P7:48:06 <JTE> Yeah because 0 is true too.
P7:48:07 <JTE> >.>
P7:48:25 <serp> it enters with value = 1. then it increases by 1 to make value = 2. then it checks value >= 2 which makes it 0. then it enters the loop and exits immediately. value is still = 0
P7:48:26 <EmpiresBane> I also have one that goes the other way but it still ends up at 1
P7:48:29 <JTE> Just get rid of the "!=true" in your while.
P7:48:36 <JTE> >.>;

P7:51:01 <serp> it's supposed to go to 0
P7:51:04 <EmpiresBane> no
P7:51:16 <EmpiresBane> i want it to switch to a weapon i have
P7:51:27 <EmpiresBane> [2] is false meaning i don't have it
P7:51:28 <JTE> If you remove the initial increase it stays at 0, which also wasn't what you wanted, right?
P7:51:35 <serp> jesus
P7:51:38 <serp> how dense are you
P7:51:46 <EmpiresBane> i wanted to be able to switch between the weapons
P7:52:03 <JTE> And staying at 1 wasn't good enough?
P7:52:17 <serp> the function is to switch between weapons
P7:52:21 <JTE> Oh, you mean you only call the function once, and that's why it didn't go?
P7:52:28 <JTE> That has nothing to do with the function itself. D:
P7:52:34 <serp> if he is at 1 and switches he obviously doesnt want it to stay at 1

P9:16:00 <MonkeyDKS> Wouldn't it be easier to just not be stupid so you don't get banned?
P9:16:53 <Animator> Now then. Time to play Captain Forever and get Cho Ren Sha out of my mind.

P10:21:02 <lmaoboat> Notch probably could have changed your name if you asked him
P10:21:16 <Annihilator> i should switch over to annihilator soon
P10:21:19 <Dwarfbeard> Yes, but this way I come off as an egotistical bastard.
P10:21:29 <Annihilator> ... maybe i should ask him
P10:21:32 <Dwarfbeard> Plus I don't want to bother Notch with something so trivial.
P10:21:45 <VurtualRuler98> Had I bought the game already, I'd gift Gordon Freeman.

P10:24:22 <vede> Hm. So Fox cancelled Dark Angel at season 2, leaving basically EVERY SINGLE PLOTLINE unclosed, to make room for... Firefly. Which it cancelled in the first season. Leaving basically EVERY SINGLE PLOTLINE unclosed.
P10:25:01 <SMP> also, dollhouse
P10:25:03 <Jat> fox is known for killing only the good shows
P10:25:06 <vede> Dammit, I almost want to send an email to Fox telling them how stupid they are.
P10:25:12 <Jat> family guy too but now family guy was brought back and it sucks terribly
P10:25:17 <Dwarfbeard> You would not be the first, Vede.
P10:25:26 <vede> But I'm certain a good number of other people have already informed them of that.
P10:25:27 <Jat> also futurama
P10:25:57 <Evilgrim> What?! You've not seen it yet. [ Or have you? ] You can't judge something you've not seen.
P10:25:58 <PuyoDead> Yea, Fox is amazingly bad about canceling the good stuff.
P10:26:07 <Jat> dollhouse was already cancelled?
P10:26:17 <Dwarfbeard> Firefly, short as it is
P10:26:25 <Dwarfbeard> is still the best show that has ever graced television.
P10:26:30 <PuyoDead> I myself loved The Tick... they canceled it before it even finished one season.
P10:26:38 <Jat> yeah the tick was good
P10:26:44 <Evilgrim> Courage the Cowardly dog.
P10:26:50 <Jat> courage was cartoon network
P10:26:55 <Jat> i thought the tick was wb
P10:26:57 <Evilgrim> It's still awesome.
P10:26:59 <Jat> also dark angel
P10:27:05 <PuyoDead> The cartoon, yea. The live show was Fox.
P10:27:16 <Jat> oh yeah
P10:27:18 <SMP> courage scared the shit out of me as a kid
P10:27:19 <Jat> now i kinda barely remember
P10:27:28 <Jat> courage was awesome
P10:27:31 <Evilgrim> Courage is and always will be win.
P10:27:38 <PuyoDead> The guy who does Joe Swanson's voice from Family Guy was the tick. It was perfect.
P10:27:38 <Annihilator> livestream is always maxed out in viewers huh
P10:27:41 <SMP> i couldn't stand it
P10:27:46 <Dwarfbeard> Courage was great.
P10:27:48 <Jat> haha
P10:27:50 <lmaoboat> King Raaaaamseeeees!
P10:27:55 <Dwarfbeard> Some episodes were stupid, but they more than made up for it.
P10:27:55 <PuyoDead> Courage was a damn fine show.
P10:27:56 <lmaoboat> The man in gauze!
P10:27:58 <Jat> freaky fred
P10:28:08 <Evilgrim> Holy! I just got into the stream! In your face! :P
P10:28:18 <SMP> the one where the aliens came down and stole heads fucked with me
P10:28:50 <Dwarfbeard> None of them fucked with me, ever. They were always just the most fascinating things in the world when I was little.
P10:28:56 <Dwarfbeard> And funny.
P10:28:59 <Dwarfbeard> Fookin hilarious.
P10:29:03 <vede> I would honestly be somewhat okay if James Cameron just wrote up a few paragraphs answering all the questions left over by the second season of Dark Angel. Just so I know what the hell happened.
P10:29:07 <PuyoDead> There was one episode done in a bunch of different animation styles (claymation, standard drawing, CG), and I've only seen it aired once.
P10:29:22 <Dwarfbeard> Also
P10:29:26 <Dwarfbeard> Concerning Firefly
P10:29:36 <Dwarfbeard> I cannot think of a better ending line than "Well... here I am".
P10:30:28 <vede> Now I'm going to go watch The 4400 to try to drown my sorrow.
P10:31:41 <Animator> I liked Courage.
P10:31:49 <Animator> They still air re-runs.

P10:42:21 <PuyoDead> He was talking about making those moss/vine cobblestones grow kind of like grass with other cobblestones... but I don't know where that went.
P10:42:29 <Jat> oh
P10:42:34 <Jat> that would be cool
P10:42:36 <Jat> kinda i guess
P10:42:37 <VurtualRuler98> Naw.
P10:42:43 <VurtualRuler98> It'd make it hard to make lightly ruined buildings.

P10:42:57 <Jat> things like growing grass and cobblestone moss growing are good in survival
P10:43:01 <Jat> but not in creative
P10:43:08 <VurtualRuler98> Actually, here's an idea.
P10:43:20 <VurtualRuler98> Vines can grow, but only occasionally.
P10:43:27 <VurtualRuler98> As like, plants.

P10:43:33 <VurtualRuler98> And in survival, plant mobs.
P10:43:49 <VurtualRuler98> So you'll have to de-vine your buildings at random to protect them.
P10:44:38 <VurtualRuler98> Then actual, later-game vine creatures. That'll dig under the dirt, and bury themselves. Then, they burrow under the rock, and spread through the rock to attack you.

P11:00:37 <Visiiri> Including a griefer mode >:D
P11:00:52 <MonkeyDKS> I have a hack that lets me play 4 different games and watch YouTube vids all at the same time
13P11:01:00 * Visiiri rants about it.
P11:01:08 <VurtualRuler98> I'll just drown you out with my bad mob ideas, Visiiri.
P11:01:10 <Visiiri> This thing sends teleporting packets to the server
P11:01:23 <Visiiri> it will go to a random coordinate for about a milisecond
P11:01:26 <Visiiri> then to another
P11:01:36 <Visiiri> the client sees you with normal stuff.
P11:01:44 <Visiiri> So you dont' teleport like that
P11:01:47 <Visiiri> ...to you.
P11:01:51 <Visiiri> Makes sense?
P11:02:06 <VurtualRuler98> yes
P11:02:21 <Visiiri> Well, when you delete/place a block, it will teleport near that one
P11:02:21 <VurtualRuler98> But it is useless against the concept of a vine monster that can entangle you! Then you can't teleport!
P11:02:27 <Visiiri> hehe
P11:02:34 <Visiiri> but then you can grief without being caught
P11:02:34 <VurtualRuler98> And it takes away your block-changing!
P11:02:52 <Visiiri> I'm not releasing that part to non-vip users
P11:03:15 <VurtualRuler98> Visiiri, I may have to hurt you.
P11:03:20 <Visiiri> For what?
P11:03:29 <VurtualRuler98> You've done something that shouldn't've been done.
P11:03:36 <Visiiri> Don't worry
P11:03:45 <VurtualRuler98> You're ruining an internet balance!
P11:03:52 <VurtualRuler98> The whole WORLD works to keep this in check!
P11:03:53 <Visiiri> Don't worry
P11:03:59 <Visiiri> these are the first minecraft HACKS
P11:04:03 <Visiiri> instead of physics changers
P11:04:17 <Visiiri> I have a wallhack
P11:04:18 <VurtualRuler98> Someone will find you and kill you if any of this is mentioned.
P11:04:26 <Visiiri> where the layers fight to see through walls
P11:04:31 <Jat> nothcs stream is offline?
P11:04:35 <Visiiri> It's not usefull though
P11:04:36 <Visiiri> Jat, no.
P11:04:36 <VurtualRuler98> They'll see what you did, and kill you.
P11:04:45 <Visiiri> I also have a ghost mode
P11:04:48 <VurtualRuler98> That's what happens when you make an unfair advantage.
P11:04:55 <Visiiri> thats' like griefer mode without placing/deleting blocks
P11:05:18 <Jat> notchs stream is offline for me
P11:05:29 <PuyoDead> He sawin' logs.
P11:05:31 <chariot> 00:03 <@mnkrft> [MC] [Sentient_Malos] who here has windows 7?
P11:05:31 <chariot> 00:03 <@mnkrft> [MC] [dearthlen] I only have 5 windows at my house
P11:05:53 <Jat> wat
P11:06:02 <Jat> but he just woke up before starting it
P11:06:07 <Jat> and hes already sleeping again?
P11:06:25 <Visiiri> Speed 1-20, float 1-2, jump 1-20, teleport, autoclick right-left, and I'm developing two tools.
P11:06:36 <Visiiri> One will be grief mode with less server-crashing
P11:06:45 <Visiiri> and one is a fill tool
P11:06:55 <Visiiri> Where your client will just fill for you
P11:07:00 <Visiiri> and you will be in ghost mode while it happens
