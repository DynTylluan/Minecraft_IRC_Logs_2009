A12:01:02 <Infinity> lol a spher server would be awesome
A12:01:04 <Infinity> but RP in miencraft
A12:01:06 <Infinity> is impossible right now
A12:01:10 <Eagle> Whatever happened to that RP server we had?
A12:01:10 <Infinity> LOL HI I BUY A BLOCK
A12:01:27 <Eagle> lol  infinity we actually had one
A12:01:32 <Eagle> and it worked out pretty good
A12:01:33 <Infinity> :/
A12:01:36 <Eagle> at first
A12:01:41 <Infinity> kinda hard to see RPing in a game where all you have is giant blocks
A12:01:51 <Eagle> We weren't buying things.
A12:01:53 <Infinity> and griefing
A12:02:02 <Eagle> It was a private server
A12:02:07 <Infinity> ah
A12:02:16 <Infinity> well i'm just saying
A12:02:20 <Eagle> We had, maybe, 5 people in it.
A12:04:11 <TrueWolves> RP is possable
A12:04:29 <TrueWolves> you have a town, you need farms and such to survive, you can only place blocks you mine or chop to earn
A12:04:51 <TrueWolves> you have an imagionary invatory
A12:05:01 <Prime_2> ...why didn't I notice that Notch was here X_x
A12:07:16 <TrueWolves> You should set up a notice
A12:07:25 <TrueWolves> make your computer been everytime notch is said

A2:51:36 <fanta> thx
A2:51:57 <fanta> there should be some server command to do that

A2:52:23 <fanta> i was thinking of writing a perl script to that
A2:55:57 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Do what?
A2:56:10 <fanta> rollback to a backup
A2:56:33 <fanta> you write in game "!rollback <date>
A2:56:55 <fanta> the script replaces the server_level.dat
A2:56:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Why would there be a server command to rollback to a backup if there isn't even a server command to back up the map?
A2:57:23 <fanta> cause i have one :P
A2:57:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, okay.
A2:58:29 <fanta> just need to track the server.log
A2:58:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah I know how making your own commands works.
A3:00:09 <Syndlig> That doesn't help for one thing though
A3:00:13 <Syndlig> Loading maps to the server
A3:00:27 <Syndlig> Would be cool if you could load a map onto the server without having to restart it

A3:01:00 <fanta> i bet that cause huge lags
A3:01:17 <Syndlig> For like the 20 seconds it takes to download the new map.
A3:01:53 <fanta> Is there a thread already? For "hotloading" a map?

A3:46:09 <Bobo> Syndlig: that would be soooo buggy
A3:46:15 <Bobo> how would you position people
A3:46:26 <Bobo> thered be so many times where people would just get stuck 
A3:46:36 <Bobo> unless they just get spawned back to the main spawn
A3:46:43 <fanta> the spawn at the main spawnpoint
A3:46:46 <fanta> *they
A3:46:52 <Bobo> i think its a feature that'd just be too much of a pain 
A3:46:57 <Bobo> and not really that usefull
A3:47:09 <Bobo> i'd rather notch spend more time getting the game closer to survival :D
A3:47:27 <Siiseli> morning
A3:47:40 <fanta> i am pretty sure, that there will be some kind of map change command
A3:47:58 <fanta> so you will be able to change maps during the game

A4:53:11 <C418> but you get spawned inside the earth
A4:53:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah I know.
A4:53:30 <vdgmprgrmr> You would spawn outside if a lava core were added, of course.
A4:53:47 <C418> fuck

A7:18:22 <akuryo> two works correctly
A7:18:27 <akuryo> but the two other doesnt
A7:18:39 <akuryo> they are displaced

A7:21:56 <Redshift> what?

A7:23:30 <akuryo> redshift
A7:23:31 <Fushigidane> I just have a quick question. What are the maps dimensions cubed?
A7:23:48 <Redshift> eh?
A7:23:51 <akuryo> do you have experience in map moding...etc
A7:23:59 <Redshift> yes
A7:24:08 <akuryo> fishigidane, not sure i understood your question but... 256x256x64 ?
A7:24:15 <akuryo> so redshift
A7:24:19 <akuryo> could you come to my server
A7:24:24 <akuryo> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a5fe85f3c144f73915a468a5766f063b
A7:24:27 <akuryo> ill show you the problem
A7:24:30 <Redshift> jsut min
A7:24:45 <akuryo> ok
A7:25:36 <Fushigidane> I mean how many cubes run along the outer 'walls' and how high for each map. I got an idea on something to build, but I want to know how much work it's gonna take
A7:26:18 <Redshift> default:
A7:26:21 <Redshift> 256*256*64
A7:26:37 <Fushigidane> But what map size is that, small?
A7:27:13 <Evil-Ville> default
A7:27:30 <TrueWolves> Redshift, I'm going to use a level editor to Create a spaceship under water that fills a whole 512x256x256 map =3
A7:27:39 <Redshift> lol
A7:27:42 <Fushigidane> Alright then. Thank you

A7:27:50 <TrueWolves> the level will be the ship, just for exploration
A7:28:44 <TrueWolves> perhaps RP on it, with griefers being astroids blowing up parts of the ship (glass doors+water = detecting holes)
A7:30:23 <akuryo> Redshift: http://pastebin.com/m6fcaa2bc
A7:31:43 <akuryo> Redshift: the long lines like * if(buffer[i+y*0x10000-1]!=0 or buffer[i+y*0x10000+1]!=0 or buffer[i+y*0x10000-256]!=0 or buffer[i+y*0x10000+256]!=0) * are the one who try to look around the current tile
A7:31:56 <Redshift> ij
A7:31:58 <Redshift> ok
A7:32:03 <akuryo> and yeah lol, i mix decimal and hexa xD
A7:32:14 <akuryo> so
A7:32:21 <akuryo> -1 and +1 are one dimension
A7:32:26 <akuryo> +256 and -256 are the other
A7:32:26 <Redshift> so are you jsut trying to gen 4 random decorations around each trunk?
A7:32:31 <akuryo> yeah
A7:32:34 <akuryo> exactly
A7:32:37 <Redshift> oh ok
A7:32:43 <akuryo> but those decoration can only spawn there
A7:32:57 <akuryo> so you can clearly see that ONE +256 or -256 work
A7:33:02 <akuryo> and ONE +1 and -1
A7:33:16 <akuryo> since they are near next to the tree heh?
A7:33:22 <akuryo> you see what i mean lol?
A7:33:33 <akuryo> i can not be the two +1 and -1 or the two 253
A7:33:35 <akuryo> 256
A7:33:45 <akuryo> it has to be one of the two
A7:34:06 <akuryo> so basically i would like to know where is my mistake
A7:36:16 <akuryo> by the way, i made this system for the decoration only to see better the problem. the same happens to the leaves, but it's easier to analyse on the ground.
A7:38:21 <citricsquid> yay my server is finally top of the list.
A7:38:34 <akuryo> Citric

A8:52:43 <Rroff> theres no street view within 60 miles of my house

10A8:58:30 * Rock_D (Mibbit@82-171-27-159.ip.telfort.nl) has joined #minecraft
A8:58:50 <Rroff> they are basically being held up as an example and theres no doubt the judge is bias
A8:59:43 <citricsquid> I don't get how he can't be bias: He has a direct affiliation with one of the represented parties, it's impossible for him not to be bias.
A9:00:17 <Bobo> did pirate bay make money?
A9:00:35 <citricsquid> They claim they don't.
A9:00:47 <Bobo> if they don't, they shouldnt get punished
A9:00:48 <Rroff> he also has a past involvement on several levels with anti-piracy and media groups
A9:00:50 <Bobo> just forced to shut down
A9:01:02 <Evil-Ville> Why should they be forced shut down?
A9:01:07 <citricsquid> Shutting the site down is understandable, prison time isn't.
A9:01:18 <Bobo> i think piracy sucks ass
A9:01:22 <Rock_D> they have ads, so they do get money from it
A9:01:30 <Bobo> the ads probably go towards hosting
A9:01:32 <citricsquid> Rock_D: What about maintainence costs?
A9:01:36 <Rroff> they are just being made an example of by people with a lot of money and power
A9:01:42 <Rroff> theres no justice involved
A9:01:43 <citricsquid> Ads never make much money, they use it for their servers. 
A9:01:55 <Bobo> piracy is shit, but i'm not gonna let the rest of the world get free stuff while i pay for it
A9:02:02 <Rroff> meh
A9:02:13 <fanta> bobo, tryed open source?
A9:02:14 <Rroff> I pay for my shit and I dislike freeloading
A9:02:22 <Bobo> open source music?
A9:02:24 <Rroff> but I consider piracy a neccesary evil
A9:02:28 <fanta> nope software
A9:02:32 <citricsquid> If I can afford it, I'll pay for it, but if I can't then I most likely pirate it, I try to pay whenever I can though.
A9:02:33 <Bobo> why would i want it?
A9:02:41 <fanta> cause its free?
A9:02:46 <fanta> well most of it
A9:02:55 <fanta> and its good as well
A9:03:00 <Bobo> thats debatable
A9:03:03 <Rroff> heres a good example... trying to buy the box set of house seasons 1-4
A9:03:06 <Evil-Ville> If you use open source software you're a freeloader
A9:03:10 <Bobo> i'm sure theres not open source apps for everything i do
A9:03:13 <fanta> yeah, but your problem if you wanna pay for it
A9:03:25 <Rroff> downloading it online legally at the cheapest option would have cost £38 PER season
A9:03:30 <Rroff> no one in their right mind would pay that
A9:03:43 <Rock_D> i didnt say that they turned a profit, but the law doesnt care about whether a criminal made profit, just whether they got money
A9:03:46 <Adura> Your money is a vote for continued content.
A9:03:48 <Bobo> i'll have to buy the adobe suite once i start working properly
A9:03:48 <Rock_D> it elevates the crime
A9:03:53 <Rroff> got the disc set off amazon in the end for £37 for the entire lot
A9:03:59 <citricsquid> I'll pay for something if I can justify the cost: I'd pay £10 for minecraft because the hour/£ rate is good, but I wouldn't pay £50 for CoD5 when I'll play 2 hours and get bored.
A9:04:08 <Rroff> normally tho I won't wait to buy a physical set any more
A9:04:19 <Bobo> games are 120 dollars in my country
A9:04:22 <Bobo> its bullshit
A9:04:23 <Rroff> lol
A9:04:37 <Rroff> current price for minecraft is good
A9:04:47 <Bobo> if i can help it, i'll purposely not buy games from big companies
A9:04:49 <Bobo> like EA
A9:04:49 <Rroff> its at a level where you don't really need to think about it
A9:04:57 <citricsquid> Bobo: I hate that attitude
A9:05:05 <citricsquid> "It's okay to steal from big corporations"
A9:05:07 <Bobo> they dont need my money
A9:05:14 <Bobo> i mean as opposed to like
A9:05:15 <Bobo> Gish
A9:05:17 <Bobo> i'd buy gish
A9:05:21 <Rroff> tbh at the non alpha price its at a point where people will equate it with a months internet or a couple of weeks electricity bill
A9:05:24 <Bobo> even though its there to download
A9:05:28 <Rroff> and be a lot less likely to buy it
A9:05:37 <Evil-Ville> Big corporations need money just like everyone else
11A9:05:42 <DBN> do EA make any games? i thought they're just a publisher
A9:05:45 <citricsquid> I'd be more inclined to support a indie developer over a big one like EA, but saying "I'm not buying because you'ee rich" is a dick attitude.
A9:05:49 <Rroff> they are mostly a publisher
A9:06:07 <Rroff> but they do have a development arm tho I don't think its as active as other publishers
A9:06:07 <Bobo> if they charged a reasonable price i would buy them still
A9:06:09 <Bobo> but they dont
11A9:06:21 <DBN> support the game's devs even if it happens to support EA as well
A9:06:25 <Rroff> anyone seen the EA UK HQ? heh
A9:06:33 <Rroff> its like this massive glass building
A9:06:37 <Bobo> heh
A9:06:44 <citricsquid> it's hot
A9:06:52 <Bobo> i'm generally not a big fan of EA
A9:07:05 <Rock_D> EA has quite a lot of teams they bought up and renamed to EA <whatever>, like maxis
A9:07:11 <Bobo> to me they're like the MTV of Games
A9:07:16 <Bobo> they're in it for the money, not the love
A9:07:18 <Bobo> i know thats fine
A9:07:26 <Bobo> but its just not sometihng i like
A9:07:46 <citricsquid> Everyone is in it for the money.
11A9:07:50 <DBN> ^
A9:07:51 <Bobo> the difference is
A9:07:54 <Bobo> some companies might say
A9:08:05 <Rroff> its actually kinda nice
A9:08:09 <Bobo> hey, this game idea i have, its really cool, lets make it, might make some money
A9:08:10 <citricsquid> Some companies have better public relations, but inevitably they all want money.
A9:08:16 <wingboy> http://www.tomshardware.com/news/sims-piracy-bittorrent-game-sales,8126.html
A9:08:16 <Rroff> set in parkland near thorpe park
A9:08:22 <wingboy> ea makes me lol
A9:08:27 <Bobo> EA would do surveys, find out what the majority would buy, and jsut make that
A9:08:30 <Bobo> no risks
A9:08:46 <Rock_D> i dislike the dumbed down feel a lot of EA games have, like it really wants to appeal to a foul mouthed 15 year old
A9:09:01 <Rock_D> the dialogues of dead space are an example
A9:09:24 <Rock_D> thats not how a professional team of deep space engineers should act
A9:09:40 <Rock_D> cussing and being pissy at each other
A9:09:52 <Rroff> "Essentially, those who pirate Sims 3 only get a portion of the full game"
A9:09:53 <Rroff> uh
A9:09:58 <Bobo> lol
A9:09:59 <Rroff> won't be long til someone hacks that too
A9:10:00 <citricsquid> I have a friend who pirated an album for an artist, enjoyed it so much he went out and bought all the other albums and attended all their concerts, spending well over £500 on them. Without piracy that would never have happened.
A9:10:12 <Bobo> hehe
A9:10:15 <Bobo> mmh
A9:10:21 <Rroff> I can't count the number of times people have sent me music on MSN 
A9:10:28 <Rroff> and I've liked it and go on to buy stuff from them
A9:10:32 <citricsquid> Exactly.
A9:10:33 <Bobo> i purchased a band's album once just to support them
A9:10:36 <Rroff> or linked to youtube uploads of them
A9:10:44 <Bobo> would have felt stupid going and handing them 30 dollars
A9:10:44 <Bobo> :p
A9:10:50 <citricsquid> I'm not going to drop £15 on a band I dunno if I like, so I pirate it and if I enjoy it I buy it. 
A9:11:09 <Bobo> i like the itunes system
A9:11:12 <citricsquid> I highly doubt that piracy affects sales that much.
A9:11:14 <Bobo> i've recently bought a few songs on itunes
A9:11:21 <Rock_D> the crippled sims3 was already patched back to a full version before it got released
A9:11:26 <Bobo> like, a dollar per song is decent
A9:11:32 <citricsquid> aye, I like itunes :D
A9:11:53 <Bobo> you know what else i like...
A9:11:54 <Bobo> minecraft
A9:12:02 <Bobo> can't wait till its got its proper game mode
A9:12:29 <Siiseli> I don't like itunes becouse it's full of apple
A9:14:36 <Rroff> itunes is ok
A9:14:57 <Rroff> prices for music are generally a little steep but not outrageous
A9:15:02 <Rroff> tho movies are expensive
A9:15:22 <Rroff> wouldn't mind pay that much if they were HD but they aren't
A9:15:33 <Siiseli>  
A9:15:46 <C418> I would mind paying that much, if they would be hd
A9:15:51 <Rock_D> I think the industry is turning around and starting to use business models that make sense. The steam weekend deals success are a sign that games are simply overpriced. I also like the pre-order at a reduced price to get in the alpha model that minecraft and wolfire games have.
A9:15:53 <citricsquid> when purchasing I consider £ value per hour, I'm not paying £15 for a film that gives me 90 minutes of enjoyment.
A9:16:05 <Siiseli> wow that's alot
A9:16:51 <citricsquid> Rock_D: Steam is a brilliant platform, it works really well. I wish all companies adopted such systems with games, there'd be a lot less piracy.
A9:17:13 <Bobo> its true
A9:17:17 <akuryo> rock d +1
A9:17:24 <Bobo> i dont have one pirated valve game
A9:17:35 <Rroff> I don't have many valve games
A9:17:43 <akuryo> i do
A9:17:48 <Bobo> i have the orange box, hl2, CS, CS:S
A9:17:49 <Rroff> HL2 was ok but EP1 was boring
A9:17:51 <Bobo> few others
A9:17:59 <Bobo> yeah i havent played any of the episodes
A9:17:59 <Rock_D> steam is horribly crippled until they actually start competing on price with stores though. In europe only the weekend deals are worth it
A9:18:02 <Rroff> so I didn't bother with EP2
A9:18:11 <Siiseli>  hl2 was just waiting for the next part of the game
A9:18:17 <Siiseli> ep1 was an improvement
A9:18:26 <Siiseli> so ep1 and 2 were good
A9:18:33 <Bobo> i dont care for story
A9:18:36 <Bobo> so hl2 was enough
A9:18:37 <Siiseli> got 'em all with orange box
A9:18:53 <Siiseli> well hl2 ep1 and ep2 were imo more fun
A9:19:06 <Bobo> mmh
A9:19:17 <Rroff> didn't bother with the orange box
A9:19:27 <Rroff> TF2 and portal aren't my kinda games
A9:19:54 <Bobo> i got it for portal
A9:19:55 <Siiseli> I liked portal
A9:19:55 <Bobo> loved it
A9:20:00 <Siiseli> didn't like tf2
A9:20:07 <Bobo> first unique game i'd played in a long time
A9:20:26 <Siiseli> you don't play many indie games do you?
A9:20:35 <Bobo> not really
A9:20:38 <Bobo> they're usually pretty crap
A9:20:40 <Siiseli> that explains it
A9:20:40 <Bobo> :P
A9:20:42 <Bobo> i play some
A9:20:44 <Siiseli> I beg to differ
A9:20:49 <Bobo> yeah well its all opinion
A9:20:53 <Siiseli> indeed
A9:20:57 <Siiseli> a matter of taste
A9:20:58 <Bobo> to me, a lot of indie games are just boring
A9:21:00 <citricsquid> Steam not competitive? I paid £10 for TF2, similar games from EA etc would have been £50.
A9:21:09 <Siiseli> indeed
A9:21:16 <Siiseli> steam has the prices right usually
A9:21:19 <Bobo> yeah
A9:21:24 <Siiseli> l4d might've been overpriced a bit
A9:21:34 <citricsquid> their only problem is euro/usd conversion, besides that they're perfect.
A9:21:35 <Siiseli> I got it in a bargain
A9:21:41 <Siiseli> oh yeah that's a big problem
A9:21:55 <Bobo> the economy crapped itself just before L4D
A9:21:56 <Rock_D> citricsquid: in europe mass effect is 45 euros, that isnt even competitive with ea's own store, where its already 25 or something
A9:21:58 <Bobo> so it was heaps
A9:21:58 <Bobo> lol
A9:22:30 <Rock_D> all steam games start at 50 euros in europe, even stores don't do that here
A9:22:45 <Siiseli> what
A9:22:48 <Siiseli> no they dooon't
A9:23:06 <Rock_D> yes they dooo, they're 50 euros when they come out
A9:23:25 <Rock_D> and dont come down for a loong time
A9:23:43 <Rock_D> stores usually have it cheaper way before steam does
A9:23:55 <Siiseli> oh right when they come out
A9:23:57 <Siiseli> well
A9:24:00 <citricsquid> most steam games are <£20
A9:24:05 <Siiseli> when games come out they cost about 60 in stores
A9:24:12 <Siiseli> so there you have it
A9:24:13 <Rock_D> console games
A9:24:44 <Rock_D> mediamarkt usually starts at 48 or something like that for pc games
A9:24:48 <Siiseli> no pc games too
A9:24:50 <Bobo> lol microsoft got me
A9:25:01 <Bobo> i changed the firmware of my dvd drive in my 360
A9:25:12 <Rock_D> only crappy toy stores sell for 60 at launch
A9:25:13 <Cue> Sucks to be you
A9:25:16 <Bobo> after 6 months microsoft managed to figure it out and ban my console from live
A9:25:23 <Bobo> i felt i still got my monies worth
A9:25:28 <Siiseli> hmm well I haven't bought games in a store for ages
A9:25:31 <Cue> Stick to PC piracy.
A9:25:33 <Siiseli> I haven't bought pc games for
A9:25:35 <Siiseli> how long?
A9:25:40 <Siiseli> 9 years?
A9:25:44 <akuryo> bought?
A9:25:44 <Siiseli> I think
A9:25:49 <akuryo> what do you mean by bought?
A9:25:56 <C418> I regulary buy pc games on steam
A9:25:58 <Siiseli> well you know
A9:25:58 <fanta> should stat buying games via steam. the have awesome offers 
A9:26:00 <Siiseli> paid money for one
A9:26:01 <akuryo> i buy 2 or 3 parts by year
A9:26:04 <Testvan> smoke weed everyday
A9:26:05 <Siiseli> except when I buy from steam
A9:26:06 <akuryo> AHHH
A9:26:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I buy the games I like
A9:26:08 <akuryo> PC GAMES
A9:26:11 <C418> but those games are small and not full fledged pc games
A9:26:11 <Cue> I pay money for games with good multiplayer
A9:26:12 <akuryo> i understood pc lol
A9:26:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or games that actually innovate, even if I don't like them
A9:26:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Supporting innovation can't be a bad thing
A9:26:21 <Siiseli> I don't do multiplayer usually
A9:26:24 <Cue> I refuse to waste my money on games with no multiplayer
A9:26:28 <Siiseli> I dislike the competitivness
A9:26:31 <akuryo> this is madness
A9:26:39 <akuryo> multiplayer is good
A9:26:41 <akuryo> but single too
A9:26:47 <Siiseli> agreed
A9:26:49 <Cue> I dislike the lack of replay after a while
10A9:26:49 * Quatroking (Quatroking@86.90.159.252) has joined #minecraft
A9:26:49 <akuryo> minecraft without multi would suck tough
A9:26:51 <fanta> i got leaf 4 dead for 14 euro. in store its 44
A9:27:00 <Cue> Leaf 4 Dead...
A9:27:01 <Siiseli> yeah
A9:27:01 <Cue> Hmmm
A9:27:03 <Quatroking> HELLO THAR
A9:27:03 <akuryo> i bought it the 40â‚¬
A9:27:03 <Siiseli> l4d I liked
A9:27:10 <Siiseli> I played it competitively for some while
A9:27:14 <Siiseli> got into some clan and shit
A9:27:18 <akuryo> i don't like l4d
A9:27:20 <Siiseli> then I went all meh on the competitivness
A9:27:21 <akuryo> i wasted my money
A9:27:25 <akuryo> zombie master is free and better
A9:27:31 <akuryo> a LOT fucking better
A9:27:32 <Siiseli> I can't agree on it being better
A9:27:38 <akuryo> lol.
A9:27:38 <Cue> I disliked the PC version of L4D
A9:27:42 <Cue> But I played the 360 one a lot
A9:27:42 <akuryo> this is fucking 154 times better
A9:27:44 <Quatroking> after being in several clans I noticed that clans are stupid
A9:27:48 <fanta> cant wait to see black mesa source
A9:27:52 <Siiseli> I don't see how they're different
A9:27:54 <akuryo> fanta:  +1
A9:27:58 <Siiseli> except 360 has shittier control thing
A9:28:09 <Quatroking> BMS is going to be awesome
A9:28:14 <akuryo> zombie master = for those who don't know this game, this rock.
A9:28:19 <akuryo> A LOT!
A9:28:20 <Siiseli> Quatroking, yeah I was in one only cos' it helped me find good people to play with
A9:28:37 <Siiseli> cos' well, public games :D
A9:28:46 <akuryo> it's left 4 dead, but with better scenario(shorter tough) , more player, and one player is the zombie master, he have to spawn zombies
A9:28:53 <akuryo> more weapons
A9:28:53 <Quatroking> I never join clans anymore, I just find a server that's fun and I keep playing there regulary (gmod)
A9:28:55 <akuryo> more fun
A9:29:05 <Cue> You spawn zombies?
A9:29:07 <akuryo> left 4 dead has not difficity
A9:29:08 <akuryo> yeah
A9:29:09 <Cue> Now you've gotten me interested
A9:29:11 <akuryo> you actually have points
A9:29:19 <Siiseli> Quatroking, yeah except in public games in l4d no one knows how to play
A9:29:20 <Quatroking> wat
A9:29:20 <akuryo> and the zombie master spawn zombie
A9:29:23 <akuryo> lots of sort of zombies
A9:29:26 <Siiseli> and they lack the teamplay
A9:29:27 <akuryo> the bigger cost more
13A9:29:28 * Cue downloads
A9:29:30 <Quatroking> I've got l4d
A9:29:36 <akuryo> cue : we can play together if you wantr
A9:29:40 <Quatroking> it sucks at replay value
A9:29:53 <Siiseli> it's actually one of the games I played most
A9:29:54 <akuryo> zombie survival and zombie panic are NOTHING facing zombie master
A9:29:57 <Siiseli> for the longest
A9:30:18 <akuryo> zombie master at the night is really great
A9:30:20 <citricsquid> If you play campaign on expert
A9:30:22 <citricsquid> it's awesome
A9:30:25 <akuryo> like you have to open doors
A9:30:29 <citricsquid> with friends and vent/teamspeak :P
A9:30:31 <akuryo> and you have 200 zombies bhehind xD
A9:30:34 <Siiseli> oh sure but it gets boringly easy after a while
A9:30:44 <akuryo> i remind of a big huge wave in ZM
A9:30:45 <Siiseli> I refused to play if my friends didn't have mics citricsquid :D
A9:30:48 <Siiseli> and so did they
A9:30:50 <akuryo> 10 guys standing, and 10 guys kneeling
A9:30:53 <akuryo> the zombie arriving..
A9:30:56 <akuryo> "SHOOT!"
A9:30:58 <akuryo> lot
A9:31:04 <akuryo> zombies corps flought
A9:31:07 <Siiseli> meh
A9:31:10 <citricsquid> without communication the game is awful, it's not a game you can just drop in and play :(
A9:31:10 <akuryo> it was so fucking fun
A9:31:19 <Quatroking> when I'm bored I sometiems just go rampage on random servers
A9:31:22 <akuryo> xD
A9:31:31 <akuryo> rampaging is better on zm
A9:31:32 <citricsquid> but with friends and communication it's probably one of the best games I've played.

A9:59:40 <akuryo> HEY
A9:59:43 <akuryo> QUATRO KING
A9:59:46 <akuryo> ARE YOU HERE
A9:59:49 <Quatroking> This whole Haus Am See song from Peter Fox is pretty nice actually.
A9:59:53 <akuryo> quatro
A9:59:56 <Snowman> IT IS TEH WIN
A9:59:59 <akuryo> QUATRO
A10:00:04 <akuryo> i have a question
A10:00:07 <akuryo> with your keyboard
A10:00:11 <akuryo> erm...
A10:00:17 <akuryo> can someone ask quatro to unignore me?
A10:00:20 <Quatroking> Yeah I heard it yesterday on MTV while reading the newspaper
A10:00:28 <akuryo> really
A10:00:28 <Quatroking> Really nice melody.
A10:00:34 <Snowman> quatro
A10:00:34 <Adura> akuryo, I think the idea is that they don't want people to do that.
A10:00:41 <akuryo> erm
A10:00:43 <Snowman> can you unignore akuryo?
A10:00:50 <akuryo> thank you snowman
A10:00:54 <Quatroking> command?
A10:00:57 <Adura> It'd be funny if he ignored Snowman now.
A10:00:58 <Snowman> he wants gay sex with you
A10:01:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyone here have the Model M keyboard?
A10:01:03 <Snowman> :D jk
A10:01:17 <akuryo>  unignore
A10:01:18 <Snowman> akuryo you know the command?
A10:01:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm thinking about replacing my Logitech Illuminated, but I heard some people say it causes strain on the hands
A10:01:20 <Quatroking> I'm not unignoring that faggot until he quits fucking up
A10:01:21 <akuryo>  /unignore
A10:01:30 <akuryo> say him i'm serious now
A10:01:33 <akuryo> i changed =D
A10:01:36 <Adura> That's not likely to happen, Quatroking.
A10:01:37 <Quatroking> to be honest
A10:01:55 <Snowman> quatro its /unignore, and he really needs your help, hes changed, he begs you
A10:01:57 <akuryo> say him it's about his keyboard god damnist
A10:02:04 <akuryo> =(
A10:02:05 <Quatroking> well then, fuh-ged-abbout-it
A10:02:24 <Snowman> its about your keyboard
A10:02:39 <akuryo> thank you snowman, you're nice
A10:02:40 <Quatroking> fine, what
A10:02:46 <akuryo> you have the logitech G11?
A10:02:49 <Quatroking> Yes I do
A10:02:57 <akuryo> does it have a...
A10:03:00 <akuryo> erm... key leds?

A10:03:15 <Quatroking> they PROMOTE the thing with that feature
A10:03:17 <akuryo> and what are the USB for this?
A10:03:24 <akuryo> USB for*
A10:03:27 <Quatroking> two usb ports on top
A10:03:34 <Quatroking> to put usb devices in
A10:03:34 <akuryo> yeah what are they for?

A10:03:37 <akuryo> oh
A10:03:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> The REAL logitech keyboard
A10:03:42 <akuryo> so you have to plug the keyboard in USB?
A10:03:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> besides the DiNovo, which costs far too much
A10:03:54 <akuryo> and how much you paid it?
A10:04:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> akuryo, buy it off eBAy
A10:04:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> eBay*
A10:04:07 <akuryo> no
A10:04:11 <Quatroking> I got it for 60 euro's or something
A10:04:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> never buy keyboards from a store or the manufacturer
A10:04:14 <akuryo> materiel.net have it for 53
A10:04:32 <akuryo> ebay in new?

A10:05:20 <Testvan> i buy $10 keybords from walmart once a year
A10:05:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> The LEDs on my Logitech make a weird noise for some reason....
A10:05:27 <ZomBuster> pff
A10:05:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Through the speakers
A10:05:36 <ZomBuster> I got a $10 keyboard
A10:05:37 <akuryo> 80â‚¬ on ebay lol wtf
A10:05:39 <ZomBuster> from 1995
A10:05:45 <Snowman> testvan why?
A10:05:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I feel like if I'm typing so much, I might as well do my hands a favor.  Also why I bought the MX Revolution
A10:06:00 <Testvan> they get dirty and im too lazy to clean it
A10:06:05 <ZomBuster> lol
A10:06:19 <Testvan> truth bomb
A10:06:22 <Snowman> lol
A10:06:30 <Snowman> I cant even get rid of my keyboard
A10:06:36 <wingboy> normal beige keyboards ftw
A10:06:38 <Snowman> it's integrated :D
A10:06:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just buy a Model M... that thing is indestructible
A10:07:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's what... 70 on eBay now-a-days?  And it'll last forever
A10:07:21 <akuryo> model M ?
A10:07:30 <Snowman> standard keyboard #1
A10:07:30 <Testvan> $10 walmart keyboard nigga
A10:07:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> akuryo, IBM keyboard that set the standard for modern keyboard layouts... It's from the 80s, but still widely considered the beest k,eyboard ever made
A10:07:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> best keyboard*
A10:08:03 <Snowman> â‚¬1000 Integrated keyboard ftw
A10:08:06 <Daidoji> paid $20 for my saitek led keyboard
A10:08:11 <akuryo> hmmm
A10:08:13 <Daidoji> it GLOWS NIGGA IT BE GLOWIN
A10:08:23 <akuryo> i think i'll stay with my logitech G11 in mind
A10:08:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I paid $80 for my Logitech Illuminated
A10:08:26 <akuryo> ebay is fucked up
A10:08:31 <akuryo> i can not order from the states
A10:08:39 <ZomBuster> I can get a keyboard for €4
A10:08:45 <akuryo> lol
A10:08:50 <akuryo> for 0x08 4 really ?
A10:08:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> akuryo, check this out:

A10:08:57 <akuryo> ZOM!
A10:09:03 <akuryo> thanks
A10:09:06 <akuryo> zom i need your help lulz =(
A10:09:12 <Daidoji> yes mine is the top left one
A10:09:30 <Daidoji> eclipse 2
A10:09:38 <ZomBuster> why is the model M $70
A10:09:45 <ZomBuster> it doesnt even have a numpad
A10:09:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because it's the best keyboard ever made
A10:09:51 <Quatroking> I want an optimus max, if it wasn't so expansive
A10:09:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it lasts forever
A10:10:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I want either Model M or Das next
A10:10:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> but I heard Das has issues
A10:10:08 <Quatroking> I WANT THIS http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/
A10:10:16 <Quatroking> but it's so goddamn expansive :(
A10:10:18 <akuryo> lol
A10:10:32 <Daidoji> it's $70 cause people want to pay that for it on ebay
A10:10:33 <akuryo> logitech G11 is good? i do i need to take a new version?
A10:10:34 <Testvan> never thought i would hear people talking about vintage keyboard models like they were classic cars or something.... fag
A10:10:34 <akuryo> like G15
A10:10:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> The Maximus is not worth the money
A10:11:03 <akuryo> maxime is my name =D
A10:11:07 <akuryo> ok... =(
A10:11:15 <ZomBuster> you can get a cheap knock-off of the M with the same mechanism type 
A10:11:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> But I doubt anyone here has that kind of money anyway
A10:11:19 <Daidoji> hallo
A10:11:22 <akuryo> zom buster you ignored me too lol?.
A10:11:27 <Haggle> I like how the Das Keyboard sings to you while you type.
A10:11:36 <Daidoji> mah name is artle bedev. I make keyboards and occasionally enjoy the trance-hop
A10:11:48 <akuryo> what i tough... can someone ask zom to unignore me =( (sorry...)

A11:14:08 <Snowman> It was 2 weeks ago when I first saw him on TV
A11:14:22 <conman420> om I just witnessed the most awesome bug ever
A11:14:48 <conman420> some mapper made his map sunk underneath the big admin block wall so the whole thing was under sea level
A11:15:09 <conman420> and when you placed a block against it then removed it again the water would start seeping in
A11:15:13 <conman420> it was like a giant tsunami
A11:15:38 <Evil-Ville> You might think it was a bug but it wasn't 8)
A11:16:10 <conman420> well water going through the admin wall is a bug lol
A11:16:34 <conman420> and it gave me an awesome idea for a gamemode where you had to survive as water constantly rises
A11:16:34 <Evil-Ville> What I am saying is that I made the tube and slowly let one layer of water in every 5 minutes
A11:16:51 <conman420> yer I realised that it was someone later on
A11:17:03 <conman420> then that guy removed the top layer :v
A11:17:13 <Evil-Ville> Oh that's why it crashed
A11:17:17 <conman420> yes
A11:17:22 <conman420> it was a 20 block high wall of water
A11:17:42 <Evil-Ville> It was fun though
A11:17:45 <conman420> omg its back
A11:18:05 <conman420> whole thing is submerged

P12:04:49 <Quatroking> I love to do that when I'm bored
P12:04:50 <citricsquid> rm -rf * is my favourite command! =\
P12:05:16 <Quatroking> get a virtual machine, throw in ubuntu, and fuck it up as quickly as possible
P12:05:18 <Divagador> configuring java bla bla bla
P12:05:23 <Divagador> a giant text
P12:05:26 <Divagador> and a OK
P12:05:54 <Divagador> now... ?
P12:06:14 <citricsquid> Now do "cd minecraft" (changes you into the minecraft directory) then "mkdir one" (makes a directory called one )then "cd one" (changes you into one) then "wget http://minecraft.net/minecraft-server.zip", after it's downloaded to "unzip minecraft-server.zip"
P12:06:27 <citricsquid> assuming java is installed
P12:06:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> what citricsquid said
P12:06:30 <Divagador> yeah but how to exit that thing PPU
P12:06:31 <Divagador> ^^U
P12:06:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> PPU?
P12:06:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> did Java finish installing?
P12:06:44 <Divagador> ppu = ^^U
P12:07:05 <Divagador> there is a blue screen with a text

P12:07:22 <Divagador> yeah
P12:07:34 <Divagador> but i don't know what key i must press
P12:07:42 <Adura> Depends on what's highlighted.
P12:08:01 <Divagador> ah
P12:08:02 <Divagador> ok
P12:08:06 <Divagador> must select with tab
P12:08:08 <Divagador> lol
P12:08:12 <Adura> Yup.
P12:08:17 <Divagador> fucking windows user
P12:08:20 <Divagador> >o>
P12:08:31 <Adura> Use space to... click.
P12:08:43 <Divagador> ok, it seems to be installed
P12:08:53 <citricsquid> Now do "cd minecraft" (changes you into the minecraft directory) then "mkdir one" (makes a directory called one )then "cd one" (changes you into one) then "wget http://minecraft.net/minecraft-server.zip", after it's downloaded to "unzip minecraft-server.zip"
P12:08:57 <Adura> Did you buy a VPS, or something?
P12:09:02 <Divagador> yep
P12:09:18 <Rroff> what OS is on it?
P12:09:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ubuntu 9.04
P12:09:36 <Rroff> hmm not sure about ubuntu
P12:09:38 <Divagador> you can choose de OS
P12:09:45 <Adura> Nothing wrong with Ubuntu Server.
P12:09:50 <Divagador> unzip command not found
P12:09:51 <Rroff> debian won't install java 6 properly unless you add non-free apt sources
P12:09:59 <Divagador> =/
P12:10:00 <Rroff> apt-get install unzip
P12:10:03 <Rroff> or is it zip
P12:10:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> unzip
P12:10:09 <Rroff> think theres an unzip
P12:10:11 <Adura> They already aded universe sources.
P12:10:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> we added multiverse
P12:10:22 <citricsquid> see, centos is much better, it comes with all this already =D
P12:10:25 <Adura> Yeah, there you go.
P12:10:27 <Divagador> now it works
P12:10:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Divagador, just apt-get install unzip
P12:10:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmkay
P12:10:38 <citricsquid> okay, now do "nano server.properties

P12:10:43 <Infinity> I use Windows 2003 :(
P12:10:48 <citricsquid> and enter the information you want for your server :)
P12:10:57 <Divagador> nice n_n
P12:11:14 <citricsquid> Once you want the server to run, do "nohup java -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer" (nohup is so that you don't end the server when closing ssh)
P12:11:15 <Phygar> Bily mays is dead
P12:11:21 <citricsquid> remember to add your username to admins.txt =)
P12:12:07 <Divagador> with the same command, right? nano admins.txt
P12:12:13 <citricsquid> yeah
P12:12:19 <citricsquid> nano is the text editor (best one imo)
P12:12:24 <Rroff> nano rocks
P12:12:29 <Divagador> nicen_n
11P12:12:30 <DBN> best linux command :(){ :|:& };:

P12:12:37 <Quatroking> like, 5 ducks just rammed my window
P12:12:37 <Rroff> vi lol
P12:12:38 <citricsquid> nano > vi
P12:12:43 <Divagador> i'm learning so much lol
P12:12:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> vi has a steep learning curve
P12:13:18 <Rroff> nano just has everything where you expect it to be
P12:13:25 <Divagador> ok, now i have a server_level.dat that i want to use
P12:13:33 <citricsquid> right then
P12:13:33 <citricsquid> do
P12:13:34 <Divagador> can i?
P12:13:36 <citricsquid> rm -rf server_level.dat
P12:13:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> is that on your server?
P12:13:41 <citricsquid> then upload your custom one somewhere online
P12:13:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, you dont need that
P12:13:42 <citricsquid> and then do
P12:13:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> just mv x.dat server_level.dat
P12:13:56 <citricsquid> wget [link to server_level.dat]
P12:13:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> upload it to an FTP server
P12:14:00 <Rroff> or get WCP
P12:14:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> then wget it
P12:14:02 <citricsquid> allnatural: :(
P12:14:05 <Rroff> uh
P12:14:08 <Rroff> winSCP even
P12:14:15 <Rroff> if you've already got an ssh port open
P12:14:20 <Rroff> easiest way to upload files
P12:14:30 <Adura> Hmm, I could probably host a server on my VPS provider's $7.95 /mo plan, ror.
P12:14:45 <Rroff> I moved mine to VPS
P12:14:48 <Rroff> works no hassle
P12:14:49 <citricsquid> enjoy your shity vps on oversold servers =D
P12:14:54 <Rroff> meh
P12:15:13 <ZomBuster> what is cph
P12:15:14 <Rroff> depends on the hose
P12:15:17 <ZomBuster> vps*
P12:15:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well if you don't need to run , say, 14 servers....
P12:15:19 <Rroff> *host
P12:15:20 <Adura> Minecraft isn't exactly a mission critical application. :P
P12:16:00 <Rroff> I get 10.9-11.4MByte/s transfer rates on my rapidswitch hosts VPS 24x7
P12:16:05 <Bobo> grrr
P12:16:09 <Divagador> uhm, ok, i must to upload the archive anywhere
P12:16:10 <Bobo> this map editor is awfully buggy
P12:16:12 <Bobo> really cool
P12:16:14 <citricsquid> my servers are on 100mbit =D
P12:16:16 <Rroff> and CPU performance seems fine
P12:16:16 <Bobo> but keeps not saving :(
P12:16:20 <Rroff> that is 100mbit
P12:16:21 <Divagador> and then download it in the vps?
P12:16:26 <citricsquid> (h5)
P12:16:28 <citricsquid> yeah diva
P12:16:33 <Divagador> nice
P12:16:40 <Rroff> 11.4MByte/s ~= 92Mbit
P12:16:43 <Adura> Or just upload it to the VPS.
P12:16:56 <Divagador> how?
P12:17:03 <Rroff> grab winSCP IMO
P12:17:06 <Adura> Some things were suggested above.
P12:17:18 <citricsquid> It's easier to upload and wget, extra programs ftl
P12:17:30 <Rroff> http://winscp.net/eng/index.php
P12:17:37 <Rroff> if you've already got an ssh login
P12:17:56 <Rroff> it makes everything easier to upload and do stuff with files
P12:18:10 <Quatroking> how far is the reinstall, citric
P12:18:26 <citricsquid> I got distracted, oops.
P12:18:32 <Quatroking> ._.

P12:22:54 <Divagador> which user interface is better for winscp?
P12:22:59 <Divagador> commander or explorer ?
P12:23:13 <Rroff> explorer is prolly closer to what your used to
P12:23:40 <Divagador> ok, so done
P12:24:12 <citricsquid> Once you want the server to run, do "nohup java -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer" (nohup is so that you don't end the server when closing ssh)

P12:31:24 <Infinity> ah
P12:31:35 <Adura> If you'd like instructions on how to use my Perl server admin script, ask.
P12:31:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> What does your script do Adura ?
P12:31:50 <citricsquid> diva: You'll be able to set up 4 minecraft servers from your vps =D
P12:31:57 <Adura> Why only 4?
P12:32:00 <Rroff> depends on the specs of the vps
P12:32:02 <citricsquid> only 4 per IP
P12:32:07 <citricsquid> after that they won't send heartbeats
P12:32:10 <Divagador> oh, 4 servers?
P12:32:16 <Rroff> basic VPS only has enough memory for 1 or 2 isntances
P12:32:24 <citricsquid> minecraft uses <10mb ram...
P12:32:30 <Adura> Right now it only does timers and chat triggers.
P12:32:30 <Rroff> nah
P12:32:33 <Divagador> so, if anyone want it... lol
P12:32:37 <Rroff> 180Mb on default map
P12:32:42 <peerkoel> it can however eat some CPU
P12:32:43 <citricsquid> :|
P12:32:49 <Rroff> once it gets going
P12:32:58 <Rroff> give it a couple of hours of people working on it
P12:33:01 <peerkoel> yay garbage collection :)
P12:33:07 <Divagador> i mean, i will do a public server for you
P12:33:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have it running on 0.0% cpu... it spiked to 2.0% sometimes
P12:33:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's on a 667MHZ processor
P12:34:01 <Rroff> :D
P12:34:07 <Divagador> anyways, before i have a program that makes backup of the server_level every 5 minutes
P12:34:16 <Rroff> CPU load doesn't change much
P12:34:23 <peerkoel> hm, I had a testing server that ate 100%
P12:34:25 <Rroff> 500Mhz or multicore 3gig
P12:34:29 <Rroff> it only uses 0-2%
P12:34:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> 500mhz Rroff 
P12:34:43 <citricsquid> 10% ram and 2% process is what my most popular server is doing
P12:34:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> actually
P12:34:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> 667
P12:34:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> but wh's counting?
P12:35:02 <Rroff> well I tried it on a 500
P12:35:05 <Rroff> which is why I said that
P12:35:18 <Rroff> also tried it on a box with 32 cores at 3gig
P12:35:18 <Divagador> Linux Automatic Backup (CronJob)
P12:35:20 <Divagador> can i use this ?
P12:35:23 <Rroff> yeah
P12:35:33 <Rroff> but you need a decent script to do backups
P12:35:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's my post Divagador  :D
P12:35:48 <Rroff> <Rroff> also tried it on a box with 32 cores at 3gig << and it still uses upto 2% CPU
P12:35:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> not clean the way I did it, but it does the job
P12:35:54 <Divagador> i kwno n_n
P12:35:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh I see Rroff 
P12:35:57 <ZomBuster> doesnt really matter hoe you do backups
P12:36:09 <Adura> Who's a hoe?
P12:36:14 <Rroff> I do 10 minute backups with 1 month purge lol!
P12:36:16 <Rroff> bit overkill
P12:36:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> 1 hour backups, keeps last 24
P12:36:39 <Rroff> I'd do it more often than 1 hour personally
P12:36:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> why;s that?
P12:36:52 <Rroff> but you don't need more than 1-2 days retention max
P12:37:03 <Rroff> easier to recover from griefing on an active server without too much lost
P12:37:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> then again we have 90 ops so barely any griefers slip by
P12:37:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> you only lose 30 mins on average
P12:37:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> plus griefers are usually in for more than 5 mins
P12:38:15 <ZomBuster> wait
P12:38:18 <ZomBuster> with 90 ops
P12:38:19 <Rroff> actually
P12:38:25 <ZomBuster> big chance an op wil fuck up
P12:38:30 <Rroff> my server is using 45Mb physical and 180Mb virtual
P12:38:35 <Rroff> but coz I have no swap file configured
P12:38:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> ZomBuster, you mean ban an innocent?
P12:38:40 <Rroff> it looks like its using more RAM lol
P12:38:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Our join message is E-Mail phil@linux.com for questions or ban appeal
P12:38:53 <ZomBuster> and reandom frieging
P12:38:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> I get about 1 or 2 ban appeals a week
P12:39:24 <citricsquid> lmao, my server is at 96% ram capacity, oops.
P12:39:53 <Adura> Aw lawds.
P12:39:54 <Rroff> I've only got 178488k free lol

P12:44:00 <Rroff> celerons were good for q3 servers back in teh day

P12:44:05 <Rroff> due to the short pipeline
P12:44:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yup... Q3 server ran great
P12:44:26 <Rroff> they would actually run noticeable smoother than an AMD CPU or P4 which was weird

P12:52:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I might reduce it
P12:52:33 <Rroff> gonna make a tool to compare 2 versions of a map
P12:52:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's the font... the text itself is 12 pt
P12:52:50 <C418> it is time to wander through random servers again
P12:52:55 <Rroff> and a brush that XORs sections of geometry as you move over it
P12:53:05 <Rroff> between each version
P12:53:13 <Rroff> so you can basically airbrush griefed sections
P12:53:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> that would be cool

P1:02:06 <Rroff> its an automated command
P1:02:07 <citricsquid> it's the best thing you can get from a prostitute.
P1:02:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> cron is a unix scheduler; it executes certain commands at certain times
P1:02:12 <Rroff> that runs at regular intervals

P1:02:48 <Rroff> 0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * cd mine;./check.sh &
P1:03:00 <Rroff> think you can use /10 on the minutes
P1:03:05 <Rroff> but I've not played with that
P1:03:09 <Rroff> thats what I use
P1:03:23 <Divagador> but for use it i need to download it or what ?
P1:03:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPLrm3Omkjg
P1:03:32 <Rroff> cron should be already installed
P1:03:51 <Rroff> so you can just make a file with a command in and use crontab <filename> to make cron aware of it
P1:04:23 <Rroff> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron
P1:04:41 <Rroff> oops it would be /6 not 10 heh
P1:04:56 <Divagador> uhm, ok i'll read this
P1:05:18 <Divagador> i need to put a backup tool 
P1:05:22 <Rroff> nor not lol
P1:05:37 <Rroff> ok it works different to how I thought for /
P1:06:36 <Divagador> but, is there a command or something to use it ?
P1:06:43 <Rroff> crontab is the command
P1:06:49 <fanta> crontab -e
P1:06:56 <Rroff> crontab <filename> will load a cron command from that file
P1:06:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> or crontab [file]
P1:06:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> which I prefer
P1:07:00 <Divagador> so it will be... crontab 10/* * * * * /bin/cp /
P1:07:03 <Divagador> or what
P1:07:04 <Rroff> crontab -l will list cron jobs
P1:07:09 <Rroff> and -r removes cron jobs
P1:07:27 <fanta> 1 * * * * cp /home/minecraft/server_level.dat /home/minecraft/backups/backup_`/bin/date +\%Y-\%m-\%d-\%H`
P1:07:30 <Rroff> */10 I think for every minute dividable by 10
P1:07:37 <fanta> hourly
P1:07:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> why 1 and not 0 fanta?
P1:07:54 <peerkoel> the server should make a backup every time a new user enters
P1:07:55 <Rroff> that will spit out a LOT of files

P1:28:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Divagador, only problem is that this script doesn't remove old backups
P1:28:56 <Divagador> so, how often did it backup ?
P1:29:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> 10 minutes
P1:29:04 <Divagador> nice
P1:29:07 <Rydia> i want to hear swish swish boop boop boop choop whenever i mine stuff
P1:29:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rydia, nobody knows
P1:29:17 <Divagador> don't worry i'll remove the old backups manually
P1:29:29 <C418> most servers are kind of bitchy
P1:29:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Divagador, good.. just make sure you dont run out of HD space
P1:29:36 <Viter> I've just installed it and nothing happends should i reboot my pc?

P1:29:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Divagador, if you want to remove the whole folder, use rm -rf backup && mkdir backup

P1:32:50 <Bobo> sdits worked really well so far
P1:32:52 <C418> you block everything off?
P1:33:01 <Bobo> i block the entry
P1:33:02 <C418> did you ever think of making it private?

P1:33:22 <C418> blocking spawn points is a kind of dick move
P1:33:22 <Viter> Hey iI'm back i've just installed it (again) and rebooted my pc and nothing happend
P1:33:24 <Bobo> so people are usually on
P1:33:31 <Bobo> not as much of a dick move as deleting my shit
P1:33:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bobo, that's retarded
P1:34:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> might as well go private
P1:34:11 <Bobo> then no new people will come
P1:34:15 <Snowman> QUATRO
P1:34:20 <Snowman> WHAT COLOUR IS GMANS TIE?
P1:34:22 <C418> really, making it private would be the best idea
P1:34:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Few new people are coming this way I imagine
P1:34:25 <Bobo> C418 is the first person to come in, and just complain and leave
P1:34:29 <C418> you even could use a free domain
P1:34:36 <Bobo> usually people just come in, i let them out
P1:34:37 <C418> yes. I cannot understand something like that
P1:34:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or hell, a paid one
P1:34:52 <Rroff> ooh this is clever if it works

P1:35:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> dark
P1:36:16 <Bobo> the blocked entrance has worked great for me, i usually have at least 4 people in my server, heaps of stuff has been built, and no greifing whatsoever in 5 days its been going
P1:36:39 <citricsquid> It's better to op good players than blocking new players
P1:36:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, +1 to that

P1:36:58 <citricsquid> :D
P1:36:59 <Viter> Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from (file location)/minecraft-server.jar
P1:37:03 <Bobo> i do op good players
P1:37:07 <Bobo> and they let people in
P1:37:23 <citricsquid> I quit a server if, upon joining, it has me blocked.
P1:37:33 <Wingboy> same
P1:37:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> +1 again citricsquid 
P1:37:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also, griefers can be good
P1:37:40 <Bobo> doesnt really bother me :p
P1:37:40 <Divagador> is possible to get the map more open than 256x256x64 ? o_o
P1:37:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> They force us to refresh the map
P1:37:53 <Rroff> would this work?

P1:39:04 <Quatroking> citricsquid is the server still alright or did it fuck up again
P1:39:08 <Rroff> the only thing I'm not sure is how long read would work for
P1:39:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh I see
P1:39:28 <Rroff> hopefully it stays persistant while the proggy is writing to std out
P1:39:43 <Rroff> I haven't tested it yet
P1:39:50 <Rroff> but its kinda clever if it works
P1:40:12 <ZomBuster> would work great for instant griefers

P1:41:52 <Testvan> BILLY MAYS IS DEAD
P1:41:55 <Rroff> the other neat thing is
P1:41:56 <Snowman> ITS PURPLE
P1:41:56 <m0bus> light black? as in grey?
P1:42:04 <Snowman> NO NOT GREY
P1:42:08 <Snowman> IN BETWEEN BLACK AND GREY
P1:42:09 <Rroff> you can do away with checks if the server is running
P1:42:18 <Evil-Ville> dark grey then
P1:42:21 <Rroff> you can make the script restart the server at the end
P1:42:30 <Snowman> I PREFER LIGHT BLACK
P1:42:40 <Quatroking> Gman's tie is dark blue
P1:42:44 <Evil-Ville> light black doesn't make any sense
P1:42:45 <Quatroking> a little lighter than his suit
P1:43:19 <Snowman> ITS PURPLE

P2:02:58 <Rroff> oops
P2:03:08 <Rroff> take out the screen if your not using it not that it matters
P2:03:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff, what about ps -ef | grep [m]inecraft
P2:03:22 <Rroff> or that
P2:03:57 <Rroff> or not
P2:04:05 <Snowman> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Snowman
P2:04:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> works for me
P2:04:30 <Ellimistd> ...maybe i'll just reboot the whole box, it reboots quick enough
P2:04:38 <Rroff> it works
P2:04:43 <Rroff> but I still have to filter screen out
P2:04:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P2:04:52 <Rroff> so for me it doesn't mat that much odds
P2:04:56 <Rroff> *make
P2:05:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah
P2:05:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> brb
P2:05:05 <Rroff> plus you only need ps x for local user
P2:05:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> going to find my phone
P2:05:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> ps x | grep [m]inecraft also works
P2:05:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> w,e
P2:05:34 <Rroff> :P
P2:05:45 <Rroff> I have mobile putty on my phone yay me
P2:05:53 <Rroff> can admin my servers from anywhere heh
P2:05:56 <Ellimistd> k, ill try these out later.  one is bound to work...
P2:06:30 <Rroff> kill $(ps x | grep [m]inecraft | cut -f 1 -d " ")

P2:38:23 <JLB8> yea it should be
P2:38:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> do a ping example.org

P2:41:07 <JLB8> not sure why its not on the net tbh, considering im RDP'ing onto it atm

P2:56:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> andyy, no difference
P2:56:54 <andyy> these might be a stupid question, but how does an assigned OP destroy unbreakables? or is it not possible
P2:57:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's possible
P2:57:03 <Snowman> RECONNECT
P2:57:03 <ZomBuster> you can just do it
P2:57:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> same way they destroy other blocks
P2:57:09 <ZomBuster> dont need any commands
P2:57:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> if they were just assigned, they must reconnect
P2:57:16 <Snowman> RECONNECT TO THE SERVER AFTER YOURE MADE AN OP
P2:57:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> before they can destroy OP blocks
P2:57:34 <Wolfram> So I've been seeing a lot of obnoxiously large maps. Attempted to replicate through the OME, but to no avail
P2:57:38 <Wolfram> So how is this being done?
P2:57:39 <andyy> Ok thanks
P2:59:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Try Rosetta's tool... That might work Wolfram (haven't tried it though(
P2:59:04 <Wolfram> It's a secret to everyone? -.-
P2:59:07 <Wolfram> Ah
P2:59:14 <Wolfram> Rosetta's tool, eh?
P2:59:17 <Wolfram> I'll look into it. Thanks
P2:59:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> it should let you specify dimensions

P3:35:15 <vdgmprgrmr> That's actually 8192 blocks LESS than a standard huge map!
P3:35:32 <Quatroking> alright, I managed to do a 512x512x64 now

P3:37:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, are you able to bypass the 4 server limit by turning verify names off?
P3:37:56 <citricsquid> nope
P3:37:58 <citricsquid> I don't think so
P3:38:01 <Quatroking> considering its 26,214,400 blocks
P3:38:01 <Rroff> afaik servers won't go over 512
P3:38:07 <Quatroking> No?
P3:38:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Heh... If it's private without verify-names it shouldn't require a heartbeat

P4:43:50 <citricsquid> Did the block go black?
P4:43:53 <nip> Oh!

P4:51:41 <Quatroking> :rolleyes:
P4:51:47 <Flumoxxe> I agree
P4:52:00 <akuryo> quatroking?
P4:52:01 <Flumoxxe> Any largely circulated game has a cestpool of a forum
P4:52:04 <Flumoxxe> Without fail
P4:52:05 <akuryo> you have something to say?
P4:52:10 <Quatroking> NAh
P4:52:14 <akuryo> ok.
P4:52:18 <Quatroking> Thought you'd get it anyways

P4:52:41 <akuryo> the forum is great
P4:52:50 <citricsquid> wiki has used loads of bandwidth.

P4:54:37 <akuryo> and now i love zuriki
P4:54:46 <akuryo> and a little bit citricsquid too
P4:54:51 <akuryo> but mostly zuriki
P4:55:02 <Flumoxxe> Completely unrelated: Is anybody else using the latest minefield build?
P4:55:05 <akuryo> because lesbian > all
P4:55:20 <Flumoxxe> And if so, are you unable to copy the url from the address bar to clipboard as well?
P4:55:22 <akuryo> * Do someone here master a little bit C++ *
P4:55:30 <Quatroking> What is minefield
P4:55:39 <Quatroking> yo
P4:55:42 <Flumoxxe> Mozilla's experimental browser build
P4:55:48 <Flumoxxe> Basically Firefox 3.6+
P4:55:59 <Rroff> I still use 2.x :|
P4:56:05 <Quatroking> what the fuck
P4:56:05 <Flumoxxe> But they have this stupid philosophy about the firefox experience being consistent
P4:56:09 <Quatroking> where did my drink go
P4:56:12 <Flumoxxe> So they name alpha builds with a code-name
P4:56:14 <Rroff> firefox has got out of hand
P4:56:17 <Flumoxxe> Hence, Minefield
P4:56:26 <Flumoxxe> Minefield is fucking FAST
P4:56:29 <Flumoxxe> That is all
P4:56:42 <akuryo> i'm currently developing a map generator(it's working, just need some fixes, and improves) so do someone want to work with me?
P4:56:53 <Quatroking> flumoxxe, link?
P4:57:13 <Flumoxxe> Actually, that was my problem
P4:57:16 <Rroff> I'd rather use IE6 if it wasn't for the security flaws
P4:57:16 <akuryo> http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/
P4:57:18 <akuryo> google?
P4:57:22 <Flumoxxe> I can't seem to copy urls from my address bar
P4:57:26 <Rroff> I like my browser fast, functional and plain
P4:57:27 <Flumoxxe> Just google minefield download
P4:57:28 <akuryo> google, minefield, first link : http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/
P4:57:32 <Flumoxxe> The first link it what you want
P4:57:35 <Quatroking> fuck google
P4:57:39 <Flumoxxe> There's no download page
P4:57:40 <akuryo> OMG
P4:57:45 <Flumoxxe> It's just an index
P4:57:46 <akuryo> HE SAID FUCK GOOGLE
P4:57:48 <akuryo> omgomgomg

P4:57:58 <Quatroking> you do know that they're the second microsoft
P4:58:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> they are?
P4:58:06 <Flumoxxe> (lol)
P4:58:09 <akuryo> microsoft is greqt
P4:58:13 <akuryo> great
P4:58:16 <Quatroking> akuryo, NO.
P4:58:18 <Flumoxxe> Fucking IE man. FUCK YEAH
P4:58:22 <akuryo> IE is shit
P4:58:26 <akuryo> but microsoft is great
P4:58:27 <Flumoxxe> GOOOOO WINDOWS!!!!
P4:58:33 <PuyoDead> big corporations are bad! YEA
P4:58:33 <akuryo> i'm not joking man
P4:58:36 <Quatroking> YAY BSOD EVERY WEEKEND
P4:58:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> go pants
P4:58:39 <Quatroking> WOOHOO
P4:58:41 <akuryo> quatro
P4:58:47 <akuryo> i got 2 bsod in my life
P4:58:48 <Flumoxxe> Actually, I'd be curious to see Google's attempt at an OS
P4:58:51 <akuryo> i'm a ubuntu user
P4:58:55 <akuryo> but windows rock
P4:58:57 <Rroff> I haven't seen a BSOD on my current XP install
P4:58:59 <akuryo> microsoft rock
P4:59:02 <Rroff> almost 3 years intalled
P4:59:05 <akuryo> same
P4:59:05 <Flumoxxe> Linux, in every sense, is better
P4:59:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> i bet google will come up with linux or something
P4:59:09 <akuryo> the last bsod is very old
P4:59:12 <Rroff> not as a desktop OS
P4:59:15 <Flumoxxe> But there are so many cool little things about XP to learn
P4:59:19 <akuryo> linux is better than windows
P4:59:22 <Flumoxxe> For instance:
P4:59:26 <Flumoxxe> Windows users;
P4:59:26 <akuryo> but microsoft is a very good corporation
P4:59:33 <Flumoxxe> Hit Window Key + 'L'
P4:59:35 <Quatroking> the only reason I use windows is gaming
P4:59:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> they know how to make money that's for sure
P4:59:40 <Rroff> lock
P4:59:42 <Rroff> we all know that
P4:59:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes quatro
P4:59:45 <akuryo> i hitted it
P4:59:52 <Flumoxxe> Several don't, oddly enough
P4:59:53 <akuryo> it just did nothing
P5:00:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> ooh
P5:00:04 <Rroff> well anyone whos made it to IRC prolly knows
P5:00:04 <akuryo> just brought me to user choose
P5:00:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> that'll be useful
P5:00:19 <Flumoxxe> I just set up a user account with a password

P5:26:00 <FoxBlitzz> Is Firefox 3.6 actually worth downloading?
P5:26:00 <cryzed> what is the problem oO?
P5:26:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> FoxBlitzz, not if you have 3.5
P5:26:18 <FoxBlitzz> Firefox 3.0 was great because it solved serious issues that plagued 2.0
P5:26:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> 3.5 is wayyy better than 3.0.11 or whatever it is these days
P5:26:31 <FoxBlitzz> 3.5 doesn't seem like it solves anything
P5:26:40 <FoxBlitzz> My main critique over 3.5 is the Private Browsing.
P5:26:47 <C418> porn mode
P5:26:50 <FoxBlitzz> Nowhere do I see it stated that enabled extensions can breach privacy
P5:26:54 <FoxBlitzz> Nowhere.
P5:27:14 <citricsquid> If you want privacy on the internet, you're doing it wrong.
P5:27:22 <C418> you mean having porn sites in the history
P5:27:25 <FoxBlitzz> Firefox has had "porn mode" the whole time. It's called the Profile Manager and it lets you surf without those extensions
P5:28:11 <cryzed> Lol, just delete your cache and cookies
P5:28:13 <cryzed> where's the problem
P5:28:17 <cryzed> "porn mode" my ass
P5:28:29 <FoxBlitzz> cryzed: Extensions that probe data like visited sites can take data to their servers
P5:28:45 <cryzed> That's why I'm regularly clearing my cache
P5:28:49 <cryzed> like every 10 mins
P5:28:50 <cryzed> lol
P5:28:53 <FoxBlitzz> You can't undo something like that.
P5:29:03 <cryzed> oh
P5:29:04 <cryzed> that
P5:29:06 <FoxBlitzz> Clearly you don't understand the issue here.
P5:29:09 <cryzed> I don't think I've got those addons installed
P5:29:27 <citricsquid> which is why I only use trusted extensions =D
P5:29:29 <FoxBlitzz> Well, someone's bound to make the mistake if they don't put in a disclaimer
P5:29:30 <cryzed> The only addons I'm using are those which got installed over 100.000 times I think
P5:29:38 <cryzed> adblock, download statusbar, greasemonkey
P5:29:42 <citricsquid> If you want to watch porn secretly, use a different browser.
P5:29:45 <citricsquid> Have a porn browser
P5:29:46 <citricsquid> simple.
P5:29:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Opera is my porn browser :D
P5:29:55 <FoxBlitzz> citricsquid: That's what Profile Manager is for
P5:30:04 <FoxBlitzz> firefox -ProfileManager --no-remote
P5:30:58 <Stiggs> Anyone else know why my server using Linode would be hanging on 'Connecting'?
P5:31:13 <FoxBlitzz> Browsers like Google Chrome can get away with their "porn modes" because they don't revolve around having extensions
P5:31:22 <FoxBlitzz> Firefox is a whole 'nother can of worms.
P5:31:38 <citricsquid> Stiggs: It's ports being blocked, I'm sure of it, I had exactly the same problem until I disabled the firewall. You're using centos right?
P5:32:05 <Stiggs> Yeah, using centos
P5:32:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> The firewall is there for a reason... Can't you just add exceptions?

P5:48:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, nightly version of FireFox
P5:48:18 <akuryo> siiseli : new alpha versio of firefox
P5:48:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> I would stick with 3.5RC for now
P5:48:22 <Siiseli> ah
P5:48:25 <Flumoxxe> Basically alpha a Firefox 3.6
P5:48:28 <akuryo> fucking fast
P5:48:29 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, will do
P5:48:33 <Flumoxxe> It's really not buggy
P5:48:41 <akuryo> lol
P5:48:42 <akuryo> i can not tell
P5:48:45 <Siiseli> I'm not in a hurry to get it
P5:48:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not, but the diff between 3.6a1pre and 3.5RC1 is very, very minute
P5:48:52 <akuryo> i runned it for some min now
P5:48:56 <Flumoxxe> It is really really fast
P5:48:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> not worth bugs / incompatibilities
P5:49:01 <Siiseli> akuryo, ran
P5:49:06 <akuryo> sorry xD
P5:49:17 <akuryo> my english isn't taht gud =)
P5:49:22 <Siiseli> yeah
P5:49:23 <Flumoxxe> The only big incompatibility I've seen is with All-in-one-Sidebar, and my themes
P5:49:35 <Flumoxxe> And neither have support for 3.5
P5:49:39 <akuryo> sidebar?
P5:49:47 <Flumoxxe> It's an addon

P5:49:52 <Siiseli> and addons
P5:49:52 <Flumoxxe> I'd like a sidebar again
P5:49:59 <Flumoxxe> But I can't find one compatible
P5:50:00 <akuryo> erm
P5:50:04 <akuryo> my addons don't work
P5:50:06 <akuryo> i mean
P5:50:07 <akuryo> lol...

P5:50:18 <Flumoxxe> Download Nightly Tester Tools
P5:50:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> or just do extensions.checkcompatibility false in about:config (boolean)
P5:50:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> thats not the exact string
P5:50:39 <Flumoxxe> A lot are, but their certificate is for another version
P5:50:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> but I can look for it if you want
P5:50:56 <Flumoxxe> I try to stray away from editing about:config as much as possible
P5:51:02 <akuryo> you know what? firefox orthograph corrector doesn't know the word microsoft , google  or even mozilla and firefox xD
P5:51:11 <akuryo> but it knows apple =D
P5:51:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> akuryo... go to about:config in your URL bar, when you get in, right click new boolean
P5:51:27 <Flumoxxe> Some are company names, the other is just a work (?)
P5:51:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> string is Extensions.checkCompatibility
P5:51:35 <akuryo> lol yeqh
P5:51:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> value is false
P5:51:36 <Flumoxxe> *word
P5:51:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> then restart
P5:51:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> they'll all work
P5:51:51 <akuryo> lol
P5:51:53 <akuryo> don't worry
P5:51:54 <Flumoxxe> Unless they're incompatible...
P5:51:54 <akuryo> i already done that
P5:51:59 <akuryo> but some addons still bug
P5:52:18 <Flumoxxe> It's completely worth it, honestly
P5:52:26 <Flumoxxe> The speed almost outweighs any addons period
P5:52:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Flumoxxe, have you tried 3.5RC1?
P5:52:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> it has both speed and add-on compatibility
P5:52:45 <akuryo> OMH
P5:52:46 <Flumoxxe> Yeah, I went from that to 3.6
P5:52:49 <akuryo> i just realised
P5:52:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> 3.6 isn't faster...
P5:52:57 <akuryo> no wait...
P5:52:59 <Flumoxxe> Any that don't work with the alpha don't work with 3.5
P5:53:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> unless it's because of all the add-ons

P5:59:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> USE FIREFOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
P6:00:01 <Siiseli> yeah ie for example has such lovely things as not supporting min-width and height
P6:00:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> I PREFER CHROME ITS FASTER
P6:00:02 <akuryo> even the worst noob use firefox
P6:00:03 <Flumoxxe> IE8 is better for developers, but no better as a browser

P6:03:45 <Siiseli> making a html interpreter might take some effort?
P6:03:47 <akuryo> it was a project

P6:04:04 <akuryo> it will suck

P6:04:08 <akuryo> the browser have no use!

P6:04:26 <Siiseli> Eagle, he's MKAKING that browser

P6:04:29 <akuryo> lol
P6:04:30 <Eagle> I know that.

P6:04:32 <Siiseli> not using it
P6:04:37 <Eagle> He said he was. >>;
P6:04:43 <citricsquid> I have the most annoying problem in firefox: Images seem squashed by 1px, like, if an image is set as 600px it's 599px distorting all text.
P6:04:45 <Siiseli> perhaps he was joking
P6:04:49 <akuryo> it's pretty hard to work with the internetz =D
P6:04:53 <akuryo> so making a browser is hard
P6:04:54 <Adura> ctrl-0
P6:04:54 <Eagle> Perhaps he was.
P6:04:59 <Siiseli> citricsquid, try clicking on the image
P6:05:05 <akuryo> actually the browser was the first phase of my final project

P6:05:09 <citricsquid> <3

P6:05:15 <citricsquid> I thought I had no zoom settings
P6:05:16 <akuryo> which is done
P6:05:18 <Siiseli> my firefox for no apparent reason zooms my pics up by like 1 px
P6:05:21 <citricsquid> but apparently I had the tiniest ever
P6:05:24 <Siiseli> adding that annoying blur
P6:05:34 <akuryo> yeah

P6:06:25 <akuryo> not the basic sql injection tough

P6:06:35 <akuryo> i'm not talking about the ' or 1=1 gay thing

P6:06:52 <Eagle> sql injection in the face
P6:06:53 <akuryo> no lol
P6:06:55 <akuryo> believe me
P6:06:58 <akuryo> they are not rare
P6:06:59 <akuryo> so...
P6:07:03 <Siiseli> the designers of that site are fucking retarded
P6:07:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, people who mainly program their own backend and don't pay to get it security tested
P6:07:06 <Siiseli> oh well
P6:07:12 <akuryo> with this type of injection i could only see 10 cards in a time
P6:07:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> No matter how good you are, you can always mess it up
P6:07:22 <akuryo> so i programmed this
P6:07:25 <akuryo> so it makes lots of request
P6:07:27 <citricsquid> security is, contrary to popular belief, piss easy as long as you have a brain and check everything as you go along.
P6:07:29 <akuryo> only takes the cards infos
P6:07:32 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, mm yeah

P6:07:53 <Flumoxxe> I hate forgetting to eat
P6:07:58 <citricsquid> well, in a game it's totally different, I meant with websites =D

P6:08:26 <Siiseli> stuff you didn't even think of
P6:08:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> akuryo, I know, it was still there though
P6:08:49 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, that's why I always test my websites on friends

P6:34:57 <Drakkar> I would buy a mac
P6:35:11 <Snowman> Dell xps m730 is prettier
P6:35:13 <Drakkar> but for no reason other than to ensure cross-compatibility
P6:35:15 <Snowman> 1730
P6:35:25 <citricsquid> Drakkar: what do you make?!
P6:35:37 <Quatroking> I prefer black cases so I won't be getting a mac anytime soon

P6:36:23 <citricsquid> Drakkar: better than minecraft? =D
P6:36:37 <Drakkar> I wouldn't say that
P6:36:41 <Snowman> I like my Dell XPS M1530
P6:36:43 <Drakkar> pretty different really
P6:36:49 <Snowman> powerful, lightweight and good looking
P6:36:53 <citricsquid> :D

P7:21:40 <Rroff> this is far less complicated way to implement it
P7:21:54 <Adura> Oh, that's not for backups mind you.
P7:22:05 <Rroff> this works
P7:22:11 <Adura> It's for remote admin.
P7:22:16 <Rroff> whenever someone joins it creates a backup with their name and date :D
P7:22:33 <Rroff> so you can quickly recover from an individual griefer

P7:58:07 <citricsquid> it isn't financially viable to rent with gameservers unless you're doing thousands of units
P7:58:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not talking about commercial gamehosts, but you linked to it from the MineCraft forum post
P7:58:44 <citricsquid> I was just linking any hosts I can think of :D

13P7:59:31 * citricsquid giggles
P7:59:34 <vdgmprgrmr>  :D
P7:59:35 <Rroff> tho
P7:59:43 <Rroff> I can get same spec for half that
P7:59:48 <Rroff> with slightly less bandwidth
P8:00:04 <citricsquid> =D
P8:00:07 <Rroff> actually less ram as well
P8:00:11 <citricsquid> they have an awesome setup though
P8:00:21 <Rroff> $140 is nothing
P8:00:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> My point: nobody's going to pay 140 to run a minecraft server
P8:00:52 <Rroff> ah
P8:00:53 <Rroff> true that
P8:00:56 <citricsquid> true
P8:01:20 <Rroff> my old server was $600/m :X
P8:01:26 <citricsquid> rofl
P8:01:35 <citricsquid> 18172? =D
P8:01:38 <citricsquid> 1872*
P8:01:42 <citricsquid> god I suck at typing
P8:01:50 <Rroff> got unlimited gig-e for the price of unlimited 100mbit on special offer
P8:02:14 <citricsquid> I've never needed much bandwidth, don't think I've ever done over 30gb/month
P8:02:31 <Rroff> I haven't hit more than 250gig in recent months
P8:02:40 <Rroff> would easily tear up 3Tb "back in the day"
P8:02:48 <citricsquid> I did have a site doing 30gb/day (alexa rank 10k) but It wasn't 100% mine :{
P8:03:07 <Rroff> a lot of the hosting stuff I've done tho hasn't been that bandwidth intensive
P8:03:20 <Rroff> last gig was processing huge images
P8:03:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> What kind of hosting Rroff ?
P8:04:29 <Rroff> well that was more backend processing
P8:04:35 <Rroff> before that used to do game server hosting
P8:04:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> web hosting is the easiest, but with the market that's around these days I don't see a way to compete
P8:05:10 <Rroff> http://www.escapedturkey.com << helped set that up
P8:05:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff, really?
P8:05:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know that host...
P8:05:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> from when I used to play Urban Terror
P8:05:28 <Quatroking> god
P8:05:28 <Rroff> yah
P8:05:51 <Rroff> I did all the technical stuff in the early days
P8:05:54 <Quatroking> inverse kinematics are a bitch to make
P8:05:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> But I always heard about how the guy didn't speak English....
P8:06:02 <Rroff> ?
P8:06:13 <citricsquid> easy to compete if you're unique
P8:06:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> dno I heard the guy running it didn't speak English
P8:06:22 <Rroff> he speaks English fine lol
P8:06:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Must've just been a PO'd customer getting revenge then
P8:06:34 <Rroff> I hate iks Quatroking
P8:06:39 <Rroff> prolly
P8:06:46 <Quatroking> even fucking pivot can do it better than flash
P8:06:55 <Nalok> Ah man is redshift's server down >.<
P8:06:56 <Quatroking> god
P8:07:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why is his server always down/
P8:07:11 <Nalok> I just made a little shack on russia too!
P8:07:18 <Rroff> he pretty much ended black listing *aol on the web server :P
P8:07:28 <Nalok> When is that client update
P8:07:30 <Rroff> coz those customers almost always ended up more hassle than worth
P8:07:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Maybe tomorrow, maybe not Nalok 
P8:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> 10 GB Space | 300 GB Transfer
P8:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> 100 Email Accounts
P8:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> 10 MySQL Databases : $4 / month
P8:08:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> how can I compete with that?
P8:08:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> don't even get me started on the free hosts...
P8:08:46 <Rroff> heh
P8:09:01 <citricsquid> Allnatural = competing on space/bandwidth is impossible
P8:09:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I suddenly find myself thinking about Line Rider...
P8:09:04 <citricsquid> compete on other aspects
P8:09:06 <citricsquid> be unique
P8:09:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Too bad I'm not creative enough to do that
P8:09:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> :D
P8:09:38 <Rroff> some people don't do too badly
P8:09:46 <citricsquid> I have a hosting idea that I have planned out, doing it whenever I have the capital
P8:09:51 <Rroff> I use rapidswitch and their prices are pretty much middle of the road
P8:09:57 <Rroff> but I can't fault them one bit
P8:10:31 <citricsquid> competing on price never works, unless you have the service to back it up
P8:10:44 <Rroff> tho they sold out to someone recently :( so I hope it doesn't go downhill
P8:10:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> it does if you have killer price
P8:11:05 <citricsquid> any customer worth having will pay extra for good servuce
P8:11:07 <citricsquid> service*
P8:11:16 <citricsquid> those who go for the cheapest ALWAYS are horrible to deal with
P8:11:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> I must be horrible to deal with then
P8:11:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> or am I just broke?
P8:11:40 <Rroff> heh
P8:11:55 <citricsquid> ...you can't afford good hosting?
P8:12:03 <Rroff> in the early days of ET - art of war offered the owner almost a million $ to go away and never do game hosting again
P8:12:10 <Rroff> coz he was squeezing their prices out
P8:12:22 <Rroff> personally I'd have taken it
