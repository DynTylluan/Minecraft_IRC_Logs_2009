A12:54:36 <JimRaynor> thats retaarded
A12:54:40 <JimRaynor> retarded* even
A12:54:40 <PuyoDead> but not many networks actually do that, it's kind of weird, actually
A12:54:47 <JimRaynor> its retarded.
A12:55:12 <PuyoDead> yea, I've never seen it myself, and I've been using IRC for almost 15 years
A12:55:19 <JimRaynor> Coldfront is the center of some of the most violent irc drama, and it does not use that O.o
A12:55:41 <JimRaynor> mmm hows irc progressed over the years?
A12:55:47 <PuyoDead> not much at all
A12:55:51 <JimRaynor> ive only began using it a couple/few years ago
A12:55:57 <JimRaynor> heh, then it is already perfected :p
A12:56:05 <PuyoDead> it's IRC, there really isn't anything to change
A12:56:16 <PuyoDead> just new networks popping up, new clients being made, etc
A12:56:35 <PuyoDead> kinda like usenet
A12:56:44 <JimRaynor> usenet?
A12:56:49 <PuyoDead> newsgroups
A12:57:30 <JimRaynor> i see, my only experience is with aforementioned coldfront :p though ive tried a few different clients, I think I like mirc the best

A5:37:15 <Snowman> Hey
A5:37:23 <Arzock> I think I solved spawn prisons
A5:37:37 <Arzock> And potentially griefing
A5:38:47 <LG_Legacy> Lol?
A5:38:54 <Arzock> Srsly.
A5:38:55 <LG_Legacy> This ought to be interesting
A5:38:57 <LG_Legacy> Speak
A5:38:59 <Arzock> Indeed.
A5:39:05 <Arzock> The hacks people use, yes?
A5:39:11 <Arzock> They have a saving function
A5:39:26 <Arzock> So I can save a map and put it on another server
A5:39:30 <Arzock> yet only I can see it
A5:39:34 <Arzock> Therefore
A5:39:45 <Arzock> Someone makes the map in single or a private map
A5:39:52 <Arzock> someone then saves it 
A5:39:56 <Arzock> goes on their server
A5:39:59 <Arzock> loads it
A5:40:05 <Arzock> yet griefers cannot see it
A5:40:09 <Arzock> so it remains intact!
A5:40:21 <LG_Legacy> So practically stealing the whole map?
A5:40:25 <Arzock> Yes.
A5:40:34 <LG_Legacy> Players only?
A5:40:45 <Arzock> Yes, I believe so.
A5:40:55 <LG_Legacy> Eh..
A5:40:58 <LG_Legacy> Not too keen on it
A5:41:05 <Arzock> Do you have the hacks?
A5:42:05 <|404notfound> uh

A5:42:16 <|404notfound> you save a map and load it, and other people can't see it?
A5:42:17 <LG_Legacy> Players can steal maps and save em
A5:42:21 <Arzock> yes
A5:42:22 <Arzock> like
A5:42:27 <Arzock> I go to skybuild two
A5:42:31 <Arzock> press shift f2
A5:42:36 <Arzock> then go to flatgrass
A5:42:39 <Arzock> press f2
A5:42:49 <Arzock> and I have loaded up a copy of the map only I can see
A5:42:52 <LG_Legacy> Wait
A5:42:54 <Arzock> but it can also be multiplayer
A5:42:54 <LG_Legacy> How the hell?
A5:43:02 <Arzock> I don't know how it works.
A5:43:02 <LG_Legacy> How does that work in multiplayer?
A5:43:13 <Arzock> get the hacks then I can show you.
A5:43:19 <LG_Legacy> Yeah... no
A5:43:23 <Arzock> Precisely
A5:43:32 <Arzock> Come to flatgrass and I will show you?
A5:43:36 <LG_Legacy> Nope.
A5:43:41 <Arzock> >_>
A5:43:59 <Arzock> So you refuse to let me answer your question?
A5:44:13 <|404notfound> does loading a map in multiplayer cause it to actually change for everybody else?
A5:44:18 <Arzock> Nope
A5:44:24 <Arzock> So griefers can't get to it.
A5:44:41 <Arzock> Yet you can explore it
A5:44:54 <Arzock> also it means you retain powers from the actual server
A5:44:57 <|404notfound> the logistics of that boggles me
A5:45:02 <Arzock> so I could be an op on any map I like!
A5:45:24 <Arzock> The only problem is it is slightly baffling and you can go into the sea
A5:45:38 <Arzock> but you can't make things in the sea
A5:45:45 <Arzock> because nobody can see them
A5:45:51 <Arzock> except you if you made them

A5:48:13 <vdgmprgrmr> you can't load maps in MP.

A5:49:01 <|404notfound> but you said other people don't see it

A5:50:49 <vdgmprgrmr> The LOAD MAP button is unclickable in MP.

A6:06:11 <Quatroking> because I didn't understand a word from what you said
A6:06:23 <Arzock> =P
A6:06:29 <Arzock> Yes I am bad at explaining
A6:06:32 <|404notfound> wait, so I still don't understand how that solves griefing
A6:06:43 <|404notfound> you get a private copy of the map to play on by yourself, but then what?
A6:06:44 <Arzock> Becuase the griefers can't see it
A6:06:54 <Arzock> so they can't grief

A6:08:07 <Quatroking> whats the difference from playing singleplayer and then passing the save link to friends
A6:08:24 <LG_Legacy> The fact you can't all play toghether?
A6:08:27 <|404notfound> well
A6:08:28 <Quatroking> or just good opping
A6:08:31 <|404notfound> that was entirely too much work to put into getting a joke
A6:10:02 <Arzock> you can though
A6:10:12 <Arzock> if you both save the same map
A6:10:15 <Arzock> and loadv it
A6:10:23 <|404notfound> wait
A6:10:25 <|404notfound> you're serious
A6:10:53 <Arzock> Yes.
A6:11:00 <Arzock> I can prove it.
A6:11:34 <|404notfound> I believe you, but I mean you're serious about it being a solution to griefing
A6:12:52 <Arzock> It is.
A6:12:57 <Arzock> It would work.
A6:13:27 <|404notfound> the hassle of setting all of that up aside, wouldn't each user just be looking at his own copy?
A6:13:37 <|404notfound> i.e., changes made by one guy on the loaded map are not shown for the other guys who loaded it
A6:13:51 <Quatroking> Wouldn't it just be easier to play with friends on a private server/find a server with good ops
A6:14:18 <Arzock> Its not any hassle you click three buttons
A6:14:20 <Arzock> Not hard
A6:14:42 <Arzock> And what if you want your creation to go public?
A6:15:23 <Quatroking> uh
A6:15:35 <Quatroking> pass on the link?
A6:15:51 <Quatroking> I don't see why people have to bitch around all the time about griefers anyways
A6:16:02 <Quatroking> just built on places that are hidden or something
A6:16:12 <|404notfound> so you tell all your friends to save the map at the exact same time so that they're synchronized, and then you all go and find another server to join, and everybody loads up the map, which--if my assumption is correct--will no longer be synced because everybody will be working in his own unique copy
A6:16:32 <Arzock> Um no

A9:45:28 <SteGriff> I didn't suggest yours weren't, though :P just that mine are

A9:45:38 <SteGriff> yeah

A9:47:29 <SteGriff> It just eliminates the point of xhtml
A9:47:37 <SteGriff> and accessibility
A9:47:44 <Zuriki> How?
A9:47:53 <SteGriff> great, 10 images, all marked "none" for their mouseover text
A9:48:02 <SteGriff> accessable!
A9:48:08 <Adura> That's not what alt is for.
A9:48:11 <SteGriff> tru
A9:48:15 <SteGriff> but as an example
A9:48:24 <Zuriki> Seriously how often do you hover over a layout image for the alt text
A9:48:28 <SteGriff> ok, other way: 10 images, all missing, containing the word none
A9:48:31 <citricsquid> alt is for screenreaders isn't it?

A9:57:14 <SteGriff> heh right
A9:57:20 <SteGriff> fair enough
A9:57:54 <citricsquid> bought it in 2005, used it for about 6 weeks, left it and then cancelled before the renewal date, then in 2008 they sent is a bill for overdue domain registration over a year later saying we'd not paid so we now owed lots of fees.
A9:58:07 <citricsquid> so instead of contacting us at renewal they waited over a year so the fees built up.

P1:31:57 <citricsquid> 10th of may was first release, wasn't it?

P1:45:49 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Nah, about 70 people running a mysql query that had to check through 40,000,000 rows at a time. 
P1:45:54 <08Notch> I have, and it rules
P1:46:01 <blckpythn> when i start my server it automatically generates a new level even thoughi already have a server_level.dat
P1:46:22 <Saer> Yeah, but they been working on it for four years or something.
P1:46:22 <Saer> Anyway, I was going to ask after, Was minecraft kind of inspired a little by that?
P1:46:26 <potato> The server_level.dat you have might not be gzipped
P1:46:26 <08Notch> if the level file is broken, it will autogenerate a new one
P1:46:34 <08Notch> yes, saer
P1:46:34 <citricsquid> blckpythn: sure you're not being sent into single player?
P1:46:42 <blckpythn> yes im sure

P1:46:57 <Saer> Thank you Notch
P1:47:03 <Saer> Want to interrogate me?
P1:47:04 <C418> when I see dwarf fortress, I see a dungeon keeper with a very weird control scheme
P1:47:17 <blckpythn> aaahaha i figured it out
P1:47:20 <PrinceOfFire59> I AM A GENIOUS
P1:47:28 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I only got a screenshot at 19, but the load was >70 when It crashed: http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/20619471175-orig.jpg
P1:47:29 <blckpythn> omen didnt automatically append the file type
P1:47:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P1:47:41 <PrinceOfFire59> I uncorrupted my microsd
P1:48:00 <C418> I never get those three numbers
P1:48:06 <C418> could you explain it to me citric?
P1:48:42 <citricsquid> I *think* it's the amount of processes pending, in percent. So if you have 4 cores then a load of 4 means your server is being used 100%. So a 2 core server with a load of 20 means it's 1000% overloaded. I *think*
P1:48:57 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX probably knows better :P

P1:50:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> very high actually
P1:50:48 <Bbzx> Notch, what about downloadable server_level.dat
P1:50:51 <Bbzx> from single player
P1:50:56 <citricsquid> yeah, it got to 70 and the server killed itself. haha.
P1:51:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> load average: 0.35, 0.13, 0.04
P1:51:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> right now for me
P1:51:07 <Bbzx> so that people can reuse them and host them on a multiplayer server =3
P1:51:08 <citricsquid> Load Averages	0.09 0.08 0.16 
P1:51:25 <citricsquid> Load Averages  	0.00 0.00 0.00 for my minecraft server :D

P1:58:27 <08Notch> i held one yesterday, that was scary
P1:58:36 <citricsquid> held a baby or a tiger?
P1:58:36 <peerkoel> I held one today, it was great
13P1:58:52 * peerkoel held his 8 months old nephew
P1:59:08 <08Notch> hehe
P1:59:11 <08Notch> baby =)
P1:59:21 <08Notch> he was cute, though. Grabbed my beard
P1:59:33 <Wolfram> Kids drive me nuts. o.o
P1:59:43 <citricsquid> baby has taste! beards are the best thing ever.
P1:59:45 <peerkoel> if they could they'd grab all your stuff and eat it
13P1:59:49 * citricsquid makes a beard medal
P2:00:44 <08Notch> i had had a couple of glasses of wine. "here, hold this"
P2:01:05 <peerkoel> "omg! which way is up!?"
P2:01:07 <peerkoel> hehe
P2:01:07 <citricsquid> wine? you big girl!
P2:01:17 <08Notch> "but I'm inebriated!", I thought to myself. "What if I break it!?"
P2:01:30 <peerkoel> then... you go to jail
P2:01:31 <08Notch> I didn't, though. :D But apparently I didn't look very natural holding him, hehe
P2:01:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> vertigo
P2:01:34 <Perogi> Notch, is your beard at all reminiscent of Billy May's beard?
P2:01:52 <08Notch> i wish!
P2:01:57 <08Notch> mine's not as dense on the sides
P2:02:00 <citricsquid> Do you use your beard for typing?
P2:02:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wait, Perogi hasn't been banned yet?
P2:02:02 <PrinceOfFire59> Nevermind, I just renamed the corrupted folder and replaced it...

P2:02:18 <08Notch> citricsquid: Bah, when you turn 30, you start to appreciate wine
P2:02:32 <Perogi> I appreciate wine and I'm much younger :/

P2:02:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, I've been seeing yellow and purple stained blocks everywhere... http://www.ubuntu-pics.de/bild/20053/screenshot_007_g29uZ2.jpg
P2:02:43 <peerkoel> beer is still the drink for me..
P2:02:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> by everywhere, I mean like once a day
P2:02:56 <Perogi> I only really drink beer to chase other hard liquore
P2:02:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> and woah that screenshot is funky
P2:02:59 <Perogi> or with a smoke
P2:02:59 <08Notch> beer's nice. wine's nice too. water's awesome.
P2:03:03 <08Notch> whoa
P2:03:11 <Perogi> Yes water is best I try to drink more water lol
P2:03:17 <citricsquid> ice cold coca cola > everything
P2:03:19 <PuyoDead> yea, beer is nice, when you learn to drink it for taste, rather than simply to get drunk
P2:03:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Getting drunk off beer == shit
P2:03:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.ubuntu-pics.de/bild/20055/screenshot_008_UpYs19.jpg
P2:03:33 <08Notch> indeed, PuyoDead. There's a lot of really nice complex beers
P2:03:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> better
P2:03:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, and his damn European local beers
P2:03:42 <PuyoDead> that there are
P2:03:46 <Perogi> I find that while beers do have varying tastes none of them have much depth
P2:04:02 <Perogi> not like the subtleties of a good red wine
P2:04:13 <PuyoDead> beer has plenty of depth, given you actually hunt them down
P2:04:15 <peerkoel> I had beer once, named Kelpie
P2:04:20 <peerkoel> made from seaweed
P2:04:24 <peerkoel> not so good
P2:04:27 <Perogi> Well I must remember to go beer hunting one day
P2:04:58 <PuyoDead> I find dark and ales to be the best
P2:05:00 <08Notch> that looks like an entry in the color buffer got corrupted, AlLnAtuRalX. I wonder how that's even possible
P2:05:06 <08Notch> is your video card running hot?
P2:05:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> it does many times Notch, but I think other people can see it too
P2:05:23 <PrinceOfFire59> What do I do with a corrupt folder?
P2:05:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> I remember there was a yellow-stained OP block once and everyone saw it Notch
P2:05:36 <PuyoDead> where is the corrupt folder?
P2:05:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> we were all laughing about who urinated on the wall x.X
P2:05:38 <08Notch> oh, if others are getting it, it's probably a client bug!
P2:05:45 <08Notch> lol
P2:05:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not sure this time
P2:05:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> but last time they were
P2:05:51 <PrinceOfFire59> the folder is on a microSD
P2:05:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> let me refind the block and call some people over
P2:05:54 <08Notch> ok, that's good to know. =)
P2:06:02 <PuyoDead> you'll probably have to reformat it
P2:06:08 <PuyoDead> back up, format, replace
P2:06:18 <PrinceOfFire59> alright
P2:06:31 <PuyoDead> I've had it happen a few times
P2:06:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> one: Asdfgh says: See nothing
P2:06:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> one: JGibbs says: i dont see anything either
P2:07:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
P2:07:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> worked with the yellow OP block though :/
P2:07:20 <PuyoDead> odd
P2:07:24 <PrinceOfFire59> I fucked up bad on DS Homebrew XD
P2:07:31 <08Notch> :D
P2:07:39 <08Notch> are you making stuff yourself, PrinceOfFire59? =D
P2:07:45 <PuyoDead> hah, yea, the last time I had that happen, if was from a DS flashcart
P2:07:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Man. Quassel is orgasmic.
P2:08:06 <PuyoDead> I don't remember what spefically, but I know it was some form of homebrew
P2:08:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I love having a central core I can keep my settings in when I go from computer to computer
P2:08:08 <PrinceOfFire59> I wish I was, If I knew how

P2:08:36 <08Notch> i want to try doing some ds homebrew sometime. =)
P2:08:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quassel IRC is based on the client-server model: The core application can be placed onto a server which is connected to the Internet around-the-clock; one or more clients then connect to the core. This way, the connection to IRC can be kept up even when all clients have been closed. The combination of screen and WeeChat as well as IRC bouncers served as example for this architecture.  yum.
P2:09:14 <PuyoDead> Notch, if you do, that would be amazing

P4:59:34 <Aduro> video signal, what do you mean
P4:59:38 <Quatroking> because while booting up its no longer giving the usual beep
P4:59:42 <Aduro> Ah
P4:59:52 <Quatroking> monitor says "No input signal" and goes into standby
P5:00:03 <Quatroking> that thing you get when you turn off your pc bt not your monitor
P5:00:07 <Quatroking> but*
P5:00:08 <Snowman> The POST isn't going properly?
P5:00:30 <Quatroking> I doubt it, because then it'd give beep errors
P5:00:35 <Aduro> Did anything happen to the PC in those 2 weeks?
P5:00:36 <Quatroking> now its not giving anything at all
P5:00:41 <Quatroking> nope.
P5:00:46 <Snowman> If it doesnt beep the POST isnt going good :/

10P5:43:57 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
P5:43:58 <victory> then saves the hidden/shown layers as a PNG.
P5:44:05 <victory> To use for a skin
P5:44:07 <Darkebrz> GIMP
P5:44:15 <victory> and/or automatically uploads with your info.
P5:44:34 <Darkebrz> Well
P5:44:36 <victory> No. Listen. I allready have a PSD with a bunch of layers.
P5:44:46 <victory> It's liek a dress up doll prgram that saves a PNG
P5:44:59 <victory> I made the skins and different graphics.
P5:45:06 <victory> The program will be a chooser.
P5:45:26 <victory> SO not an editor.
P5:45:37 <Darkebrz> Well
P5:45:42 <Darkebrz> Good luck getting someone to make that
P5:45:48 <victory> Say... Someone comes into the forums, Finds my "Skinpack"
P5:46:02 <victory> Downloads it. Opens it, chooses what he wants on his doll.
P5:46:12 <victory> Saves/Uploads it with a button.
P5:46:25 <victory> And logs into the game with a new awesome customizable skin.
P5:46:45 <victory> Bad idea?
P5:47:03 <victory> Right now i just edit one doll by adding layers. It's really effiecient.
P5:47:33 <victory> but not everyone has photoshop and/or knows enough to make thier own out of it.
P5:48:03 <Darkebrz> Well
P5:48:06 <Darkebrz> Good luck
P5:48:06 <victory> There are like 15000 AFK people in this room.

P7:28:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> well i googled that and i happen to found some driver updates
P7:29:02 <stickzanimator> Hai i need some help here. I plan on buying full version of minecraft, but I can't use paypal since it dosn't accept prepaid american express cards
P7:29:11 <stickzanimator> Is thier any way i can pay besides paypal?
P7:29:20 <Darkebrz> I do not believe so
P7:29:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> credit card
P7:29:27 <stickzanimator> I don't have a credit card
P7:29:30 <stickzanimator> all i have is this prepaid card
P7:29:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> trade it with someone who does have one
P7:29:49 <stickzanimator> what do u mean
P7:29:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> you know, trade
P7:30:03 <stickzanimator> i guess...
P7:30:14 <Darkebrz> Annihilator
P7:30:19 <Darkebrz> That doesnt make any sense
P7:30:30 <citricsquid> it does
P7:30:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> how does what not make any sense
P7:30:37 <citricsquid> he gives the card to someone, they pay for his account.
P7:30:40 <citricsquid> ergo, trade.
P7:30:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> exactly
P7:30:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> the good ol days padre
P7:30:52 <stickzanimator> I have no one to trade with really D:
P7:30:59 <Darkebrz> Lol, I was thinking of actually trading cards
P7:31:11 <Nalok> Also, I forgot my pass to my main MC account, Dragoon, I already paid for it and I'm stupid for forgettting my pass and all but >.<
P7:31:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> that could work too
P7:31:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P7:31:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah, nalok
P7:31:26 <stickzanimator> So anyone wana trade? ololo
P7:31:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> i forgot my password too
P7:31:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> so i'm stuck with chrome
P7:31:46 <Nalok> So could I email Notch and see if he can get me my pass?
P7:31:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> because it's the only browser that has my password saved
P7:32:03 <Darkebrz> Chrome is the shit
P7:32:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wonder if i can find some cookies
P7:32:23 <citricsquid> Nalok: markus@mojang.com, make sure you include the paypal payment ID for the payment of premium!
P7:32:29 <citricsquid> That way he'll know you're legit :)
P7:32:35 <stickzanimator> Alright so say i found someone to trade with...they need to log on to my account and hit the buy button?
P7:32:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> erm
P7:32:54 <citricsquid> no
P7:32:57 <stickzanimator> D:
P7:32:58 <citricsquid> let me find the image I posted
P7:33:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> that sounds edgy
P7:33:03 <citricsquid> that let you haxx0r it
P7:33:11 <citricsquid> wait, I'm not on my pc. bugger.
P7:33:16 <stickzanimator> ololo
P7:33:18 <citricsquid> well, you can edit the HTMl of the button
P7:33:18 <stickzanimator> mac?
P7:33:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> well, you see, sickzanimator...
P7:33:25 <citricsquid> and change the username.
P7:33:51 <Nalok> Gah, all the programs I'm trying I have to sign up or buy >.<
P7:33:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> well nevermind brb
P7:33:58 <stickzanimator> ...
P7:34:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> nalok: what programs
P7:34:11 <stickzanimator> So does the buying need to be done on MY computer?
P7:34:24 <citricsquid> no
P7:34:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> not really
P7:34:28 <Nalok> Driver detective and Driver Updater Pro
P7:34:34 <citricsquid> it affects the logged in account
P7:34:42 <citricsquid> because it takes the logged in name and adds it to the HTML
P7:34:44 <citricsquid> for the button
P7:34:45 <stickzanimator> So i just need to be logged in as stickzanimator
P7:34:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> why do you use automatic driver update softwares anyway
P7:34:49 <citricsquid> so you manually change to buy someone else :)
P7:35:00 <stickzanimator> Oh i see
P7:35:10 <Nalok> So I can update my driver >.>
P7:35:27 <stickzanimator> Damn it why the crap won't paypal accept my card
P7:35:34 <stickzanimator> it would be so much easiere
P7:35:40 <stickzanimator> easier*
P7:36:22 <stickzanimator> Anyone wana buy it for me then? ololo

P8:35:24 <Bbzx> :\
P8:35:34 <Bbzx> extremely popular?
P8:35:35 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> I have SP3, I have the latest java, 
P8:35:45 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> Yes 4chan is full of puppyluarity
P8:35:55 <Bbzx> exactly how many people in the world have an IQ under 60
P8:35:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't recall they have puppies
P8:36:02 <Bbzx> i wouldnt call it extreme
P8:36:05 <Bbzx> ly
P8:36:11 <mail2345> it's a bell curve around 100
P8:36:14 <mail2345> for IQ
P8:36:15 <PuyoDead> popular in the same way car wrecks are
P8:36:31 <tortele> wtf is Spleef.
P8:36:32 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> 4chan has half their population idiots
P8:36:37 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> another half smart people
P8:36:45 <Bbzx> and 100% faggots
P8:36:53 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> im sorry do you hate trolling
P8:36:59 <Bbzx> not trolling
P8:37:06 <PuyoDead> just the general stupidity
P8:37:08 <Bbzx> yep
P8:37:16 <tortele> What is Spleef. :l
P8:37:21 <Bbzx> trolling can be quite amusing when done in a funny and intelligent way
P8:37:24 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> im sorry sir did you ever not see the uncommon real 4chan person.
P8:37:28 <Bbzx> a "successful troll"
P8:37:29 <PuyoDead> certain areas of 4chan are actually informative, but /b/ is just a waste
P8:37:29 <tortele> Stop talking about 4chan and their idiots.
P8:37:29 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> you're looking at /b/
P8:37:39 <tortele> /b/ sux
P8:37:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> we have some 4channer in our school
P8:38:00 <PuyoDead> tortele, http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Spleef
P8:38:04 <Bbzx> burn him! lynch him! guillotine him!
P8:38:06 <tortele> kthx
P8:38:11 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> ú_ú
P8:38:14 <Bbzx> :P
P8:38:20 <citricsquid> problem with 4chan; when you say 4chan 90% of people think /b/
P8:38:26 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> You're making a huge stereotype of 4chan
P8:38:38 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> you're thinking that /b/ is the only board on there
P8:38:45 <citricsquid> OrangeJuice_Seempson: it's massively accurate, though.
P8:38:57 <PuyoDead> that it is
P8:38:58 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> it applies to /b/
P8:39:09 <citricsquid> yeah, and /b/ has 90% of the traffic.
P8:39:12 <PuyoDead> which is the vast maority
P8:39:14 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> yes
P8:39:18 <Bbzx> how many people on 4chan, though, have not visited /b/ ?
P8:39:19 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> that's called "Cancer"
P8:39:22 <PuyoDead> hence, the obvious
P8:39:35 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> "cancer" is the stupid of 4chan.
P8:39:40 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> Thus newfags and oldfags.
P8:39:47 <citricsquid> the cancer is the idiots who constantly say LOLOL CANCER.
P8:39:52 <PuyoDead> agreed
P8:39:53 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> no not really.
P8:40:04 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> i've taken it you never visited Encyclopedia Dramatica.
P8:40:10 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> lulzy place of the web
P8:40:11 <citricsquid> of course I have.
P8:40:11 <Bbzx> oh god no
P8:40:15 <PuyoDead> let's blame our mass stupidity on something we can't explain!
P8:40:28 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> you're being an idiot
P8:40:33 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> and thinking that /b/ is all full of idiots.
P8:40:35 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> that's incorrect
P8:40:39 <PuyoDead> which it most certainly is
P8:40:43 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> incorrect.
P8:40:49 <Bbzx> but tell me, what could possibly be so amazingly entertaining in /b/ that you would browse it all day>
P8:40:50 <citricsquid> lmao
P8:40:55 <PuyoDead> I'm hard pressed to say 5% of the /b/ folks have any original thought
P8:40:56 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> I do not browse it all day sir.
P8:41:00 <citricsquid> find me 10 people on /b/ right now that aren't idiots.

P9:20:02 <Zuriki> You should get the exact size
P9:20:04 <Zuriki> I think...
P9:20:05 <Zuriki> Idk

P9:20:36 <Quatroking> Hay

P9:20:53 <Animator> Quatroking, have you seen the Papercraft thing?
P9:21:00 <Quatroking> Yeah
P9:21:04 <Animator> Make some.
P9:21:09 <Quatroking> Fucking zuriki stole my idea
P9:21:16 <Quatroking> D:
P9:21:33 <Zuriki> Shut up
P9:21:42 <Quatroking> no you
P9:21:48 <Animator> HEY HEY HEY.
P9:21:50 <Darkebrz> Hahaha!
P9:21:58 <Darkebrz> I just completely flooded an ocean server 8D
P9:21:59 <Quatroking> hi hi hi
P9:22:05 <Zuriki> This isn't the first time is it Quatroking
P9:22:17 <Perogi> OMG DARKEBRZ YOU FLOODED YOUR A GRIEFER OMG
P9:22:17 <citricsquid> i thought about papercraft like, last month, u steelz mah ideas!!
P9:22:25 <fydo> Perogi: it's true
P9:22:32 <Quatroking> I dunno, I just had three coffee
P9:22:35 <Zuriki> I thought about Papercraft like... well ages ago
P9:22:41 <Perogi> what is a papercraft?
P9:22:46 <Zuriki> TROLL
P9:22:50 <Perogi> !!!
P9:22:52 <citricsquid> http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1082847
P9:22:57 <citricsquid> I was inspired by that thread
P9:23:05 <citricsquid> was going to post the template and everything but it sucks for minecraft
P9:23:05 <Quatroking> I tought about papercraft before I even met Minecraft
P9:23:07 <citricsquid> :P
P9:23:13 <Nalok> Haha, AT&T are a bunch of dumb fucks
P9:23:13 <Quatroking> Before Notch had a beard
P9:23:22 <Animator> I thought about PaperCraft before man was alive.
P9:23:38 <Quatroking> I tought about it before the first atom existed
P9:23:38 <Eagle> I thought of PaperCraft before Chuck Norris had a beard.
P9:23:40 <citricsquid> it's like rubbing yourself in nectar and getting inside a beehive (AT&T)
P9:23:43 <Darkebrz> Newgrounds is not responsible for any cuts (paper or otherwise) users may receive during the making of their papaercraft creations.
P9:23:58 <Animator> Well, to be fair.
P9:24:01 <Perogi> huh shit seems wierd
P9:24:03 <Quatroking> I remember when Newgrounds was fun
P9:24:13 <Animator> Neither of you get credit because you didn't invent papercraft in the first place.
P9:24:22 <Perogi> me too quatroking
P9:24:23 <Quatroking> when I was 9 years old, visiting the Assassin page in its full glory
P9:24:27 <PuyoDead> http://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/205524058/in/set-72157594224719487/
P9:24:31 <Zuriki> I'm still awesome though right?
P9:24:33 <Animator> Any and all papercraft ideas stem from the original person who made papercraft.

P9:29:33 <PuyoDead> my god... I can look back on logs from '95
P9:29:38 <Darkebrz> I believe I was mostly wrong
P9:29:53 <Perogi> well then
P9:29:55 <citricsquid> Quatroking: That's my alt :D My main is level 25 or something.
P9:30:12 <citricsquid> I have ~30 accounts.
P9:30:12 <Quatroking> My main is tomfulp.newgrounds.com
P9:30:15 <Quatroking> take that
P9:30:15 <Perogi> lawl I was a newgrounder for like 6 months and thats it
P9:30:29 <citricsquid> I've been mentioned on the frontpage, TAKE THAT.
P9:30:43 <Quatroking> CITRIC
P9:30:46 <Perogi> you are a newground celebrity citric
P9:30:48 <Perogi> +1
P9:30:49 <Quatroking> YOU HAVE THE MAGICAL NUMBER OF POSTS
P9:30:49 <Eagle> I've never browsed the newgrounds forums.
P9:30:51 <Quatroking> 256
P9:30:54 <Quatroking> I love that number
P9:30:59 <citricsquid> Eagle: Don't, you'll regret it.
P9:31:02 <Perogi> ^
P9:31:06 <Eagle> :O
P9:31:25 <Quatroking> citricsquid, I once ruled the blogs
P9:31:29 <Quatroking> with hardcore troll parties
P9:31:30 <citricsquid> my main has 14124 posts and is ranked 60 in posts, but I have about 18k across all my accounts.
P9:31:45 <Quatroking> bobbyballer.newgrounds.com
P9:31:47 <Quatroking> my alt
P9:31:49 <Perogi> quatorking I do not believe there is such thing as a hardcore newground  troll
P9:31:53 <Quatroking> bobbyballers*
P9:31:57 <citricsquid> you cannot troll newgrounds.
P9:32:05 <Quatroking> the original got stolen after wade deleted it twice
P9:32:11 <Quatroking> TWICE
P9:32:20 <Perogi> similarly, people who frequent newgrounds can't troll
P9:32:45 <citricsquid> haha, I had my account permabanned twice =\
P9:32:50 <Quatroking> I need to make some new flash again
P9:33:01 <Perogi> doubt that was for trolling, probebly some lame forum drama :O
P9:33:01 <Darkebrz> citricsquid: How?
P9:33:07 <Perogi> amiright?
P9:33:15 <citricsquid> stealing accounts, accidentally.
P9:33:17 <Quatroking> I MAKE NICE MOVIES http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/485497
P9:33:20 <Perogi> accidently?
P9:33:22 <Darkebrz> Hahaha
P9:33:22 <Quatroking> hollywood quality baby
P9:33:23 <Perogi> do continue
P9:33:25 <Darkebrz> How does that work?
P9:33:56 <citricsquid> I built some site and a bunch of morons and I mean complete morons, it said in huge letters "DO NOT USE YOUR NEWGROUNDS PASSWORD" so they used it, then I accidentally gave someone account access and they stole the passwords and accounts.
P9:34:07 <Perogi> ololol
P9:34:10 <Darkebrz> hahahaha
P9:34:11 <Quatroking> lmao
P9:34:13 <citricsquid> so an admin locked my main account, then it got unlocked and locked again.
P9:34:17 <Perogi> I suppose that does qualify as accidental trolling
P9:34:19 <citricsquid> and now it's unlocked :D
P9:34:33 <Perogi> if that had been on purpose you would be a hero
P9:34:43 <Quatroking> http://bobbyballers.newgrounds.com/news/post/326239
P9:34:54 <citricsquid> I'll find the e-drama from it.
P9:34:56 <Quatroking> after I left the KK because that goddamn collab took over a year
P9:35:07 <Quatroking> got released a few days ago while we started in may 2008
P9:35:13 <Quatroking> ._.
P9:35:16 <Perogi> trolling and spamming the portal,
P9:35:18 <Nalok> What the fuck Quatro
P9:35:18 <Perogi> LOL
P9:35:29 <Nalok> :I

P9:35:50 <Perogi> no
P9:35:53 <Quatroking> the first post is epic
P9:36:02 <Quatroking> it features potato porn
P9:36:41 <Quatroking> This is a message to all you and all the BettyBallers on this site:
P9:36:41 <Quatroking> LEAVE. LEAVE FOREVER AND NEVER RETURN TO NEWGROUNDS OR ME AND THE ANTI-SPAM GROUP I WILL CREATE ONE DAY WILL COME AND GET YOU.

P9:37:41 <Perogi> hmmmmm sounds like sub-par internet drama
P9:37:43 <Quatroking> i leterally made a guy cry because i kept calling him fat
P9:37:50 <Quatroking> literally*
P9:37:54 <Perogi> lol but its easy to make insecure people cry

P10:15:18 <Perogi> :O

P11:24:55 <Moujave>           o 3.8 Server Directory
P11:24:56 <Moujave> [edit] How to make a server
P11:24:58 <Moujave> In order to create your own server, one must first download the server software from the multiplayer page of the Minecraft website, and forward the port they wish to use for their server, then simply follow the steps in the server software readme.
P11:24:58 <tortele> 23:24:25 JTE I'm asking $15 ... is that okay?
P11:24:59 <tortele> 23:24:48 JTE USD, paypal, will email the source code and any updates.
P11:24:59 <Moujave> For help with port forwarding, most players have gone to portforward.com.
P11:25:00 <tortele> OOP
P11:25:01 <tortele> SFUCK
P11:25:01 <Moujave> If all else fails, the Minecraft forums usually have a good information on hosting servers.
P11:25:02 <Moujave> [edit] Connecting to your local server
P11:25:04 <Moujave> Once your server is up, you start sending the external URL to your friends. If you have trouble logging in through the external URL, you can use the local IP to join yourself, make sure your logged in and use the following URL:
P11:25:05 <Moujave> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
P11:25:07 <Moujave> If you changed the port in the configuration file you'll have to change that in the URL too.
P11:25:08 <Moujave> If someone in the same network wants to connect to your server, that person will have to use the same link, but change the ip adress to the hoster's local ip adress.
P11:25:10 <Moujave> You might have trouble connecting to your own server while others can join without problems. This can be solved by changing "verify-names=true" to "verify-names=false" in the server.properties file.
P11:25:11 <Moujave> [edit] Different kinds of servers
P11:25:13 <Moujave> There are numerous kinds of Minecraft servers, usually distinguished by the level used in them or how players in them are supposed to behave. Most special types of servers rely on the use of map editors.
P11:25:14 <Moujave> [edit] Standard server
P11:25:16 <Moujave> A standard server with a normal map, usually allow players to build or destroy whatever they wish to. (Though most often griefing is against the rules)
P11:25:17 <Moujave> [edit] Flatgrass server
P11:25:19 <Moujave> An otherwise standard server whose level is not randomly generated, but is instead simply a vast grassy plain.
P11:25:20 <Moujave> [edit] Ocean Build server
P11:25:22 <Moujave> This kind of server usually consists of 100% water, or just mostly water, and generally encourage building underwater structures. These gained more prominence when sponges were added.
P11:25:23 <Moujave> [edit] Falling Lava server
P11:25:25 <Moujave> A server, usually with a small, blank map, with a single block of lava at the top of it. Players are intended to try and construct a shelter before the lava engulfs the area ("surviving"). It is usually reset afterwards.
P11:25:26 <Moujave> [edit] Roleplay server
P11:25:28 <Moujave> A server, usually with a normal map, where players are encouraged to take on roles and act as them in the game. Often, these servers will attempt to simulate settlement in some foreign land or similar, and require the gathering of resources to build structures.
P11:25:29 <Moujave> [edit] Spleef server
P11:25:31 <Moujave> This is a server, usually with a nonstandard map, that is dedicated to playing Spleef. These servers will tend to have much more extravagant Spleef arenas than a standard server might.
P11:25:32 <Moujave> [edit] Dome server
P11:25:34 <Moujave> Dome Servers Consist of large underwater domes made of glass or Unbreakable stone if an admin can't be on 24/7. (Usually because of flooding.)
P11:25:35 <Moujave> [edit] Server Directory
P11:25:37 <Moujave> Some servers have their own page, and are being listed in the Server directory. 
P11:25:38 <Moujave> there ya go

P11:49:00 <tortele> wtf
P11:49:17 <tortele> I don't even have a link any where except on another irc server
P11:49:17 <tortele> :l
P11:49:19 <tortele> haxor?
P11:49:25 <tortele> and he griefed our stuff
P11:49:41 <sKadoodle> mmm
P11:50:41 <Bbzx> thats why you do spawn traps
P11:50:48 <Bbzx> and you manually allow people out
P11:50:57 <Bbzx> then watch them for about 5 minutes
P11:51:05 <Bbzx> then leave them alone if they're not griefing
P11:52:26 <War> I did that, but after like 10 mins he griefed my house
P11:52:50 <Bbzx> sucks
P11:53:25 <sKadoodle> what's grief
P11:54:23 <Bbzx> when you screw with people's server
P11:54:28 <Bbzx> ruin their map, buildings etc
P11:54:43 <Bbzx> i once turned a church's crosses upside down :3
P11:55:00 <Darkebrz> Thats not bad grief though :/
P11:55:02 <Bbzx> admin was right there next to me, he said it was an improvement
P11:55:08 <Darkebrz> Haha
