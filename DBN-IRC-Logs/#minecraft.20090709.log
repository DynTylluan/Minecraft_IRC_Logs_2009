A8:26:12 <Azrael-> ATi HD3850 here, I get at least 90fps with no fog on a normal-sized map
A8:26:39 <^> Nvidia 8800gt here and i get around 50-45ish fps in morrowind
A8:27:19 <t3hk0d3> on my main computer w GFX 280 ive got around 100-200 fps
A8:27:26 <t3hk0d3> in minecraft
A8:27:31 <t3hk0d3> but notebook
A8:27:58 <t3hk0d3> arrrr
A8:29:12 <Quatroking> GTX280 here and I have an average of 400 on most maps with a lot of stuff built

A8:32:20 <t3hk0d3> GeForce FX GTX 280
A8:32:25 <Quatroking> Yeah
A8:32:47 <Quatroking> Well the fact I get higher framerates than you is probably because I've got a 3GHZ Quadcore or something

13A10:57:06 * citricsquid hugs wget
A10:57:27 <postlogic> Also, by client downloads he probably means the java applet download done by the browser.
A10:59:13 <Marach> will i be able to play the game without internet connection then?
A10:59:25 <postlogic> Probably not.
A10:59:30 <citricsquid> Single player, maybe
A10:59:32 <Marach> :/
A10:59:38 <Marach> yes singleplayer!
A10:59:51 <citricsquid> I have no idea why I said singleplayer, like it wasn't obvious :P

P1:32:09 <Quatroking> I just got in discussion with some 1337fag about how rap is terrible
P1:32:28 <Quatroking> he kept saying rap is awesome while the majority is just shit
P1:33:11 <fydo> I like the idea of rap
P1:33:18 <fydo> usually fails in execution though
P1:33:31 <citricsquid> the majority of rap is shit, but good rap is awesome.
P1:33:38 <fydo> citricsquid: yep
P1:33:58 <Quatroking> The only good rap song (that was actually a song!) I've heard so far is That's Just The Way It Is from 2pac
P1:34:11 <citricsquid> Listen to Jurassic 5 :D
P1:34:14 <citricsquid> awesome music.
P1:34:44 <Quatroking> The guy also claimed he listened to every genre there is
P1:35:01 <Quatroking> and a minute later he claimed rock, ska and classic suck
P1:35:23 <Quatroking> Where is notch when you need him
P1:35:32 <Quatroking> Gotta do a bugreport
P1:35:33 <citricsquid> People who say genres suck are twats, genre should be irrelevant.
P1:36:17 <fydo> but, genres do suck
P1:36:24 <fydo> there should be a better way of categorizing music
P1:36:40 <citricsquid> I meant, people who say specific genres suck, like "rock sucks!" or "pop sucks!"
P1:36:54 <fydo> there are lots of "alternative" bands that sound nothing alike
P1:37:13 <Quatroking> isn't that what alternative is supposed to be like
P1:37:33 <fydo> yeah, but it's like having an "other" category
P1:37:56 <fydo> not conducive to an efficient categorization system
P1:38:25 <Quatroking> What would you categorize this song in: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NNMHxqJp6A

P6:43:42 <Quatroking> hmm
P6:44:37 <lilith> shit man,their gonna own the world lol
P6:44:54 <Quatroking> They basically already do for a part
P6:45:12 <Quatroking> I mean, who doesn't use youtube and google
P6:46:33 <Quatroking> Well
P6:46:53 <Quatroking> Let's hope they can get game developers to make their games for Chrome OS too

P6:48:08 <Quatroking> They're already working with Adobe, so I can expect CS5 to come out on Chrome OS too
P6:53:05 <Quatroking> but maybe..
P6:53:14 <Quatroking> what if Google IS Microsoft all along?
P6:54:14 <Rroff> lol
P6:54:18 <Rroff> I don't see the point in that OS
P6:54:44 <Rroff> the main feature seems to be the ability to get emails and visit social websites without having to wait for the PC to boot up
P6:54:48 <Rroff> in which case just get a mobile phone
P6:55:09 <Quatroking> wait what
P6:55:14 <Quatroking> without waiting for the pc to boot up?
P6:55:33 <Rroff> well the OS seems to be geared around "instantly on"
P6:55:46 <Rroff> but meh
P6:55:52 <Quatroking> You do know every Linux distribution pretty much has that right
P6:55:55 <Rroff> once you start actually using it I bet it won't be that fast
P6:56:12 <Rroff> pretty much every OS has the ability to hybernate
P6:56:15 <Quatroking> Well, i hope it turns out good
P6:56:25 <Rroff> thats cheating imo and rarely actually works well
P6:56:46 <Rroff> if I want to be able to instantly access email and stuff I turn to my phone
P6:56:48 <Quatroking> Linux always had faster boot times on my desktop than windows :P
P6:56:49 <Rroff> its always on
P6:56:58 <Rroff> depends
P6:57:01 <Quatroking> true true
P6:57:09 <Rroff> my stripped down XP builds boot in around 20 seconds from power on
P6:57:13 <Quatroking> I need to get a blackberry or something
P6:57:26 <Quatroking> something that actually has some features
P6:57:37 <Rroff> I have the xperia
P6:57:38 <Quatroking> my current cellphone doesn't even support midi ringtones
P6:57:59 <Rroff> not the greatest phone as phones go, but can't beat 800x480 touchscreen for internet browsing
P6:58:11 <Quatroking> sweet
P6:58:35 <Rroff> great looking phone as well imo

P10:17:42 <yihff> wow?
P10:17:50 <yihff> they do it that long?
P10:18:04 <yihff> then why do people upload in 10-15 minute length things?
P10:18:23 <Animator> I just don't know.
P10:18:41 <Animator> Those kinds of question are up there with infinity and pi. We'll never understand.
P10:18:56 <Quatroking> isn't youtube only limited to filesize?
P10:19:53 <Animator> But then the ones with an hour long movie should be huge.
P10:20:08 <Animator> And couldn't be one hour. Could they?
P10:20:14 <Quatroking> the quality wasn't that bad actually
P10:20:28 <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppUl_CBuyz8
P10:20:29 <Quatroking> That one
P10:20:37 <Quatroking> for a gmod movie, it was pretty nicely done.
P10:22:01 <Quatroking> search on full movie, then sort on durations longer than 20 minutes and you easily get a load of 1 hour movies
P10:25:01 <Animator> Alright, what the hell.

P10:29:37 <Animator> A friend showed it to me once.
P10:30:20 <Animator> God, that introduction puts me to sleep.
P10:30:45 <Animator> It's so 80's oldschool, and not in the good way.
P10:30:55 <Quatroking> fffffff
P10:30:57 <Quatroking> uuuu
P10:30:59 <Quatroking> ccccc

P10:48:33 <Quatroking> three days ago the main page had around 2000 and its now already over 8000
P10:48:36 <marshalkowski> anyone have any troubleshooting experience with macs for minecraft?
P10:49:04 <Quatroking> Nope, all I've researched so far is Windows
P10:49:32 <Quatroking> Say, there are intel-compatible macs right?
P10:49:44 <Quatroking> you know, x86?
P10:49:52 <marshalkowski> most are these days
P10:50:10 <Quatroking> I should get an iso or something and install Mac in a virtual box
P10:50:47 <Quatroking> um
P10:50:55 <Quatroking> macs do have cd's with the OS on it right
P10:51:02 <marshalkowski> yep
10P10:51:29 * Prime_2 is now known as Prime|otherstuff
P10:51:45 <Quatroking> aaaand OS/2 is mac?
P10:52:00 <Quatroking> oh wait
P10:52:02 <Quatroking> nevermind
P10:52:05 <Quatroking> OSX is
P10:52:22 <marshalkowski> yeah
P10:52:43 <marshalkowski> I played Minecraft earlier today on an older mac and it worked fine
P10:53:02 <marshalkowski> but when I play it at home (newer computer), none of the keyboard commands work
P10:53:35 <Quatroking> Yeah I hope Notch comes on soon, I've got two bugreports ready for him regarding the keyboard commands
P10:53:42 <Quatroking> they don't work when in menu's :/
P10:54:40 <Quatroking> so when you have the block menu open for example you can press M all you want but the crappy music will just continue to cause cancer in your airdrums
P10:54:53 <Quatroking> same goes for the general game menu
P10:54:56 <marshalkowski> lol
