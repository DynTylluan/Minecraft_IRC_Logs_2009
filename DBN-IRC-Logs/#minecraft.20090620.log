A1:19:38 <Syndlig> Nope.
A1:19:40 <Syndlig> Which is good.
A1:19:42 <Syndlig> Question.
A1:19:49 <Syndlig> How does one go about changing textures for the game?
A1:19:58 <Kapow> hack it?
A1:20:00 <Syndlig> I wanna replace the glass one with one less hideous.
A1:20:05 <Syndlig> Well how do I go about hacking it?

A1:20:32 <Kapow> by learning how to hack
A1:20:32 <Bobo> i like the glass texture
A1:21:15 <Kapow> goddammit the client keeps crashing when I try to connect
A1:21:32 <Syndlig> How can you like the glass texture?
A1:21:39 <Syndlig> It looks nothing like glass and is hard as fuck to see through.
A1:21:47 <Syndlig> It's better to just have nothing there than the glass.  :x
A1:21:48 <Maulrus> cause he does?
A1:21:48 <Maulrus> >_>
A1:21:49 <Kapow> did you update your server or what
A1:21:56 <Maulrus> glass isn't too terrible
A1:21:56 <Syndlig> Yes, yes I did.
A1:22:03 <Kapow> how can you say it's hard to see through then
A1:22:11 <Syndlig> Because the whole thing has massive white lines in it.
A1:22:14 <Kapow> it's completely transparent with a couple lines over it
A1:22:24 <Maulrus> the lines re there to make it visible
A1:22:34 <Syndlig> When you put two panes of glass next to one another you shouldn't be able to easily tell them apart, except you can because of the huge white border and the streaks of white.
A1:22:45 <Syndlig> I mean, really, how do you fuck up glass?  o.O
A1:22:53 <Bobo> ?
A1:22:55 <Kapow> so you want it to be invisible?
A1:23:00 <Maulrus> Because WE begged him to release it today for bugtesting
A1:23:05 <Bobo> i like how its obvious blocks
A1:23:07 <Syndlig> There's other alternatives.
A1:23:08 <Maulrus> Notch SAID he was gonna fix it
A1:23:10 <Syndlig> Such as
A1:23:10 <Bobo> its like a big ice block
A1:23:12 <Kapow> like what?
A1:23:14 <Maulrus> so just stop complaining
A1:23:21 <Syndlig> Not blindingly white streaks of crap on it
A1:23:29 <Syndlig> There's a thing called transparency and subtlety.
A1:23:38 <Maulrus> Syndlig: BE PATIENT
A1:23:41 <Maulrus> it's in alpha
A1:23:52 <Maulrus> he can make a mistake once in a while, especially if we were the ones to rush him to release it
A1:23:54 <Syndlig> Maulrus:  NO THANKS
A1:23:56 <Syndlig> I'd prefer not to :D
A1:24:00 <Syndlig> I wasn't.
A1:24:05 <Kapow> why do you call it a mistake
A1:24:15 <Maulrus> because notch himself isn't satisfied with it
A1:24:16 <Maulrus> >_>
A1:24:22 <Syndlig> It's less a mistake and more the inability to make a good looking glass texture.
A1:24:34 <Syndlig> It wouldn't be nearly as bad if he just made all the lines be 25% opaque.
A1:24:45 <Syndlig> And remove the godawful border lines.
A1:24:55 <Maulrus> Just cause he didn't make it perfect doesn't mean he has an inability to make good glass
A1:24:56 <Droqen> That was tried at the beginning
A1:24:58 <Syndlig> Then the glass is still obvious but it's not ugly.
A1:24:58 <Maulrus> he just hasn't yet
A1:25:04 <Kapow> he tried partial transparency and it was screwy
A1:25:06 <Droqen> Transparencies in multiple layers aren't happy.
A1:25:10 <Droqen> (for the engine)
A1:25:38 <Syndlig> Then don't make it 0% and 100%, make the whole thing like 10% or something
A1:25:47 <Syndlig> You don't have to have picture perfect vision, glass can have a tint to it.
A1:25:55 <Kapow> are you listening
A1:25:58 <Syndlig> It's just absolutely awful with the white lines.
A1:26:00 <Kapow> it can't be 10%
A1:26:21 <Kapow> otherwise it looks weird combined with water
A1:26:26 <Syndlig> I'm pretty sure it can be whatever it wants, since Notch owns and programs the code and can add it in.
A1:26:42 <Kapow> ...with the current engine
A1:26:50 <Maulrus> you don't need to be all literal, you know what he means
A1:27:08 <Syndlig> Still doesn't change the fact it's godawful.
A1:27:09 <Kapow> if he rewrites the graphics code to handle multi-layer semi-transparency then yes, it can be that
A1:27:15 <Kapow> he hasn't done that
A1:27:30 <Kapow> come back tomorrow and complain while he's here
A1:27:40 <Kapow> we can't do shit about it
A1:27:41 <Droqen> We should subdue him now
A1:27:45 <Maulrus> come back tomorrow and get argued even more
A1:27:50 <Droqen> There are more important things than pretty glass ;p
A1:28:03 <Kapow> like bringing back sand and stone
10A1:28:13 * paul|not (grif392@209.65.247.45) has joined #minecraft
A1:28:15 <Droqen> and survival
A1:28:17 <Droqen> GRIF :D
A1:28:36 <Syndlig> I doubt Survival's anywhere near on the pipeline.
A1:28:43 <Droqen> I'm curious, what does paul|not mean?
A1:28:47 <Maulrus> ... why
A1:28:53 <Maulrus> when Notch has said that he's working on it
A1:28:59 <Syndlig> Especially with hacking, griefing and most planned features are still nowhere near implementation.
A1:29:10 <Syndlig> err, hacking and griefing are rampant and
A1:29:30 <Droqen> Notch said something like a week for... going into beta. Not to say that's going to be how long it's going to be, but it gives a general time frame of not forever.
A1:29:35 <Maulrus> I hope notch adds in pay-only servers
A1:29:39 <Droqen> Does anyone remember what he said?
A1:29:47 <Maulrus> griefing would drop intensely
A1:30:06 <Roras> hm
A1:30:20 <paul|not> Droqen: I'm paul, but there's another paul on this server
A1:30:24 <Droqen> ah
A1:30:27 <paul|not> so I am paul but not that paul.
A1:30:28 <Droqen> Alright, I see
A1:30:30 <Droqen> xD
A1:30:32 <Roras> cant you just make a private server
A1:30:39 <Maulrus> paul, who is a ghost
A1:30:44 <Droqen> Roras; then the problem is you don't get that many new players
A1:30:46 <Maulrus> not if you want to attract new people
A1:30:47 <Roras> oh
A1:30:48 <Maulrus> yeah
A1:30:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'd like to see password protected servers
A1:30:50 <Roras> tru
A1:30:57 <Roras> hmm
A1:31:31 <Roras> heres an idea: one makes a website, asks people to register. anyone who registers get a password to the server they have
A1:31:31 <paul|not> yeah, private servers are good for posting on communities though
A1:32:00 <Roras> hows that sound

A1:38:16 <Bobo> haha thats cool
A1:38:21 <Droqen> Annihilator: You should try looking at some sprites of him - you're missing a lot of key features and colours D:
A1:38:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> very nice indeed
A1:38:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> well i did try looking at the very basic one :v
A1:38:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> aka the sprite
A1:38:38 <LazyWaffle> THIS GAME IS DUMB
A1:38:41 <paul|not> my quote is terrible
A1:38:42 <LazyWaffle> I CAN'T MINE FOR CLAMS
A1:38:43 <Droqen> Although I do like that it's more detailed than single-colour
A1:38:47 <paul|not> I need a good skin idea
A1:38:50 <paul|not> butler was okay
A1:38:54 <LazyWaffle> This game needs more clams
A1:38:56 <paul|not> my quote is terrible
A1:38:57 <LazyWaffle> amirite
A1:38:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> red pants fluffy hair and black shirt
A1:39:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> no hat because it looks really weird if he does
A1:39:15 <Droqen> red hat with white block
A1:39:18 <Droqen> well, okay, pff.
A1:39:20 <Droqen> White skin
A1:39:23 <Droqen> Like, WHITE white
A1:39:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> white white yellowish tan white
A1:39:32 <FoxBlitzz> Antenna thing too
A1:39:54 <Droqen> yes, those
A1:40:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> i also tried to make a karoshi skin but the resolution ain't big enough to give it enough details
A1:40:05 <Droqen> Green Antennae?
A1:40:15 <paul|not> hmm
A1:40:18 <paul|not> iji skin might be decent
A1:40:21 <paul|not> hard to do though
A1:40:43 <Super-Dot> If a server hasn't updated, is it still displayed in the server list?
A1:40:47 <FoxBlitzz> Heh, I have an idea for a skin just now
A1:40:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> i think so
A1:40:50 <LazyWaffle> Make a GBA Max Payne skin
A1:41:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> i joined a server where sponges were still dsiappearing randomly
A1:41:17 <paul|not> yeah it's a server update
A1:41:17 <LazyWaffle> it's a server that hasn't restarted yet
A1:41:18 <Kapow> anything .19 will still work
A1:41:35 <LazyWaffle> Any private servers I can join?
A1:41:36 <Kapow> if it's .18 then it'll say something about a protocol error
A1:41:52 <paul|not> I would let you join tigland but I'm not on to op it
A1:42:07 <LazyWaffle> are there any ops on?
A1:42:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you want a good pub just use cyanide's :v

A1:44:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't get the point of huge pub servers if you want to build properly
A1:44:34 <paul|not> yeah huge pub servers are just for messing around
A1:44:37 <paul|not> you'll never get anything done
A1:44:56 <LazyWaffle> so can you invite me?
A1:45:02 <LazyWaffle> i actually have a TIGS account
A1:45:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> so do i but i barely post :v
A1:45:14 <paul|not> well then check the forum

A3:12:39 <Bobo> pretty fun
A3:12:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah yeah we knw that...
A3:12:55 <Bobo> i dunno, just the first game that doesnt work on vista that came to mind
A3:13:11 <Bobo> where is Notch from?
A3:13:13 <vdgmprgrmr> But liq3 seemed amazingly... something... regarding it.
A3:13:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch is Swedish.

A3:14:13 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno. He's prolly originally Swedish.
A3:14:14 <Bobo> fair enough
A3:14:17 <Bobo> doesnt matter really
A3:14:28 <Bobo> i did get the feeling that a lot of the minecraft community were swedish
A3:14:33 <Bobo> or something close
A3:15:15 <vdgmprgrmr> More indie game devs/players are from scandinavian countries than with other games.
A3:15:30 <Roras> hmm
A3:15:41 <Roras> you mean balkan countries?

A7:02:16 <Roras> at least something that doesnt make me fall asleep
A7:02:20 <postlogic> Also, what the hell are you doing on IRC then?
A7:02:32 <vdgmprgrmr> IRC is active.
A7:02:41 <postlogic> It is based upon reading.
A7:02:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Reading from a page is static and unchanging.
A7:02:50 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not the reading that's bad.
A7:02:57 <Roras> its the activity
A7:02:57 <vdgmprgrmr> It's the static and unchangingness.
A7:03:03 <Roras> that i need
A7:03:11 <Roras> wait
A7:03:14 <vdgmprgrmr> (Although I don't mind reading for knowledge.)
A7:03:49 <Roras> i dont like to read unless it allows me to progress. reading stupid novels is pointless because its much easier to look at a picture
A7:04:04 <Roras> oops... disregard the "stupid" part in there
A7:04:19 <vdgmprgrmr> But novels allow for much more detail.
A7:04:28 <Roras> not exactly...
A7:04:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, exactly.
A7:05:01 <vdgmprgrmr> It'd be hard for a picture to describe as much about an apple as fifteen pages could.
A7:05:21 <Roras> but its not as efficient
A7:05:35 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not as efficient as what?
A7:05:46 <Roras> the point of life is to do everything you can in the least amount of time.
A7:05:51 <vdgmprgrmr> If it's the only thing that can do it, it's as efficient as you can get.
A7:06:08 <vdgmprgrmr> And because "efficient" is a relative term, it is, by definition, extremely efficient.
A7:06:46 <Roras> er...
A7:06:48 <Roras> Acting or producing effectively with a minimum of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.
A7:07:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Key term, *unnecessary*
A7:07:03 <Roras> a minimum of unnecessary effort
A7:07:07 <vdgmprgrmr> And *minimum*
A7:07:21 <vdgmprgrmr> If it's the only thing that can do it, it is obviously minimum.
A7:07:24 <Roras> i dont want to read, so i can look.
A7:07:50 <vdgmprgrmr> So, yeah, pictures take less effort, but they also hold much less information.
A7:08:15 <Roras> hmm. pictures hold opinions, words hold facts. both are wrong.
A7:08:25 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A7:08:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Pictures can only hold facts.
A7:08:41 <vdgmprgrmr> (Assuming we're talking about photographic images.)
A7:08:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Words can hold both.
A7:08:59 <akuryo> yeah
A7:09:00 <vdgmprgrmr> And facts are definitively not wrong.
A7:09:15 <akuryo> i agree vdgmprgrmr
A7:09:16 <Roras> pictures dont hold facts in the mind of human
A7:09:18 <vdgmprgrmr> That's what they are. If they're wrong, they're not facts.
A7:09:21 <akuryo> (not c/c for you name, =D)
A7:09:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Words are the only things that can convey as much detail as words can.
A7:10:07 <akuryo> erm
A7:10:10 <akuryo> actually no
A7:10:15 <akuryo> erm
A7:10:22 <akuryo> told words have more info
A7:10:31 <akuryo> because of the tone, emotions...etc
A7:10:31 <Roras> actions hold more detail than words
A7:10:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Still words, my friend.
A7:10:37 <akuryo> yeah
A7:10:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And no, actions have more consequense than words.
A7:10:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Words can convey actions as well, so...
A7:10:58 <akuryo> but readed worded and listened words are different
A7:11:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Still words.
A7:11:14 <akuryo> lol
A7:11:56 <Roras> but humans do not breathe words
A7:11:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Words can convey information regarding each of the five senses, and things that aren't sensory, such as exact history and exact future.
A7:12:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Pictures can only convey exact information regarding visuals, while all other things must be inferred.
A7:12:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Thus, requiring MORE mental input if you want to glean even half the detail words can give you.
A7:12:59 <Bobobo> i tried handing in one and a half pictures instead of a 1500 word essay once
A7:13:13 <postlogic> Did you pass?
A7:13:18 <Bobobo> my lecturer did not get the joke
A7:13:23 <Bobobo> i had done the essay as well
A7:13:25 <postlogic> Aw :(
A7:13:26 <Bobobo> so i passed
A7:13:46 <Roras> well
A7:14:02 <Roras> conveying isnt the same as experiencing
A7:14:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, images are incapable of conveying conceptual things and abstracts.
A7:14:18 <Roras> you must experience something before you can convey it
A7:14:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I challenge you to give me the Communist Manifesto, with no words. Only images allowed.
A7:14:51 <Roras> i dont even know what that is
A7:15:41 <Roras> but even so, words cannot be 100% accurate
A7:15:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes they can.
A7:15:49 <Roras> how so
A7:16:46 <vdgmprgrmr> With enough words, you can describe anything.
A7:16:55 <Roras> but not accurate enough
A7:17:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, accurately.
A7:17:09 <Roras> not as accurate as the real thing
A7:17:31 <vdgmprgrmr> It is theoretically possible to outline the location of each and every molecule or subatomic particle in any object.
A7:17:41 <vdgmprgrmr> In words.
A7:17:45 <Roras> the only way to know if something is 100% true is to experience it for yourself
A7:17:46 <innkpr> ah, but the real thing was a picture originally
A7:17:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, not a picture.
A7:17:57 <vdgmprgrmr> An object.
A7:18:05 <innkpr> a picture in your head
A7:18:09 <Roras> thoughts
A7:18:13 <vdgmprgrmr> And words can convey the history of the object as well.
A7:18:24 <vdgmprgrmr> And the future.
A7:18:30 <Roras> but words arent what we do... therefore they cant be 100% accurate
A7:18:42 <Roras> we dont breathe words
A7:18:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Man, you're talking about different things entirely.
A7:18:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Actions aren't images.
A7:19:04 <Roras> actions arent words either
A7:19:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I realize this. Rendering actions completely irrelevant.
A7:19:20 <innkpr> when you describe something to someone, they see a mental picture
A7:19:26 <Roras> they are only *conveyed* as words
A7:19:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep, you're describing it with words, aren't you?

A7:19:40 <Roras> it doesnt mean that they are actually words
A7:19:52 <innkpr> yes, and they turn it into a picture, more like movie
A7:19:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, yeah, if you're describing with words, you're describing it with words.
A7:20:20 <vdgmprgrmr> There are still things that can't be described without words.
A7:20:40 <vdgmprgrmr> And there is nothing that can't be described without pictures.
A7:21:06 <Roras> hm
A7:21:17 <innkpr> you know how some things are best explained with one of those simplified computer animations?
A7:21:47 <Roras> but, before you experience words, you must have had actions
A7:21:51 <vdgmprgrmr> You know all the knowledge in computer animations can be taught with words as well?
A7:22:02 <innkpr> well anything that words convey, is instantly turned into an animation in our head by our powerful graphics processor of abrain
10A7:22:07 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
A7:22:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, you're just bringing in actions again, and we've already shown that they are irrelevant.
A7:22:17 <Roras> hm
A7:22:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah?
A7:22:29 <Roras> so if words didnt exist
A7:22:30 <vdgmprgrmr> How about love?
A7:22:39 <vdgmprgrmr> If I say "love" what image pops into your head?
A7:22:40 <Roras> you feel love
A7:22:55 <Roras> hmm
A7:23:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Pictures are incapable of describing abstract, or conceptual things.

A7:23:14 <innkpr> i dunno, the combined cultural experience of many years pops into my head
A7:23:15 <Roras> and are portrayed as opinions
A7:23:17 <vdgmprgrmr> When I say "democracy" what image pops into your head?
A7:23:19 <rubikd> hey guys
A7:23:23 <Roras> and are portrayed as opinions
A7:23:30 <innkpr> and those experiences are all video
A7:23:32 <rubikd> what's the deal with sponge? it was working fine earlier, now it disappears?
A7:24:20 <vdgmprgrmr> I would like for anyone here, to, in an image, describe to me a full explanation of the core concepts of democracy.
A7:24:21 <rubikd> earleier this morning it lasted 30+ mins, now it decays anywhere between 30 seconds and a few minutes
A7:24:22 <Roras> um
A7:24:28 <innkpr> when i hear democracy i think of the process of democracy, which is a little animation showing many people deciding
A7:24:42 <vdgmprgrmr> That isn't necessarily democracy.
A7:24:55 <Roras> without action, word is nonexistant
A7:24:56 <innkpr> well the more words you add, the more pictures i add
A7:24:59 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'd say it's awfully inaccurate compared to what can be gained by someone just telling you.
A7:25:02 <Roras> without action, word is nonexistant
A7:25:06 <vdgmprgrmr> And again, actions are irrelevant.
A7:25:10 <Roras> but
A7:25:13 <vdgmprgrmr> We've already been through this.
A7:25:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, four times.
A7:25:22 <Roras> the only way words could ever have been made
A7:25:25 <Roras> was by action
A7:25:30 <vdgmprgrmr> WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
A7:25:34 <Roras> you need to speak to give words
A7:25:47 <innkpr> so how did this argument end when words didn't exist?
A7:25:52 <Roras> well
A7:25:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Which doesn't have ANYTHING AT ALL to do with whether or not words are accurate?
A7:25:56 <vdgmprgrmr> It didn't!
A7:26:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Er, that question mark should be an exclamation point.
A7:26:23 <Roras> i still think one's own experience is better than words

A7:26:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Can you describe one's full experiences with an image?
A7:26:47 <Roras> yes
A7:26:47 <innkpr> not a single one
A7:26:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Can you show their mental processes?
A7:26:56 <innkpr> well maybe if you tiled it
A7:26:57 <Roras> yes
A7:27:02 <vdgmprgrmr> You can?
A7:27:03 <Roras> yes
A7:27:07 <Roras> thought bubbles
A7:27:09 <Roras> lol
A7:27:11 <vdgmprgrmr> In such a way that any human would be able to understand it.
A7:27:16 <Roras> yes]
A7:27:21 <innkpr> thought bubbles with more pictures in them
A7:27:21 <vdgmprgrmr> In perfect detail.
A7:27:25 <Roras> mhm
A7:27:32 <innkpr> thought bubbles with video
A7:27:52 <innkpr> years worth of video compressed into 1 second
A7:28:30 <innkpr> now about smell, i dunno how you could accurately convey that with a picture or with words
A7:28:38 <Roras> pictures can be explained by words, and words can be explained by pictures
A7:28:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Smell? Can be conveyed with words.
A7:28:45 <Roras> therefore, they are both accurate
A7:28:47 <Roras> yes
A7:28:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course, relational words, but still words.
A7:29:01 <innkpr> "smells like pine cones"
A7:29:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Not all words can be explained with pictures.
A7:29:10 <Roras> put a nose and a pinecone
A7:29:15 <Roras> yeah
A7:29:16 <innkpr> picture of a pine cone
A7:29:25 <Roras> give us an example vdgm
A7:29:37 <innkpr> he tried with democracy
A7:29:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, no, having a nose next to a pine cone does not directly indicate that it smells like a pinecone.
A7:29:51 <vdgmprgrmr> And no one ever managed to describe the full concept of democracy with pictures.
A7:30:21 <vdgmprgrmr> If nose+pinecone=smells like pinecone then how do you show "a nose near a pinecone"?
A7:30:23 <Roras> but it doesnt mean that words are all humankind know how to portray things
A7:30:23 <innkpr> how about a video of the atoms bonding to the smell receptors, and then an image of a pine cone appears in the head?
A7:30:55 <Roras> not everyone can understand words
A7:30:55 <vdgmprgrmr> What's that? Two thingies bonded and then some guy got a pinecone in his head?
A7:31:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Sounds gory.
A7:31:05 <Roras> not everyone can understand pictures
A7:31:15 <Roras> you can only go as far as you know
A7:31:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Just because not everyone can understand them, does not mean they are inaccurate.
A7:31:38 <innkpr> well words are basically predefined concepts
A7:31:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I know absolutely zero assembler, but it's way more accurate than any other programming language.
A7:31:56 <Roras> nobody said they were accurate either
A7:31:57 <innkpr> when you think of a concept, do you think in terms of video?
A7:32:19 <vdgmprgrmr> When I think of "a concept" do I think in video?
A7:32:20 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A7:32:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Not at all.
A7:32:29 <vdgmprgrmr> I think in words.
A7:32:33 <innkpr> i mean a concept like smell
A7:32:38 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A7:32:46 <Roras> hm
A7:32:51 <innkpr> then how was it first described to you?
A7:32:58 <vdgmprgrmr> It never was.
A7:33:02 <innkpr> how did you learn the word "smell" ?
A7:33:04 <vdgmprgrmr> It's instinctive.
A7:33:05 <Roras> innkpr are you left handed
A7:33:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I was taught the word "smell"
A7:33:18 <innkpr> no
A7:33:20 <Roras> oh
A7:33:23 <vdgmprgrmr> How would one learn the word for "smell"?
A7:34:00 <innkpr> well your parents would do some action and repeat the word "smell" in different ways
A7:34:05 <Roras> how would we know if the word smell is even correct? for all we know it could have been something completely different in the past
A7:34:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Possibly.
A7:34:13 <Roras> think about it
A7:34:17 <Roras> latin...
A7:34:20 <vdgmprgrmr> So how does one learn what "a concept" is.
A7:34:21 <Roras> latin is words, yes?
A7:34:40 <Roras> was lating completely precise to every word?
A7:34:41 <vdgmprgrmr> How do you describe the very concept of conceptual things with images?
A7:34:43 <innkpr> you don't learn, you just use it like you've seen it used
A7:35:10 <Roras> you only go as far as you know
A7:35:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Not important...
A7:35:21 <Roras> well
A7:35:22 <innkpr> what im getting at is that words are condensed images
A7:35:30 <innkpr> they are the same things
A7:35:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope.
A7:35:43 <innkpr> condensed concepts then?
A7:35:53 <vdgmprgrmr> More or less, but not all concepts are images.
A7:36:05 <Roras> not all concepts are words either
A7:36:07 <vdgmprgrmr> And some things are condensed images.
A7:36:16 <vdgmprgrmr> No, every single concept can be described in words.
A7:36:53 <vdgmprgrmr> But most of the images packed in with words are also accompanied by other words.
A7:37:01 <innkpr> what is a concept, but an idea in your head?
A7:37:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep.
A7:37:13 <vdgmprgrmr> That's what it is.
A7:37:14 <wingboy> its 1337 o'clock
A7:37:23 <Roras> so ideas are btter than words
A7:37:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, yeah.
A7:37:37 <Roras> so then whats all this about accuracy
A7:37:43 <vdgmprgrmr> It's most accurate.
A7:37:44 <Roras> if ideas are better than words
A7:38:00 <innkpr> what idea in your head is not something you experienced, something that is not a memory from one of your senses?
A7:38:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, can you just telepathically link my brain up to your ideas?
A7:38:11 <vdgmprgrmr> And how can you gain new ideas without seeing or reading?

A7:38:46 <Roras> there is no such thing as accuracy... accuracy is only a thing that people made words for.
A7:38:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, you all seem to be working from the assumption that if x is an extension of y, that x cannot be more accurate than y.
A7:38:55 <Vahue> i just got pmed it
A7:38:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is false.
A7:39:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh my gosh! That means accuracy is A CONCEPT.
A7:39:33 <innkpr> i think we would have to understand how our brain processes knowledge before we can finish this debate
A7:39:35 <Roras> you cant explain HOW accurate a word or words are
A7:39:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes you can.
A7:39:46 <Roras> how
A7:40:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Simply, but it would depend on the situation.
A7:40:05 <Roras> lol
A7:40:10 <Roras> explain to me
A7:40:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, if someone says to me "Drinking glasses are always yellow." I could show that statement's level of inaccuracy with "No, not all drinking glasses are yellow."

A7:42:35 <vdgmprgrmr> And you could possibly even show that statement's level of inaccuracy by require it state the concept of what a drinking glass is.
A7:42:47 <Roras> you cant explain how accurate something is. for instance, lets say "He Loves her." well, how much does he love her? you could say "he loves her more than anything in the world." how accurate is that?
A7:43:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Probably very inaccurate.
A7:43:08 <Roras> hm.
A7:43:24 <Roras> i just realized one thing
A7:43:50 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A7:43:51 <Roras> words are pictures that are organized in the mind.
A7:43:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, not always.
A7:43:59 <Roras> this W
A7:44:07 <innkpr> what if we didn't have mouths, and we communicated through complex gestures that stood in for concepts.
A7:44:08 <vdgmprgrmr> How about the word "concept"
A7:44:14 <Roras> iwell
A7:44:16 <Roras> i see
A7:44:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Does that have an image?
A7:44:18 <Roras> a C
A7:44:23 <Roras> it is a character
A7:44:26 <innkpr> it's a picture that i know means "concept"

A7:46:03 <Roras> er...
A7:46:10 <Roras> not if you dont know how to
A7:46:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, simply not knowing how to do it doesn't mean it's inaccurate.
A7:46:37 <vdgmprgrmr> It simply shows a failure on the part of the person.
A7:46:56 <innkpr> how about an easier word. like "dog"

A7:49:38 <wingboy> longest discussion on irc between 2 people ever
A7:49:42 <Roras> 3*
A7:49:42 <vdgmprgrmr> No, that makes the people of earth incapable of forming words.

A7:50:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Not necessarily.
A7:50:11 <Roras> hm
A7:50:15 <vdgmprgrmr> But even a lack of existence doesn't make something inaccurate.
A7:50:23 <Roras> er...
A7:50:30 <Roras> thats kinda contradicting
A7:50:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Telepathic link between brains would be the most accurate.
A7:50:39 <vdgmprgrmr> But telepathic link does not exist.
A7:50:42 <innkpr> i agree. it's the same territory as "a tree falling in the woods with no one around to hear it. does it make a sound?"
A7:50:59 <Roras> huh?
A7:51:01 <Bobobo> of course it makes a fucking sound
A7:51:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Don't go off-topic.
A7:51:15 <Bobobo> we're about as real as a tree
A7:51:20 <vdgmprgrmr> That's just annoying.
A7:51:27 <Bobobo> so why does us being there have anything to do with its existance being true?
A7:51:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Stop it.
A7:51:43 <innkpr> im just saying that a computer would be useful
A7:51:49 <Roras> we are talking about accuracy of words/pictures/ideas
A7:51:49 <Bobobo> if i fall over in my house, but theres no trees around to hear it, do i really fall?
A7:51:52 <Roras> we are talking about accuracy of words/pictures/ideas
A7:52:01 <Roras> hahah
A7:52:03 <Roras> LOl
A7:52:16 <Roras> trees dont hear
A7:52:33 <innkpr> i thought we were talking about which was more rudimentary, the word or the picture.
A7:52:59 <Roras> accurate, not rudimentary
A7:53:04 <vdgmprgrmr> A force-field that doesn't allow any projectiles meant to be offensive weapons inside its borders, that covers an entire nation would be way more useful than existent systems would be to any country, but that doesn't exist. Does that mean that it is useless?
A7:53:17 <innkpr> actually, whether or not a word can replace a picture and vice versa
A7:53:18 <Roras> yes
A7:53:24 <Roras> because it cant be used
A7:53:34 <Roras> it is not available to the user
A7:53:34 <vdgmprgrmr> It could be used if it existed.
A7:53:46 <Roras> huh
A7:54:05 <citricsquid> It depends whether or not you're talking about the idea and theory, or the actual thing. The idea/theory of it is useful, but the actual 'thing' isn't, because it doesn't exist.
A7:54:06 <vdgmprgrmr> How about this: Laser guns are useless.
A7:54:12 <Roras> but it doesnt exist in the portrayal you jsut said
A7:54:13 <innkpr> i think the problem comes from the word "useless"
A7:54:42 <Roras> hm
A7:54:52 <Roras> so
A7:54:58 <Roras> which is the most accurate
A7:55:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Either way, words can convey more information than images can.
A7:55:10 <innkpr> sometimes
A7:55:11 <Roras> thats not true
A7:55:23 <Roras> not all the time can they
A7:55:27 <innkpr> they both have their areas of strengths
A7:55:29 <vdgmprgrmr> You can use words to describe every image you can ever possibly see.
A7:55:43 <Roras> but each word only goes to one picture
A7:55:43 <vdgmprgrmr> You can not use images to describe every combination of words you might ever come across.

A7:55:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Words have more in them than a simple picture.
A7:56:06 <Roras> lol
A7:56:15 <innkpr> well now we have to define a picture
A7:56:16 <Roras> you only use one word for every picture
A7:56:24 <Roras> or a few words
A7:56:32 <vdgmprgrmr> A single word, if you are REQUIRED to show it in images, could require far more than one image.
A7:56:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Not always.
A7:56:46 <Roras> hm
A7:56:51 <vdgmprgrmr> One could easily use a thousand or more words to describe a picture.
10A7:56:57 * AlLnAtuRalX (kingnerd@pool-71-125-32-74.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
A7:57:00 <innkpr> yes
A7:57:12 <Roras> well
A7:57:22 <innkpr> and a word can be described with thousands of pictures
A7:57:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe.
A7:57:54 <Roras> accuracy is nothing without a base factor
A7:58:04 <innkpr> it might take a lifetime's worth of ultrasuper HD video, but it would work
A7:58:16 <Roras> what are we talking about
A7:58:22 <Roras> um
A7:58:28 <vdgmprgrmr> And if you want to take that route (which I don't), you state that words and pictures are equal, therefore, we must observe some other qualities, such as efficiency. And pictures take far more space than words do.
A7:58:31 <Roras> accuracy to what
A7:58:37 <Roras> what are words accurate to
A7:58:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, accuracy compared to raw thoughts.
A7:58:48 <Roras> raw thoughts
A7:58:49 <innkpr> if i had to describe "my life in a nutshell" in pictures, it would take a lot of pictures.
A7:58:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Which we've agreed are as accurate as you can possible get.
A7:58:59 <Roras> oh
A7:59:08 <Roras> i was talking about accuracy to the person
A7:59:15 <Roras> not to raw thoughts
A7:59:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Accuracy COMPARED TO raw thoughts.
A7:59:34 <vdgmprgrmr> There is no "to what" to care about here.
A7:59:42 <Roras> er.
A8:00:07 <Roras> wasn't i the one that started the topic some 60 minutes ago
A8:00:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno.
A8:00:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Whoever started it doesn't matter, though.
A8:00:46 <innkpr> raw thoughts are composed of many senses i guess.
A8:01:00 <innkpr> those thoughts are memories of some type, maybe
A8:01:18 <Roras> this is how it started
A8:01:22 <Roras> <Roras>i dont like to read unless it allows me to progress. reading stupid novels is pointless because its much easier to look at a picture
A8:01:22 <Roras> <Roras>oops... disregard the "stupid" part in there
A8:01:22 <Roras> <vdgmprgrmr>But novels allow for much more detail.
A8:01:22 <Roras> <Roras>not exactly...
A8:01:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't matter how it started.
A8:01:31 <Roras> well
A8:01:34 <innkpr> concepts come from those thoughts.
A8:01:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I have no idea why that even is being brought up.
A8:01:44 <Roras> if it doesnt matter how it started, then when will it end
A8:01:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno.
A8:01:59 <Roras> hm
A8:02:02 <Roras> well
A8:02:04 <vdgmprgrmr> If it DOES matter how it started, how would it end?
A8:02:17 <Roras> you were talking about something completely different
A8:02:25 <vdgmprgrmr> So?
A8:02:40 <vdgmprgrmr> We're still basically talking about accuracy of things.
A8:02:44 <Roras> so.... if the topic is wrong, then whats the point of continuancy
A8:02:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Fun.
A8:02:58 <vdgmprgrmr> And we're still on the same topic anyway.
A8:03:13 <innkpr> words stand in for ideas or concepts
A8:03:30 <Roras> i was talking about accuracy to a person and how easy it is to progress
A8:03:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Words can stand in for almost anything.
A8:03:44 <vdgmprgrmr> How easy it is to progress?
A8:03:49 <innkpr> well concepts are basically anything
A8:03:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Progress IN WHAT?
A8:03:55 <Roras> er...
A8:04:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Progress is a word that really requires modifiers.
A8:04:10 <Roras> progress in my java
A8:04:22 <Roras> i think it is based on the person
A8:04:30 <Snowman> any good private servers?
A8:04:32 <vdgmprgrmr> And words are still more accurate.
A8:04:32 <Roras> you do what you want to do
A8:04:47 <vdgmprgrmr> If you can't understand words for some reason, they're still accurate.
A8:05:04 <Roras> YOU do what YOU want to do, and whatever it is YOU do is most accurate to YOU

A8:05:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Not seeing how that matters...
A8:05:23 <Roras> um
A8:05:28 <Roras> it depends on the person
A8:05:42 <innkpr> i think you and I have a different concept of "accuracy" lol
A8:05:44 <Roras> some people find total accuracy in pictures
A8:05:45 <vdgmprgrmr> No, the ACCURACY of words does not depend on the person.
A8:05:53 <vdgmprgrmr> The ACCURACY of words is constant.
A8:05:57 <Roras> well
A8:05:59 <Roras> like i said
A8:06:19 <Roras> what if someone didnt know words? then pictures would be msot accurate to him
A8:06:21 <vdgmprgrmr> The SUBJECTIVE USEFULNESS of words is not constant. As shown by the word "SUBJECTIVE" in the term.
A8:06:36 <vdgmprgrmr> No, they wouldn't be most accurate.
A8:06:43 <vdgmprgrmr> You're using the word accurate wrong.
A8:06:59 <Roras> er...
A8:07:00 <vdgmprgrmr> No matter who the person is, words are most accurate.
A8:07:03 <Roras> there is no wrong or right
A8:07:13 <vdgmprgrmr> If a person doesn't understand words, they are still accurate.
A8:07:16 <Roras> its only what a person portrays it to be
A8:07:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Whether or not that person has the ability to use them might be different.
A8:07:33 <vdgmprgrmr> But they are still accurate.
A8:07:45 <Roras> er...
A8:08:01 <Roras> so what if i said words werent accurate
A8:08:15 <vdgmprgrmr> And seriously, the subjectivity of "wrong and right" is so absurdly off-topic that I'm starting to think you hardly know what we're talking about.
A8:08:33 <Roras> well, you guys kinda wandered off
A8:08:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you said words weren't accurate.
A8:08:48 <Roras> well
A8:08:54 <Roras> so is that right to me?
A8:09:02 <Roras> is that what i think is most accurate?
A8:09:14 <vdgmprgrmr> It doesn't matter what you THINK is most accurate.
A8:09:24 <Roras> then what does matter
A8:09:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Whether or not something IS accurate.
A8:09:41 <postlogic> Are you still talking about that stuff?
A8:09:42 <Roras> well
A8:09:45 <Roras> yeah
A8:09:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, we are.
A8:09:47 <postlogic> Haha
A8:09:51 <postlogic> Philosophers.
A8:09:53 <Roras> okay
A8:10:05 <innkpr> his point is that all perceived facts are opinions. whether or not that statement is true is another debate
A8:10:07 <Roras> if its so accurate, what if accurate itself is inaccurate
A8:10:20 <Roras> accuracy*
A8:10:32 <innkpr> wat
A8:10:46 <postlogic> That's contradicting, Roras.
A8:10:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Accuracy itself cannot be inaccurate.
A8:10:57 <Roras> prove it
A8:11:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Because accuracy is the definition of itself.
A8:11:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Statement       |        Reason
A8:11:22 <vdgmprgrmr> A=A and B=B
A8:11:24 <innkpr> that's like saying truth is false
A8:11:29 <Roras> well
A8:11:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Accuracy cannot be inaccurate |  Definition of accuracy
A8:11:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
A8:11:40 <vdgmprgrmr> You're trying to say A=\=A
A8:11:47 <Roras> well
A8:11:47 <postlogic> It is a tautology in and by itself.
A8:11:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Which does not work in any way at all.
A8:11:57 <postlogic> I've so been wantign to use that word.
A8:12:11 <Roras> i can believe what i want to believe. if one is ignorant, let them be ignorant
A8:12:41 <Roras> therefore if i think it is right, technically, to myself, it is right
A8:12:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, you're so awesome at not making irrelevant statements, Roras.
A8:12:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And whether or not it's right TO YOU doesn't matter.
A8:13:07 <Roras> er...
A8:13:09 <postlogic> A fact is true by itself, regardless of opinion.
A8:13:11 <Roras> its hard to explain
A8:13:22 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it's not.
A8:13:31 <Roras> no i mean
A8:13:31 <innkpr> well ancient people thought they were right about the earth being flat. Turns out they were wrong.

A8:15:17 <innkpr> well were getting into fact vs opinion, objective vs subjective here.
A8:15:34 <Roras> well now
A8:15:35 <vdgmprgrmr> No, that was just another random tangent Roras decided to try and take.
A8:15:58 <Roras> so what are other words for accuracy
A8:16:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Precision.
A8:16:12 <Roras> wrong
A8:16:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, no.
A8:16:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Precision = accuracy
A8:16:30 <vdgmprgrmr> They are pretty much one and the same.
A8:16:37 <innkpr> slightly different concept
A8:16:42 <postlogic> Precision, exactness, accuracy. Are the same.
A8:16:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Not in this context.
A8:16:53 <Roras> wiki it
A8:17:04 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't know if you quite got it.
A8:17:04 <Roras> accuracy and precision are not the same
A8:17:09 <vdgmprgrmr> NOT IN THIS CONTEXT.
A8:17:21 <vdgmprgrmr> In regards to this debate, precision and accuracy are the same.
A8:17:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Synonyms:   accurateness, carefulness, certainty, closeness, definiteness, definitiveness, definitude, efficiency, exactitude, exactness, faultlessness, incisiveness, mastery, meticulousness, preciseness, sharpness, skill, skillfulness, strictness, sureness, truthfulness, veracity, verity  
A8:17:34 <Roras> hm
A8:17:39 <Roras> thats what you think
A8:17:42 <vdgmprgrmr> See, not all those would be the same as accuracy in this context.
A8:17:45 <innkpr> well we know they're different, so let's just use "closeness"
A8:17:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's what the thesaurus shows...
A8:17:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not what I think
A8:17:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> I copy - pasted that
A8:18:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Skillfulness does not equal accuracy in this context.
A8:18:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Neither does carefulness or certainty.
A8:18:36 <Roras> ....
A8:18:42 <Roras> taking away all the normal words
A8:18:46 <vdgmprgrmr> However, precision does.
A8:18:53 <postlogic> No, taking away the words not relevant to this context, Roras.
A8:19:01 <Roras> ...
A8:19:09 <postlogic> Accuracy in this context would probably be more like 'conformity to fact' and such
A8:19:23 <Roras> you are so tied into this conversation you couldnt take a joke
A8:19:29 <vdgmprgrmr> More or less.
A8:19:39 <postlogic> ONE DOES NOT JOKE WHEN DISCUSSING.
A8:19:45 <Roras> i can do whatever i want
A8:19:47 <vdgmprgrmr> (Regarding postlogic, I meant.)
A8:20:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Jokes and debate stay far away from each other.
A8:20:09 <Roras> so um
A8:20:21 <Roras> we are trying to find how accurate words and pictures are
A8:20:26 <Roras> yes?
A8:20:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Yup.
A8:20:31 <Roras> OK
A8:20:41 <innkpr> precision in the context of "words conforming to ideas" would mean uh, words always meaning the same thing whether accurate or not
A8:20:42 <Roras> they are as accurate as accuracy is
A8:20:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Words are more accurate in comparison to raw thoughts than pictures are.
A8:21:09 <Roras> they are as accurate as accuracy is... theres no other explanation
A8:21:14 <Roras> we dont have to complicate things
A8:21:29 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A8:21:36 <vdgmprgrmr> That is not a good explanation.
A8:21:36 <Roras> ...
A8:21:39 <Roras> well
A8:21:40 <innkpr> yeah, but then again words are just thoughts anyway
A8:21:47 <Roras> you explain it mr genius
A8:21:50 <postlogic> lol
A8:21:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Words are a buffer between thoughts.
A8:21:59 <postlogic> Roras hasn't debated philosophy much, I see.
A8:22:09 <Roras> no i have not
A8:22:10 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I don't believe he has.
A8:22:13 <postlogic> It's quite important to define the ground rules first.
A8:22:14 <Roras> but its just comes down to that
A8:22:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, well, yeah, see.
A8:22:24 <Roras> accuracy is as accurate as it wants to be
A8:22:30 <innkpr> i have a thought, and so do you, and we decide together on a word that will represent our shared thought
A8:22:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Accuracy cannot "want" anything.
A8:22:40 <vdgmprgrmr> It's an impossibility.
A8:22:43 <Roras> you cannot "want" anything
A8:22:47 <Roras> your an impossibility
A8:22:53 <Roras> trying to complicate everything
A8:22:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're
A8:22:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> You
A8:23:00 <vdgmprgrmr> That was relevant, Roras.
A8:23:00 <Roras> yes
A8:23:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're = You are, your = possessive pronoun
A8:23:12 <Roras> that was what i was trying to say
A8:23:15 <postlogic> I recommend reading Statesman by Plato.
A8:23:17 <Roras> allnatural
A8:23:25 <Testvan> youre suckin mah dick
A8:23:28 <Roras> LOL
A8:23:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, you really should try to stay on the topic.
13A8:23:45 * postlogic thinks vdgmprgrmr is quite enjoying this
13A8:23:53 * vdgmprgrmr is quite enjoying this.
A8:23:56 <postlogic> Hehe.
A8:24:01 <Roras> half of the sentenes i cant even comprehend
A8:24:10 <innkpr> Testvan: 75% of that was misspelled.
A8:24:35 <Roras> welll
A8:24:48 <Roras> if my explanation of accuracy is wrong, then you find the right one
A8:25:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Accuracy, in this context, would be the level of adherence to fact.
A8:25:34 <Testvan> 75% of mah dick is being sucked
A8:25:44 <Roras> lol
A8:25:55 <Roras> um
A8:26:02 <Roras> but accuracy can be explained in numbers too
A8:26:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Or the amount of factual information contained within any set of things.
A8:26:15 <Roras> ok
A8:26:17 <Roras> so then
A8:26:50 <Roras> does this mean that ALL words,ALL pictures, ALL ideas are accurate.
A8:26:50 <postlogic> Should we define a set and its relation to the context, or am I just nitpicking?
A8:26:57 <vdgmprgrmr> To some extent, yes.
A8:27:02 <Roras> so then
A8:27:05 <Roras> theres your answer
A8:27:11 <vdgmprgrmr> postlogic, I think we're good.
A8:27:23 <postlogic> Good. I wasn't looking forward to that.
A8:27:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, they're all accurate, but they're not equall accurate.
A8:27:40 <postlogic> Roras: It would be more correct to say all words, all pictures and all ideas might be accurate to some point.
A8:27:42 <vdgmprgrmr> *equally
A8:28:00 <Roras> ok
A8:28:08 <postlogic> Crap, I really wasn't gonna get involved in this.
A8:28:11 <vdgmprgrmr> First, I really think we should try to do this a bit more formally.
A8:28:12 <Testvan> penis
A8:28:21 <Roras> history is just a set of lies that can be chosen to be believed or not believed
A8:28:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, that was ridiculously irrelevant.
A8:28:38 <Roras> lol
A8:28:47 <Roras> there are no rules
A8:28:53 <postlogic> Yes there are.
A8:28:57 <Roras> what are they
A8:28:58 <vdgmprgrmr> There are rules.
A8:29:02 <postlogic> We haven't defined them yet ;)
A8:29:07 <Roras> now you are off topic
A8:29:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, there's rules that must be adhered to if you plan for any debate to actually END.
A8:29:33 <vdgmprgrmr> And no, we're setting up formalities to keep things ON-TOPIC.
A8:29:51 <vdgmprgrmr> First thing: We take turns.
A8:29:53 <Roras> a debate is an arguement between two ideas, with one idea eventually being adhered to.
A8:30:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, no, you gotta let the other person FINISH first.
A8:30:17 <vdgmprgrmr> We take turns.
A8:30:20 <Roras> hm
A8:30:28 <Roras> what about the other 30 million people here
A8:30:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Any statement that is made must be immediately followed by the reason for the statement.
A8:30:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> We take turns based on arguments
A8:30:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Then someone may reply.
A8:30:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> And refuting the others' points
A8:30:46 <Roras> okay
A8:30:59 <Roras> this isnt a very good set up then
A8:31:01 <vdgmprgrmr> The person who replies MUST reply directly to the previous person's reasoning.

A8:36:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Your reasoning was just a big statement. And I'm not exactly seeing how that was a direct refutation of my statement.

A8:37:39 <innkpr> i've never debated either
A8:37:48 <Roras> there is no point in fighting if both statements are wrong
A8:37:58 <vdgmprgrmr> No, one statement is right.
A8:38:09 <Roras> prove it.
A8:38:24 <vdgmprgrmr> That's what we're trying to do here!
A8:38:42 <Roras> give me the most accurate portrayal of your idea of the right statement IN words
A8:38:56 <Roras> the most
A8:39:02 <vdgmprgrmr> My idea of the right statement?
A8:39:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Statement of what?
A8:39:11 <Roras> completely accurate, no errors, at all.
A8:39:18 <vdgmprgrmr> OF WHAT?
A8:39:39 <Roras> it must not be accurate. and it must be of your idea of the right statement aforementioned
A8:39:47 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A8:39:54 <Roras> which of the two is correct?
A8:39:58 <Roras> -_-
A8:39:59 <vdgmprgrmr> STATEMENT OF WHAT?

A8:42:11 <Roras> <Roras>Reason: its the most beneficial and efficient to a group of varied people to have both. this allows for easier interpretation of ideas. you choose which one is correct, and give me a 100% accurate reason why with no errors at all using words
A8:42:39 <vdgmprgrmr> What is the point of this?
A8:42:46 <Roras> well
A8:42:55 <Roras> im just trying to see what you would do

A8:43:18 <vdgmprgrmr> WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?

A8:43:30 <wingboy> you guys finsihed yet lol? :P
A8:43:32 <Roras> you just failed to see it
A8:43:41 <vdgmprgrmr> You replied to "what is the point of this" with "i wanted to do it"
A8:43:46 <Roras> im just trying to see what you would do
A8:44:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, WHAT IS THE POINT OF TRYING TO SEE WHAT I WOULD DO?
A8:44:23 <vdgmprgrmr> wingboy, no, now Roras is attempting, and failing utterly, to make a coherent argument.
A8:44:39 <Roras> what is the point of debating? why fight about two wrong answers when there is no right answer
A8:44:46 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A8:44:52 <Roras> i dont like debate
A8:44:55 <vdgmprgrmr> That statement is extremely fallacious.
A8:45:08 <Roras> you fallacious
A8:45:12 <Roras> you are*
A8:45:17 <vdgmprgrmr> "Why fight about two wrong answers" is dependent upon us both agreeing that both of the answers are wrong.
A8:45:18 <innkpr> well there is a right answer, but were not going to find the right one here
A8:45:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is obviously false.
A8:45:39 <Roras> i dont even know what the hell fallacious means
A8:45:45 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A8:45:55 <vdgmprgrmr> It's a fallacy.
A8:46:00 <innkpr> it's like high school classrooms that debate the existence of God. they know it's not going to be resolved there.
A8:46:01 <vdgmprgrmr> A logical fallacy.

A8:46:12 <Roras> i dont know what that is

A8:46:47 <Roras> so...
A8:46:59 <innkpr> fallacy? i think it means logically wrong. technically wrong. not morally, not socially, not opinionwise, but based on logic.
A8:47:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, like, 0=1
A8:47:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Or arguing that the desk is blue because it is red.
A8:47:38 <Roras> which is more important to you? action? accuracy? or results?
A8:47:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Depends on the situation.
A8:47:58 <Roras> on a general situation
A8:48:00 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't see where "action" came in.
A8:48:01 <Roras> in which all apply

A8:48:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Simply being written in words does not mean that it is true.
A8:48:48 <Roras> doesnt mean that its false either
A8:49:04 <vdgmprgrmr> You are perhaps among the worst debaters I have ever met.

A8:50:01 <Roras> i just see you as a person
A8:50:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Testvan, I honestly don't think there ever was one.
A8:50:20 <Roras> what is fun about debating
A8:50:25 <Roras> you dont learn anything

A8:50:36 <innkpr> but it's rare

A8:51:07 <Roras> and ive been doing it for two hours
A8:51:07 <vdgmprgrmr> You didn't learn anything because you didn't really try to debate anything.

A8:51:47 <Roras> and i failed
A8:51:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Because you tried miserably.
A8:52:02 <innkpr> well, you argue using examples roras
A8:52:06 <vdgmprgrmr> You didn't show any effort to try and stay on topic.
A8:52:20 <Roras> so why try debating when your peers dont want to comply
A8:52:44 <Roras> why play a 2 player game if your friend doesnt want to play
A8:53:02 <Testvan> why suck mah dick
A8:53:19 <vdgmprgrmr> You relentlessly brought up complete irrelevancies and assumed they were still in the argument despite being informed that they weren't. And you were, metaphorically, trying to play the game.
A8:53:23 <innkpr> well one of the players just bought the game.
A8:53:28 <vdgmprgrmr> But you suck at it.

A8:56:34 <innkpr> we don't know for sure if birth date affects personality and demeanor.
A8:56:53 <postlogic> vdgmprgrmr: It means you are especially cranky but also should look out for a mysterious woman in red when Venus stands in left tower and Jupiter raises right foot.
A8:57:12 <Testvan> age is pretty arbitary, amount of times you have rode a rock around a fireball
A8:57:12 <innkpr> probably doesn't, but it might.
A8:57:21 <Roras> not everyone is good at everything
A8:57:23 <postlogic> I should write these things.
A8:57:25 <Roras> so dont expect them to be
A8:57:26 <vdgmprgrmr> innkpr, we're almost entirely sure that birth date has nearly no effect at all on personality or demeanor.
A8:57:45 <postlogic> Unless you are dropped at birth.
A8:57:48 <Roras> also
A8:57:52 <vdgmprgrmr> If it does, it has nothing to do with the stars, but the period of time you were born in, or the season in which your birthday lies.

A9:00:02 <Roras> i know what burden is
A9:00:04 <Roras> and proof
A9:00:06 <innkpr> jesus didn't write the bible...
A9:00:13 <vdgmprgrmr> No no, "burden of proof".
A9:00:25 <Roras> the fact that you have to stumble over yourself just to prove your right
A9:00:30 <vdgmprgrmr> No...
A9:00:44 <Roras> in my mind it is
A9:00:51 <innkpr> the apostles did. and the first testament was partly written by old old jews and even older pagans
A9:01:00 <Testvan> so i claim there is a invisible unicorn in my room, is it up to me or you to prove what i claim?
A9:01:12 <Roras> no
A9:01:16 <vdgmprgrmr> In philosphical arguments, or any arguments, really, the burden of proof falls on the person making the POSITIVE statement. This means the person making the claim that something IS or DOES must prove his statement.
A9:01:20 <Roras> everyone has free will
A9:01:30 <Roras> i see
A9:01:36 <Roras> you have to correct everyone
A9:01:38 <Boinciel> God's actions do not fit in the physics model we have.

A9:10:55 <Roras> you cant expect me to speak like everyone else
A9:11:16 <vdgmprgrmr> So basically what you're saying is, "I refuse to actually read what you type and prefer to simply type in your general direction without any regard as to whether or not what I type means anything."

A9:13:43 <Testvan> so he would have something too look good against
A9:13:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay... "God is not the cause of negative... God created the devil."
A9:13:51 <vdgmprgrmr> That's contradictory.
A9:13:54 <Roras> evil manifested itself
A9:13:57 <vdgmprgrmr> In like, every way possible.
A9:14:07 <innkpr> so evil exists without God?
A9:14:10 <Testvan> god is all knowing... so he knew evil would manifest itself
A9:14:16 <Testvan> and let it happen
A9:14:18 <Roras> god gave free will to every living thing
A9:14:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright!
A9:14:31 <Roras> yes he did
A9:14:40 <innkpr> this is turning into Intro to Philosophy.
A9:14:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Would you say that the OMNIPOTENT God standing by and letting evil happen is not negative?
A9:14:47 <innkpr> It's all coming back to me.
A9:15:01 <Roras> not at that time
A9:15:07 <Boinciel> Evil is a big thing for him to not create with his omnipotence!
A9:15:12 <vdgmprgrmr> He is omnipotent, the devil exists, thus, God is indirectly the very reason the devil still exists.
A9:15:26 <Roras> okay
A9:15:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is pretty damn negative.
A9:15:42 <Testvan> GOD needs evil, cause if there wasnt 'evil', god wouldnt be 'good'
A9:15:43 <vdgmprgrmr> (According to most Christian religions.)
A9:15:54 <vdgmprgrmr> So it's a matter of reputation?
A9:15:56 <innkpr> God... IS EVIL
A9:16:00 <Testvan> :)
A9:16:06 <innkpr> They are one in the same.
A9:16:07 <Boinciel> <vdgmprgrmr> So it's a matter of reputation? <-- God's quite vain!
A9:16:13 <Roras> well, its wasnt our choice that we did that
A9:16:16 <Testvan> god is 50/50 good/evil
A9:16:19 <Roras> no
A9:16:20 <Roras> -_
A9:16:26 <Roras> why dont you read the whole bible
A9:16:30 <Roras> and tell me that
A9:16:30 <Testvan> i have
A9:16:33 <innkpr> God lives in my fishtank
A9:16:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, I seem to recall a story in the Bible where God basically tortured the crap out of a guy.
A9:16:35 <Boinciel> Because the bible smells.
A9:16:41 <Boinciel> I don't want to read it. :(
A9:16:43 <Testvan> he created the devil, therfore he created all evil....
A9:16:43 <Roras> which guy
A9:16:45 <Roras> and why
A9:16:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I believe it was Job.
A9:16:52 <innkpr> Job
A9:16:53 <vdgmprgrmr> But I could be wrong.
A9:16:56 <Roras> oh joB
A9:17:05 <Boinciel> Boj?
A9:17:13 <Testvan> kill his family gave him poorness and disease all cause God was in bet with the devil
A9:17:14 <Testvan> nice dude
A9:17:17 <vdgmprgrmr> The Devil says "People love me." so God curses Job with terrible boils and makes all his crops die.
A9:17:25 <Roras> lol job did that to himself
A9:17:31 <Roras> god does not control you
A9:17:32 <Testvan> WHAT
A9:17:33 <innkpr> in the original old testament version, job didn't reward him at the end lol. it just ends like an indie movie
A9:17:35 <Testvan> WHAT
A9:17:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Job did to himself something he can't control?
A9:17:49 <Testvan> job worshiped god and was his best follower
A9:17:50 <Roras> rather, he moves you by your own will
A9:17:58 <innkpr> i meant God didn't reward Job at the end*
A9:18:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, Job ending up with terrible boils and killing all his crops was something JOB did?
A9:18:15 <Roras> but he questioned god
A9:18:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Where?
A9:18:26 <Testvan> after he was fucked up and almost dead
A9:18:32 <Roras> i dont know, i dont have the bible with me
A9:18:33 <Testvan> job said 'why me'
A9:18:37 <Roras> i dont know, i dont have the bible with me
A9:18:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't the modern story rely on Job being healed at the end because he DIDN'T question God?
A9:19:00 <Roras> i dont know
A9:19:12 <Testvan> why do you chose to believe the bible?
A9:19:16 <Roras> all i know is that there should be of no private interpretation of the bible
A9:19:23 <innkpr> yes, the christians modified it to have a more Hollywood ending
A9:19:28 <Roras> because i have a will
A9:19:31 <vdgmprgrmr> "There should be of no private interpretation"
A9:19:36 <vdgmprgrmr> What the hell does that mean?

A9:20:03 <Roras> you must not make up your own version of what god originally willed, because then it is not the bible
A9:20:20 <Roras> basically, the word of god is the will of god
A9:20:21 <Testvan> then why dont you read the word of god (the hewbrew bible) 
A9:20:28 <Testvan> god never spoke english
A9:20:33 <innkpr> but god didnt write the bible
A9:20:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure the Catholic and Christian sects basically modified the bible to fit their wants.
A9:21:04 <Testvan> people are evil
A9:21:11 <vdgmprgrmr> If changing the Bible is so bad, then why are there multiple versions?
A9:21:18 <vdgmprgrmr> The King James Version.
A9:21:31 <Roras> omg let me answer one question at a time
A9:21:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm sure there's tons of different bibles.
A9:21:40 <Testvan> GIVE HIM TIME TO ANSWER
A9:21:51 <Testvan> i own a koran but havent read it
A9:21:55 <Roras> ok, i dont read it because im lazy
A9:22:10 <Roras> but its not like im gonna be killed for being lazy
A9:22:24 <innkpr> Jesus was a mega troll. He always spoke in parables. Even one of his groupies called him out on it.
A9:22:26 <Roras> ...
A9:22:30 <vdgmprgrmr> One of the seven DEADLY sins: Sloth.
A9:22:33 <Roras> yeah
A9:22:51 <Roras> sinning is giving into the god of this word:the devil
A9:23:14 <vdgmprgrmr> That's two words.
A9:23:19 <Roras> however, if you apologize to god, you are forgiven
A9:23:34 <innkpr> you know the story of Lucifer, the fallen angel?
A9:23:43 <Roras> no i dont
A9:23:51 <vdgmprgrmr> So if I murder babies for four years, and then say, "Oh please Lord Almighty, I beg you take forgiveness upon my soul!" you're fine.
A9:23:51 <innkpr> that's not in the bible, that's written by some dude named milton
A9:24:09 <Roras> hm
A9:24:16 <Roras> im not sure
A9:24:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Or, I'm fine.
A9:24:27 <Testvan> fuck this im going back to watching startrek
A9:24:33 <Roras> :P
A9:24:38 <innkpr> yes, and according to catholics, you can also pay for forgiveness
A9:24:48 <Roras> catholics made that for their own
A9:24:54 <Boinciel> Did God invent bubblewrap?
A9:24:55 <innkpr> i think it was called... absolution?
A9:25:02 <Boinciel> Is bubblewrap sinful?
A9:25:02 <Testvan> GOD INVENTED EVERYTHING EVER 
A9:25:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Don't leave Testvan.
A9:25:14 <Roras> it doesnt say that you pay for salvation in the bible
A9:25:15 <vdgmprgrmr> You know it's fun.
A9:25:15 <Boinciel> Bubblewrap is fun to pop, but it kills animals.
A9:25:29 <Testvan> but i need to see what happens to Quark and Sisco 
A9:25:32 <innkpr> Roras, the same way you feel about catholics, that's how the jews feel about you.
A9:25:33 <Boinciel> HOW CAN THIS BE JUSTIFIED
A9:25:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, I'd be willing to bet that according to most of society in the middle ages, it WAS in the bible.
A9:25:51 <Roras> jews feel that jesus was not the savior
A9:25:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Most of the population was illiterate.
A9:25:56 <innkpr> The jews were the OG God worshipers
A9:26:03 <vdgmprgrmr> The priests said anything they wanted to the population.
A9:26:04 <Roras> ok
A9:26:07 <Roras> i bet on it
A9:26:25 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A9:26:34 <Testvan> the fact there are multiple religions tells me they are all wrong
A9:26:37 <Roras> it doesnt say that you pay for salvation in the bible
A9:26:43 <Roras> you bet on that right?

A9:28:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait...
A9:28:09 <Testvan> IF (big if) there is a god im pretty sure he averages all your evil and good deeds and thats how decides if you goto heaven or hell
A9:28:11 <Roras> religion is of tradition, which is of man
A9:28:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Catholicism was a distortion of all religion?
A9:28:13 <Quatroking> religions are silly, take that!
A9:28:13 <innkpr> just like christianity is a distorted version of judiasm

A9:28:38 <Roras> why
A9:28:44 <Roras> was born in NJ
A9:28:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Chances are your religion is based on protestantism.
A9:28:55 <Roras> i dont have a religion
A9:28:58 <Roras> i read the bible
A9:28:58 <Testvan> he lives in florida i bet
A9:29:01 <Roras> thats all i need to know
A9:29:03 <Roras> yes i do
A9:29:07 <vdgmprgrmr> You said you believe in the Bible.
A9:29:11 <Roras> the bible
A9:29:17 <Roras> i dont believe in religion
A9:29:29 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A9:29:37 <Roras> er.... a book is not religion
A9:29:45 <innkpr> so you study the bible as literature?
A9:29:49 <vdgmprgrmr> What the fuck do you believe then?
A9:29:51 <Testvan> so you dont goto church on sundays?
A9:29:52 <Roras> the bible
A9:29:56 <Roras> what it says
A9:30:02 <Roras> no, i dont need to
A9:30:04 <vdgmprgrmr> YOU BELIEVE WHAT THE HOLY BIBLE SAYS.
A9:30:08 <Roras> yes
A9:30:11 <vdgmprgrmr> THAT IS A RELIGION.
A9:30:18 <Roras> tell me the name
A9:30:24 <Testvan> a religion is belief without proof 
A9:30:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Chances are, it's a sect of Christianity.
A9:30:29 <innkpr> judeochistianity
A9:30:41 <vdgmprgrmr> innkpr said it better.
A9:30:41 <Boinciel> Do you believe everything it says?
A9:30:50 <Boinciel> Do you believe everything a politician says?
A9:30:53 <Quatroking> I believe in Douglas Adams
A9:30:57 <Testvan> i hope god is a badass who doesnt give a fuck and just does what he wants
A9:31:10 <Roras> yes i do believe the bible and everything it says
A9:31:25 <Testvan> but you have only read a translation
A9:31:28 <Quatroking> Testvan: looks like it, otherwise he would've cured aids, cancer, etc. right?
A9:31:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you believe that Christ is the savior of humanity.
A9:31:38 <Roras> hm
A9:31:44 <vdgmprgrmr> You're a Christian, man.
A9:31:46 <Roras> ok
A9:32:05 <Boinciel> Well, I think we've _almost_ cured cancer
A9:32:09 <Roras> hm
A9:32:09 <innkpr> so muslims are not religious, they just believe in the korhan
A9:32:12 <Quatroking> If god really exists then we wouldn't have cancer
A9:32:14 <Quatroking> and aids
A9:32:15 <Quatroking> and hiv
A9:32:17 <Quatroking> sars
A9:32:26 <Roras> well
A9:32:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Quatroking, that area has already been debated.
A9:32:32 <Boinciel> Emphasis on we.
A9:32:32 <Testvan> roras what your opinion on gay marriage
A9:32:36 <Roras> no
A9:32:41 <innkpr> koreans are not religious, they just play starcraft a lot.
A9:32:46 <Quatroking> vdgmprgmr: I just came in
A9:32:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I know, I was informing you.

A9:34:11 <Roras> i have, but i didnt read all of it
A9:34:15 <Boinciel> hahahahaha yeah
A9:34:16 <Testvan> grew up as a catholic, was forced to take sunday school
A9:34:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh well if that counts then I've read it too.
A9:34:31 <innkpr> i've read it twice then
A9:34:32 <Roras> but theres certain parts
A9:34:37 <Roras> ive taken a class on the bible
A9:34:43 <Quatroking> I grew up as christian but at the age of 9 I realized it was all a good story
A9:34:45 <Testvan> the bible says eating shellfish is as bad as gay sex.... ponder that 
A9:34:56 <vdgmprgrmr> I didn't need a class.
A9:35:01 <Roras> the bible doesnt say that
A9:35:03 <Roras> you say that
A9:35:08 <Testvan> ill prove it
A9:35:09 <Testvan> hold on
A9:35:11 <Roras> kk
A9:35:18 <vdgmprgrmr> With enough people shoving the shit down your throat, you learn a lot about it.

A9:35:51 <Roras> then what is it
A9:36:01 <Testvan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_(Bible)
A9:36:12 <vdgmprgrmr> It's where, allegedly, the holy spirit enters the body, and speaks through it.
A9:36:19 <vdgmprgrmr> And it's just all gibberish.
A9:36:26 <Roras> it is not
A9:36:28 <innkpr> i would have liked a class on the bible. The bible is so jam packed with metaphors and symbolisms that you need a class to decipher it.

A9:46:01 <Rroff> Theres not one church that I know of thats not full of corruption and false doctrine
A9:46:36 <vdgmprgrmr> If you know the currently taught versions are distorted, then obviously you have some non-distorted version to compare them to, so please, bring about worldwide religious reform or something.
A9:46:46 <Roras> the bible itself
A9:46:52 <Testvan> roras you are the next jesus
A9:46:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Which parts?
A9:46:57 <Roras> no i am not
A9:46:57 <Testvan> jesus 2.0
A9:47:06 <Roras> the new testament is for the gentiles
A9:47:08 <Testvan> jesus jr.
A9:47:09 <Roras> which is us
A9:47:16 <Roras> therefore
A9:47:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, and what do people teach today?
A9:47:25 <Roras> anything taught from the old testament is
A9:47:30 <Roras> false doctrine
A9:47:46 <Roras> just that
A9:47:48 <Testvan> so if you only believe the new testiment... then you do believe the universe is 14 billion years old and the earth 4 billion?
A9:47:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure most people listen to the New Testament anyway, since the Old Testament is filled with crazy, crazy shit.
A9:47:59 <Roras> nah
A9:48:00 <Rroff> The church should be there as a guide and focal point, most instill arbitary rules and regulations based on badly interpreted passages
A9:48:21 <Roras> the church is a group of people willing to build the church
A9:48:29 <Roras> and spread the word of it
A9:48:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Rroff: But then it's not a church. It's just a group of people being nice.
A9:48:44 <Rroff> or not so nice
A9:49:02 <Testvan> i bet more people have been murdered in god's name than the devil's name
A9:49:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Rroff: I meant that being a guide or focal point was generally being nice.
A9:49:09 <Roras> nope
A9:49:12 <Roras> well
A9:49:13 <Roras> maybe
A9:49:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Crusades.
A9:49:20 <Roras> the no
A9:49:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Crusades.
A9:49:24 <Rroff> ic
A9:49:29 <Roras> crusades were of man
A9:49:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Weren't there FOUR of those?
A9:49:32 <Testvan> inquizition
A9:49:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, MAN was killing for GOD.
A9:49:40 <Testvan> in the NAME of god, not god himself
A9:49:46 <Roras> crusades made to build the catholic church
A9:49:52 <vdgmprgrmr> FOR GOD.
A9:49:54 <Roras> no
A9:49:56 <Roras> for the church
A9:50:04 <Roras> they plundered money FOR THE CHURCH
A9:50:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Which they believed was FOR FUCKING GOD.
A9:50:09 <Roras> they took land FOR THE CHURCH
A9:50:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't think you freaking get it.
A9:50:29 <Testvan> would god let me do him in the butt if asked nice
A9:50:38 <vdgmprgrmr> TO THEM, FOR THE CHURCH MEANT *FOR GOD*
A9:50:54 <Roras> yeah but not
A9:50:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Thus, killing FOR GOD.
A9:50:55 <Roras> to god
A9:51:05 <vdgmprgrmr> You never said TO GOD.
A9:51:10 <Roras> hm
A9:51:15 <vdgmprgrmr> You said FOR or IN THE NAME OF.
A9:51:15 <innkpr> Jesus was a Jew. OMG

A /teleport x y z thing for admins/ops, if you try to teleport to a spot where either your legs or head would be cut off by a solid block it would tell you that you can't (and what part would get cut off?). The other idea is a saving of your saved respawn spot if you disconnect from a server then reconnect that way if you set a spot to respawn and you rejoin a server that is o

A10:59:00 <C418> the first one to upload the leaked cassette gets about two terrabytes of seed
A10:59:47 <Notch> i should work more on my new music project
A10:59:55 <C418> whats it about?
A11:00:03 <C418> my current music project is all half classic half electro music
A11:00:08 <C418> :D
A11:00:12 <Senku> Notch, either of those ideas good?
A11:00:15 <Notch> it's about code. =D
A11:00:45 <Notch> I'm a bit wary of teleports, but I guess I could add it
A11:00:52 <citricsquid> I'm musically retarded, apparently =( keyboard is the best instrument ever.
A11:00:53 <C418> I love the /teleport command
A11:00:56 <Notch> the second one isn't possible at the moment, unfortunately. =)

A11:01:04 <Notch> that's already in

A11:02:07 <C418> so you basically code sine waves to make music

A11:03:14 <mezo> manual music is going dead isn't it
A11:03:19 <C418> not it isn't
A11:03:22 <C418> minus the t
A11:03:46 <mezo> appreciation for manual performance is certainly diminishing
A11:03:52 <C418> procedual music gets mode and more modern
A11:03:56 <C418> look at spore
A11:03:58 <mezo> the simple fact is that keyboards are the ultimate instrument
A11:04:02 <C418> they hired brian eno to make procedual songs
A11:04:04 <mezo> keyboards + pc
A11:04:08 <C418> well, okay, the music in spore sucks ass
A11:04:11 <C418> but it's a start
A11:04:24 <Notch> mine would be about as electro as you get. Minimalistic idm, influenced by autechre with the short noise sounds
A11:04:24 <wingboy> spore in general sucked
A11:04:26 <Senku> Also any chance we might get an ice block that players and solid blocks can slide on? Along with melt if lava comes within 1-2 blocks of it and maybe floats on water and can be pushed? :P
A11:04:37 <mezo> that's not really what i mean C418
A11:04:42 <mezo> i mean manual vs sequenced music
A11:04:53 <Notch> I've even got a name for the project. I started work on this a year ago, but got sidetracked, and I haven't made any music at all since
A11:04:58 <C418> theres not just manual and sequenced
A11:05:10 <Notch> this would be neither. ;)
A11:05:22 <mezo> if you code sine waves to form a pattern, that's sequenced
A11:05:23 <C418> hm, I like the more melodic autechre songs
A11:05:35 <Notch> My favorite it Gantz Graf
A11:05:36 <C418> ... untilted for example was mostly percussive
A11:05:37 <C418> didn't like it
A11:05:44 <mezo> even eno's stuff was sequenced if you consider the individual parts of the music
A11:05:59 <mezo> the procedural stuff is just modification of pre-sequenced music
A11:06:04 <Notch> mezo: No, it's won't be sequenced. It probably won't even have a stable beat.
A11:06:20 <C418> the ep I love most is cichli suite
A11:06:20 <mezo> but you're entering a sequence to be played out by a machine
A11:06:26 <mezo> as opposed to, say, playing keys manually
A11:06:27 <C418> from autechre of course
A11:06:31 <mezo> with your hands, on a keyboard
A11:06:41 <Notch> no, I won't enter a sequence. It'll be procedural and fractal
A11:06:45 <C418> my music is played by BARE HANDS
A11:06:46 <mezo> ffff
A11:06:49 <C418> WITH BARE FINGERS
A11:06:55 <Notch> I won't know how the song will end up
A11:07:14 <C418> so you try to go the brian eno way
A11:07:33 <Notch> not if I can help it. ;)
A11:07:52 <Notch> i have a passion for procedural content. The levels in minecraft, for example
A11:07:53 <C418> oh well, as far as I know, eno listens to his own songs in 4 times the speed
A11:07:56 <Notch> I love doing stuff like that
A11:08:15 <mezo> that's probably due to impatience :P
A11:08:16 <C418> yes. but procedural music is something very hard to achieve if you want it sound good
A11:08:23 <C418> I always keep typing procedual
A11:08:27 <mezo> probably listens to them a hundred times before settling on the final
A11:08:29 <C418> because the german word doesn't have the r
A11:08:29 <Notch> absolutely, it's very hard
A11:09:07 <C418> well, brian eno is pretty much the expert in those things
A11:09:19 <mezo> he's the arch-wizard of sound
A11:09:25 <C418> not really
A11:09:46 <mezo> he can create specific sounds by their wave form like it's nothing
A11:09:53 <mezo> the way most musicians can create chords by their notes

A11:17:34 <Notch> ?
A11:17:36 <MisterX> more like draining 2.0

A11:18:09 <Notch> amen and 303, that's all you need
A11:18:15 <MisterX> indeed Boinciel
A11:18:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah Notch.
A11:18:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, you should never take the Sponge out.
A11:19:07 <vdgmprgrmr> At least for creative mode.

A11:20:04 <Notch> I think I love it
A11:20:18 <C418> but now I take the drum racks implemented in ableton live. they have basically every classic drum machine emulated through the operator synth

A11:22:39 <Notch> back when pandora worked in sweden, I wrote a tool to store the music locally and let it run for a while
A11:22:48 <MisterX> it's nice to hide them in walls, so it looks like water is magically kept out of tunnels

A11:31:30 <m0bus> dumb
A11:31:37 <C418> everyone complains
A11:31:40 <Rroff> if hes looking for visuals
A11:31:43 <Notch> hey, people can have opinions. =)
A11:31:44 <Rroff> he should be playing crysis
A11:31:51 <mezo> i agree with that person :X
A11:31:54 <Rroff> then again
A11:31:59 <Notch> in fact, even if he ISN'T looking for visials, he should play crysis. =D
A11:32:00 <Rroff> crysis doesn't look that good imo
A11:32:02 <Notch> I enjoyed that game
A11:32:10 <Maulrus> :c as soon as I play minecraft it permanently drops my DF FPS to 20
A11:32:11 <Rroff> I didn't
A11:32:22 <Maulrus> stupid sucky computer
A11:32:26 <mezo> all the birdshit lands on crysis because it's at the top
A11:32:30 <mezo> it's got a bad rep
A11:32:42 <Maulrus> Crysis was okay
A11:32:53 <Rroff> crysis was too fiddly for what it was imo gameplay wise
A11:32:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> but it was pretty kewl
A11:32:58 <Maulrus> I've been enjoying Prototype a lot more
A11:33:21 <Rroff> I enjoyed farcry 2 more than crysis, and farcry2 has some really really frustrating "features"
A11:33:40 <Maulrus> Far cry 2 wasn't nearly as good as a few small changes would've made it
A11:33:52 <Maulrus> but it had its fun bits
A11:33:52 <Rroff> minecraft is cool coz its accessable, you can just jump in and play any time
A11:34:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
A11:34:09 <Rroff> indeed Maulrus
A11:34:30 <Maulrus> minecraft is accessible if you have an open mind

A11:34:41 <Maulrus> a friend of mine stopped playing instantly cause of the blocky graphics
A11:34:42 <C418> thats it
A11:34:49 <Rroff> plus a couple of other tweaks would have made the game 10x more fun
A11:34:50 <Maulrus> oh god malaria was so annoying
A11:35:10 <C418> malaria! ?
13A11:35:14 * mezo points out neon-dong in related
A11:35:25 <Rroff> you constantly suffered from malaria throughout the game
A11:35:40 <Rroff> and if you didn't do the silly pill hunting missions you'd end up fainting or whatever
A11:35:47 <Rroff> and blurry visual spells at all the wrong times
A11:35:48 <mezo> only afx i really like is selected ambient
A11:36:06 <C418> probably the first selected ambient works
A11:36:07 <Testvan> i hate granular musicification
A11:36:15 <mezo> both are good

P12:18:52 <C418> I was happy when I noticed our school computers can run df at about 80 frames
P12:19:00 <C418> everything else runs like crap there
P12:19:02 <C418> but dwarf fortress
P12:19:04 <C418> perfectly
P12:19:09 <C418> well, almost
P12:19:29 <mezo> 80 frames for the first season maybe
P12:19:40 <mezo> on a map with no running water
P12:19:54 <C418> oh, there was running water alright
P12:20:11 <C418> of course it gets slower, but I guess thats not that awful

P2:04:48 <Rroff> there was awhile back
P2:04:50 <Quatroking> It downloades packages but i don't see any difference
P2:04:59 <Quatroking> downloaded*
P2:05:06 <Spadge> hmmm mine comes up with errors while downloading
P2:05:29 <Erki> mh, I still have that running too fast and getting too much lag stuff^^
P2:05:46 <Quatroking> I hope cobblestone returns soon
P2:05:54 <Quatroking> oh well, at least we're not Kaidane.

P2:08:43 <Quatroking> blasphemy
P2:09:32 <Notch> restart browsers and all that
P2:09:36 <Notch> might help
P2:09:40 <Quatroking> oh hi notch
P2:10:04 <Quatroking> oh shit my foot is sleeping oh godddd
P2:10:06 <Rroff> Notch timer problem is back
P2:10:12 <Notch> it is? :-O
P2:10:13 <Quatroking> But at least I'm not kaidane
P2:10:14 <Rroff> I was playing for about 30 mins fine
P2:10:24 <Notch> grrr
P2:10:27 <Rroff> then fps dropped to 30-40 and clock started going 1.5x
P2:10:37 <Rroff> even after restarting it does the same
P2:10:40 <Rroff> which is really weird
P2:11:17 <Rydia> notch can i have a copy of minecraft
P2:11:26 <Rydia> :p
P2:11:35 <Quatroking> Sure you can
P2:11:40 <Notch> of course you can.
P2:11:47 <Quatroking> You'll have to play with a regular account tho
P2:11:49 <Quatroking> :P
P2:11:59 <wingboy> notch can i has faste e-checks :(
P2:13:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ahhh
P2:14:24 <Quatroking> Notch, when will we have more player animations?
P2:14:40 <Notch> beta, probably
P2:14:51 <greenslimy> When is beta anyways
P2:14:54 <Quatroking> When will we have beta
P2:15:01 <Notch> when survival mode is in
P2:15:07 <greenslimy> oh ok
P2:15:14 <greenslimy> thats... helpfull
P2:15:17 <greenslimy> lol
P2:15:19 <Quatroking> when is survival mode added
P2:15:25 <Notch> not just added, but working ok
P2:15:27 <citricsquid> Will everyone be able to play survival during beta, or just paid?
P2:15:27 <MisterX> Notch, do you have any idea why a friend of mine, running Vista, can't click anything? I'm sure the problem isn't knew, but I don't recall any solution
P2:15:31 <Notch> so a few days or a week after it's added
P2:15:40 <wingboy> Notch if you had to choose between pancakes and waffles what would you choose?
P2:15:50 <Notch> i don't know any solution either. I rely on opengl picking, which SHOULD work
P2:16:11 <MisterX> I think he can't even highlight blocks and such
P2:16:14 <Rroff> hah interesting and even weirder...

P2:16:28 <Rydia> i have the same problem
P2:16:33 <Rroff> I just wrote a little proggie that displays the system menumonic (gg spelling) timer value on screen while playing
P2:16:36 <MisterX> and so does Helli83 :P
P2:16:36 <Rroff> and
P2:16:38 <Notch> yeah, misterx
P2:16:42 <Rroff> no timer drift while its running
P2:16:45 <Notch> highlighting blocks uses picking
12P2:16:52 * Spadge (Spadge@202.171.164.53) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
P2:16:53 <Rroff> soon as I quit the program - drift comes back and fps plummets
P2:17:07 <MisterX> if it's got to do with opengl, could updating drivers work?
P2:17:08 <Notch> what the hell, sun?
P2:17:20 <Notch> maybe, misterx. :-\
P2:17:38 <Rydia> http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=258319
P2:18:26 <Rydia> However, that is not guaranteed to be foolproof, as the spec does not define pixel accurate results, and it fails in 16-bit display modes. Driver settings such as anti-aliasing and optimizations may also interfere.
P2:18:52 <Quatroking> Notch how exactly does the client know which server to connect to
P2:19:14 <Notch> applet parameters. =)
P2:19:16 <Rydia> So Notch why not follow this thread and do picking on the CPU?
P2:19:23 <Quatroking> so basically
P2:19:27 <Notch> I will, Rydia, thank you
P2:19:28 <Rroff> coz CPU picking is SLOOOOOOW
P2:19:42 <Quatroking> it's possible to run the client jar locally and just add parameters through batch?
P2:19:59 <Notch> kind of
P2:20:02 <Rydia> picking on the GPU seems to run into problems with driver settings and all sorts of problems that are hard to pin down
P2:20:09 <Notch> it's a bit tricky, since you need the mppass for name verification
P2:20:09 <Rroff> tho any half decent setup should still manage 2000 or so picks a second before you see a noticeable dip in performance
P2:20:16 <Quatroking> hmm

P2:20:32 <Quatroking> how does that all work

P2:20:59 <Notch> the master server assembles a list of all servers and presents the public ones via html

P2:22:17 <Quatroking> Yeah, but using batch commands
P2:22:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> This is cross-p;atform

P2:23:35 <Quatroking> it should be possible to have  program launch the jar file using parameters
P2:23:38 <Notch> it won't need more or less parameters just because you change the language it's written it
P2:23:42 <Quatroking> *a
P2:23:43 <Tokyoma> Possibly newbish question, forgive me if it is. But is there anyway to get minecraft to run fullscreen?
P2:23:45 <C418> I make some music now
P2:23:49 <Quatroking> no no no
P2:23:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> He wants a dedicated client I believe
P2:24:00 <C418> you can zoom the browser screen
P2:24:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch wants to push updates aggressively though
P2:24:05 <Quatroking> YES
P2:24:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> So that won't be possible until updates slow down...
P2:24:21 <Quatroking> Now Kaidane here, knows how to code stuff

P2:24:26 <Notch> oh, the SERVER
P2:24:32 <Kaidane> what
P2:24:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, no.. He wants a dedicated client

P2:24:56 <Notch> it'll still be written in java. ;)
P2:24:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Good
P2:25:00 <Tokyoma> Source too? D:
P2:25:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> I love Java... Delicious cross-platform
P2:25:16 <Notch> source comes in the distant future
P2:25:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> it tastes pretty cool
P2:25:25 <ZomBuster> Source comes out when nobody cares anymore
P2:25:46 <Quatroking> ZomBuster can you make icons for the glass and sponge tiles, for on the wiki
P2:26:04 <ZomBuster> sure,, not right now
P2:26:08 <ZomBuster> not at home
P2:26:12 <Quatroking> alrighty
P2:26:15 <Tokyoma> I'm not very knowledgeable of java, but everytime I mess around with this game I get really nice ideas. I was just interested in modding potential.
P2:26:37 <ZomBuster> you can write your own game ;D
P2:26:43 <Tokyoma> I've used other object oriented languages though, I just haven't had the time in my school schedule to check out java.
P2:27:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm learning java right now
P2:27:09 <Tokyoma> Yeah, I thought about that to. I actually have a similar engine from a while back when I was making a Voxel based painting program.
P2:27:16 <Tokyoma> too*
P2:27:33 <Quatroking> Notch do you update the client like, every few minutes?
P2:27:43 <Quatroking> this is the fifth time I'm downloading new packages
P2:27:46 <Rroff> notch are you using any kinda sleep/delay in the main program loop?
P2:27:47 <Quatroking> today
P2:27:53 <Tokyoma> But reinventing the over invented wheel seems, counterprogressive. :~
P2:27:57 <citricsquid> quat: quite a few bugs today, it appears :P

P2:28:04 <Quatroking> ah
P2:28:06 <Notch> no new client software
P2:28:14 <Notch> but I've replaced the lwjgl jars with the right ones
P2:28:16 <Quatroking> too minor for version changes
P2:28:27 <Notch> the first ones I uploaded had double signing

P2:34:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> When Java supports it?
P2:35:05 <Rydia> does it not?
P2:35:07 <ZomBuster> what si cpu picking?
P2:35:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> No idea Rydia.. Just saying, seems a bit frivolous for now
P2:35:27 <Rydia> cpu picking is the only real reliable way of picking blocks
P2:35:42 <Rroff> http://aten-hosted.com/files/mctimerfix.rar (honest it doesn't contain any viruses or anything) but if anyone does have the too much lag problem and low fps give it a whirl if you feel like it
P2:35:49 <Rroff> just run it while the game is running
P2:35:49 <Rydia> right now minecraft uses opengl gpu picking i think
P2:35:59 <Rydia> so some people have problems highlighting blocks
P2:36:23 <citricsquid> rroff: Feel free to post on the forums, seems to be some people with the problem there as well =D
P2:36:37 <Rroff> it would be better if notch fixed it :P
P2:36:42 <Erki> rroff it works
P2:36:43 <Rroff> but if anyones desperate - that does work for me
P2:37:07 <Rroff> fps should be 4-5x higher as well
P2:37:09 <Erki> I dont run fast anymore
P2:37:18 <Rroff> the irony is...
P2:37:24 <Rroff> the program does absolutely nothing
P2:37:26 <Rroff> except sleep

P2:40:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> (the server will reset in 20 mins or so)

P3:07:13 <Maulrus> aw DAMN
P3:07:27 <Maulrus> I got a secretive mood on one of the peasants I have cross-training in Armoring
P3:07:35 <Maulrus> and he claims a craftsdwarf's workshop
P3:07:36 <Maulrus> :c
P3:08:33 <Quatroking> hmm
P3:08:44 <Quatroking> the player model's head is 2x2x2 right?
P3:09:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> hwat?
P3:09:20 <Quatroking> 2x2x2 small blocks
P3:09:33 <Quatroking> the player model seems to be built out of blocks
P3:09:49 <Quatroking> I'm trying to make a replicate of the model and then turn it into papercraft
P3:09:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> built using 6 rectangles
P3:10:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> by piels the head should be 8*8*8

P3:11:12 <PuyoDead> ok, so this is weird. seems with the latest update, use the fog (F) doesn't help FPS anymore
P3:11:22 <PuyoDead> I get the same FPS regardless of the fog distance
P3:11:30 <Maulrus> unless he updated since last night,
P3:11:35 <Maulrus> I don't share your problem
P3:11:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> what's your average fps?
P3:11:44 <Maulrus> my fps goes from 2 to 30 with 2 levels of fog
P3:11:53 <PuyoDead> ehh, within the 30-80 range
P3:11:56 <PuyoDead> on a full map
P3:12:03 <Maulrus> lucky you
P3:12:11 <PuyoDead> well, that's on a good full map
P3:12:24 <PuyoDead> it's it's something complicated ,than yea, it's about 10-12
P3:12:59 <Maulrus> so I'm about to have 2 legendary craftsdwarves
P3:13:11 <Maulrus> it's not a legendary armorsmith but it'll do
P3:13:12 <PuyoDead> just standing in place, every fog level has a result of about 8 FPS in this current server

P3:19:56 <Quatroking> So I can make a papercraft out of it

P3:20:10 <Quatroking> It's been too long since I've modeled myself :/
P3:22:41 <Notch> there is no 3d model of it. =D
P3:22:45 <Notch> it's procedural
P3:22:49 <Quatroking> noo
P3:22:53 <Notch> AlLnAtuRalX: I'd love to! What time is it?
P3:22:56 <Quatroking> D;
P3:23:00 <citricsquid> quatro: if you make a paper thing for it, I'll buy some little paper templates from you if you'd mail them, paying postage + whatever for them ;)
P3:23:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> GMT?  That would be umm 3PM - 10PM
P3:23:17 <Notch> ok, I'll be there for much of the time, probably. =)
P3:23:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nice
P3:23:43 <Quatroking> Well I'm busy trying to model one myself now using Wings3D

P3:23:49 <Quatroking> It's been a good 2 years I've used this
P3:24:50 <ZomBuster>  lol quatro
P3:24:54 <ZomBuster> its like
P3:25:01 <ZomBuster> 6 cubes
P3:25:02 <citricsquid> Quatro: well, if it goes well I'm definitely down for some, I'll pay handsomly ;)
P3:25:14 <Quatroking> I won't be asking any money
P3:25:18 <ZomBuster> you can remake in 10 sec
P3:25:44 <Quatroking> well the thing is I forgot how to make cubes.
P3:25:46 <Quatroking> sort of.
P3:26:04 <ZomBuster> use the textures for the scale
P3:26:32 <Quatroking> I am
P3:26:36 <ZomBuster> actually
P3:26:51 <ZomBuster> I think you could make a papercraft template from just the texture
P3:27:04 <Quatroking> Hmm
P3:27:05 <Quatroking> Probably
P3:27:08 <Quatroking> Let me try
P3:27:42 <PuyoDead> hey Notch, have you heard of fog levels not affecting FPS anymore?
P3:27:57 <Notch> it's probably because I tried to limit the fps
P3:28:01 <Notch> but I'll look into it
P3:28:18 <PuyoDead> nothing game breaking, of course, just weird
P3:28:19 <Notch> the fps limiting did not work at all, so I'm taking it out. it caused a whole bunch of bugs with timing
P3:28:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have the bug Notch... Max is 120 or so and for won't lower it
P3:28:42 <LKA> Notch: I'm guessing the FPS limiting thing was why some of us have been seeing the game going somewhere around 1.5x to 2x faster than it should?
P3:29:12 <Rroff|afk> would be a shame if there was no fps limiting tho :S my GPU gets really noisey when churning out 1000fps
P3:29:34 <C418> some people have problems with the frames being above 100
P3:29:57 <Maulrus> This guy has killed 16 unicorns
P3:30:01 <Maulrus> he deserves a title
P3:30:28 <Maulrus> He is now a unicorn slayer
P3:30:39 <Rroff|afk> what I don't get is how JAVA can affect the system timer
P3:30:46 <Rroff|afk> it should only ever be reading it not writing
P3:30:47 <LKA> java (tm)
P3:31:26 <Notch> yes, LKA, I thin kso too
P3:31:32 <Notch> so I'm taking it out for 0.0.20
P3:31:51 <LKA> It was hilarious though,
P3:31:57 <LKA> I was outrunning all my friends and their fancy cpus
P3:32:03 <LKA> and going "i'm a hero, f-zero"
P3:32:11 <Rroff|afk> :S
P3:32:47 <citricsquid> It's horrible watching my brother play, Pentium 4 with onboard intel graphics gets about 7 FPS =D

P3:33:30 <citricsquid> works fine notch
P3:33:51 <Rroff|afk> oof
P3:33:57 <Rroff|afk> not working for me too well
P3:34:05 <Rroff|afk> 38fps and running 1.5x
P3:34:48 <LKA> i was clocking about 27-35 with the same rate
P3:35:39 <Rydia> Notch what about grate blocks
P3:35:42 <PuyoDead> 38? hell, I was getting 10
P3:35:47 <Rydia> that let liquids through but not players
P3:36:16 <Notch> not yet, Rydia, but it's a good idea. =)
P3:36:19 <Rroff|afk> .sleep(10); might help possibly dunno
P3:36:41 <Notch> I'm going to avoid doing more liquid stuff if I can until finite water

P4:38:58 <Notch> yes?
P4:39:01 <Rydia> next time you add more blocks
P4:39:04 <JackITA> Notch reply my email pls
P4:39:07 <Prime_2> will this one fix the crashes?
P4:39:11 <Rydia> make it so you click on a category first and then it shows all the blocks in that category
P4:39:20 <Notch> good idea, Rydia
P4:39:20 <Rydia> in case it gets too big
P4:39:36 <ZomBuster> yeh

P4:39:58 <Notch> JackITA: what's the title?
P4:39:59 <Empty> I though all will be solid when placed by an op or admin.
P4:40:06 <Kapow> no way
P4:40:06 <Empty> thought
P4:40:08 <Rydia> more like Rock, Cloth, Plant, etc
P4:40:19 <ZomBuster> different
P4:40:20 <Kapow> then nobody would be able to change or add to the stuff they build
P4:40:23 <Notch> no, just the stone one, empty. I want it to be obvious to the players
P4:40:23 <ZomBuster> but would work too
P4:40:24 <JackITA> Change passowrd acocunt
P4:40:24 <Rydia> the colored blocks are supposed to be cloth ;)

P4:41:23 <Kapow> hey notch, how about cycling through available blocks in the current inventory slot with Ctrl+Mousewheel?
P4:41:44 <Notch> I like it, kapow
P4:41:49 <Notch> *adds to todo
P4:42:06 <Kapow> like, I have dirt in one slot, ctrl+wheeldown changes it to wood
P4:42:07 <ZomBuster> ctrl+scrollwheel makes menu come up and scrolls trough blocks?
P4:42:26 <Kapow> instead of always having to bring up the whole list of blocks
P4:42:32 <Kapow> that would also be available though

P4:43:17 <paul|not> lol
P4:43:30 <liq3> I had to build the exit. ^^
P4:43:50 <wingboy> notch , people can still build on solid stones
P4:44:14 <C418> so?
P4:44:20 <Nadnerb> why wouldn't they be able to?
P4:44:30 <wingboy> can normally build on boundary blocks
P4:44:36 <wingboy> cant*

P4:46:34 <Quatroking> I hate the time of the month where I have to pay my hosting and everything :(
P4:46:37 <liq3> Notch: The ability for ops to delete Border Blocks only seems to refresh at server restart.
P4:46:37 <Gauphastus> My server should store my player's inventories so they can return and get their stuff back.

P4:47:04 <Kapow> I'm getting the same bug with glass that I was with leaves, if you try to build off the side of it from a narrow angle, sometimes the place the new block will appear goes inside the existing block

P4:48:04 <Kapow> that kept happening to me too
P4:48:07 <liq3> Kapow: I was getting your bug yesterday.
P4:48:13 <Kapow> I think it freezes when it can't connect, sometimes
P4:48:14 <liq3> With the placing inside blocks thing.
P4:48:15 <Notch> Prime_2: Has it always done that for you?
P4:48:19 <Rydia> Notch mushrooms should grow on dirt and wood
P4:48:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Can I like save a default block setup or something?
P4:48:21 <LKA> lol i just generated a map with lava count of 28
P4:48:24 <Kapow> it's doing it more since .19 came out
P4:48:25 <Zambuster> I got an input==null error
P4:48:30 <Zambuster> dunno what it means
P4:48:30 <Prime_2> It's crashed when trying to connect a few times in the past
P4:48:32 <liq3> Prime_2: That happens to me every time I try to join a server that isn't updated.
P4:48:39 <liq3> was happening yesterday.
P4:48:42 <Prime_2> but it's freezing every single time since the update
P4:48:44 <Kapow> nah these are updated
P4:48:45 <PuyoDead> can we have it so you hold down B, not a toggle?
P4:48:46 <liq3> Hrm.
P4:48:51 <Prime_2> and only once did it actually succeed at joining
P4:48:59 <Notch> kill your browser process and try again, it might've gone really bad
P4:48:59 <Rydia> and not need sunlight
P4:49:00 <Kapow> I had it crash and then killed java.exe and reloaded, and it worked
P4:49:05 <Notch> but the original freeze needs to be fixed
P4:49:10 <Kapow> once you take out java.exe the browser is free
P4:49:15 <Prime_2> Notch, I've been doing that over and over and over again
P4:49:17 <Prime_2> I even restarted
P4:49:25 <Prime_2> hell, I've found that the JAVA processes don't close
P4:49:34 <Kapow> that also happened to me once
P4:49:48 <Notch> yeah, if it hangs like that, the java process probably gets stuck
P4:49:51 <Kapow> extra instance of java.exe was running

P4:53:28 <Kapow> hmm
P4:53:30 <Kapow> testing it
P4:53:40 <Kapow> it only seems to happen if there's a block underneath
P4:53:58 <Kapow> like it's missing the existing block and trying to build off the one behind it
P4:54:12 <Prime_2> I have a question.
P4:54:20 <Zambuster> is that an picking problem?
P4:54:23 <Prime_2> Why can't you save a copy of a map in multiplayer to your hard drive?
P4:54:30 <Prime_2> when it's not your map, that is
P4:54:37 <Zambuster> because you can't yet
P4:54:40 <Rydia> lol i found a lava elemental
P4:55:44 <wingboy> griefng with admin blocks is lol
P4:56:13 <Kapow> it must be because of the transparency, it's seeing through the block if you're right next to it
P4:56:31 <Kapow> it's only if you're within 1 block distance
P4:56:37 <Kapow> like right next to it
P4:57:05 <liq3> LKA: What's your problem?
P4:57:38 <LKA> the only editor i had laying around (the minecrap one) can generate a blank map, but the new minecraft-server thing can't recognize it so it builds a new level over it
P4:57:40 <Prime_2> ...there needs to be more typing space in minecraft.

P5:00:45 <Prime_2> gravel and sand are stopped mid-fall by water.

P5:01:04 <Zambuster> you can just change it yourself

P5:01:14 <Kapow> although it's glitchy
P5:01:17 <Prime_2> with gravel bombs
P5:01:19 <Kapow> if you have a sand tower underwater
P5:01:26 <Prime_2> and then when I drop them, they just sit there on the water.
P5:01:27 <Kapow> and you break the bottom
P5:01:30 <Kapow> the sand above it will go down

P5:02:01 <Prime_2> make it slowly sink in lava

P6:50:20 <Rroff> what I could do with is pulling the server port out the config file
P6:50:27 <Rroff> thats gonna take a bit more bashing
P6:50:52 <Rroff> coz unfortunatly minecraft seems to result in a lot of sockets stalled in FIN_WAIT 1
P6:51:05 <Rroff> preventing it from restarting until they clear or you reboot
P6:51:05 <peerkoel> really?
P6:51:09 <Rroff> yeah
P6:51:15 <peerkoel> after closing?
P6:51:20 <Rroff> not sure if tuning keep alive would help
P6:51:22 <Rroff> yeah
P6:51:32 <peerkoel> I noticed a "can not bind" message now and then
P6:51:34 <Rroff> sometimes they don't even time out after 10 minutes
P6:51:45 <peerkoel> never took that long with me
P6:51:59 <Rroff> usually they drop in 200 seconds or less
P6:52:10 <Rroff> but I've seen the odd one thats been up over 10 minutes and forced me to reboot
P6:52:23 <peerkoel> that's ugly
P6:52:30 <Rroff> I blame java
P6:52:43 <peerkoel> I think the server could use a shutdown instruction
P6:52:47 <Rroff> I swear one of the main developers must have aspergers (gg spelling)
P6:52:57 <Rroff> is there a way to force sockets in FIN_WAIT to close?
P6:53:05 <peerkoel> if the server calls .close() on sockets and all I guess it should all be fine

P7:15:37 <peerkoel> eh?
P7:15:43 <vdgmprgrmr> It DOES.
P7:15:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> All of the Z vs Y discussions in here
P7:15:58 <peerkoel> and yes, he's probably trying to piss people off

P7:18:43 <vdgmprgrmr> What are you talking about?
P7:18:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Y DOES invert.
P7:18:54 <Rroff> http://aten-hosted.com/images/minec1.jpg << I love webmin :D tho I think I need to start moving stuff into catagories
P7:19:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I think you're talking about two different things.
P7:20:01 <vdgmprgrmr> There's coordinates and y-inversion on mouselook, and they don't have much to do with each other.
P7:20:31 <Rroff> yeah they do :P
P7:20:34 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't see many games where pressing Y inverts the mouse.
P7:20:38 <vdgmprgrmr> No, they don't.
P7:20:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Gamespace coordinates have three axes.
P7:20:51 <Rroff> Y is up/down in screenspace and Z is depth
P7:20:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Mouselook coordinates only have two.
P7:21:01 <Rroff> in world space Z is up/down
P7:21:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Rroff, that system is retarded, no matter how you look at it.
P7:21:40 <Rroff> its _the_ standard
P7:21:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't make it any less stupid.
P7:21:51 <Rroff> heh
P7:22:17 <vdgmprgrmr> And either way, the MOUSE only has two axes.
P7:22:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Not three.
P7:22:49 <Rroff> yeah but in 2D traditionally X is left<>right and Y up/down
P7:22:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P7:23:03 <vdgmprgrmr> And the mouse is 2d, thus, Y is up/down.
P7:23:04 <Rroff> so when you move into screenspace with 3 dimensions Z becomes depth
P7:23:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.
P7:23:24 <vdgmprgrmr> What the hell are you even trying to argue?
P7:23:36 <Rroff> I'm not arguing anything
P7:23:39 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P7:23:54 <vdgmprgrmr> You're talking about freakin' 3d coordinates and I'm talking about mouselook!
P7:24:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Mouse... 2d... X and Y.
P7:24:27 <peerkoel> yep, 3D coordinate systems are different everytime you blink your eyes
P7:24:39 <vdgmprgrmr> I still haven't quite figured out what Allnatural was trying to say...
P7:24:57 <vdgmprgrmr> <AlLnAtuRalX>vdgmprgrmr: I know, I'm just saying, there's plenty of debate on the subject, but putting that instead of the standard Y to invert just seems like he's trying to piss people off, that's all.
P7:25:02 <vdgmprgrmr> What the fuck does that mean?
P7:25:05 <peerkoel> he was just summing up different ways of defining 3 axes
P7:25:09 <Awol10> think of mouse 2d coord as X going left and right and Y going up and down which is why Z is depth
P7:25:19 <vdgmprgrmr> So where the hell did "standard Y to invert" come from?
P7:25:22 <peerkoel> because in the end, it all comes down to definitions
P7:25:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
P7:25:34 <vdgmprgrmr> My
P7:25:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Fucking'
P7:25:37 <vdgmprgrmr> God
P7:25:50 <peerkoel> you called? :P
P7:25:54 <Awol10> lol
P7:25:56 <vdgmprgrmr> I KNOW WHAT COORDINATES ARE.
P7:26:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I KNOW HOW THEY WORK.
P7:26:26 <peerkoel> but you didn't know what aln..something was talking about
P7:26:36 <peerkoel> you know how they work
P7:26:40 <peerkoel> he knows how they work
P7:26:46 <peerkoel> but you differ on definitions
P7:26:51 <peerkoel> that's all
P7:26:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, because "Y to invert" is obviously a reference to Y-inversion for MOUSELOOK.
P7:26:54 <peerkoel> and that's cool
P7:27:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Which there is NO DEBATE AT ALL over.
P7:27:08 <peerkoel> agreed
P7:27:39 <vdgmprgrmr> So he basically said "There's debate on what 3d coordinates are, but standard Y to invert seems to be an attempt to piss people off."
P7:27:46 <vdgmprgrmr> None of it made sense!
P7:28:03 <peerkoel> agreed
P7:28:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Y to invert is not a comparison to 3d coordinates, and I fail to see how it would have been an attempt to piss people off at all.
P7:28:43 <vdgmprgrmr> So if you AGREED WITH ME why were trying to tell me how fucking coordinates worked?
P7:29:21 <Kaidane> Chill out.  :P
P7:29:33 <vdgmprgrmr> It's freaking stupid!
P7:29:36 <peerkoel> I didn't try to tell you how coordinates work, I was just pointing out that there is obviously a difference in the definition people use
P7:29:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, but I fail to see how that was relevant.
P7:29:58 <peerkoel> screen vs. math axes and so
P7:30:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I say "Gee, that thing Allnatural said was completely incoherent." and you reply with "There is debate on 3d coordinates."
P7:30:24 <Evil-Ville> Why do people get so worked up over coordinates
P7:30:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, we're not even talking about coordinates.
P7:30:42 <Spazz> People (as in real people) will press "Y" and say "oh shit my mouse is inveterted" and then press "Y" again to undo it.
P7:30:48 <Spazz> It happened to me.
P7:30:48 <peerkoel> hold on, now I have to read the scrollback buffer to see what it is we are talking about
P7:30:54 <Spazz> It's fine as it is.
P7:31:00 <Spazz> Chill out and play multiplayer legos.
P7:31:17 <vdgmprgrmr> We're talking about this, Evil-Ville:
P7:31:22 <vdgmprgrmr> <AlLnAtuRalX>vdgmprgrmr: I know, I'm just saying, there's plenty of debate on the subject, but putting that instead of the standard Y to invert just seems like he's trying to piss people off, that's all.
P7:31:40 <Evil-Ville> Yeah he's a dumbass, discussion over
P7:31:44 <peerkoel> ah, I think this spurred my remarks:
P7:31:45 <peerkoel> [21 02:17:14] <vdgmprgrmr> And in the screen, regarding mouselook, Y is up and X is across, there is no Z.
P7:31:45 <peerkoel> [21 02:18:14] <vdgmprgrmr> In gamespace, there's just disagreement on whether or not to use engineering or mathematical coordinates.
P7:32:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I was showing that Allnatural's statement spanned two entirely different topics.
P7:32:59 <peerkoel> hm, well, sorry then, I seem to have been preaching to the choir
P7:33:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Sorry it's just random stupid statements piss me the hell off.
P7:34:14 <peerkoel> people tend to be like that
P7:34:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Minecraft is fun but my chair is black.
P7:35:07 <peerkoel> that's not so much stupid as irrelevant
P7:35:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Exactly.
P7:35:18 <vdgmprgrmr> And stupid.
P7:35:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Because the color of my chair has nothing to do with Minecraft.
P7:35:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, at all.
P7:35:54 <peerkoel> nah.. stupid would be .. "Minecraft is what DF should be like!!"
P7:36:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I believe Minecraft IS what DF should be like.
P7:36:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Nice and simple.
P7:36:17 <peerkoel> or "OMG notch should check out this game infiniminer"

P7:36:37 <Saint> Hey Osici
P7:36:37 <peerkoel> it's not going to be anywhere near as complex as DF in a while
P7:36:44 <vdgmprgrmr> The statement is actually coherent.
P7:36:44 <Saint> Mind if I ask you a question?
P7:36:58 <Saint> I know you probably get asked this a lot so sorry if it bothers you
P7:37:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Is Osici even here right now?
P7:37:10 <Saint> Any estimated time on release?
P7:37:17 <Saint> He's on the list

P7:37:28 <Saint> True
P7:37:30 <vdgmprgrmr> There's 74 people on the list.
P7:37:39 <vdgmprgrmr> But there's maybe six here.
P7:37:39 <peerkoel> well he's here, but is he at his computer? :)

P7:40:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Hello.
P7:40:59 <peerkoel> graduation parties are fun
P7:41:24 <peerkoel> you can usually just walk into any of them, have a drink and a good time, and not know anybody present :P

P7:47:42 <Rroff> remote/automated features
P7:48:06 <SaintAckbar> You mean like with friends and stuff
P7:48:14 <Rroff> I mean for instance
P7:48:15 <vdgmprgrmr> You could just make a script to do that.
P7:48:18 <SaintAckbar> If Notch does implement a friends list
P7:48:32 <SaintAckbar> Or when
P7:48:35 <SaintAckbar> For that matter

P7:49:40 <SaintAckbar> Ah
P7:49:54 <SaintAckbar> Sounds interesting
P7:50:11 <Rroff> so your remote script logs in, opens a port, server will then pipe events to it and listen for incoming command replies

P8:33:31 <Quatroking> then how the hell am I reaching the 700 fps again

P9:08:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, it's serverside

P9:53:13 <paul|not> if he can't connect then the problem is almost certainly with ports

P9:54:59 <NgLF> does that effect ports?
P9:55:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe

P9:55:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> there it is

P11:26:17 <Maulrus> yeah
P11:26:22 <Maulrus> I don't know why though :c
P11:26:31 <Maulrus> stupid me not knowing anything about online-ness
P11:26:40 <liq3> Holy shit batman, so many colours: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=c988377de9073e402a695189dbaeaed0
P11:28:29 <Maulrus> how does one go about setting up a server
P11:28:58 <liq3> Down this. http://www.minecraft.net/minecraft-server.zip. Forward ports if you have a router. Run "start_server.bat". Enjoy.
P11:29:06 <liq3> Ports = 25565.
P11:29:15 <Kaidane> Hmm.  I can't connect to my local server anymore.  :/
P11:29:33 <Kaidane> "An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine"
P11:29:47 <liq3> Kaidane: make sure you have latest server software.
P11:30:09 <Maulrus> ah, thought it had something to do with forwarding it
P11:30:10 <liq3> README says latest is 1.8.2
P11:30:20 <Maulrus> though I tried to avoid it cause I can't remember the pass I set for the router >_>;;
P11:31:09 <Kaidane> liq3: It is the latest.
P11:31:19 <liq3> Maulrus: Gotta forward ports whenever you wanna accept incoming connections I think. :P
P11:31:26 <liq3> I.e. whenever you run any server.
P11:31:29 <liq3> software.
P11:31:56 <liq3> Because otherwise the router has idea which PC on the local network to send the info.
P11:32:51 <Maulrus> okay
P11:33:00 <Maulrus> thanks for the help, I've never done anything like this before
P11:33:19 <Kaidane> Bah.
P11:34:32 <Kaidane> This is odd since I was literally just on it before it started returning this error.
P11:34:45 <Kaidane> Something must be aborting my connections..
P11:36:28 <Kaidane> Scratch that.
P11:36:31 <Kaidane> It's working again.

P11:58:56 <skullxreaper> Hello again. Does anyone know why when chaging my skin the preview will not update? I know my ISP caches things but hitting ctrl F5 does nothing. Neither does clearing the local cache
P11:59:28 <skullxreaper> Firefox and IE are the same.
