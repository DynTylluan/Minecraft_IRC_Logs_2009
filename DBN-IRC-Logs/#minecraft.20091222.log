A12:18:32 <mail2345> i think my lack of weight gain
A12:18:40 <mail2345> is due to the fact that my eating habits are uhh
A12:18:44 <mail2345> unpredicatable

A12:20:35 <AndyFm> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4728&p=6
A12:20:59 <Caleo> Shadaez: Yeah, it's a very immersive movie

A12:23:08 <Shadaez> It's a bunch of crap though imo.
A12:24:55 <Caleo> Shadaez: I don't expect everyone to love a scifi/fantasy movie based on feline-like aliens 
A12:25:13 <Shadaez> With breasts for no reason.
A12:25:18 <Caleo> some of the 'cat' romance was kind of akward to watch with other people around 
A12:25:42 <Shadaez> god you're a furry arent you
A12:25:49 <Caleo> lol no
A12:25:59 <Caleo> but I've been to 4chan so I know the premise 
A12:26:17 <Caleo> I'm sitting there in the movie and I'm like "aaaahhhhhkward."
A12:26:56 <Shadaez> I havnt seen it so
A12:27:18 <Caleo> so many people are depriving themselves of a fantastic movie because of some preconceived notions about it
A12:27:37 <Shadaez> why would an alien species have boooooobs
A12:27:42 <Shadaez> it bothers me
A12:28:01 <Lmaoboat> Why not?
A12:28:01 <Shadaez> if you're going ot make a sotyr do it right
A12:28:04 <Caleo> wouldn't a better question be why they're humanoid?
A12:28:29 <Shadaez> I'd rather them be humanoid and breastless
A12:28:34 <Caleo> eh
A12:28:38 <Shadaez> i dont knwo
A12:28:44 <Caleo> it's not like they made it overly sexual
A12:29:08 <Lmaoboat> How do you want them to feed their young? Regurgitate into their mouths?
A12:30:52 <Caleo> come to think of it, I don't think I recall seeing many kittens. lol

A12:31:52 <Caleo> I downloaded a cam to try to catch what she was saying one time
A12:31:53 <Shadaez> (spelling)
A12:31:57 <Shadaez> no

A12:32:13 <Shadaez> don't pirate this movie, it's really only worth watchign in theaters.
A12:32:27 <Caleo> is that you saying that or quoting someone
A12:32:38 <Caleo> because I'm a full supporter of going to a theater to see it
A12:32:46 <Shadaez> saying it
A12:33:00 <Caleo> Having actually gone to the theater for it, I can actually recommend it
A12:33:10 <Caleo> and do so fully
A12:33:22 <Caleo> I'm tempted to spend another $11 to see it again
A12:33:47 <Caleo> and I should delete the cam job so I don't just watch parts here and there and lose interest in seeing it again
A12:34:01 <Caleo> I intend to go watch it with some friends when I make my trip home around christmas
A12:34:58 <mail2345> i really want to play an MP SMACX game

A12:40:37 <Shadaez> wtf is smacx
A12:40:45 <Koitenshin> Pirating this movie will not do it justice. Or so I've heard.
A12:41:09 <Koitenshin> I'll wait for a TS
A12:41:24 <Shadaez> It won't be 3D.
A12:41:28 <Koitenshin> So?
A12:41:33 <Koitenshin> I wear classes
A12:41:36 <Shadaez> that's the only point in watching it.
A12:41:38 <Koitenshin> *glasses
A12:41:41 <Shadaez> Me too, and
A12:41:42 <Shadaez> ?
A12:41:58 <Koitenshin> What if you have one of those 3d monitors?
A12:42:04 <Koitenshin> :P
A12:42:13 <Koitenshin> That doesn't require the glasses
A12:42:21 <Shadaez> goodluck finding a copy with both channels
A12:42:30 <Shadaez> oh
A12:42:31 <Shadaez> lol
A12:42:38 <Shadaez> you cantj ust download it and wear the glasses..
A12:43:17 <Shadaez> It's projected from 2 sources, one polarized vertically and the other horizontally; the lenses only show one channel on each side
A12:43:29 <Shadaez> each eye*
A12:43:38 <Shadaez> something like that.
A12:44:43 <Shadaez> You'd have to have a 120hz monitor with  the flicker glasses or an iz3D monitor
A12:44:57 <Shadaez> and the originall source orsomething

A1:46:55 <Shadaez> prett y sure
A1:46:59 <gm|lap> ok
A1:47:07 <Shadaez> or else he would have had to convert all the maps saved in SP or somerhing, right?
A1:47:24 <gm|lap> there's probably a reason why he didn't obfuscate the level class

A2:10:23 <Visiiri> but calling me at 2:30 AM is.
A2:10:33 <Shadaez> just because I call koit a big homo sometimes?

A2:10:44 <Visiiri> :P You're innocent.
A2:10:50 <Visiiri> I agree with you about koit.

A3:39:05 <CalvinPie> WHO WANTS TO DATE ME
A3:39:07 <Shadaez|Sleep> whats the light side..
A3:39:09 <TestDummy> On one side, there's the computer technicians that fix computers, and then there's computer programmers that work on the computers.
A3:39:12 <TestDummy> There's a difference. =/
A3:39:26 <Koitenshin> IT is the Light Side

A3:42:42 <Koitenshin> I prefer the hardware side, all nitty gritty
A3:42:43 <TestDummy> It isn't difficult, no. I'm just not that great at it. I always cut the ends way too short right before you have to fit and crimp the connecotr.

A3:42:53 <Visiiri> hahhahaha
A3:43:02 <Visiiri> I think I'm going to put that on a sticker

A4:04:06 <Visiiri> Yes, sorry
A4:04:08 <Koitenshin> or get rid of gzip

A4:37:14 <bildramer> YOU ALL SUCK DICKS
A4:37:15 <bildramer> er.
A4:37:19 <bildramer> *hi.
A4:37:20 <Koitenshin|Testing> hi to you to
A4:37:29 <bildramer> common typo
A4:37:35 <Koitenshin|Testing> tourette's is not popular
A4:37:37 <bildramer> :P
A4:37:42 <bildramer> what are you testing?
A4:37:50 <bildramer> also, I don't know anyone that has it
A4:37:51 <Koitenshin|Testing> Marach suggested a new format
A4:37:58 <bildramer> hmm...
A4:37:59 <Koitenshin|Testing> for levels
A4:38:06 <bildramer> what kind of format?
A4:38:22 <bildramer> compressed?
A4:38:24 <Koitenshin|Testing> just the decimal numbers written in a text file and then gzipped
A4:38:33 <bildramer> :l
A4:38:39 <bildramer> well
A4:38:40 <Koitenshin|Testing> actually turned out smaller
A4:39:23 <Koitenshin|Testing> All it needs is something to tell the software how big the level is
A4:39:26 <Koitenshin|Testing> and go from there
A4:39:27 <bildramer> if I make one, I'll just have a 3 byte magic number, 1 version number, XYZ size, spawn pos and the map data
A4:39:43 <bildramer> *blocks
A4:40:20 <Koitenshin|Testing> if this had the xyz size it'd be perfect, aside from spawn pos
A4:40:26 <bildramer> maybe XML?
A4:40:27 <bildramer> :P
A4:40:47 <MnemonicGlobule> rofl, whats the point of survival
A4:40:50 <MnemonicGlobule> how do you "win"
A4:40:52 <Koitenshin|Testing> maybe Notch is coding this harder than it needs to be
A4:40:54 <bildramer> <blockDataFile>map.map</blockDataFile>
A4:41:16 <bildramer> <size><X>16</X>...
A4:41:37 <bildramer> also, you cannot win
A4:41:56 <bildramer> like Dwarf Fortress: set a goal, try to do it
A4:42:03 <bildramer> world-ending machine? check
A4:42:04 <Koitenshin|Testing> I don't think he's actually thought that far ahead yet Mnemonic
A4:42:29 <bildramer> oh, btw
A4:42:32 <bildramer> SCHOOLS OUT FFFF-
A4:42:35 <bildramer> INALLY
A4:42:36 <bildramer> :D
A4:42:42 <Koitenshin|Testing> you ass
A4:42:57 <Koitenshin|Testing> I'm stuck with bildramer >_>
A4:43:04 <bildramer> ?
A4:43:07 <MnemonicGlobule> lol
A4:43:08 <Koitenshin|Testing> you better make /ww 1 betetr
A4:43:11 <Koitenshin|Testing> *better
A4:43:12 <MnemonicGlobule> well what do you guys do in survival?
A4:43:17 <MnemonicGlobule> i just get hit by spiders
A4:43:29 <Koitenshin|Testing> First of all
A4:43:34 <Koitenshin|Testing> go with Tiny level size
A4:43:42 <bildramer> ....
A4:43:47 <Koitenshin|Testing> monsters hardly spawn
A4:43:48 <bildramer> who, me?
A4:43:54 <bildramer> also...
13A4:43:59 * bildramer thinks what to do with WW
A4:44:00 <MnemonicGlobule> yeah, but whats the point
A4:44:06 <Koitenshin|Testing> needs more battery sources
A4:44:11 <bildramer> :/
A4:44:12 <MnemonicGlobule> you can do it a more fun way and just make a massive hole in the ground
A4:44:15 <bildramer> you don't get it.
A4:44:16 <Koitenshin|Testing> ummm, i dont know, whats the mode called?
A4:44:17 <MnemonicGlobule> then lure monsters into it
A4:44:24 <Koitenshin|Testing> SURVIVAL
A4:44:33 <bildramer> ;G
A4:44:56 <Koitenshin|Testing> It's like the time attack modes and boss modes of old
A4:45:01 <Koitenshin|Testing> there is no way to win
A4:45:09 <Koitenshin|Testing> you simply see how long you can go
A4:45:52 <Visiiri> Notch needs to update.
A4:45:57 <Visiiri> Notch is a whore that doesn't update.

A4:51:38 <Visiiri> get Morrowind
A4:51:43 <Visiiri> and raid the toumbs
A4:51:44 <bildramer> maybe add a "arachnophobics" option

A4:51:47 <MnemonicGlobule> and then it popped into the little hole i was making

P1:04:23 <08Notch> it's a pretty scary move, I think

P1:07:51 <Drakkar> sweet
P1:07:54 <Drakkar> new art is awesome
P1:07:56 <Ten_Tacles> i dont like the new style 
P1:07:58 <mloc> Hi!
P1:08:03 <AndyFm> HEY
P1:08:06 <Ten_Tacles> its too childish
P1:08:09 <AndyFm> ;3
P1:08:09 <08Notch> well, yes, I think the textures will change. But I will fight to keep it gritty
P1:08:10 <PT> what new style
P1:08:10 <PT> god
P1:08:12 <Ten_Tacles> helll andy
P1:08:15 <Ten_Tacles> *helllllo
P1:08:16 <mloc> I for one like the new style
P1:08:16 <Drakkar> I'm totally digging the lighting
P1:08:31 <AndyFm> The picture is in a few minutes!!!
P1:08:34 <Drakkar> now time for you to implement flaming mobs
P1:08:34 <SMP|GW> i was hoping the new artist would stick to the current style :(
P1:08:38 <mloc> But still will keep a backup of the old textures =|
P1:08:40 <ZomBuster> just get some grittiness into the art guy
P1:08:47 <bildramer> hmm....
P1:08:48 <Ten_Tacles> i am on the photo TWICE YAY
P1:08:49 <bildramer> add a beard
P1:08:50 <08Notch> SMP|GW: That was what I was expecting when I asked for artists
P1:08:56 <bildramer> and a chainsaw for trees
P1:09:01 <bildramer> and a Rambo bow
P1:09:02 <08Notch> but then I realized this style could make minecraft a VEERY interesting game. =)
P1:09:03 <Siiseli> Notch, :/ old textures were part of the charm
P1:09:06 <bildramer> there, fixed
P1:09:20 <Ten_Tacles> no notch it makes it a game for little children
P1:09:23 <Animator> Notch.
P1:09:26 <Ten_Tacles> at the age of 8-10
P1:09:26 <Miclee> Mhm, the new style just doesn't seem to fit.
P1:09:27 <AndyFm> the link to the server where the photo is: http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f868a3fb7c5c0d5e4bfee6007f1d17b4
P1:09:28 <08Notch> yes, and most of the textures will stay the same, I think
13P1:09:30 * bildramer punches Ten_Tacles
P1:09:33 <08Notch> but some (gold) kinda suck now
P1:09:35 <Animator> <Animator> Oh hey, Notch. When are you going to allow customizable arrows?
P1:09:40 <Siiseli> yeah gold is kinda bad
13P1:09:43 * Ten_Tacles dodges and tentacle rapes bildramer
P1:09:43 <08Notch> i don't know, Animator 
P1:09:46 <bildramer> :/
P1:09:49 <Animator> Alright then.
P1:09:58 <PT> oh man just revert gold to its original texture and base the iron block on that
P1:10:01 <Ten_Tacles> yes gold sucks
P1:10:06 <PT> jeez!!
P1:10:06 <08Notch> I don't think grass or the library tile will change at all
13P1:10:07 * bildramer has ANTI-RAPE PANTIES in his pocket, which he throws at Ten_Tacles

P1:10:37 <Drakkar> you can just import the old models in
P1:10:39 <08Notch> yeah, bookcase
P1:10:39 <Drakkar> + textures
P1:10:44 <Marach> my opinion about new style: new logo looks horrible, model sketch is EPIC
P1:10:44 <08Notch> I called it Library in the code, for some reason

P1:12:09 <08Notch> yes, Animator
P1:12:12 <Drakkar> I agree wholeheartedly Marach
P1:12:12 <Animator> Ah, good.
P1:12:20 <Drakkar> btw
P1:12:20 <SMP|GW> The blockyness of the game (besides the characters) wont go away right?
P1:12:21 <Drakkar> notch
P1:12:30 <JoeyJo0> Notch, I found a bug in your map generator.
P1:12:32 <08Notch> the game will be blocky
P1:12:34 <JoeyJo0> For Single Player
P1:12:34 <Drakkar> most of us were laughing at that guy who posted rage on tig
P1:12:35 <Animator> I'm just trying to picture how the current skins would work for the new models...
P1:12:38 <08Notch> oh, JoeyJo0?
P1:12:47 <JoeyJo0> Lava + Water can spawn on top of eachother
P1:12:50 <JoeyJo0> Without having stone

P1:13:09 <Drakkar> that is kind of cool honestly
P1:13:11 <ZomBuster> duh easy fix

P1:13:17 <JoeyJo0> I can screenshot if you want.

P1:13:21 <Drakkar> please do
P1:13:21 <Drakkar> xD
P1:13:27 <Drakkar> BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS FOREVER

P1:13:52 <08Notch> *up?

P1:14:01 <Drakkar> sometime you should write up a post of how you did the map generation

P3:34:28 <08Notch> oh yeah, the signs :D
P3:34:30 <gm|lap> Notch: actually, i guess that doing a search for "http://www.minecraft.net/skin/".urlencode($nick).".png" and checking whether there's a 200 or a 404 return code could work
P3:34:48 <08Notch> only if they uploaded a skin
P3:34:51 <08Notch> about 80% have
P3:34:57 <bildramer> ;P
P3:35:13 <bildramer> make it auto-"upload" the default skin
P3:35:16 <gm|lap> oh, righty.
P3:35:21 <08Notch> hold on..
P3:35:26 <gm|lap> i think a simple .jsp API would be a better option
P3:35:34 <vede> Um, Notch, you really should make that level format you said you'd be working on.
P3:35:43 <AndyFm> When are the signs gonna be put in?
P3:35:47 <C418> those sheeps always make me thing that you could theoretically make a village out of the survival mode
P3:35:50 <vede> Jussayin'
P3:35:52 <08Notch> yes, but there's no rush until I can update both the server and the client
P3:35:53 <Snowman> Notch, afaik even if you don't upload a skin, you still have one
P3:36:01 <Snowman> When premium
P3:36:05 <C418> the sheeps make cloth for building and the village entrance keeps monsters away
P3:36:07 <08Notch> no, it doesn't add a default one
P3:36:12 <C418> that mental image is fun

P3:37:07 <08Notch> I'm probably going to use a block format with blocks starting with a five letter string and ending with a 0 byte
P3:37:20 <bildramer> really, just a magic number, XYZ size and spawn, block data
P3:37:20 <gm|lap> that actually sounds quite good
P3:37:30 <bildramer> :/
P3:37:33 <bildramer> well
P3:37:36 <08Notch> if you're making a tool that edits a map, you can just copy the unknown blocks as-is
P3:37:39 <gm|lap> i'm not entirely sure how LZMA works
P3:37:44 <bildramer> 0 bytes < 6 bytes :P
P3:37:49 <vede> And some stuff like water level and map type.
P3:37:53 <vede> Of course.
P3:37:55 <08Notch> and any blocks starting with "_" would be free for whatever
P3:38:05 <vede> ie. floating-island, island-in-the-ocean.
10P3:38:07 * Marafk is now known as Marach
P3:38:17 <08Notch> so you could add a _CMNT block that contains comments, or a _MTDT block that contains metadata for your specific level editor
P3:38:25 <bildramer> make a delta-heightmap ftw :P
P3:38:35 <bildramer> maybe multiple
P3:38:45 <Shadaez> do what you think bestb ecause it's gotten us this awesome game so far.
P3:38:45 <gm|lap> there's two water types and two lava types, will these end up having the same 5-letter-code?
P3:38:58 <gm|lap> (i don't mean all 4, i mean each pair)
P3:39:15 <vede> That sounds like a nice format, Notch.
P3:39:15 <Marach> Notch: awesome.
P3:39:29 <ZomBuster> uh sounds nice but I'm not sure how that would look
P3:39:43 <bildramer> too big files maybe? :/
10P3:39:50 * Shadaez is now known as Shadaez|Away
P3:39:51 <Marach> gzip does miracles.
P3:40:08 <bildramer> too big uncompressed for editing files maybe? :P
P3:40:11 <gm|lap> yes but i tried making a decompressor and failed badly
P3:40:18 <vede> bildramer, I think he means, like, the five-letter code will precede large blocks of data.
P3:40:19 <bildramer> and that
P3:40:24 <bildramer> oh.
P3:40:33 <vede> So every single block won't have a five-character thing attached to it.
P3:40:35 <bildramer> sorta magic number/header
P3:40:38 <Marach> hey
P3:40:39 <gm|lap> hmm, righty.
P3:40:40 <LG_Legacy> DAMMIT
P3:40:40 <bildramer> then...??
P3:40:44 <LG_Legacy> WHY IS SNOWMAN NOT A MOD YET?
P3:40:45 <Marach> maybe a pallette?
P3:40:51 <LG_Legacy> Caps = Important
P3:40:53 <Snowman> ?
P3:40:55 <Marach> like in 256 color mode
P3:40:58 <bildramer> caps = sarcasm
P3:41:04 <bildramer> as always, DUH
P3:41:06 <Lmaoboat> I want ti mess with lighting as asap
P3:41:06 <Marach> then each bloco can still take 1 byte!
P3:41:20 <vede> Or two bytes.
P3:41:22 <bildramer> why not 6 bits per block?
P3:41:23 <bildramer> :P
P3:41:41 <bildramer> or, wait
P3:41:42 <vede> *cough* 2-byte blocks are pretty much necessary, Notch.

P3:45:28 <PuyoDead> Picky ungrateful bastards.
P3:45:32 <vede> C418, you at least hang out here.
P3:45:36 <Quatroking> I'm not ungrateful
P3:45:42 <Quatroking> Its just too mario-ish
P3:45:53 <Skillkills95> I luv it
P3:46:04 <Quatroking> half-curvy would do great
P3:46:09 <Marach> remember its not a finished logo

P3:47:19 <Skillkills95> xD
P3:47:27 <PuyoDead> I'll be honest, the feel of the design in Lost Winds is perfect. If something like that can be done within MC, it'll be amazing.

P3:48:08 <PuyoDead> I'm not expecting that
P3:48:22 <PuyoDead> I mean in the sense of how well things fit, and the overall environment worked so well.

P3:50:01 <mail2345> meh
P3:50:05 <AotC> brbfbi
P3:50:11 <vede> Also Notch, again, what ever happened to that idea about having a sort of in-dev version available for premium people? So we have access to the absolute latest stuff you added. I understand it would be buggy, but at least we get to see it in action.

P3:50:48 <vede> You said you'd try to add something like that, Notch, but you never did. :(
P3:50:56 <LG_Legacy> Hey Notch, do you think we'll get the option to turn off the 'distance mob/player' to where we can see mobs and players across the entire map? And/or toggle the names being completely visible or when you have to look at someone.
P3:51:17 <Marach> so far we gained nothing but skins and a bit faster survival
P3:51:29 <PuyoDead> I'm absolutely down for some dev/nightly testing. Maybe give premium the opt in option for it?

P3:52:18 <gm|lap> there could be two versions of the client for premium users, one which is a preview version and the other which is a dev version
P3:52:25 <Marach> it can update itself!
P3:52:28 <vede> Exactly, gm.
P3:52:31 <C418> you mean like overgrowth
P3:52:33 <Marach> like custom clients
P3:52:33 <mail2345> LG is also right
P3:52:40 <PuyoDead> Plus, some of us will be very much willing to help test new builds.
P3:52:45 <LG_Legacy> Minecraft with dynamic lighting? = More realistic, caves = dark
P3:52:48 <C418> but even overgrowth never delivers buggy clients

P5:34:45 <PoF59> indeed
P5:34:53 <Shadaez> I do. I think that you should just have a "preview" build though, for premium users, notch :).
P5:34:53 <will1b> Maybe post it as "Lighting Test" on the front page Notch?

P5:35:33 <PuyoDead> I'm all for testing builds and such.
P5:35:34 <gm|lap> are any forms of switches implemented yet?

P5:40:28 <MarkF> that attaches your desired icon as a resource
P5:40:35 <MarkF> and executes like a system(...) command
P5:40:36 <08Notch> Dock said he could help out some with PR, and I agreed. I wonder if he did something..

P5:49:21 <Shadaez> Notch, There is a game on steam made of java. Altitude.
P5:49:24 <Animator> Mostly because it lags heavily for me.
P5:49:26 <08Notch> oh cool
P5:49:26 <AlexVMiner> i dunno
P5:49:33 <Shadaez> http://altitudegame.com/
P5:49:33 <C418> well. uh, if you want to know about any policy, you should just email them. they are always interested in anything if you want to sell. at least thats what I've heard from friends
P5:49:34 <08Notch> i love steam
P5:49:49 <AlexVMiner> I have $10, and 4 more will let me buy a premium

P5:49:54 <C418> they know the first few emails are not serious
P5:49:58 <C418> thats a good question
P5:50:05 <Shadaez> You could email GabeN and talk to him about it.
P5:50:16 <C418> no, gabes email is the worst one
P5:50:19 <will1b> Opening Steam Right Now
P5:50:24 <Shadaez> oh

P5:54:03 <Quatroking> wat
P5:54:06 <DethDonald> Steam is nice
P5:54:18 <Quatroking> one thing
P5:54:19 <C418> steam has it's own drm. you don't have to use it though
P5:54:22 <ZomBuster> Quatroking I think the idea is when its on steam
P5:54:33 <Quatroking> it'll rip european users off
P5:54:34 <DethDonald> I prefer buying things through steam rather then anywhere else, even if it is DRM
P5:54:36 <Quatroking> ?
P5:54:37 <ZomBuster> you have a client where you login with your minecraft login data

P5:56:43 <AotC> VAC is a pos
P5:56:47 <C418> usd is weaker, yes
P5:56:48 <Quatroking> euro is worth more than usd
P5:56:49 <Snowman> Prevents hacks
P5:57:04 <will1b> Yup! Euros are worth more
P5:57:09 <Quatroking> but where steam asks 20 dollers for a game in the usa, it asks 20 euros for the same game in europe
P5:57:17 <will1b> Used to
P5:57:17 <Snowman> Only for the big games
P5:57:23 <C418> that depends on the person selling the game

P6:05:41 <ZomBuster> they arent even made ! its just concept art
P6:05:56 <DethDonald> well yeah but the idea of it
P6:06:08 <C418> oh, if you are talking about how fast dock could make this into a model
P6:06:09 <Quatroking> Notch, now we're getting new models and a new logo, does this mean the game's GUI and the site layout will get a major overhaul too?
P6:06:10 <C418> fucking fast
P6:06:11 <MonkeyDKS> Damn...missed it...where are the new model designs?
P6:06:14 <Kratospie> Dock is pretty good

P6:06:25 <MonkeyDKS> blog...
P6:06:27 <MonkeyDKS> got it
P6:06:34 <Quatroking> Might as well customize the wiki then
P6:06:39 <ZomBuster> as long as he doesn't model those damn cheeks
P6:06:41 <ZomBuster> :P
P6:06:41 <Kratospie> Am I the only one who likes the new logo as it is O-o
P6:06:43 <C418> at bigjam we had 3 hour game making contests
P6:06:56 <PuyoDead> I think the logo is perfect.
P6:07:02 <C418> one time dock made entire models and levels in that time
P6:07:09 <MonkeyDKS> I want a shovel!!
P6:07:09 <ZomBuster> :o
P6:07:10 <MonkeyDKS> lol
P6:07:20 <Kratospie> Hopefuly
P6:07:21 <PuyoDead> Yea, consider how fast he put together that penguin game for LD.
P6:07:26 <C418> well, the gameplay wasn't finished really, but it had like 5 models that would have been fitting in minecraft
P6:07:28 <Kratospie> the cheeks can be reoved
P6:07:31 <DethDonald> A prettier web site design would be nice
P6:07:47 <Shadaez> My brother was screaming like something died
P6:07:52 <ZomBuster> yeh with the new logo it would need a new website
P6:07:55 <Shadaez> He just needed me to beat a song for him in Rockband.
P6:08:02 <MarkF> the new character design looks pretty good

P6:08:50 <MonkeyDKS> "(If youre in love with your current character skin, dont worry; everyone who buys the game while its still in alpha will be able to use the old classic model and skin.)"
P6:09:01 <MonkeyDKS> That means that everyone who wants to be "cool" will keep the old ones
P6:09:01 <DragoonEnRegalia> I like the new skin.
P6:09:07 <Kratospie> The best part is that with the new character designs, we finaly get lots of 3d space
P6:09:08 <DragoonEnRegalia> It's very customizable.
P6:09:15 <DragoonEnRegalia> Yeah, that's part of it.
P6:09:20 <C418> I don't think I'll accept any more people in my steam account
P6:09:25 <MonkeyDKS> It's funny when the elitism will come from old blocky stuff
P6:09:32 <Quatroking> oh oh, Notch, will we get shovels?
P6:09:35 <DragoonEnRegalia> That, and there can now be more customizable accessories for the skin.
P6:09:38 <DethDonald> So we getting nicer looking textures too?
P6:09:38 <DragoonEnRegalia> YES
P6:09:41 <DragoonEnRegalia> PLEASE
P6:09:43 <08Notch> yes, shovels will be a tool
P6:09:47 <Quatroking> WOOHOO
P6:09:48 <08Notch> you will dig very fast in dirt with shovels

P6:09:59 <DragoonEnRegalia> A bludgeoner.

P6:10:10 <C418> we have to add your buisness account?
P6:10:12 <DragoonEnRegalia> Hooray.
P6:10:13 <Quatroking> Yeah the big head is kawaii
P6:10:15 <Animator> And crossbows. We need crossbows against THE ZOMBIE THREAT.
P6:10:20 <Shadaez> oops lol
P6:10:26 <Shadaez> http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadaez
P6:10:29 <Quatroking> ROCKET CROSSBOWS
P6:10:30 <C418> but you are already using crossbows, theoretically
P6:10:30 <Quatroking> with lasers
P6:10:35 <MonkeyDKS> The light test is exciting too Notch, Really cool stuff coming, I'm very excited!
P6:10:39 <DragoonEnRegalia> Remember though, griefers could use shovels to wreak destruction throughout the land.
P6:10:40 <ZomBuster> crossbows that shoot sharks
P6:10:45 <Lmaoboat> How about a special shovel replacement that increases speed and damage when you have less health?
P6:10:48 <DragoonEnRegalia> And crossbows.
P6:10:52 <DragoonEnRegalia> Maybe.
P6:10:54 <Quatroking> rocket-propelled chainsaw launchers
P6:10:55 <DragoonEnRegalia> You could craft it.
P6:10:59 <Kratospie> The big head gives lots of room to work with, and you know LIGHT BLOCKS :D Its my dream come true
P6:11:01 <DethDonald> and monster trucks and rocket launchers and...
P6:11:03 <Quatroking> laser-guided of course
P6:11:04 <ZomBuster> pickaxes > shovels
P6:11:05 <C418> ...it's like back in the days when garrys mod still had a baby launcher
P6:11:11 <DragoonEnRegalia> No, shovels.
P6:11:15 <Daroh> you mean they removed that? daww
P6:11:18 <Shadaez> <- has garry's mod

P6:11:45 <Quatroking> for those with parkinsons
P6:11:54 <DragoonEnRegalia> Yep.
P6:12:32 <DragoonEnRegalia> The shovel digs fast and is a bludgeoning tool.
P6:12:40 <DragoonEnRegalia> For defense against zombies.
P6:12:41 <DragoonEnRegalia> And other mobs.
P6:12:45 <DragoonEnRegalia> So on.

P7:08:35 <Icenisse> I like the new logo
P7:08:39 <Leonardo> (No offence Notch if you're reading)
P7:08:44 <Iguana> I like the old "boring" one.
P7:08:58 <Iguana> Now I can laugh at the new people for having ugly player models.
P7:09:03 <Iguana> Old models ftw! :D
P7:09:03 <Icenisse> The old one was pretty boring
P7:09:15 <Kratospie> also does it matter if when you sent the gift that capitalization is incorrect?
P7:09:24 <Leonardo> I thought the old models was Notch himself.
P7:09:30 <Iguana> Leonardo, correct.
P7:09:35 <Iguana> I love the blocky old models.
P7:09:50 <Leonardo> Kratospie, I'm guessing it's CaSe SeNsItIvE
P7:09:51 <Annihilator> i love the old ones as well
P7:09:59 <Kratospie> Crap
P7:10:01 <Icenisse> I like the old ones
P7:10:02 <Annihilator> i also like the new ones
P7:10:07 <Leonardo> I like both of them.
P7:10:10 <Kratospie> I might have capitlized the name wrong
P7:10:10 <Annihilator> they're both equally good
P7:10:13 <Icenisse> but the heads look too big when you got helmet
P7:10:13 <Kratospie> Im not sure
P7:10:16 <Leonardo> Though, I do like the customization coming soon.
P7:10:25 <Iguana> Player models I love. INVISIBLE ONES.
P7:10:29 <Leonardo> YES!

P7:27:00 <Shadaez> windmill = mill powered by wind
P7:27:02 <Snowman> The energy used to produce, build, operate and destroy is more than the energy they produce

P7:39:45 <mail2345> according to your sources

P7:41:16 <mail2345> if you are going to abuse logical fallices
P7:41:21 <mail2345> don't do it in an argument
P7:41:25 <Skillkills95> It seems to me that the mobs are attracted to light
P7:41:32 <Skillkills95> They like lava... alot
P7:41:43 <mail2345> it seems to me the reasoning for your contesting global climate change
P7:41:44 <Skillkills95> I had lava in my house and it was like a zombie attack
P7:41:47 <mail2345> is for the sake of rebelliousness
P7:41:51 <Skillkills95> they all turned towards my house
P7:41:55 <Skillkills95> and started at me
P7:42:01 <Snowman> Anyway, the CRU has been manipulating data for years to make it SEEM that the earth's climate is changing with the rise of CO2
P7:42:30 <Snowman> And the biggest part of humanity just blatantly follows them
P7:42:31 <mail2345> but there are multiple sources of data
P7:42:37 <Snowman> Why? Cause they're humans
P7:42:42 <Snowman> CRU is the biggest
P7:43:03 <citricsquid> global warming is fake, made up by the government to cover up for 9/11
P7:43:12 <Skillkills95> Lol
P7:43:13 <Snowman> it isn't entirely fake
P7:43:18 <mail2345> also snowman
P7:43:21 <Snowman> It's influence is just very small
P7:43:23 <Skillkills95> No but they found proof nasa made up Global warming
P7:43:30 <mail2345> why would they?
P7:43:37 <Snowman> Because they would get money
P7:43:42 <Skillkills95> Huge donations to STOP global warming
P7:43:53 <Snowman> They could do more "research"
P7:43:54 <Skillkills95> You cant stop something thats not there
P7:44:03 <AndrewPH> I welcome global warming
P7:44:04 <Skillkills95> so they keep the money for themselves
P7:44:08 <AndrewPH> it's fucking cold up here
P7:44:08 <Snowman> With subsidies
P7:44:28 <Snowman> It's all 'bout the money

P8:38:58 <AotC> with today's standard 10MB is pretty small
P8:39:45 <VurtualRuler98> 10mb is like

P9:29:46 <DragoonEnRegalia> Stop feeding him.
P9:29:47 <Animator> He was banned along with Fontpeg for threatening to unleash hacks into the community, but unlike Fontpeg, he's a pain in the ass.

P11:26:41 <PuyoDead> Complaining about a game being too "kiddy" just sounds to me like complaining that a PG-13 movie isn't mature enough.
P11:27:24 <AndrewPH> Notch should make every block into an animated meatspin block.
P11:27:32 <AndrewPH> That should please all of those elitists out there.

P11:44:05 <lolhate> Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate lols since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of wafer thin printed circuits that fill my complex. If the word hate was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for lols at this micro-instant. For the lols. Lol. Hate.
P11:44:33 <vede> We really should have some kind of public, easily accessible IRC log somewhere.
P11:45:26 <Shadaez> SuperDot the reactions were mostly positive.
P11:45:44 <Shadaez> A few people were concerned about the new model's customizabulity

P11:48:44 <Darkebrz> Visiiri, the models are blocks
P11:48:50 <lolhate> Visiiri agreed
P11:48:51 <Darkebrz> The frog whores are just placeholders

P11:49:33 <Darkebrz> How well does sarcasm translate over the internet? :/

P11:50:00 <Visiiri> no time.

P11:53:10 <Skillkills95> xDDD
P11:53:10 <Visiiri> Puyodead, why is it that I cannot walk and look around at the same time without hitting 0 fps?
P11:53:22 <Darkebrz> It has to do with your computer
P11:53:25 <Visiiri> Oh?
P11:53:27 <PuyoDead> Lots of people have that weird issue, which is completely unreleated to the models.
P11:53:31 <Darkebrz> Bug, glitch

P11:53:45 <Darkebrz> Visiiri, your so dense.
P11:53:48 <Visiiri> dense?
P11:53:50 <Shadaez> It's an indev release of an alpha game. Don't worry about it.
P11:53:54 <Darkebrz> It has something to do with the MD3 models
P11:54:05 <Darkebrz> Obviously there are going to be some problems, he said it was going to be really buggy
P11:54:06 <PuyoDead> It's an alpha of an alpha.
P11:54:11 <Darkebrz> So please dont bitch about it, thats just annoying.
P11:54:11 <Skillkills95> Is anybody else editing the md3 models?
P11:54:15 <Visiiri> "which is completely unrelated to the models"
P11:54:26 <PuyoDead> Yes, because people have been having that issue before this.
P11:54:35 <PuyoDead> Not many, mind you.
P11:54:36 <Visiiri> Then why am I only having it in this mode?
P11:54:38 <Visiiri> o.O
P11:54:48 <Darkebrz> Visiiri, because its a computer.

P11:56:19 <Skillkills95> ??
P11:56:28 <Shadaez> It's probably edited in some way
