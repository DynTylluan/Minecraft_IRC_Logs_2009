A5:26:11 <citricsquid> Allnatural was talking about the bandwidth usage, the reddit server uses around 250mb bandwidth/day
A5:26:53 <Quatroking> so about 10.4mb an hour

A5:40:53 <Quatroking> I ban'd him for an entire month with the "faggotry" as reason
A5:41:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Is it possible to contact a person starting only with an IP?

A5:45:22 <LayZ> So basically the good old way of rubbing your knuckles against his scull in a high speed collision is still the best way to deal with pesky retards.
A5:46:10 <Quatroking> pinpoint his location through IP and then bomb his house with mass destruction

A5:48:19 <JTE> Okay, so gravel/sand + watertimer Spleef is nearly impossible to clean up after. @.@;
A5:48:30 <Quatroking> oh god
A5:48:31 <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZK1SPy7Us
A5:48:58 <LayZ> lol'd
A5:49:06 <vdgmprgrmr> watertimer spleef?
A5:49:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Frightening...
A5:49:26 <citricsquid> multilayer spleef is awesome
A5:49:34 <vdgmprgrmr> But not as much was lava timer spleef.
A5:49:36 <citricsquid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64vKzlG4D9s
A5:49:47 <Quatroking> holy shit I'm getting this DVD
A5:49:47 <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r_zemRHBsI&feature=response_watch
A5:49:51 <JTE> vdgmprgrmr: I has a big water tank, plugged up with a single glass block at the top, it slowly spirals down a slide around and around the sides until it reaches the spleef field
A5:49:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And since lava's so slow, you can just have it coming straight down from above.
A5:50:04 <LayZ> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T74YrClkhPE
A5:50:07 <LayZ> groovy
A5:50:29 <JTE> Which is filled with two layers: A glass or red layer, and a sand or gravel layer, the idea being that if you can shoot out the lower layer, the top one falls down and you win easier.
A5:50:42 <JTE> But they float on water, so they end up EVERYWHERE. @.@;;;
A5:50:51 <LayZ> what floats?
A5:50:58 <JTE> Sand/Gravel blocks.
A5:51:02 <LayZ> Oh snap
A5:51:12 <JTE> They normally fall if there's nothing under them. But in water, they don't. They don't rise, but they don't fall either.
A5:51:34 <JTE> So it's a mess, I'll make the sand Spleef seperate... or something.
13A5:51:54 * JTE is making a spleef map instead of working on something more useful to everyone.

A8:42:34 <Dossy> tbh
A8:42:45 <Quatroking> Lol
13A8:42:48 * AlLnAtuRalX vomits blood.
A8:42:53 <Quatroking> Nah, I only troll around on Youtube these days
A8:43:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup, 100% troll
A8:43:07 <Quatroking> on those annoying emo video's about some guy who suicided or something
A8:43:23 <Dossy> The WoW one is the best :o
A8:43:35 <Quatroking> Its great to comment with "lol suicide is fucking awesome" and then read the response a week later
A8:43:39 <Syniphas> [10:42] <AlLnAtuRalX> Ooh, Syniphas, can you fix sound?
A8:43:55 <Syniphas> if you mean taking it off completely, i'd love to
A8:44:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Syniphas> and i made minecraft
A8:44:04 <Quatroking> anyways, I'm fine with the sound effect but honestly the music fucking rapes my ears
A8:44:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly
A8:44:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I want an option to turn off the music
A8:44:16 <Quatroking> even sped up zelda tunes sound better
A8:44:19 <Syniphas> yeah
A8:44:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> because it's choppy on my end
A8:44:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> the sounds are fine though
A8:44:43 <Quatroking> It's not choppy at all here, its just the worst tune one could ever put in a game
A8:44:53 <Syniphas> yeah
A8:45:44 <Dossy> Hmmm
A8:45:53 <Dossy> Minecraft needs some sort of... user thing
A8:46:01 <Dossy> Like, Friends and where they're playing
A8:46:03 <Dossy> etc
A8:46:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> wouldn't make a difference to me
13A8:46:25 * AlLnAtuRalX has no friends.
A8:46:28 <Dossy> Rofl
A8:46:36 <Dossy> Still, it'd be nice :p
A8:46:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft should have an enemies feature
A8:46:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> you add the names of people you hate
A8:47:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it wont let you click the servers they're on
A8:47:11 <Angrybanana> :D
A8:47:34 <Dossy> That'd be nice

A9:11:32 <fanta> yeah
A9:11:35 <citricsquid> like, if nobody is around me I can't delete the base.
A9:11:37 <wingboy> yeah good idea
A9:11:49 <citricsquid> or, you can't delet your own floor.
A9:11:51 <citricsquid> delete*
A9:12:20 <wingboy> but people who invade base cant be stopped :P

A9:13:04 <citricsquid> oh true
A9:13:11 <citricsquid> yeah, that'd be good

A9:18:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura wants to buy a VPS?
A9:18:32 <Dossy> We did a while back :o
A9:18:40 <Dossy> Before Minecraft, though
A9:18:48 <Adura> No, I hve a good source of VPSness.
A9:18:57 <Rroff> rapidswitch if your in the UK
A9:21:06 <Adura> AlLnAtuRalX, did you try the newest version of the script? 
A9:21:06 <Rroff> best VPS by far
A9:21:06 <citricsquid> vpss are for girlsssssss, dedi ftw
A9:21:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura when I get back from the dentist
A9:21:06 <Rroff> VPS are useful tho
A9:21:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> slicehost in the US
A9:21:06 <Adura> I use VPSlink.
A9:21:06 <Adura> If you need a referral code, ask. 10% off
A9:21:06 <wingboy> need more ideas for maps
A9:21:06 <wingboy> feed me
A9:21:06 <Adura> I need more ideas for admin script features.
A9:21:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> For some reason, VPSLink is in my history
A9:21:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> strange...
A9:21:06 <Dossy> Admin script for what? :o
A9:21:06 <Adura> For minecraft servers.
A9:21:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> For MC servers

A9:21:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> awesome
A9:21:58 <Adura> Yes.
A9:22:18 <fanta> You want ideas, Adura? here is one. I would like to have an bot in my IRC channel, which makes it possible to communicate with players via IRC
A9:22:32 <Adura> Yeah, people have suggested that. I'll get on that today.
A9:22:59 <fanta> at same time, you could read the chat stuff as well without being on the server
A9:23:12 <Adura> That might get spammy, but alright.
A9:23:13 <Rroff> thats quite a bit of work
A9:23:19 <fanta> no, not really
A9:23:33 <Adura> Oh, your server isn't chatty.
A9:23:34 <Rroff> if you already have a bot script then it makes it easier
A9:23:39 <citricsquid> I started making one that took any input that started with "/report" and sent it as a private message to me over IRC
A9:23:42 <citricsquid> but I gave up.
A9:23:55 <Rroff> adapt my script
A9:23:59 <Adura> You can't take fake / commands, though.
A9:24:00 <fanta> you use irris, add ad small script and your done
A9:24:01 <Adura> right...?
A9:24:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> irssi FTW
A9:24:13 <Adura> I use POE::Component::IRC
A9:24:25 <citricsquid> adura: You can? If they say "/report" it'll still output it, won't it?
A9:24:37 <Adura> I'll check.
A9:24:44 <Dossy> What are you coding this in? :o
A9:24:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I don't think / commands made by players get passed to the servers
A9:24:50 <Adura> Perl.
A9:24:52 <citricsquid> oh :(
A9:24:53 <Dossy> Ah, k
A9:24:53 <Rroff> prolly say unknown command or something
A9:25:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> It would be entirely possible to do report x
A9:25:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> but then all the players would see it
A9:25:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
A9:25:30 <fanta> ok, there a many possibilities. i can use a "screen" for irssi on my server with a script that simply reads out the server.log.
A9:25:33 <Adura> It'd be nice if Notch did allow fake commands.
A9:25:36 <Rroff>      15:25:29  Rroff admins: report
A9:25:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff, you're an op
A9:25:47 <Rroff> thats what happened in the server log when I did /report
A9:25:47 <fanta> i just cant "talk" back to the server :>
A9:25:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> deop youself then try
A9:25:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> all op commands get passed
A9:25:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> not user commands though
A9:25:57 <Rroff> ah
A9:26:04 <cryzed> I want the choppy sound to be fixed :(
A9:26:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> me too
A9:26:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think that's why Notch made /tp ops only
A9:26:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> he was too lazy to rewrite it so users can pass commands
A9:26:36 <citricsquid> or because /teleport was a compromise
A9:26:39 <citricsquid> he didn't even want to add it
A9:26:40 <citricsquid> afaik
A9:26:45 <Adura> Doesn't work, yeah... So, need to talk to Notch about that.
A9:26:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> I wanted /spectate, and he thought that was a good idea
A9:27:00 <Rroff> yeah doesn't work :(
A9:27:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's a PITA to implement though
A9:27:02 <Quatroking> Anyone got a nice server to build on
A9:27:06 <Rroff> the player gets a message saying your not a server admin
A9:27:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I do Quatroking 
A9:27:08 <citricsquid> Could always just use ":report citricsquid" or "report: citricsquid"
A9:27:11 <Quatroking> link?
A9:27:12 <Rroff> and nothing shows in the log
A9:27:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> or !report
A9:27:23 <citricsquid> or >report
A9:27:33 <citricsquid> or $report
A9:27:38 <citricsquid> or REPORTTTTTTT

A9:27:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> see you guys after that
A9:28:12 <Rroff> !report makes more sense tho it still shows on the server
A9:28:53 <citricsquid> I think it should be passed...

A11:32:29 <Batosai3591> hypothetically of course
A11:33:08 <doohan> Go get it activated?
A11:33:10 <doohan> Buy it.
A11:33:14 <Rroff> don't be cheap
A11:33:19 <doohan> The person at the shop is supposed to activate it.
A11:33:25 <Adura> Ghetto question is ghetto.
A11:33:34 <doohan> So if you buy it, it'll get activated. Simples.
A11:33:51 <Dossy> Or you could just kill a checkout guy and do it yourself, your choice
A11:33:57 <Batosai3591> got it as a gift so...

P12:02:31 <citricsquid> Quatro: It came out as blocks, about 30 lines of them.
P12:02:37 <Quatro> D:
P12:02:53 <EmpiresBane> can you add a Map Editting catagory to the wiki?
P12:02:54 <Quatro> So it didn't form well
P12:03:09 <Quatro> EmpiresBane: Everyone can
P12:03:30 <EmpiresBane> how do i add a catagorie not a page?
P12:03:44 <Quatro> just add category: in front of the page title
P12:03:51 <EmpiresBane> oh
P12:03:51 <Quatro> Anyways I've learned my lesson, IRC is shit when it comes to ascii
P12:03:53 <ZomBuster> they ban too fast in this channel

P12:18:16 <Adura> That wasn't ascii, though. :P
P12:18:19 <Quatroking> I can show you logs, I didn't.
P12:18:25 <ZomBuster> uuh I checked
P12:18:28 <ZomBuster> you did :
P12:18:29 <citricsquid> quatro: You did.
P12:18:35 <C418> you have to think about irc server lag
P12:18:38 <ZomBuster> it was probably just your client
P12:18:42 <C418> they kinda give you about 3 lines per second
P12:18:44 <Quatroking> In that case xChat is a piece of SHIT
P12:18:48 <C418> after that, they throttle you very extremely
13P12:19:18 * Quatroking is making cake
P12:19:19 <Adura> /set net_throttle off
P12:19:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura JSON and POE installed w/out a hitch, I'm just waiting for my server to drain so I can restart it with the script
P12:19:43 <Adura> Of course, without that you could get banned for flooding.
P12:19:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> That might take a few hours though
P12:19:56 <Adura> Drain... hm?
P12:20:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> For everyone to leave
P12:20:11 <Adura> Ah, indeed.
P12:20:12 <C418> steam has no throttling
P12:20:24 <C418> so if you are in a chat with over 200 people
P12:20:31 <C418> you kinda get 2 mbps of spam
P12:20:43 <C418> pure, unfiltered spam
P12:20:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yay... go no steam!
P12:20:52 <Quatroking> adura's ascii came in without lag tho
P12:21:00 <Adura> It was ascii.
P12:21:04 <citricsquid> That was 4 lines
P12:21:07 <citricsquid> yours was >20
P12:21:09 <Quatroking> 5.
P12:21:15 <Adura> And 5 lines is within XChat's throttle.
P12:21:15 <Quatroking> Yeah I guess
P12:21:23 <Quatroking> fine fine
P12:21:25 <citricsquid> It was loads more than that quatro, for me anyway =\
P12:21:28 <Quatroking> I'm sorry alright
P12:21:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> And, citricsquid is magically back and was watching the whole time!
P12:21:41 <Quatroking> anyways C418 I added cool stuff to your article
P12:21:44 <Adura> Do that /set I said, if you don't mind being floodkicked.
P12:22:05 <citricsquid> Quatro: You did 8 lines, were kicked, rejoined and sent another 8 then C418 banned you.
P12:22:21 <citricsquid> allnatural: shhhhhhh
P12:22:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P12:22:46 <Quatroking> i said i was sorry
P12:22:54 <Adura> Make sure you have enouggh ram for another process though.
P12:22:55 <Quatroking> :(
P12:23:25 <Adura> If you have only 1% RAM with your minecraft server running, the perl script won't be a good idea. :P
P12:23:30 <Quatroking> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/C418
P12:23:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol Adura
P12:23:36 <Quatroking> i added a funny new part

P12:23:57 <Adura> Huge map could cause that, heh.
P12:24:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> True
P12:24:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, is vote kick and ban implemented here?
P12:24:47 <Adura> Here...? Where?

P12:31:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> That is a correct sentence ;)
P12:31:36 <citricsquid> "Joe liked to edit the wiki pages until he was banned."
P12:31:37 <fydo> AlLnAtuRalX: yep
P12:31:48 <citricsquid> It depends on the tense... but it's entirely valid.

P5:43:52 <Fishlips> yeah it was fine earlier, now it just fails
P5:44:14 <cryzed> windows...
P5:44:26 <Fishlips> im tempted to go to ubunto
P5:44:34 <Fishlips> is it very different to windows gui wise?
P5:44:41 <cryzed> No if you are using GNOME/KDE
P5:44:44 <cryzed> it's pretty easy
P5:44:45 <cryzed> imho
P5:44:48 <cryzed> Ubuntu is GNOME
P5:44:51 <cryzed> *using
P5:44:53 <peerkoel> AlLnAtuRalX did you make Mapjack?
P5:44:58 <cryzed> But Fishlips one thing beforehand
P5:45:01 <cryzed> you can't just go
P5:45:23 <cryzed> "Yeah, let's install ubuntu. So why can't I execute *.exe files. I need to install my drivers"
P5:45:30 <cryzed> Things are a bit different
P5:45:31 <cryzed> with Linux
P5:45:35 <cryzed> not more complicated, just new
P5:45:49 <cryzed> You should actually take some time to get to know Linux
P5:45:55 <peerkoel> try the livecd :)
P5:45:56 <cryzed> though ubuntu makes your life pretty easy
P5:45:56 <Fishlips> you cant just execute exes :O
P5:46:06 <cryzed> No because *.exe's are Windows executables
P5:46:11 <Fishlips> ah k
P5:46:11 <cryzed> and not unix binaries
P5:46:43 <cryzed> while Using Ubuntu(Debian) your installers will most of the time probably be
P5:46:46 <cryzed> files ending with *.deb
P5:47:03 <cryzed> you've got a built-in software repository which you can browse and install all kind of apps
P5:47:12 <cryzed> ranging from tetris to a development environment
P5:47:15 <peerkoel> actually, there is usually only 1 installer that you use
P5:47:16 <cryzed> to firefox
P5:47:21 <cryzed> apt-get
P5:47:23 <cryzed> aptitude
P5:47:24 <cryzed> ?
P5:47:33 <peerkoel> whichever you prefer
P5:47:35 <Fishlips> interesting
P5:47:39 <cryzed> those are packet-managers if you ask me
P5:47:42 <Fishlips> ill look into it on the site n stuff :)
P5:47:45 <cryzed> do that
P5:48:02 <peerkoel> and try the livecd
P5:48:09 <cryzed> yes
P5:48:14 <cryzed> try the livecd installation first
P5:48:18 <cryzed> before you wipe your HDD
P5:48:20 <cryzed> and can't go back
P5:48:44 <Fishlips> so the livecd is like a simulation or something?
P5:49:00 <cryzed> yes
P5:49:05 <cryzed> it's running in your RAM
P5:49:09 <cryzed> not on your hard drive
P5:49:17 <cryzed> after restarting it's completely gone
P5:49:26 <cryzed> to get a semi-installation of Ubuntu
P5:49:35 <cryzed> you can insert the Ubuntu CD while having startet XP
P5:49:39 <cryzed> and choose the Wubi setup
P5:49:47 <cryzed> beware though - that's not the "real" installation
P5:50:01 <cryzed> it's setting up a virtual harddisk file on your C:/ partition
P5:50:07 <Fishlips> mines H
P5:50:09 <cryzed> which you can boot from when you start the PC
P5:50:12 <cryzed> then H:/
P5:50:12 <Fishlips> dont know why its H
P5:50:25 <cryzed> So for a quick slow try-out use the LiveCD
P5:50:36 <cryzed> for a semi-quick virtual installation use WUBI
P5:50:46 <cryzed> (Inserting the Ubuntu CD into Windows)
P5:50:50 <cryzed> and installing a virtual image
P5:51:06 <cryzed> if you did it with WUBI you can easily remove it via Remove/Install programs in Windows
P5:51:09 <cryzed> there won't be any traces left
P5:51:29 <Fishlips> alot of ways to try it i see :P
P5:51:30 <cryzed> If you want the full thing (fast, permanent) insert the CD while booting your PC
P5:51:40 <cryzed> and wipe your HDD :D
P5:51:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wubi isn't virtual
P5:51:43 <cryzed> and install Ubuntu
P5:51:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's a full install
P5:51:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> native
P5:51:52 <cryzed> Wubi is using a virtual disk-images
P5:51:53 <cryzed> actually
P5:51:58 <cryzed> *image
P5:52:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's not a virtual machine though
P5:52:13 <cryzed> Yeah
P5:52:18 <cryzed> that's not what I meant
P5:52:23 <cryzed> but it's no real "installation"
P5:52:31 <Fishlips> so i guess i will have to backup my harddrive
P5:52:36 <cryzed> it's a virtual partition in a file
P5:52:39 <cryzed> No
P5:52:44 <cryzed> You can just use the LiveCD
P5:52:45 <cryzed> or Wubi
P5:52:51 <cryzed> won't do anything to your hard-drive
P5:52:54 <Fishlips> i mean if i want permanent
P5:52:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> he won't be able to play MC on a livecd
P5:53:06 <cryzed> well there are 2 options
P5:53:09 <cryzed> if you want it permanent
P5:53:13 <cryzed> wipe off windows install Ubuntu
P5:53:16 <cryzed> or shrink windows
P5:53:20 <cryzed> and install ubuntu next to it
P5:53:25 <cryzed> then you can multi-boot
P5:53:29 <cryzed> WindowsXP or Ubuntu
P5:53:31 <cryzed> completely installed
P5:53:37 <cryzed> on 2 different partitions
P5:53:44 <Fishlips> any disadvantage to that?
P5:53:48 <cryzed> no, not really
P5:53:49 <cryzed> except
P5:53:57 <cryzed> size/2 of your HDD
P5:54:05 <cryzed> or whatever you told it to shrink it to
P5:54:14 <Fishlips> my harddrive is 500gig
P5:54:22 <cryzed> how much is free of it right now?
P5:54:29 <Fishlips> 300odd
P5:54:34 <cryzed> well you should be fine
P5:54:46 <cryzed> a vanilla ubuntu installation is 1-3gb I think

P5:56:54 <cryzed> 69mb
P5:56:58 <cryzed> doesn't raise anymore
P5:57:08 <cryzed> why are you restarting every 2 days?

P5:59:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura has custom scripts that allow administration via telnet, votekick, voteban, etc

P5:59:53 <cryzed> AlLnAtuRalX: okay - didn't know that about the custom scripts
P5:59:56 <cryzed> how do they work?
P6:00:03 <cryzed> hooking functions in the java bytecode
P6:00:05 <cryzed> when starting up?
P6:00:06 <cryzed> oO?
P6:00:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> it starts up the server and pipes input/output I would guess
P6:00:28 <cryzed> oh
P6:00:33 <cryzed> so it's using the same socket
P6:00:36 <cryzed> the opened
P6:00:42 <cryzed> maybe...
P6:00:49 <cryzed> well, that's pretty smart :)

P6:43:03 <JTE> Where do you have Java installed?
P6:43:26 <JTE> C:/Program Files/Java/jre6/ or something like that?
P6:43:34 <Bert> No idea, I'llf ind it
P6:44:01 <Bert> Yeah
P6:45:08 <JTE> Then, you can either add "C:/Program Files/Java/jre6/bin;" to your PATH environment variable (painful @.@) or edit the .bat file in a text editor to use "C:/Program Files/Java/jre6/bin/java" instead of just "java" (Less painful, but then you have to do it for every .bat you come across)

P7:49:05 <Adura> I can turn water into Lava.

P7:50:02 <Megatomte> So there is no definitive way of creating falling lava server? :P
P7:50:21 <Adura> Falling lava that floods the server server...
P7:50:56 <Megatomte> What do you mean? :D
P7:51:14 <Adura> Where would this lava be falling from, the sky?
P7:51:29 <Megatomte> the wiki defines it as
P7:51:31 <Megatomte> "A server, usually with a small, blank map, with a single block of lava at the top of it. Players are intended to try and construct a shelter before the lava engulfs the area ("surviving"). It is usually reset afterwards. "
P7:51:59 <Megatomte> So I guess a place in the sky?
P7:52:00 <Megatomte> :D
P7:52:01 <Adura> Oh.
P7:52:08 <Adura> Yeah, you'd have to reset it alright.
P7:52:44 <Megatomte> I get that too.. But, 
P7:52:49 <Megatomte> how would I create this?
P7:53:34 <Adura> There are some tools on the forum.
P7:54:24 <Lmaoboat> I hate routers >:(
P7:54:37 <Megatomte> Easy to use tools?
P7:54:57 <Adura> I don't know, I've never tried them.

P7:58:30 <vdgmprgrmr> There's a default username/password.
P7:58:53 <Lmaoboat> Don't know what it is, and the manual is in storage
P7:58:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Try a blank username and a password of "admin".
P7:59:04 <vdgmprgrmr> That's what mine was.
P7:59:22 <vdgmprgrmr> portforward.com should tell you the defaults for your router.
