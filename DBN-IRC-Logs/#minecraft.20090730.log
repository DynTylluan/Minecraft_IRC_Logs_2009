A5:36:54 <citricsquid> well, the server I run all my minecraft servers off is going offline soon, because I don't have the money to renew it (well, I do but I also want to go to London!) and the hassle of constanty fixing idiot ops messing stuff up is too much for my poor weak body to handle. I can host your server for you, but no guarantees on when it'll be up until :3
A5:36:59 <TrueWolves> Also, I just BSed a 600 word essay =D
A5:37:35 <TrueWolves> Citric, you do it for me for free, I have no reason at all to ever compliagn if you have to stop or such! =D
A5:38:35 <TrueWolves> Sooner or Later (I'm hoping sooner) I can host the server my self, though at the rate things are going that might not be for.... 8 months x.x; But alas, I can still make levels for people and hang on to my own ideas tell then or hand them off to others who want intresting maps =3

A6:18:27 <Snowman> I did, I was the one who said that
A6:18:32 <Quatroking> woaah

A6:20:03 <C418> I appreciate that, but if I read something when my back isn't turn, I only half believe it. my music isn't art or anything. I just do it as a hobby. and it's easy to hear that I'm not incredibly good

A6:21:07 <Drakkar> my best sprite is my twitter av
A6:21:24 <Snowman> Citric can you give me a completion percentage on the medal system?
A6:21:33 <Drakkar> http://twitter.com/PixelScum
A6:21:36 <citricsquid> Snowman: it's as complete as minecraft.
A6:21:46 <Snowman> alpha?
A6:21:50 <crazyboy11> so we can use it?
A6:21:58 <crazyboy11> cause we're all playing minecraft arent we?
A6:22:02 <citricsquid> okay, it's as complete as survival.
A6:22:08 <Snowman> YOU MADE IT IN PAINT?
A6:22:13 <Drakkar> anyway

A6:23:15 <citricsquid> I don't even know why I'm an op, I guess it's because of the forums but I'm really shit at it.
A6:23:18 <Drakkar> german and irish though
A6:23:19 <Drakkar> er
A6:23:20 <Drakkar> actually
A6:23:36 <C418> hm. I don't think you are "shit at it"
A6:23:42 <C418> and I mean it

A6:24:07 <Snowman> You're shit at finishing stuff at time
A6:24:07 <citricsquid> well, I can manage kicking, but I keep making inappropriate "jokes" :(
A6:24:19 <C418> snowman, who isn't?
A6:24:27 <Snowman> Notch :D
A6:24:38 <C418> oh, he's not the holy grail either
A6:25:13 <Drakkar> ugh
A6:25:18 <Drakkar> I need more AP
A6:25:25 <Drakkar> these zettas are eating my face
A6:25:26 <Drakkar> :|
A6:25:38 <C418> oh, I don't think my last messages came through
A6:25:44 <Snowman> Drakkar why are you online at 4:25 am?
A6:25:48 <C418> as I said, sandbox shouldn't have music at all
A6:25:50 <Drakkar> A)
A6:25:57 <Drakkar> it just dayrolled in billy vs snakeman
A6:25:58 <Drakkar> B)
A6:26:02 <Drakkar> I'm a writer
A6:26:07 <Drakkar> I think thats pretty self-explanatory
A6:26:07 <C418> it's a game mode that can get pretty insane artwise
A6:26:08 <citricsquid> Snowman: if you're not online at 4:30am you're not a proper internetererer.
A6:26:14 <Snowman> >.>
A6:26:19 <C418> so making music for something that can change infinitely is quite... hard
A6:26:34 <citricsquid> C418: is there new music specific to survival?
A6:26:34 <Drakkar> nah
A6:26:35 <Drakkar> C418
A6:26:41 <Drakkar> easy way to get past that
A6:26:43 <Drakkar> just
A6:26:45 <Drakkar> loop yakety sax
A6:26:46 <Drakkar> 24/7
A6:26:56 <C418> now making music for specific game modes, where I can predict the music style will be much more easier
A6:27:04 <C418> yes. survival, capture the flag, horror, that stuff
A6:27:05 <Drakkar> and C) I'm doing work on my rpg system and preparing for a game of deadlands
A6:27:14 <C418> I think I will focus on those game modes for music
A6:27:16 <C418> not on sand box
A6:27:44 <C418> what sand box should get though is ambient sounds
A6:27:51 <C418> birds chirping, water ambience
A6:27:53 <C418> that stuff
A6:28:03 <citricsquid> I hope there's l4d type music, where it works well at creating an atmosphere.
A6:28:15 <C418> we'll see about that
A6:28:26 <crazyboy11> you have l4d citric?
A6:28:27 <Drakkar> (deadlands is a western horror rpg which relies on cards for 98% of its mechanics, its very rad. Hell the main wizardy type archetype is something called a huckster which cracks open a hand of poker to determine how effective his hexes are)
A6:28:34 <Snowman> Yeah and you can listen to the music carefully and hear when a zombie horde is coming
A6:28:36 <citricsquid> crazyboy11: yeah
A6:28:40 <Drakkar> also
A6:28:46 <Drakkar> it has zombies and shit
A6:28:55 <crazyboy11> we totally have to play some l4d sometime
A6:29:08 <C418> I can make music like left 4 dead
A6:29:12 <Drakkar> and there's nothing better than playing a priest who wants to cleanse the world of darkness
A6:29:16 <citricsquid> crazyboy11 :D I need to check it runs properly, had to switch back to windows xp for my lan party because pc sucks for gaming on vista :(
A6:29:19 <Snowman> Everyone here should play l4d together :D
A6:29:22 <C418> the only question is if notch can trigger something like that with his code
A6:29:41 <Drakkar> he probably can
A6:29:46 <Drakkar> the concept isn't too hard
A6:29:47 <citricsquid> event based music would make minecraft so much better, I'd buy more copies! :D
A6:29:51 <Snowman> Citric, how many L4D Achievement you got? :P
A6:29:56 <Drakkar> I mean
A6:30:04 <Drakkar> if the zombies are spawning
A6:30:12 <C418> but we don't want to copy anything from left 4 dead
A6:30:16 <citricsquid> Snowman: not played in ages, not since the new achievements. I had one of the hardest achievements under the old system, I shall check!
A6:30:16 <Drakkar> its just a matter of catching different spawn triggers
A6:30:24 <C418> yes. we had event based music planned for sand box
A6:30:26 <C418> but as I said
A6:30:30 <C418> the game mode is too unpredictable
A6:30:34 <Snowman> I have all of the achievements, new and old :D

A6:31:15 <Drakkar> :V
A6:31:41 <crazyboy11> which is one of the hardest ones you have citric?

A6:32:09 <Snowman> http://steamcommunity.com/id/76561197993909199/stats/L4D?tab=achievements
A6:32:11 <Snowman> there
A6:32:40 <crazyboy11> no way dude, you got them all? :o
A6:32:45 <Snowman> :D
A6:32:55 <crazyboy11> well done
A6:33:04 <crazyboy11> I'm close, 54 out of 58 i think
A6:33:41 <citricsquid> if it's the ones I'm supposed to be making; they'll be sort of like steam game achievements, or xbox, where you do specific things and get a "badge" for it, but users can also create their own for competitions and stuff. So like, a member could post a competition for building the best pacman and then give the winner a badge/medal/whatever. 
A6:33:42 <citricsquid> It'd be pretty awesome if eventually there was a way to get them implemented with the main minecraft game, that'd be awesome, but not sure if it's possible to do it securely and whether or notch would want to. Assuming you meant the forum things, if you meant something else, dunno ;)
A6:34:05 <citricsquid> Snowman: how much time did you play l4d for?
A6:34:05 <Drakkar> I see

A6:34:22 <Drakkar> quitting during a horror match
A6:34:24 <Snowman> You can also get medals for eating 1 year old haribos
A6:34:30 <crazyboy11> total playtime, 119h 52m 36s
A6:34:31 <Drakkar> really
A6:34:34 <Drakkar> can i have one then
A6:34:35 <crazyboy11> wasted a lot of time on l4d
A6:34:42 <Snowman> nice crazy
A6:34:55 <Snowman> Nothing special is so fucking hard
A6:35:03 <crazyboy11> tell me bout it
A6:35:08 <crazyboy11> its the tank that gets us
A6:35:20 <crazyboy11> cant take any damage from a tank... so diffuclt to do
A6:35:30 <Snowman> yeah you should basically just run and shoot
A6:35:31 <crazyboy11> someone always gets hit by a rock :/
A6:35:48 <citricsquid> Drakkar: I'd love if eventually they were possible to obtain in game, maybe when I get a nice system built notch would be willing to consider it, but I can't think of a way to communicate the data securely right now :( People have been decompiling minecraft lots, so they'd be able to find an easy way to spoof the info.
A6:36:04 <Snowman> you shouldnt try it on no mercy, finale is too compact
A6:36:19 <Drakkar> yeah
A6:36:22 <Drakkar> I understand
A6:36:38 <crazyboy11> could glitch the no mercy finale
A6:36:50 <Snowman> In the jesus room?
A6:36:57 <crazyboy11> nah, they fixed that
A6:37:05 <Snowman> oh ok
A6:37:15 <citricsquid> I played through L4D on expert campaign with friends, we completed most of it, spent a good 50 hours doing it. 
A6:37:19 <crazyboy11> theres a ledge you can crouch on, near the edge of the building, and most stuff just runs off the edge
A6:37:26 <Drakkar> I've never played l4d

A6:40:45 <citricsquid> my spec :(
A6:40:56 <citricsquid> graphics card is awful.
A6:41:25 <Drakkar> i bet mine is worse
A6:41:42 <Drakkar> I...
A6:41:44 <Drakkar> don't know
A6:41:45 <Drakkar> lkmao
A6:42:00 <Drakkar> yes mine is 
A6:42:07 <Drakkar> yours has a bit better specs than mine
A6:42:13 <Drakkar> though the whole ATI vs NVidia thing
A6:42:17 <Drakkar> obfuscates things
A6:42:55 <citricsquid> I don't understand hardware that much, just that higher ram and ghz is normally better ;D 
A6:43:10 <crazyboy11> citric, throw all that out the window with games
A6:43:14 <crazyboy11> its graphics that matters most
A6:43:36 <citricsquid> I thought higher graphics ram = better gaming?
A6:43:48 <crazyboy11> I thought that too, but the GPU really matters
A6:43:58 <citricsquid> =o
A6:44:11 <Drakkar> afaik
A6:44:14 <Drakkar> graphics ram is just
A6:44:22 <Drakkar> a way to take the load off the rest of the system
A6:44:42 <crazyboy11> a place to store graphics stuff so it doesnt take up ram
A6:44:58 <crazyboy11> but it still needs to be processed before it can be displayed
A6:45:06 <crazyboy11> and that takes falls mainly to the GPU

P12:43:02 <kappaOne> just chasing a bug where keyboard input does not work for mac users

P12:48:17 <Maveric> kappaOne: use that as an excuse to get off a mac :P
P12:48:37 <kappaOne> :)
P12:48:54 <Maveric> Well, my compile is going now its really time for sleep. two hours after I first said it :P
P12:48:54 <kappaOne> problem is i don't have a mac, so can't test if problem exists
P12:49:23 <Maveric> I wouldn't worry
P12:49:35 <Maveric> If they use a mac, they'll find *soething* to complain about
P12:50:15 <citricsquid> kappaOne: been reported a few times, there is mac compatability problems.
P12:50:43 <kappaOne> ah so other have reported broken keyboard controls?
P12:50:54 <citricsquid> I saw a topic a few weeks back, I'll see if I can find it :)
P12:51:09 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=960
P12:51:19 <Maveric> Is there a git repo of the code about? I wouldn't mind checking it out oneday
P12:51:47 <citricsquid> of minecraft?
P12:51:49 <kappaOne> yeh there is
P12:51:49 <Maveric> Mm
P12:51:56 <kappaOne> ah not for minecraft
P12:51:58 <kappaOne> but LWJGL
P12:52:07 <kappaOne> i usually handle the applet stuff for that library
P12:52:25 <Maveric> Oh, minecfrat isn't open source, is it :(
P12:52:26 <kappaOne> so just hoping the bug can be fixed
P12:52:40 <citricsquid> It will be in a year or so, when the project dies down, but for now it isn't.
P12:52:50 <kappaOne> so its not really a minecraft but but the library it uses
P12:52:57 <kappaOne> *minecraft problem
P12:52:59 <citricsquid> "Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release the game source code as some kind of open source. I'm not very happy with the draconian nature of (L)GPL, nor do I believe the other licenses have much merit other than to boost the egos of the original authors, so I might just possibly release it all as public domain. "
P12:53:22 <Maveric> o.0
P12:54:00 <kappaOne> ah looks like the problem is fixed in new version of java
P12:54:12 <citricsquid> is it down to java sucking on a mac?
P12:54:27 <kappaOne> yeh looks like it :)
P12:54:39 <kappaOne> citricsquid thx for the link to that thread
P12:54:42 <kappaOne> most useful
P12:54:45 <citricsquid> np :)
P12:54:54 <kappaOne> will show the other developers, hopefully we can find a fix for it
P12:55:29 <citricsquid> :)

P2:46:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: IRC is far too active
P2:47:11 <Animator> This'll all be over when the game stops being free.
P2:47:11 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: This is like, the only channel I've ever seen active.
P2:47:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> We should split into minecraft-support and minecraft-offtopic or something
P2:47:14 <ChJees> Far more active than the Wurm Online IRC >_>

P2:47:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> I contribute a bit to each
P2:47:53 <citricsquid> I only use 1 at a time normally.
P2:47:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm on Chatnet, this, Freenode, irc.ubuntu.com, etc

P2:50:46 <AlexVMiner> everyone is green to me
P2:50:51 <AlexVMiner> what am i?
P2:50:59 <PuyoDead> same light blue color as natural
P2:51:00 <UnknownX> wow
P2:51:07 <UnknownX> Yellow is my favorite color too
P2:51:10 <UnknownX> <3
P2:51:14 <AlexVMiner> how are their colors?
P2:51:19 <PuyoDead> I wish every irc client did this
P2:51:20 <AlexVMiner> mine is orange

P2:52:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> That I've used at least
P2:52:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I find it distracting in large channels though
P2:52:19 <PuyoDead> this is the only one I've seen have it
P2:53:04 <AlexVMiner> so, who wants to go on my grief server?
P2:53:40 <Isak> Hey, does anyone want to host a server?
P2:53:44 <Isak> I can't host it.
P2:53:45 <Isak> So.
P2:53:47 <UnknownX>     Registered users online: 15
P2:53:47 <UnknownX>     Guests online: 7
P2:53:50 <UnknownX> WTF

P2:54:10 <Isak> Just most of the day
P2:54:18 <AlexVMiner> well, i can't be trusted
P2:54:20 <AlexVMiner> :D
P2:54:24 <Isak> D:
P2:54:39 <Isak> It's the New Atluria - Roleplay server
P2:55:07 <Isak> The original owner got pissed at all the idiots.
P2:55:09 <Isak> And quite
P2:55:10 <Isak> quit
P2:55:14 <Isak> Then he gave it to me
P2:55:22 <Isak> It didn't work, so he gave it to another OP.
P2:55:35 <Isak> didn't work for him either. Endless cycle of broken server.
P2:55:47 <Darkebrz> Ive been told by Saer that he turned down mail2345s offer
P2:55:53 <Isak> What?
P2:55:55 <Isak> Why?
P2:55:56 <Darkebrz> So Id suggest seeing if he could host it
P2:55:59 <Darkebrz> I dont know
P2:56:13 <Darkebrz> He said that someone didn't want it hosted by "Non Atluria" people
P2:56:18 <Isak> Heh.
P2:56:22 <Isak> I don't care who the host is.
P2:56:34 <Darkebrz> mail2345: You there?
P2:56:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can hook you up with a cheap VPS if you want
P2:56:41 <Isak> I'd prefer someone who roleplays on the server occasionally, but that's not necessary.
P2:56:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> but ish not free

P3:50:11 <coolcosmos> Hi guys.
P3:50:16 <PuyoDead> hey, "report" is bright pink now
P3:50:53 <coolcosmos> I've got problems setting a minecraft server.
P3:50:55 <citricsquid> so nobody can claim to miss it! :D
P3:51:00 <PuyoDead> heh
P3:51:12 <coolcosmos> I've made one on my friend computer, but it won't work on mine.
P3:51:54 <LG_Legacy> My cache isn't cleared, so it's still black to me
P3:51:57 <UnknownX> Citricsquid: I missed it
P3:52:00 <citricsquid> ctrl + f5
P3:52:05 <Isak> What's up?
P3:52:07 <LG_Legacy> I said cache
P3:52:08 <PuyoDead> whoa, pink posts
P3:52:08 <UnknownX> i cant see pink
P3:52:16 <Isak> I see pink
P3:52:17 <UnknownX> Pink = Locked
P3:52:21 <LG_Legacy> Heh, heres a question. What if you're color blind?
P3:52:22 <coolcosmos> Is there a way to play minecraft in LAN?
P3:52:27 <LG_Legacy> Yes cosmos
P3:52:36 <PuyoDead> ahh, I see
P3:52:37 <Isak> Why would you be playing minecraft if you were colorblind?
P3:52:38 <coolcosmos> Like, http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=192.168.2.4&port=25565 ?
P3:52:42 <coolcosmos> How?
P3:52:42 <Isak> That game is all about sprites
P3:52:45 <LG_Legacy> Kind of
P3:52:52 <citricsquid> if you're colour blind you'd still be able to see it
P3:52:55 <LG_Legacy> Hold on let me find the topic
P3:53:02 <coolcosmos> Ok, thanks
P3:53:03 <vdgmprgrmr> The game's about building, not colors.
P3:53:19 <LG_Legacy> True that
P3:53:23 <LG_Legacy> Use your imagination
P3:53:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Color blindness does change the experience a bit, I'm sure, but it would still be fundamentally the same.
P3:53:57 <vdgmprgrmr> I've thought about making a grayscale tileset.
P3:54:07 <UnknownX> Isak: Oh no i cant see what color this water is! What if its blood!!
P3:54:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, I think I'm gonna do a grayscale tileset RIGHT NOW.
P3:54:43 <LG_Legacy> Ah sorry Cosmos

P4:14:07 <vdgmprgrmr> You can fill the sky with fire, turn all the blocks to hellish things, make the text nasty-looking, make the beginning screen (with the loading bars) have weird images all over it (because it uses a different image than normal dirt blocks), make the HUD look crazy, but not make the fog or any liquids be appropirately themed. :(

P6:46:56 <Quatroking> there were a few tiny bugs in 1.0

P6:51:02 <LG_Legacy> Notch has to be it
P6:51:03 <mooogle> notch is the little square one
P6:51:10 <Darkebrz> Only pussies wear helmets
P6:51:10 <Quatroking> don't you see that beard
P6:51:14 <Quatroking> it HAS to be notch
P6:51:21 <PuyoDead> I played WoW a few years ago
P6:51:26 <Quatroking> its not a helmet
P6:51:37 <Quatroking> its a half skull of a robot
P6:51:39 <PuyoDead> it was at least a bit more fast paced than more mmorpg
P6:51:41 <Quatroking> put on his head
P6:51:48 <Quatroking> you can see the cables hanging from it
P6:52:03 <mooogle> does anyone know wtf notch's icon is of?

P7:12:50 <Quatroking> . . .
P7:12:52 <PuyoDead> when you rar the entire thing
P7:13:11 <Quatroking> you can't download a file seperatly if you compress the entire discography
P7:13:14 <Quatroking> which is BADDD

P7:39:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
P7:39:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Your post made no sense at all
P7:39:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> As I'm sure anyone savvy in computers can tell you
P7:39:27 <LG_Legacy> I realize this
P7:39:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> I was merely making sure misinformation didn't get passed on
P7:39:34 <LG_Legacy> I was thrown off myself.
P7:39:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nothing personal, I would have done it to anyone
P7:40:00 <LG_Legacy> Not to keen on Static ip's, misinforming yourself does that to you.
P7:40:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also, I think you're 99% likely to be a troll, or to have trollish fits on both IRC and the forums
P7:40:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> But that had nothing to do with my reply there
P7:40:48 <LG_Legacy> Thats what i was wondering of.
P7:40:52 <LG_Legacy> The question is, Why?
P7:41:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> You defended griefers on two separate occasions when everybody else in the community clearly saw their behaviour as unnaceptable
P7:41:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exhibit one is Perogi, exhibit two, the idiot who was "tricked into griefing"
P7:42:30 <LG_Legacy> I may or may not realize the second exhibit, but never judge me by my actions.
P7:42:47 <LG_Legacy> Perogi, meh... I realize he is/was a troll.
P7:42:57 <LG_Legacy> I was trying to look for some good in him.
P7:43:03 <LKA> devil's advocate?
P7:43:05 <LG_Legacy> But hes got osmething up his sleeve.
P7:43:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> "never judge me by my actions."?
P7:43:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
P7:43:07 <LKA> wait shit i should be afk
P7:43:07 <LG_Legacy> So maybe i was wrong.
P7:43:18 <citricsquid> LKA BAN BAN BAN
P7:43:20 <LG_Legacy> You think i'm a troll based on what i've done?
P7:43:28 <Animator> I don't like people begging for ops.
P7:43:31 <Animator> It annoys me.
P7:43:34 <PuyoDead> I don't mean to take sides here, but what do you judge someone on?
P7:43:34 <LKA> NO CITRIC NO
P7:43:36 <LKA> ; A;
P7:43:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes, "never judge me by my actions" kind of seals it there
P7:43:38 <LG_Legacy> Animator, ignore em :P
P7:43:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> What am I supposed to judge you on?
P7:43:54 <LG_Legacy> On who i am?
P7:44:00 <Animator> I'd kick them if it wasn't for the fact they've done nothing wrong yet.
P7:44:01 <LG_Legacy> Meh
P7:44:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> And how the hell am I supposed to know that?
P7:44:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Your actions are what make you who you are
P7:44:16 <LG_Legacy> Judge me how you will, but i don't define people on what they do half of the time.
P7:44:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> "I only spent 1/2 my life murdering people."
P7:44:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> "But... the rest was spent cooking!"
P7:44:41 <LG_Legacy> Some actions are different.
P7:44:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> "Judge me based on that!"
P7:44:58 <LG_Legacy> Either way i don't think you see my visual, so i'm dropping it. Either way.
P7:44:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  It's the same conecpt
P7:45:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> i like debate nights
P7:45:14 <PuyoDead> they're frequrnt
P7:45:18 <PuyoDead> err, heh. frequent
P7:45:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're what keeps this channel alive
P7:45:25 <LG_Legacy> Both exhibits are faulty. I had a interesting look in peroggi, but i fear he's really got something coming up.
P7:45:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're like life support
P7:45:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> And I seem to be in the middle of most of them :/
P7:45:31 <PuyoDead> a lot of times, yea
P7:45:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> feeding tubes
P7:45:36 <LG_Legacy> The other, meh... just seemed like everyone was hard on him.
P7:46:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, griefers should be treated gently, with respect, after they destroy work
P7:46:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> right...
P7:46:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> indeed
P7:46:16 <PuyoDead> peroggi was an obivous troll from the very start
P7:46:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> And a griefer
P7:46:38 <LG_Legacy> *shrugs* I thought maybe he was actually turning, i was possibly wrong.
P7:46:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> And an idiot
P7:46:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nah, you're just naive apparently
P7:46:52 <LG_Legacy> Neh
P7:47:05 <PuyoDead> I'll give you credit for giving someone a chance
P7:47:12 <PuyoDead> but... that one was a wasted effort
P7:47:16 <LG_Legacy> So?
P7:47:22 <LG_Legacy> All efforts are worthwhile in my book
P7:47:34 <LG_Legacy> I help people even if i'm against em, or hate em. Except in some occassions.
P7:47:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha Mr. Good Samaritan are we?
P7:47:38 <PuyoDead> I could try to revive a dead guy, too
P7:47:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Once again, coming back to my point in being naive
P7:47:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think that's how you spell it?
P7:47:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> W/e
P7:47:55 <LG_Legacy> Nope
P7:47:57 <PuyoDead> haha
P7:48:00 <LG_Legacy> It's just how i work
P7:48:05 <PuyoDead> you just definied it, heh
P7:48:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> *sigh* let him troll elsewhere
P7:48:25 <LG_Legacy> Believe me if you may if i say i'm not
P7:48:30 <LG_Legacy> 'naive'
P7:48:33 <LG_Legacy> Thats your choice.
P7:48:50 <PuyoDead> I'm not convinced Legacy is a troll.
P7:48:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> do you know what the word means?
P7:48:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> By definition, people who are naive will never know they're naive
P7:49:12 <Animator> I've got an op cove working with observatory.
P7:49:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> i didn't know i was naive
P7:49:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> so i guess i'm naive but i can't be
P7:49:22 <PuyoDead> neat!
P7:49:25 <LG_Legacy> People who are naive are usually inexperienced with a particalur subject, or all toghether.
P7:49:30 <LG_Legacy> Or am i wrong?
P7:49:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> " Lacking worldly experience and understanding"
P7:49:48 <LG_Legacy> Meh, close enough for me.
P7:50:05 <PuyoDead> very closely related to ignorance
P7:50:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> 12-16 ballpark?
P7:50:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn core lag... I have to fix that soon
P7:50:34 <LG_Legacy> I still hate to see how you relate what i have done, to believe i am a troll.
P7:50:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's either that or very naive... I'm open to both
P7:51:39 <LG_Legacy> Both are expelled in my book, i been past naive, and i don't think i would be a troll. Trolls usually don't help out as much as possible, around the community all toghether.
P7:51:46 <LG_Legacy> Atleast i believe so.
P7:52:05 <LG_Legacy> Or..
P7:52:11 <LG_Legacy> Some might, and just screw up later on.

P7:53:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> My ~12-16 estimate
P7:53:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> was that in the ballpark?
P7:53:33 <LG_Legacy> Are you still getting on about peroggi even though i said i was probably wrong and aint helping him?

P7:53:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, that wasn't directed at you
P7:53:55 <PuyoDead> we're not on about peroggi

P7:54:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> maa
P7:54:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Was I in the ballpark or not?
P7:54:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> is it working out so far
P7:54:25 <LG_Legacy> Don't ask me mate.
P7:54:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup... i was so right.

P8:41:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.ubuntu-pics.de/bild/20507/screenshot_014_6Dt3x1.jpg Warning: Extremely NSFW... for Darkebrz :P
P8:41:50 <citricsquid> no need to post screenshots of it :|
P8:41:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> This is why a Captcha is good
P8:42:14 <citricsquid> I'm not even going to bother explaining
P8:42:25 <Animator> Ew. They have disney porn.
P8:42:25 <citricsquid> however many times I do everyone says "loll cpatcha solves everything lolol"
P8:42:30 <citricsquid> so yes, of course, captcha will solve it.
P8:42:31 <Animator> That's just disturbing.
P8:42:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> wait, disney whatnow?
P8:42:51 <Animator> I read the links. Don't ask hy.
P8:42:55 <Animator> *why
P8:43:20 <Animator> And... And American Dad porn.. e_o
P8:43:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: I'm curious as to the downsides of Captcha, besides of course a slight inconvenience for the users
P8:43:35 <citricsquid> these aren't bots.
P8:43:36 <mail2345> minecraft secret question seems win
P8:43:47 <citricsquid> yes, that is the only good idea.
P8:43:51 <Animator> Hey citric, here's an idea.
P8:43:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> How can you be sure?
P8:44:03 <Darkebrz> Oh god porn
P8:44:04 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: spam bots run from compromised servers, not home connections.
P8:44:11 <Animator> And captcha, and if it fails, rub it into the users that it failed.
P8:44:15 <Animator> *Add.
P8:44:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Home connections can easily be part of a botnet citricsquid
P8:44:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> And usually are
P8:44:41 <Animator> Period. I'd say that's the easiest wayof resolving this, Citric.
P8:45:08 <Animator> And if it works, well then, it worked. If it doesn't, you've show them why with a demonstration.
P8:45:18 <Animator> Either way, you win.
P8:45:32 <Jat> try implementing a captcha system like this one http://www.random-good-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/math.gif

P8:46:56 <LG_Legacy> Why not ask the person registering to enter a captcha, spell minecraft backwards, and solve a simple math question
P8:47:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> because minecraft backwards will always be the same answer, it can be hardcoded into the bot
P8:47:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> that is if it only attacks this forum, which is unlikely, but still...
P8:47:52 <Jat> theres also this one http://www.random-good-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/hotornot.jpg
P8:48:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P8:48:22 <LG_Legacy> Heh
P8:49:03 <citricsquid> I'll probably just go with "select the sponge block" and have a couple of blocks with tick boxes or something.
P8:49:40 <Animator> That works.
P8:49:47 <Jat> write a bot that the user has to converse with properly briefly as a captcha
P8:50:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why the captcha hate?  I'm very confused

P9:16:30 <Darkebrz> Awesome
P9:17:12 <Afayir> Anyone here who could host a server for me?
P9:17:45 <LG_Legacy> Say your preferences
P9:18:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> uhh what
P9:18:32 <Afayir> Just any old server where I could select the map and one that has backups and !votekick running.
P9:19:12 <LG_Legacy> Probably running all the time?
P9:19:47 <Afayir> Preferably. Not required, though.
P9:20:39 <Afayir> As long as it's up for 4hours+ a day, that's good.
P9:21:01 <LG_Legacy> Oh in that case sure.
P9:21:24 <LG_Legacy> If you need a certain .dat to upload, send it over msn or upload it. Or if you have a link. I would be happy to launch one.
P9:21:41 <LG_Legacy> Unless someone else wants to try?
P9:22:29 <Animator> Hey dudes.
P9:22:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> hey
P9:22:39 <Animator> We got a non-porn advertisement.

P9:40:21 <citricsquid> I think I'm going to make moderators and admins have different name colour on the forum, it's confusing with custom titles atm.
P9:40:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> or give them custom titles that are image tags

P9:41:06 <citricsquid> I might put a little + next to their name, or something.
P9:41:08 <PuyoDead> again, hate to keep referencing the same other community I'm on, but all levels of mods (news, IRC, staff, etc.) all have different colored nicks
