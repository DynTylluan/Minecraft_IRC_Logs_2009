A12:54:09 <Koitenshin> next you'll see Suezo.
A12:54:09 <mochi> but how do I open ports?
A12:54:32 <Koitenshin> You can only open ports if you have router access
A12:54:48 <mochi> does Airport Express counts as a router?
A12:55:21 <clone1018> How do i make the guest area smaller in JTE's custom server D:
A12:55:38 <mochi> I need to get a server running :(

A1:14:30 <mochi> :(
A1:14:57 <clone1018> Why do you need to mochi
A1:17:23 <mochi> because I want to host a server
A1:17:30 <mochi> for a community
A1:17:54 <mochi> so how do I host a server? Do I DDoS 127.0.0.1 or something?
A1:17:55 <Koitenshin> Fuck the Spartans, Elite FTW
A1:18:17 <Koitenshin> here's a tip. NEVER listen to TestDummy

12A1:18:50 * Loy (durp@97.125.41.38) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A1:19:00 <mochi> so how do I brute force the hotel router's password?
A1:19:20 <VurtualRuler98> wat
A1:19:23 <VurtualRuler98> What am I missing?
A1:19:28 <VurtualRuler98> Wait, IRL?
A1:19:30 <VurtualRuler98> Why would you?
A1:19:59 <VurtualRuler98> And why're you at a hotel?
A1:20:43 <VurtualRuler98> Also, pretty sure it's illegal to do that whole illegally forcing your way into a router and changing settings thing. Crazy, right?
A1:20:47 <VurtualRuler98> Reeal easy to get caught.
A1:21:13 <TestDummy> I still think you should DDoS 127.0.0.1
A1:21:22 <TestDummy> Attacking it successfully will make your Internet work better.
A1:22:38 <mail2345|smacx> whee
A1:22:50 <clone1018> lol
A1:22:51 <mail2345|smacx> i have now comprimised the spartan air force
A1:22:53 <clone1018> So true
A1:23:03 <mail2345|smacx> also uhh mochi
A1:23:04 <clone1018> Dont tell him any more secrets of the internet TestDummy
A1:23:05 <mail2345|smacx> better idea
A1:23:07 <mail2345|smacx> setup a VPN
A1:23:11 <mail2345|smacx> to your home netwokr
A1:23:14 <mail2345|smacx> foward ports
A1:23:25 <mail2345|smacx> pat yourself on the back for a job well done
A1:23:27 <mail2345|smacx> sure it's laggier
A1:23:36 <mail2345|smacx> but you don't end up being kicked out
A1:24:02 <mochi> no I can't access my home network

A1:24:48 <mail2345|smacx> it's called VPN
A1:24:52 <TestDummy> Then perhaps you should do it when you get home back to your own network.
A1:24:57 <mail2345|smacx> oh rrightt
13A1:24:59 * TestDummy figured this out out about ten minutes ago.
A1:25:04 <mail2345|smacx> he might have not setup a connection already
13A1:25:15 * mail2345|smacx has a nice VPN setup

A1:25:33 <mail2345|smacx> but if it does work, it should be awesome

A1:27:08 <mail2345|smacx> the usual router ip to hack is 127.156.83.14
A1:27:49 <TestDummy> I concur. 127.214.48.26 also gets the job done nicely.
A1:28:45 <mail2345|smacx> gah damm spartan foresight

A1:29:52 <mochi> so nobody can host a server for me
A1:30:04 <mail2345|smacx> but it's guarded by the free drones

A1:48:49 <Siiseli> why is someone called mudder whining to me in pms?
A1:48:53 <Siiseli> have I banned someone?
A1:49:31 <TestDummy> Siiseli: It's Boirg/Santa/Whatever

A1:49:58 <TestDummy> It's partially my fault.
A1:50:47 <Siiseli> oh boirg
A1:51:05 <Siiseli> well I wanna keep him banned
A1:51:07 <Siiseli> he's a dick
A1:51:56 <mail2345|smacx> there was alot of miscommunication involved
A1:52:27 <TestDummy> To reiterate.
A1:52:37 <TestDummy> Somebody back in November set a half-assed ban against him.
A1:53:03 <TestDummy> He managed to get back in, so using my magicial powers, broke protocol to fix the ban and mute him until he gave up and went away.
A1:53:25 <TestDummy> At the time, and today Puyo affirmed that I wasn't wrong in my actions, even if I broke an oper rule. :|
A1:54:31 <TestDummy> But yeah, he came back into #dragonweyr and started harassing me via PM about a ban set against him. Never memorized his mask and "Mudder" rang no bells.

A1:54:43 <clone1018> Sorry
A1:54:55 <TestDummy> So I told him he was being obnoxious, and immature for contacting me and talking to me the way he was.
A1:54:58 <TestDummy> So I ignored him.
A1:55:03 <clone1018> That first line would be the one that controls the guest area right?

A5:32:07 <C418> black screen of death?
A5:32:09 <Spadge> lol...
A5:32:11 <C418> I have a solution for that
A5:32:14 <Spadge> i havnt had it
A5:32:15 <C418> deactivate windows aero
A5:33:29 <C418> I had that quite often in combination with ableton live. live doesn't like aero. sometimes it locks up aero, ending in a black screen of death. I noticed that I still had control about windows. just a bit control. so I tried closing live and windows was back. Then I just deactivated aero and never had this error until now...
A5:33:39 <C418> I think you have to change the theme to windows basic or something

A8:42:21 <TestDummy> Holidays, even.
A8:43:08 <TestDummy> Trying to weasel your way out of school early under the disguise of some obscure winter holiday nobody knows about?
A8:45:02 <TestDummy> "If a holiday falls on a Saturday it is celebrated the preceding Friday; if a holiday falls on a Sunday it is celebrated the following Monday. Most, but not all, states and most private businesses also observe a Sunday holiday on the following Monday. It is less common, however, for a state or private business to observe a Saturday holiday on the preceding Friday. Some states and private businesses may observe it then, a few m
A8:45:02 <TestDummy> ay observe it on Monday, and some may not observe the holiday at all in those years. In particular, banks that close on Saturdays do not observe a holiday when it falls on Saturday."
A8:45:14 <TestDummy> So yeah.
A8:45:46 <TestDummy> I suppose you have Good Friday, but that was back in April.

A8:50:24 <MonkeyDKS> Same idea :)
A8:50:24 <TestDummy> But you're actually employed.
A8:50:34 <TestDummy> Why not take sick leave and/or vacation.
A8:50:38 <TestDummy> It's only one day.
A8:51:24 <MonkeyDKS> I have two floating holdays left and they don't carry over to next year
A8:51:36 <MonkeyDKS> I'm trying to invent holidays to fit them now :)
A8:51:43 <MonkeyDKS> I already have Christmas and New Years
A8:52:42 <TestDummy> But yeah, I kinda ran out. It's not really the right time of the week to have any holidays on, apparently.

P2:41:19 <doohan> Quatroking, java keylogger?
P2:41:26 <Quatroking> why not
P2:41:34 <doohan> If it came with a load of native libs then that'd be plausible
P2:41:43 <doohan> But without, java just doesn't work that way.
P2:42:17 <doohan> I mean, all it can log is what goes into the jvm. Which, in the case of minecraft, isn't a lot.

P6:54:47 <wolfx> Andrew I realize that now

P6:54:58 <AndrewPH> Kratospie, It's a nice concept but it's not really possible.
P6:55:02 <Sean_TE> what dose that mean? BIOS recovery source not present.
P6:55:03 <PuyoDead> Krat, that isn't a very cost effective idea.
P6:55:05 <Conundrumer> th client is not functioning
P6:55:11 <Conundrumer> just needed confirmatin

P6:55:50 <EB|BLR> data transfer rate
P6:55:58 <Kratospie> It honestly seems like it could work to me, 
P6:56:01 <AndrewPH> WOM might be sending DENY to your clients. I'd need somebody with a nulled client to test it, though.
P6:56:10 <Kratospie> or at least make some way to boost graphics for laptops
P6:56:12 <AndrewPH> Kratospie, Because the internal GPU is what matters.
P6:56:29 <Conundrumer> i don't see why I would be a target for denial
P6:56:33 <AndrewPH> Kratospie, You should look at how a graphics card functions. It might help you.
P6:56:41 <AndrewPH> Conundrumer, actually it would affect a large amount of people.

P6:57:14 <EB|BLR> not really
P6:57:43 <Kratospie> People always figured out ways, cant something be connected to the mother board?
P6:57:49 <EB|BLR> you can increase RAM easy, but adding another processer outside? not really
P6:58:08 <Kratospie> cus I know one of my USB ports (the one that was defective) is directly connected
P6:58:13 <EB|BLR> it would require the laptop to made for the expansion
P6:58:14 <Kratospie> thats why it cant be replaced
P6:58:17 <AndrewPH> USB2.0 isn't very fast, USB3.0 isn't exactly cheap, and you COULD theoretically have an external graphics card, but it would be slow and expensive.
P6:58:21 <EB|BLR> USB is too slow
P6:58:35 <Kratospie> not throug USB

P6:59:00 <EB|BLR> and the motherboard and OS would need to know about it
P6:59:07 <EB|BLR> cuz that's be expensive
P6:59:13 <EB|BLR> and heavy
P6:59:24 <AndrewPH> Kratospie, just build a desktop and upgrade it when you need to, and use your laptop for smaller things.

P10:04:08 <vede> There's a strange effect with memes. They start out funny for a small group of people, who know about them, then they become overused, and they're not funny anymore.

P10:16:43 <mail2345|smacx> all i have to do if the fbi catches me

P10:16:51 <mail2345|smacx> and throw it in
P10:16:55 <sf17k> to mt doom
P10:17:11 <EmpiresBane> if they catch you, i don't think you'll be hiking any time soon
P10:17:19 <sf17k> a prison hike
P10:17:37 <EmpiresBane> with volcanoes inside the prison!
P10:17:55 <sf17k> right, hence "prison"

P10:18:04 <EmpiresBane> what?
P10:18:07 <mail2345|smacx> they send a letter first
P10:18:09 <sf17k> prisons have volcanos by definition
P10:18:13 <sf17k> otherwise its just a jail
P10:18:37 <EmpiresBane> they didn't send me one
P10:18:40 <Kratospie> But what about SUPERJAIL?
P10:18:57 <sf17k> my friend made me download the first episode of that and I still haven't watched it
P10:19:08 <sf17k> look at me I ignore culture
P10:19:09 <Kratospie> Its a jail on a volcano
P10:19:20 <Kratospie> Its actualy pretty bad

P10:27:04 <Conundrumer> there are times when griefing is justified
P10:27:09 <mail2345|smacx> when?
P10:27:22 <Conundrumer> well, according to the logic of some people
P10:27:44 <Kratospie> The only person on any server
P10:27:45 <Conundrumer> i built a bridge over a box of admincrete
P10:27:54 <Conundrumer> turned out to be the foundation of a massive tower
P10:27:56 <Kratospie> who should delete someone elses work
P10:28:02 <mail2345|smacx> ohh
P10:28:07 <Conundrumer> which was built after part of the bridge was removed
P10:28:08 <mail2345|smacx> building conflicts arn't griefing
P10:28:17 <Kratospie> should be the server admin, and he should have a reson
P10:28:18 <mail2345|smacx> i mean malicious griefing
P10:28:22 <Conundrumer> true, but i dind't get the chance to talk about it
P10:29:07 <Kratospie> was it an OP or server admin?
P10:29:15 <Conundrumer> the op who was building the tower didn't let me make other suggestiosn
P10:29:24 <Kratospie> hm..
P10:29:29 <Kratospie> He should have
P10:29:30 <Conundrumer> like making the bridge go through the tower, making the tower somewhere else
P10:29:56 <Conundrumer> i made a thread on the forums about how disparaging they are towards me
P10:30:20 <Conundrumer> well, were, but probably will still be
P10:30:26 <Kratospie> I hate when people think theres a "good reason" to grief
P10:30:53 <EmpiresBane> I hate it when people complain!
P10:31:03 <Kratospie> :l
P10:31:09 <Conundrumer> even complaining about getting griefed by some random guy?
P10:31:13 <mail2345|smacx> this wasn't technically griefing
P10:31:14 <fenixfurion> Griefing = never
P10:31:23 <mail2345|smacx> this was a combonation of missomcunication
P10:31:25 <Kratospie> I just noticed an oxymoron

P10:31:28 <mail2345|smacx> cockyness

P10:32:51 <fenixfurion> hm
P10:32:57 <mail2345|smacx> this is what i think of piracy
P10:33:01 <fenixfurion> o.o
P10:33:03 <mail2345|smacx> piracy is wrong, but it is not theft
P10:33:10 <EmpiresBane> actually, how about i put mine up for you Con
P10:33:16 <Conundrumer> it's okay
P10:33:27 <EmpiresBane> i need to get it up more often
P10:33:27 <Kratospie> According to law, piracy is theft
P10:33:28 <Conundrumer> wait, what map?
P10:33:34 <EmpiresBane> hm?
P10:33:35 <Kratospie> but it hard to catch anyone
P10:33:42 <Conundrumer> what kind of map does your server have?
P10:33:52 <mail2345|smacx> piracy is not theft as it does not direct deprive a person of an object

P10:35:32 <Jat> not if you werent going to buy it in the first place
P10:35:42 <EmpiresBane> good point
P10:35:47 <Kratospie> but by taking it, you still deprive them of the sale
P10:35:52 <Jat> no
P10:36:07 <EmpiresBane> i never thought of it that way Jat
P10:36:15 <Jat> if you werent a potential sale to begin with then youre not depriving them of the sale
P10:36:27 <Conundrumer> i could get a friend to put up a server
P10:36:32 <Conundrumer> but there will be no reliable op-ing

P10:37:52 <tentacos> you're an arrogant dick, you sat in the server saying your bridge was the best and told everyone else that they weren't creative and were making everything incorrectly

P10:39:01 <Conundrumer> I mentioned creativity because of how I wanted a compromise
P10:39:06 <Conundrumer> that was for a few minutes
P10:39:10 <AndrewPH> tentacos shut up.
P10:39:14 <tentacos> also, that your bridge was the best thing on the server

P10:43:26 <Jat> wat?...
P10:43:30 <EmpiresBane> depends on the OS i believe
P10:43:39 <Conundrumer> tentacos you can post the log in the thread I made on the forums
P10:43:44 <Kratospie> I'll check it
P10:43:47 <Jat> i dont think you can fit more than one ram on most desktops

P10:44:13 <Kratospie> whoa
P10:44:16 <Conundrumer> joining
P10:44:18 <AndrewPH> It depends on the motherboard how many ram sticks your computer's able to hold.
P10:44:24 <Kratospie> Ulitmate has a max of 192 GB O_O
P10:44:25 <AndrewPH> The max amount of RAM is...
P10:44:26 <AndrewPH> Not sure.
P10:44:39 <Jat> does it really matter?
P10:44:45 <AndrewPH> theoretically it's like 600 TB
P10:44:46 <Jat> are you really planning on putting in that much?
P10:44:50 <Kratospie> Not at all
P10:45:03 <Kratospie> I thought it was like, 16 GB
P10:45:09 <Conundrumer> nope, can't connect
P10:45:15 <Kratospie> Of course, starter and basic have 8GB max
P10:45:27 <EmpiresBane> just a sec
P10:45:32 <EmpiresBane> i know the problem
P10:45:41 <EmpiresBane> but i gotta do the dishes real quick
P10:45:43 <AndrewPH> Windows is the one operating system line that holds back on how much ram it can use
P10:45:44 <Kratospie> then Home Premium has 16, then the other 3 go up to 192
P10:45:46 <AndrewPH> 64-bit wise
P10:45:47 <EmpiresBane> like 5 minutes
P10:46:04 <mail2345|afk> umm
P10:46:06 <mail2345|afk> actually

P10:46:33 <mail2345|afk> 16 EiB
P10:46:35 <mail2345|afk> for 64 bit

P10:46:42 <mail2345|afk> it's just that operating systems are retarded
P10:46:44 <mail2345|afk> and cap it
