A12:37:53 <Evil-Ville> Siiseli good you've finally started to notice that long hair is terrible

A12:37:59 <Siiseli> Evil-Ville, it's noot

A12:39:53 <LG_Legacy> Yeah
A12:39:55 <mail2345|semi-afk> it's called rp going insane
A12:39:56 <Siiseli> k
A12:40:34 <mail2345|semi-afk> sure, killing players of the same type gets you less xp, but being at the max level, I could hardly care less
A12:40:55 <mail2345|semi-afk> i also accuse both the people i killed of being pkers, just for kicks
A12:40:59 <Siiseli> maxing out in any mmorpg is a bad sign
A12:41:07 <Siiseli> stop playing
A12:41:08 <Siiseli> go outside
A12:41:10 <Siiseli> dance
A12:41:12 <mail2345|semi-afk> actually
A12:41:37 <mail2345|semi-afk> i have been playing my account for a few years, btw the game only gives you 50 AP per day
A12:41:47 <mail2345|semi-afk> on and off
A12:41:50 <Siiseli> that doesn't say a hwole lot
A12:42:05 <mail2345|semi-afk> 50AP is about 15 mins of action
A12:42:15 <Siiseli> and what's this ap
A12:42:16 <Evil-Ville> Oh it's one of those browser games
A12:42:30 <mail2345|semi-afk> action point
A12:42:48 <Siiseli> oh 
A12:47:37 <mail2345|semi-afk> i feel alot like studying the mc protocol with my spare time
A12:47:54 <mail2345|semi-afk> or improving my custom server script
A12:48:00 <mail2345|semi-afk> modification
A12:48:04 <mail2345|semi-afk> of cMss
A12:48:11 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm.
A12:48:20 <Siiseli> mmkay
A12:48:24 <Siiseli> what can you lose
A12:48:36 <Siiseli> (that's just another way of saying doo eeet)
A12:49:21 <mail2345|semi-afk> what is a good packet sniffer, btw?
10A12:51:20 * triddin (triddin@203.185.208.74) has joined #minecraft
A12:51:51 <mail2345|semi-afk> triddin, seeing as you coded up a custom server, what is a good packet sniffer for finding the protocol?
A12:53:59 <triddin> look, there's a thousand. i actually wrote most of mine by connecting the client to my own listener and then coding a custom client to connect to the server
A12:54:37 <triddin> watching the commands as they come in on the client to my listening server and trying to work out what it was saying/asking
A12:55:02 <Colain> Notch, I summon thee to chat.
A12:55:28 <triddin> then using my custom client that was connecting to my server to send commands to my server
A12:56:21 <triddin> the very first thing i wrote was a client that walked around, talked and could build structures algorithmically
A12:56:32 <triddin> (a bot by any other name)
A12:58:11 <triddin> then with the knowledge of the elegance of the protocol, i began to see how a server could be quite quickly written to handle griefers
12A12:59:07 * C418 (C418@p5B3D5E9D.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
A12:59:12 <mail2345|semi-afk> maybe you should consider having guest prenium users having more rights than regular users on your server :P
A12:59:22 <mail2345|semi-afk> though your method is interesting
A12:59:42 <mail2345|semi-afk> from what I can tell from JTE/aera, they seemed to have used a packet sniffer
A1:00:05 <Colain> What about JTE?
A1:00:17 <triddin> it has been though of... i'm just a little worried how notch would feel about me hitting up his server to find out about premium users
A1:00:48 <triddin> see, the thing is.. at the start, i didn't want to find out how to write a server
A1:01:05 <triddin> i was only interested in how to authenticate and how to place blocks
A1:01:33 <triddin> then i found out the server would kick me if i placed a block too far from my current position
A1:01:41 <triddin> so i had to work out how to move
12A1:02:05 * Evil-Ville (hurfdurf@cs78249077.pp.htv.fi) Quit (Quit: yare yare daze)
A1:02:05 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm, I wonder why that's there at all
A1:02:11 <triddin> it was an iterative discovery process
A1:02:21 <mail2345|semi-afk> the distance cheat protection
A1:02:34 <triddin> i didn't want to know how the whole lot worked right at the start
A1:03:08 <Darkebrz> So when someone says we need cheat protection Notch says: "There is :D"
A1:03:32 <triddin> as it got more complicated, i eventually worked out more, like the mapdata format, and the mapsize commands, absolute moves, relative moves, facing moves, etc
A1:04:40 <Daidoji> you guys have spent more time disassembling minecraft than notch has spent coding it
A1:04:47 <Daidoji> just putting that out there.
A1:05:06 <mail2345|semi-afk> how is that bad :P
A1:05:28 <Daidoji> I don't recall saying it was.
A1:05:29 <LG_Legacy> >_>
A1:05:33 <LG_Legacy> Stole my words
A1:05:37 <Daidoji> just stating a fact there.
A1:05:47 <vede> Minecraft rule: Every server should have a boat, preferably in an awkward place for a boat to be.
A1:05:59 <LG_Legacy> Vede..
A1:06:02 <LG_Legacy> You gave me a idea
A1:06:06 <LG_Legacy> a photo idea
A1:06:07 <Daidoji> on my and my friends map I put mine on the edge of the map
A1:06:14 <Daidoji> and then made a dock, and then a pirate town and then..
A1:06:20 <Daidoji> just sort of snowballed from there
A1:06:23 <vede> Full-on pirate map?
A1:06:42 <Daidoji> pirate/skypirate/rainbow fortress

A1:09:43 <vede> The boat doesn't need to be in a VERY awkward place, but putting the boat in a horizontal position in any naturally occurring body of water is LAME.
A1:09:57 <LG_Legacy> Horizontal boat FTW
13A1:10:06 * LG_Legacy goes to sleep
10A1:11:11 * TheOne is now known as TheOne-afk
A1:11:58 <vede> I've made underground desert boat, jutting-out-from-cliff boat, vertical-standing-on-tip boat, and now I'm making random underground lake boat.
A1:13:45 <Daidoji> I made a full scale el castillo pyramid
A1:13:52 <Daidoji> not that much effort but it turned out nice
A1:14:20 <Daidoji> the hard part was getting the stair angle right, had to do like a 1,1,2 pattern on the steps
A1:14:39 <Daidoji> I mean 1 block, 1 block, then a 2 block wide section. repeated

A4:22:20 <Visiiri> Ohey Notchy.
A4:22:26 <iPope> We all know notch loves me most cause I asked him not to release uodates when I was on holiday and he didn't so ha

A4:23:00 <Visiiri> hahahaha
A4:23:02 <Colain> YAY RED BULL BREAKFAST!
A4:23:03 <UnknownX> I laugh at the "Read Forums"
A4:23:04 <Visiiri> I haven't eaten...
A4:23:11 <Visiiri> Then again, it's 3:23 AM here.
A4:23:23 <iPope> Notch is a mod on some java game forum thing
A4:23:29 <iPope> He posted minecraft there
A4:23:32 <Visiiri> D:
13A4:23:38 * Visiiri slaps iPope around a bit with a large trout
A4:23:41 <Colain> I'm glad I didn't have that beer. Drunk + 14 year old + filming + notch= "No, you boobies russia!"
A4:23:44 <08Notch> and now eclipse has started up and I'm going to finish off the block toughness feature and get started on the animals
A4:23:54 <Visiiri> :D
A4:23:56 <08Notch> I'll probably scrap the little work I did on it last night, as it sucked. ;)
A4:23:57 <iPope> Block toughness? Wait i got it
A4:24:01 <Visiiri> Do sheep for me.
A4:24:11 <UnknownX> IPope for mining
A4:24:12 <Visiiri> I want to make a mountain map RPG
A4:24:17 <Colain> May I take a behind look and film Notch...?
13A4:24:19 * iPope Graps Visiiri's fish and rams it down his throat
A4:24:22 <08Notch> and instead going for a better oo approach with bipeds, quadrapeds and.. er.. stuff. :D
A4:24:26 <Visiiri> And I wat to bring sheep up the mountain to graze...
A4:24:36 <UnknownX> Its not like you can break a solid gold block in one hit with your bare hands
A4:24:44 <Visiiri> I can.
A4:24:49 <Visiiri> Can't you?
A4:24:55 <08Notch> the solution I'm trying first is like the cool down in other mmorpgs
A4:25:00 <Colain> I think Notch ain't talking to me.
A4:25:00 <iPope> Notch you know in DF you have biomes, I thought that would be awesome in survival
A4:25:14 <peerkoel> OHHAINOTCH:)
A4:25:14 <08Notch> so you can do stuff immediately, but if you broke rock, you have to wait 0.8 seconds (or something) until you can click again
A4:25:14 <iPope> Like terrifying parts which are all stone and lava and crazy monsters
A4:25:31 <08Notch> HAI PEER
A4:25:53 <Colain> HELLING TIME.
A4:25:58 <Colain> *YELLING
A4:26:02 <08Notch> I've considered having people click a lot to break a tile, but that gets very very annoying
A4:26:03 <UnknownX> PEER STOLE MY GREETING
A4:26:04 <Colain> NOTCH, YOU NOTICE ME NOW?
A4:26:19 <iPope> Notch: and that way you just have autoclicker
A4:26:26 <08Notch> then there's the "hold down the mouse for 0.8 seconds to break stone"
A4:26:35 <Visiiri> No.
A4:26:38 <UnknownX> Hold down
A4:26:39 <Visiiri> Have cracks.
A4:26:48 <Visiiri> Click alot.
A4:26:48 <08Notch> but that doesn't have as much immediate feedback as the cooldown does
A4:27:29 <UnknownX> Or just make it like the other games and have it freeze you when you click the block for about .5 seconds and have a little bar at the bottom
A4:27:31 <08Notch> won't it get irritating to click a lot?
A4:27:38 <iPope> If you have immidiate then cooldown you can delete a block, say to a cave, if you dont like the cave you havent wasted your time and can walk off while your mining cools down
A4:27:53 <Visiiri> Yeah, but still let it have cracks. Holding it down and watching it crack would be awesome, I guess.
A4:27:57 <Colain> My friend can dig to the bottom of the map in like 10 seconds with just clcking.
A4:27:59 <08Notch> yes it would. :D
A4:28:05 <Super-Dot> Holding down the mouse as debris sprays would probably be very fun
A4:28:11 <08Notch> ahhh!!
A4:28:14 <08Notch> that's a very good idea
A4:28:14 <Super-Dot> Like drilling
A4:28:22 <Super-Dot> :D
A4:28:26 <08Notch> visible cracking and debris = immediate feedback

A4:28:56 <Visiiri> But notch, before you do this, you should have tools that CAN break everything in one touch.
A4:29:03 <george> oh notch is here
A4:29:05 <george> hi notch
A4:29:09 <Visiiri> Otherwise, you're just going to hold the mouse button to play.

A4:29:37 <Visiiri> D: We have no ironm, but we have iron ore.
A4:29:44 <iPope> Super: its easier to say pic
A4:29:45 <Visiiri> We have no copper, but we have copper ore.
A4:29:49 <UnknownX> It could be like...
A4:29:50 <Super-Dot> *pick
A4:29:55 <08Notch> how about click -> starts timer for 0.8 seconds (or whatever)
A4:29:56 <Super-Dot> Wait
A4:30:03 <08Notch> and if you click AGAIN while the timer is going, you speed it up slightly
A4:30:14 <08Notch> that way you CAN click for extra speed, but you can also just keep the mouse pressed
A4:30:14 <Colain> Notch, me, genius. I highly disagree.
A4:30:16 <iPope> While the timer is going crask should appear and debris should fly
A4:30:17 <UnknownX> Bronze, Silver, Iron, Gold, Platinum, Mithril?
A4:30:25 <08Notch> sure, people can use autoclickers
A4:30:30 <Colain> I think notch /ignored me :o

A4:39:58 <iPope> george
A4:39:58 <george> So the glasses have to be added on to a skin
A4:39:59 <Super-Dot> OOOOooOOOOOOhhhh

A4:40:06 <george> You can't mix-match the glasses with skins

A4:40:43 <george> And I take it armor is another pay-only skin
A4:40:54 <Super-Dot> Armor is different from glasses, strangely
A4:40:56 <UnknownX> Google suck at locating me
A4:41:03 <Super-Dot> Since glasses are user-definable
A4:41:04 <george> I'm buying minecraft this afternoon
A4:41:08 <Super-Dot> And armor is premade
A4:41:13 <george> Soon as my girlfriend arrives, with my credit card
A4:41:16 <george> which she took
A4:41:18 <george> to france
A4:41:19 <george> for a week
A4:41:21 <Super-Dot> Another purchase :D
A4:41:23 <iPope> Notch: have you considered a biome like system for survival

A4:41:27 <iPope> Similiar to DF
A4:41:33 <08Notch> yes, I have. =)

A4:41:43 <george> Who wants to spleef on venn's server
A4:41:58 <iPope> I think it would add another level to game play, gives the challenge to those who want it

A4:43:12 <Super-Dot> Deciding what to put on the second head-skin-layer will be tricky for custom skins
A4:43:22 <george> Notch, are there going to be any other addons apart from zombie mode
A4:43:31 <Super-Dot> I'm not sure whether Mario's mustache, nose, hat, or all three should pop out
A4:43:37 <iPope> Does googlemaps output heightmaps?
A4:43:39 <george> his dick should pop out
A4:43:40 <Super-Dot> Or none of them since it's supposed to be a flat sprite
A4:43:49 <08Notch> yes, george 
A4:43:59 <iPope> I wonder if you could mashup googlemaps and omen to create automatticly created landscapes from googlemaps
A4:44:05 <UnknownX> I can see that addon
A4:44:06 <Super-Dot> Dick popping out is impossible, unfortunately
A4:44:16 <Super-Dot> Unless Notch implements it
A4:44:17 <george> Why?
A4:44:20 <george> Just get a pink stick
A4:44:25 <Super-Dot> Because you can only customize the head
A4:44:38 <UnknownX> Well thats not fun

A4:45:35 <UnknownX> Super The cape does
A4:45:36 <iPope> Then you have to pay notch Â£200
A4:45:37 <Super-Dot> But cape would be better popping out, yeah
A4:45:53 <UnknownX> Notch even has a cape

A5:19:48 <venn177> or lack thereof
A5:19:59 <citricsquid> oh gosh, is that bad? :(
A5:20:02 <reviewmad> I have no idea what anyone here is talking about anymore
A5:20:03 <Super-Dot> We are all constantly talking about the forums
A5:20:07 <venn177> well we were all talking about missing the skins
A5:20:12 <Super-Dot> As such it is not much of a coincidence
A5:20:14 <venn177> site, and so yeah
A5:20:16 <venn177> :<

A5:20:28 <reviewmad> venn are you on your server i'm not sure
A5:20:30 <iPope> Why dont you just cut citric a break and leave it, all this IRC is filled with is either talking to ntoch or bitching to citric about the forums

A5:20:49 <venn177> iPope: Not true. If it was we'd have much less angry Notch
A5:20:54 <reviewmad> Have you got the map saved, with the castle wars
A5:20:57 <reviewmad> If so, can you upload it for me
A5:21:08 <iPope> venn177: Well occasionly we don't but look where that got us
A5:21:45 <reviewmad> Venn, do you have the castle war map saved
A5:21:46 <reviewmad> If so upload it
A5:21:53 <Tich> Each time I log into my photobucket now I see what is left of my castle of space invaders
A5:22:03 <Super-Dot> Huh, that would be a really easy skin to make
A5:22:17 <Tich> But I still suck and have no patience
A5:22:23 <reviewmad> Damnit my girlfriend wants to get back
A5:22:30 <postlogic> Get back?
A5:22:34 <reviewmad> both A. she has my credit card and B. i miss her
A5:22:34 <Super-Dot> Ah, patience could be a problem

A5:22:38 <reviewmad> yeah she's flying back from france
A5:22:42 <reviewmad> You know
A5:22:46 <reviewmad> The one with lava and water
A5:22:49 <postlogic> What's the problem, then?
A5:22:52 <venn177> no
A5:22:53 <reviewmad> And marigi built the keep
A5:22:55 <venn177> I formatted two weeks ago
A5:22:57 <venn177> lost everything
A5:22:59 <reviewmad> And the castle wal-
A5:23:01 <reviewmad> Oh you ffffff
A5:23:01 <venn177> also marigi was etaioz
A5:23:04 <Tich> Oh and having the template from the forums would help

A5:23:18 <venn177> yep
A5:23:19 <reviewmad> Brb, deleting my server folder
A5:23:27 <venn177> haha
A5:23:33 <reviewmad> Why does etaioz always make alts
A5:23:35 <venn177> he was also deepneau
A5:23:39 <venn177> deepnea
A5:23:39 <reviewmad> i know

A5:23:45 <venn177> Razor or whatever
A5:23:45 <reviewmad> He was also zheelt on my server
A5:23:46 <postlogic> reviewmad: Isn't it obvious? Griefing.
A5:23:52 <Super-Dot> I made one of the forum templates 
A5:23:52 <reviewmad> He made my epic pepsi
A5:23:54 <venn177> postlogic: this guy changes his IP and everything
A5:23:54 <reviewmad> Then he griefed it
A5:24:00 <postlogic> That's sad.
A5:24:01 <venn177> he started by getting OP on my server after a week and IP banning everyone
A5:24:17 <venn177> he also has at least 8 IM accounts, 4 steam accounts, and 5 forum accounts
A5:24:18 <reviewmad> Venn, the problem with some of your ops
A5:24:23 <reviewmad> Is that they constantly op others
A5:24:24 <Tich> only trust premium members :(
A5:24:28 <reviewmad> God tells me he was an op
A5:24:28 <Super-Dot> Tich: http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/1787/referencemob.png

A5:24:31 <Tich> there is only a thousand of us

A5:27:24 <reviewmad> is there a way to make irc have a chat beep
A5:27:27 <Underd0g> Hey all
A5:27:29 <Tich> there are like a whole bunch
A5:27:35 <postlogic> Notch: Just wondering... Will there be smaller building blocks in MC? Like, the normal one split in 8
A5:27:49 <venn177> postlogic: I think splitting it in half would be more than enough
A5:27:54 <Super-Dot> He said the other day that there won't
A5:27:56 <08Notch> no, postlogic. But there might be different block shapes
A5:27:59 <Tich> half is that
A5:27:59 <reviewmad> I don't think minecraft should have any other sizes of block
A5:28:00 <Underd0g> I agree with venn177
A5:28:06 <postlogic> venn177: Splitting in half from all sides == 8 ;)
A5:28:11 <postlogic> 1 subdivision
A5:28:12 <postlogic> Notch: Ah, ok.
A5:28:14 <reviewmad> Maybe a few shapes could be cool
A5:28:22 <reviewmad> I demand lava sponges
A5:28:23 <venn177> pyramids would be trippy
A5:28:23 <reviewmad> :D
A5:28:26 <Tich> You know what we need
A5:28:27 <venn177> pyramids made of pyramids
A5:28:29 <Tich> colored stone
A5:28:31 <venn177> oh god what have I done
A5:28:34 <reviewmad> Notch
A5:28:36 <postlogic> Imagine building a house made of the Blender monkey (Suzanne)
A5:28:38 <reviewmad> Will we ever get a lava sponge

A5:28:52 <08Notch> no lava sponge is planned
A5:28:56 <reviewmad> Aww
A5:29:00 <reviewmad> But what if someone floods us with lava
A5:29:03 <reviewmad> Like yesterday
A5:29:07 <venn177> do it old school
A5:29:08 <Tich> maybe an admin only thing?
A5:29:09 <venn177> like we used to have to
A5:29:17 <reviewmad> I don't like glass
A5:29:25 <reviewmad> A lava sponge is highly reccomended
A5:29:31 <08Notch> if you've build your level below lava, you've built it wrong. ;)
A5:29:39 <reviewmad> No I mean
A5:29:41 <08Notch> i'm joking, but not really
A5:29:42 <reviewmad> They went to a huge length
A5:29:43 <venn177> NOTcH HAS SPOKEN
A5:29:44 <reviewmad> Just to flood us
A5:29:45 <venn177> DO NOT QUESTION
A5:29:49 <reviewmad> NOT YET HE HASN'T
A5:29:51 <venn177> reviewmad
A5:29:52 <postlogic> Caps.
A5:29:56 <reviewmad> Caps, sorry
A5:29:57 <venn177> it means we failed at spawnjail
A5:30:01 <Underd0g> Caps is wrong
A5:30:06 <venn177> which we did
A5:30:09 <reviewmad> Yeah, but people kept going like open it open it who were ops
A5:30:09 <venn177> I tried a map without a spawn jail
A5:30:13 <venn177> and loa nd behold it got griefed
A5:30:19 <venn177> if an OP leaves the spawn jail open I deop them
A5:30:20 <venn177> derp
A5:30:25 <reviewmad> Someone accidentally flooded us first
A5:30:30 <Tich> I broke out of several spawn jails because they were too big
A5:30:31 <reviewmad> That was easy, we just sponged it
A5:30:32 <Super-Dot> Spawn jails suck
A5:30:38 <reviewmad> But when we were lavaflooded
A5:30:40 <Underd0g> They are necessary though
A5:30:43 <Super-Dot> It's better to just have a backup script and sensible ops
A5:30:44 <reviewmad> I nearly punched a baby
A5:30:46 <Underd0g> Even though they suck
A5:30:59 <reviewmad> Venn
A5:31:09 <reviewmad> Sorry about the spawnjail :S
A5:31:16 <venn177> Super-Dot: People aren't on my server 24/7, and sometimes people build after something has been griefed
A5:31:16 <reviewmad> I made a sort of op building stick out from it
A5:31:24 <reviewmad> Making op buildings is like smoking to me
A5:31:29 <reviewmad> You don't want to but you can't stop
A5:31:32 <UnknownX> Oh god this sub is good.

A5:31:50 <Super-Dot> Yeah, but they CAN'T build after something has been griefed if there's a spawn prison

A5:32:18 <reviewmad> I made spongedowns squarehurr yesterday
A5:32:20 <postlogic> Make a map without lava, then.

A5:33:55 <Tich> Wait what?
A5:34:07 <Super-Dot> If you don't have a backup script, the best way to do it I think is to only have spawn prisons when there aren't any ops online
A5:34:11 <citricsquid> his girlfriend is his hand.
A5:34:18 <reviewmad> IT WASN'T MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND IT WAS THE POST

A5:44:14 <Visiiri> LIES
A5:44:16 <Inzuki> flies
A5:44:17 <Visiiri> MIRC > ALL
A5:44:28 <postlogic> Caps.
A5:44:31 <venn177> [06:45] <Visiiri> MIRC > ALL
A5:44:31 <Super-Dot> mIRC has a nag screen unless you pay for it
A5:44:34 <venn177> I'm venn and I support that
A5:44:36 <Super-Dot> And a terrible interface
A5:44:37 <Visiiri> I can't do that?
A5:44:38 <Visiiri> wow.
A5:44:41 <Inzuki> Venn, how does Scruffy give you a headache?
A5:44:44 <Visiiri> Postlogic no longer FTW.
A5:44:56 <postlogic> It's annoying.
A5:45:10 <venn177> Ugh. I've had Fall Out Boy on repeat for three hours. I need to switch music.
A5:45:18 <citricsquid> I don't get why people use chatzilla, I have to reboot for addons etc. meaning you'd constantly be leaving and rejoining >:(
A5:45:24 <Inzuki> listen to stacey's mom :D
A5:45:42 <venn177> ehh Fountains of Wayne is okay
A5:45:50 <Super-Dot> citricsquid: Not if you run Chatzilla as a standalone client
A5:46:02 <postlogic> Hm, I find it kind of ironic that both minecraft and this channel has the consistent problem with flooding.
A5:46:02 <Super-Dot> http://chatzilla.rdmsoft.com/xulrunner/
A5:46:04 <venn177> Which kills the point of it. If you want a standalone client, just use mIRC.
A5:46:07 <Inzuki> brb later
12A5:46:10 * Inzuki (chatzilla@24.111.202.165) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A5:46:15 <postlogic> ChatZilla works fine, though.
A5:46:18 <Super-Dot> Chatzilla is a better standalone client than mICR
A5:46:21 <Super-Dot> *mIRC
A5:46:26 <venn177> but for reasons undisclosed, it's not as good.
A5:46:28 <venn177> :D
A5:46:30 <citricsquid> Super-Dot: yay work arounds.
A5:46:41 <postlogic> And there's HydraIRC, X-Chat, irssi, and so on.
A5:47:03 <UnknownX> Chatzilla is great because its built in the browser
A5:47:12 <Super-Dot> I thought you needed to pay for X-Chat
A5:47:21 <citricsquid> exactly, so when you need to restart your browser you have to restart IRC.
A5:47:22 <Super-Dot> Or is it nagware like mIRC?
A5:47:54 <UnknownX> citricsquid: That never bothers me
A5:48:18 <Super-Dot> Yeah, it doesn't bother me either
A5:48:22 <venn177> I will never use Chatzilla because I use the superior web browser: Chrome
A5:48:30 <Tich> Look how ugly Tich is
A5:48:31 <Tich> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Tich
A5:48:35 <Super-Dot> I just run it standalone because I don't use Firefox
A5:48:48 <Tich> off to eat now
A5:48:55 <Super-Dot> venn177, I run Chatzilla AND Chrome :D
A5:49:01 <venn177> oh shit
A5:49:09 <venn177> Tich: What the hell...? It's... pink.
A5:49:22 <venn177> Expand on it, now that th ebasics are done, it needs more definition
A5:49:23 <UnknownX> I may switch to chrome when they allow add-ons
A5:49:42 <Super-Dot> What add-ons do you use?
A5:49:45 <venn177> UnknownX: Chrome doesn't need addons. Addons make things slow and unnecessary. It does have greasemonkey support, though
A5:49:53 <UnknownX> But otherwise you can just make firefox look like chrome
A5:49:54 <postlogic> Chrome will most likely get addons at some point.
A5:50:26 <Super-Dot> Making Firefox look like Chrome is silly
A5:50:30 <postlogic> If Chrome had Firebug, I'd hit it.
A5:50:35 <citricsquid> if a browser doesn't have firebug and alexa addon it sucks.
A5:50:38 <Super-Dot> Chrome is good because it /acts/ like Chrome
A5:50:48 <Super-Dot> I can understand wanting Firebug
A5:50:52 <venn177> The each page is a separate process is absolutely amazing
A5:50:56 <Super-Dot> What does Alexa do?
A5:50:57 <venn177> and that alone makes Chrome worth it
A5:51:09 <offset> http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php
A5:51:17 <citricsquid> Super-Dot: Just adds all their info on traffic rating into the browser.
A5:51:19 <offset> ^ If you like Chrome
A5:51:20 <postlogic> venn177: That'll definately come in handy when I install Windows 7. With the whole full multi core support thing
A5:51:26 <Super-Dot> Ah, neat
A5:51:39 <Super-Dot> Apparently their statistics are skewed by demographic
A5:51:53 <citricsquid> oh, their info is completely wrong
A5:51:57 <citricsquid> but it's great for comparison
A5:52:03 <Super-Dot> Righto
A5:53:11 <Super-Dot> I read a bunch about how Windows 7 had a superb interface
A5:53:33 <postlogic> It does.
A5:53:34 <Super-Dot> And I was like "oh whoa, finally an interface competitor to OS X"
A5:53:39 <postlogic> Well no.
A5:53:46 <postlogic> There's still the Windows workflow
A5:53:52 <Super-Dot> And then I read how the Taskbar works
A5:53:58 <venn177> I can't wait 'til Chrome OS
A5:54:02 <postlogic> And in my opinion, it's inferior to OS X' workflow. But that's a personal preference.
A5:54:03 <Super-Dot> And all they did was make it behave more like the Dock =/
A5:54:04 <venn177> It's going to be amazing and I have every intention of getting it
A5:54:11 <postlogic> Super-Dot: Not quite.
A5:54:21 <postlogic> Windows 7 is at the very least a worthy successor to Windows XP.
A5:54:25 <postlogic> Which is about time.
A5:54:35 <Super-Dot> The Start menu has some improvements, too, which I'm unfamiliar with
A5:54:38 <postlogic> And it hits my MSDN Academy Alliance tomorrow :D installing on sunday.
A5:54:40 <venn177> I'm on Vista and I'm not having any problems, really.
A5:55:07 <Super-Dot> I like XP's Start menu, so I look forward to trying out 7's
A5:55:16 <venn177> www.vistastartmenu.com
A5:55:18 <venn177> I like that start menu
A5:55:27 <venn177> I browse my whole computer through it, it's amazing. It has XP support, too
A5:55:36 <venn177> I recommend everyone here at least give it a shot.
A5:55:41 <peerkoel> back when I was new to XP I'd just set the look and feel back to old win2k
A5:55:59 <venn177> Wow
A5:56:06 <venn177> I just realized something huge
A5:56:13 <venn177> Ever since I formatted, I never set up wallpapers
A5:56:19 <venn177> Anyone wanna throw me some cool wallpapers?

A5:57:08 <peerkoel> you should prod those admins citricsquid 
A5:57:14 <postlogic> I'm tempted to offer host space, citricsquid.
A5:57:34 <venn177> Notch should tooootally make Minecraft wallpapers
A5:57:45 <venn177> With hilariously blocky concept art, and the whole shabang
A5:58:05 <citricsquid> haha, you wouldn't be able to handle my stuff unless you have a quad core process spare, my sites routinely use >2GB ram and load averages of well over 4 on a dual core processor. :(
A5:58:11 <postlogic> Oh.
A5:58:16 <postlogic> That complicates things.
A5:58:34 <Dan> Whats the internal URL for Minecraft?
A5:58:37 <postlogic> What kind of sites do you run? I thought it was just the forum
A5:58:41 <Visiiri> Jesus, citric!
A5:58:49 <Visiiri> What the hell kind of sites are they!?
A5:58:50 <venn177> postlogic: Also wiki and skins
A5:58:55 <postlogic> Still.
A5:59:03 <venn177> I wouldn't be surprised if he hosts a Korean MMO or something
A5:59:07 <venn177> He strikes me as the type of person who would
A5:59:07 <citricsquid> well, minecraft wiki uses quite a bit, but I have a couple of personal sites that use lots of resources. 
A5:59:34 <postlogic> I run a site with several thousands of visitors without using much more than 150-200MB RAM.
10A5:59:50 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|CombatArms
A6:00:12 <citricsquid> One of my sites does 40mil mysql records whenever a user loads the page, sends load to full just loading it D:
A6:00:19 <postlogic> But it's probably simpler than even a forum :p
A6:00:26 <postlogic> ...why?
A6:00:37 <postlogic> Sounds like bad optimization ;)
A6:00:40 <citricsquid> Combined my sites only do about 30k uniques a month :(
A6:00:40 <venn177> I feel a little small.
A6:00:48 <venn177> I'm the only non-OP talking
A6:00:51 <venn177> I'd feel better if I was OP
A6:00:52 <venn177> :D
A6:00:56 <postlogic> venn177: Nice try.
A6:01:01 <citricsquid> postlogic: very much so, but also the amount of data being processed is huge. I could probably optimize it better but I cba :3
A6:01:10 <Dan> Noone here happens to know what to put in to access my own server
A6:01:10 <venn177> Damn! My plans have been foiled! I shall try again, at a later date!
A6:01:11 <postlogic> Hehe.

A7:07:20 <08Notch> =D
A7:07:34 <08Notch> when destroying a block in survival mode, you keep the mouse button pressed over a block for a while

A7:07:49 <08Notch> when the cracks cover the entire block, it pops
A7:07:53 <08Notch> and it looks GREAT

A7:28:35 <offset> Lua gamemodes are usually pretty small
A7:28:54 <iPope> offset: that depends
A7:29:01 <reviewmad> A gamemode in gmod without any additional textures/sounds/models took up 10mb of space for me
A7:29:03 <Tich> I wonder why we are talking so much about things which may not be for the near future anyway
A7:29:05 <aera> I thought the gamemodes would be entirely server-side

A7:29:33 <offset> I don't see too many high end mods floating around

A7:29:38 <aera> the ability to send a custom block map would be nice
A7:29:43 <offset> Like Gmods situation, a few people will put out quality
A7:29:47 <aera> i.e. texturemap
A7:29:58 <reviewmad> If custom gamemodes get made, sandbox could become a rare sight though
A7:30:09 <reviewmad> Custom blocks on a server will become possible, I hope
A7:30:15 <reviewmad> That'd be cool, to have your own sort of block
A7:30:21 <iPope> Notch: Can AABB's be used in 2d or is it 3d collision technique?
A7:30:49 <Siiseli> iPope, used in 2d
A7:30:50 <postlogic> iPope: Minecraft is 3D, no?
A7:30:52 <postlogic> Oh.
A7:30:59 <Siiseli> alot
A7:31:00 <Super-Dot> In 3D, surely it would be AABBCC?
A7:31:11 <reviewmad> Minecraft is 2D making a 3D illusion?
A7:31:14 <reviewmad> Never knew THAT.
A7:31:18 <iPope> reviewmad: If you look at gmod there are still lots of sandbox servers even with the huge amout of lua gamemodes
A7:31:22 <postlogic> There should be per-pixel detection! >_>
A7:31:29 <aera> AABB stands for Axis-Aligned Bounding Box
A7:31:35 <reviewmad> I want DMM in minecraft :P
A7:31:39 <iPope> postlogic: but then us lowly computers couldn't play
A7:31:40 <aera> so it's the same acronym no matter the dimension :)
A7:31:50 <postlogic> iPope: That's often slow for even 2D :p
A7:32:07 <iPope> postlogic: masks?
A7:32:11 <Super-Dot> Awesome, aera, I didn't know that :O
A7:32:21 <postlogic> iPope: Still.
A7:32:34 <reviewmad> I think custom blocks would be a good idea
A7:32:38 <reviewmad> Then we could have lava sponges
A7:32:40 <postlogic> I don't think anybody uses per-pixel for 3D.
A7:32:41 <aera> Super-Dot: I think they chose that name on purpose, mind, for the acronym :)
A7:32:45 <reviewmad> Which notch doesn't have planned :(
A7:32:50 <Super-Dot> Yeah, I suspect the same
A7:33:07 <offset> Keep it simple I think
A7:33:09 <reviewmad> The glass method you have to use for lava is too hard
A7:33:15 <aera> no, you can't do per-pixel in 3D, since a) it would be voxels and b) all 3D stuff is in vectors anyway
A7:33:18 <reviewmad> Lava sponges would be simpler and easier
A7:33:33 <aera> and if you DID manage it, your computer would explode in a rage of CPU usage
A7:33:36 <Super-Dot> Axis-Aligned Bounding Box for Cubic Collision
A7:33:38 <Super-Dot> :P
A7:33:38 <postlogic> MineCraft could've workedwith voxels, though.
A7:33:41 <postlogic> aera: My point exactly.
A7:33:43 <reviewmad> Voxels like in voxelstein 3D? That game was awesome.
A7:33:53 <reviewmad> So false dmm
A7:33:56 <reviewmad> In a way
A7:33:57 <Super-Dot> Though cubic is imprecise
A7:34:06 <aera> i mean, minecraft maps already have 4 million blocks in them
A7:34:13 <aera> imagine the number of voxels they'd have
A7:34:23 <postlogic> Someone on the TIGS forum posted a link to this "voxel" editor online
A7:34:25 <iPope> 4 in a box?
A7:34:38 <iPope> nope i mean 6

A7:54:03 <Super-Dot> So someone may have answered before
A7:54:11 <iPope> Notch is experimenting bit I think itsgoing to be click a rock, 0.8 second delay with cracks forming an debris flying
A7:54:33 <postlogic> 14:08:24 @ Notch> when destroying a block in survival mode, you keep the mouse button pressed over a block for a while

A7:54:48 <iPope> ah
A7:54:53 <iPope> right brb
A7:55:11 <Super-Dot> Ah, awesome
A7:55:28 <Super-Dot> How does the .8 second thing work?
A7:55:33 <Super-Dot> I'm still confused about that
A7:55:40 <08Notch> it's more than 0.8 seconds now
A7:55:44 <08Notch> I'm testing different speeds
A7:55:49 <08Notch> too fast, and it doesn't feel rewarding.
A7:55:49 <ZomBuster> you hold the mouse for x sec and wham its gone
A7:55:54 <08Notch> too slow and it gets VERY boring
A7:56:04 <Super-Dot> Ahhhhh
A7:56:10 <ZomBuster> maybe upgrades later on
A7:56:11 <offset> If you release your mouse, the block retains its damage/time right?
A7:56:15 <08Notch> no
A7:56:18 <ZomBuster> 10 steel = jackhammer

A8:21:42 <Super-Dot> Notch, do you have a timetable on when you're going to mirror arms and legs?
A8:21:50 <Jakkarra> but i believe Notch expressed a wish to change it

A11:15:07 <UnknownX> Notch that is fast

A11:15:45 <UnknownX> We only mentioned cracks in the block like 4 hours ago

A11:16:11 <08Notch> the first version had a circular progress bar
A11:16:18 <Jakkarra> will there be some form of hell underneath the maps?

A11:16:30 <Jakkarra> a DF styled hell, i mean
A11:16:34 <IceFlinger> Woah
A11:16:35 <citricsquid> oh, good :D Wasn't clear in the video.
A11:16:38 <IceFlinger> I forgot I was here
A11:16:40 <IceFlinger> What did I miss
A11:16:50 <rcfighter> A youtube video

A11:16:57 <08Notch> the HD version looks great. :D
A11:16:58 <rcfighter> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdiN-SatPa8
A11:17:15 <Tattimatonen> Now, this may sound impolite considering all your work Notch, but have you ever considered block variations? You have differently colured cloth, so why not differently coloured stone, wood, red bricks, metal etc. For now they would just need new textures and a little code, which should be simple, no? They would behave like old blocks, just with new textures.
A11:17:20 <citricsquid> oh good, I'll watch in HQ noq.
A11:17:22 <citricsquid> now*
A11:17:33 <iPope> Notch im stealing your code in HD
A11:17:38 <citricsquid> ahh yes, I can see the outline in HD :D
A11:17:43 <killer2329> also notch why to the npcs jump so much?
A11:17:48 <08Notch> it's not impolite at all. I have considered it, but I think that's going to require the databyte
A11:17:57 <killer2329> ipope not enough to really do anything
A11:18:23 <iPope> I know, i was kidding
A11:18:26 <Tattimatonen> Ah, I understand. (not really, I'm too young)
A11:18:26 <rcfighter> Might people eventually be able to enter the RGB value of a color when they make cloth, and need different resources to do so?
A11:18:27 <08Notch> hehe
A11:18:35 <Jakkarra> will vehicles feature at all notch? or, will that have to wait till the Dungeons update?
A11:18:38 <PuyoDead> I love how the monsters have a constant creepy stare at you
A11:18:44 <citricsquid> rcfighter: server_level.dat would be huge though.
A11:18:45 <08Notch> Jakkarra: I don't know yet
A11:18:53 <08Notch> i think they're unlikely, but I want them.
A11:19:01 <Tattimatonen> I think some vehicles wouldn't fit in
A11:19:01 <Jakkarra> coo'
A11:19:08 <SMP> horses.
A11:19:14 <citricsquid> flying carpets
A11:19:16 <Tattimatonen> Trains would be cool
A11:19:17 <Jakkarra> will the enemies vary at all?
A11:19:18 <LG_Legacy> I imagine a jeep smashing through dirt like crazy
A11:19:21 <SMP> raptors
A11:19:24 <Jakkarra> like the zombies, will they all be the same?
A11:19:26 <peerkoel> Notch: how about clusters of blocks that move around

A11:23:59 <IceFlinger> But water is the coolest!
A11:24:02 <SMP> notch, ask The Archives guy how he did it, and take a page from his book
A11:24:05 <Tattimatonen> Because dragons are awesome
A11:24:06 <JoeyJo0> Notch, if you want, you can check my Water Finity code?
A11:24:12 <Jakkarra> will there be blocks floating on top?

A11:49:19 <Tattimatonen> I mean, everyone has a cool idea for a game, though it's prolly never gonna happen.
A11:49:28 <Quatroking> I just realized, since I'm just a floating head, I'm just a dickhead.
A11:49:37 <Haggle> Har har.
A11:49:38 <citricsquid> Quatroking: Too accurate.
A11:49:40 <killer2329> alchemy had less logic in it than magic 
A11:49:43 <PuyoDead> how true, how true
A11:49:49 <fydo> lol
A11:49:50 <Quatroking> fuck alchemy and magic
A11:49:52 <iPope> citricsquid: Then do it when the people in question are there, basic manners
A11:49:59 <Quatroking> SCIENCE
A11:50:01 <Quatroking> FUCK YEAH
A11:50:04 <Tattimatonen> But mobs should drop items specific to them
A11:50:12 <PuyoDead> I <3 Science
A11:50:13 <iPope> Unless your too pussy to do when they are there to defend themselves
A11:50:20 <LG_Legacy> Zombie penis Tattimatonen?
A11:50:22 <fydo> so I suppose if iPope had an opinion about a entire country of people, he couldn't express it unless every citizen of that country was around to hear it?
A11:50:23 <Tattimatonen> unicorn-horn, skeleton-bone, zombie-head
A11:50:27 <Quatroking> I want a proton collider in Minecraft
A11:50:33 <Tattimatonen> you could shrink the head
A11:50:43 <citricsquid> haha haha. That's the most retarded thing ever, when people say "you're too scared" you can tell they don't have a valid argument. It's the internet, I am scared of nothing.
A11:50:45 <Haggle> Zombie Robot with LAZER BEAMS? ONLY WITH SCIENCE MY FRIENDS.
A11:50:46 <iPope> fydo: it would be rude to do so
A11:50:55 <UnknownX> I left facepunch because Garry is an asshole and locked me out of my CP
A11:50:58 <Tattimatonen> Sciencecraft
A11:51:00 <PuyoDead> it's the equivalent of saying "whatever"
A11:51:02 <Quatroking> I'm scared of the world outside my house
A11:51:09 <fydo> iPope: you're pretty messed up
A11:51:09 <Tattimatonen> Also garry sucks penis
A11:51:26 <Tattimatonen> Or does he
A11:51:28 <iPope> fydo: Thats a little harsh
A11:51:30 <Quatroking> garry is an asshole, but the game rocks
A11:51:34 <Quatroking> its a shame
A11:51:39 <Tattimatonen> That's true
A11:51:40 <Jakkarra> what's notch's skin, anyway?
A11:51:45 <fleshBasedProcessor> forget facepuch, we have are own community and a new video. Lets just talk about the video.
A11:51:47 <killer2329> quit breaking it with patches >.<
A11:51:48 <Tattimatonen> It was awesome
A11:51:50 <Quatroking> a bearded guy
A11:51:51 <fydo> iPope: you're here, so it's not rude
A11:52:00 <UnknownX> I make one little thread and someone trolls me and i get mad then he locks me out of my CP and from posting in a forum
A11:52:03 <iPope> fydo: when he posted them I wasn't
A11:52:03 <Tattimatonen> let's talk about our fantasy games
A11:52:07 <Quatroking> Jakkarra: if I were home right now, i could throw the file at you
A11:52:13 <Quatroking> (I made his skin)
A11:52:17 <PuyoDead> we were'nt even refering to you in the first place
A11:52:21 <fydo> iPope: I was talking about the comment that you thought was harsh
A11:52:27 <PuyoDead> but you did a fine job of drawing all the attention
A11:52:29 <Tattimatonen> Your dream game (that could be made)
A11:52:33 <iPope> fydo: Its not rude but its harsh
A11:52:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> UnkownX, please don't abreviate CP. I have no idea what you are talking about and I'm scared it is what I think it is

A11:53:40 <citricsquid> iPope: and he wasn't so you're being rude. Nice contradiction there.

A11:54:07 <UnknownX> But does that even make sense?
A11:54:18 <iPope> citricsquid: I know I was being rude and intended to be rude
A11:54:19 <Haggle> I dug a hole the other day, after breaking out of a spawn prison.
A11:54:24 <citricsquid> iPope: Immature? I'm arguing that your point is stupid, you just told me I can't comment on your post because you weren't around, but it's okay for you to call Notch strict, even though he also wasn't there.
A11:54:24 <Quatroking> What are we talking about by the way?
A11:54:24 <Tattimatonen> Pedobear always approves
A11:54:25 <Haggle> then I got banned.

P12:01:34 <Tattimatonen> Jews and their gold...
P12:01:39 <Malcovent> and someone should also make me a hitler skin...
P12:01:43 <Malcovent> then the illusion is complete.
P12:01:56 <Tattimatonen> has anyone made a skin that looks like agent 47?
P12:02:02 <Malcovent> actually thats a point, are hitler skins allowed or banned?
P12:02:07 <Malcovent> since swastikas are generally banned on servers.
P12:02:15 <killer2329> depends on the server
P12:02:17 <LG_Legacy> I'm going to make a red spy skin when i ever get my account upgraded.

P1:22:56 <Eagle> If we're lucky
P1:22:59 <Azjherben> Well
P1:23:08 <Azjherben> I'm going on vacation for a week so....
P1:23:11 <Eagle> I heard somebody say end of the month
P1:23:20 <Azjherben> Maybe it will realase then. (actually 9 days)
P1:23:20 <Peroggi> seems reasonable
P1:23:56 <iPope> Notch says closed survival will e out by the time he goes to indonesia for three weeks (4 september)
P1:24:03 <Peroggi> :(
P1:24:03 <Azjherben> I wanna try making a custom server again. I mean, I actually made my own online from scratch.
P1:24:08 <Azjherben> So, I could pull it off.
P1:24:12 <Peroggi> props to you azj
P1:24:16 <Azjherben> ?
P1:24:19 <Azjherben> Oh
P1:24:27 <Sean> So noone knows how to get cMss  to wok?
P1:24:36 <Peroggi> also how exactly do you survive in survival mode?
P1:24:43 <Eagle> cMss is incredibly easy to make work
P1:24:45 <Peroggi> are you like gonna have to sleep in shelter and eat leaves or something?
P1:24:47 <Peroggi> I know right
P1:24:48 <Azjherben> Well, the download said ERROR 404
P1:24:56 <Peroggi> Sean: do you have python 2.6?
P1:24:59 <Azjherben> Maybe you need to sleep
P1:24:59 <Sean> yes
P1:25:07 <Peroggi> run it using idle or whatever then
10P1:25:10 * chilley (armin@p5B0BE1D7.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
P1:25:12 <Azjherben> and sleep must be on leaves/cloth and in sun blocked areas
P1:25:16 <Azjherben> etc.
P1:25:25 <Peroggi> well my point is
P1:25:30 <Peroggi> what are you going to be surviving against?
P1:25:37 <Peroggi> hunger, weather, etc
P1:25:45 <killer2329> zombies 
P1:25:49 <Eagle> hunger, weather, monsters
P1:25:50 <chilley> when will the resource stuff be released?
P1:25:51 <Eagle> lava
P1:25:52 <Eagle> drowning
P1:25:53 <Peroggi> lol I thought thtat was a seperate mode
P1:26:04 <Peroggi> well ya but its easy to not go jump in a pit of lava or water
P1:26:07 <Azjherben> He should have 3 modes...
P1:26:13 <Azjherben> 1. Survival (with death)
P1:26:14 <Peroggi> how exactly will you eat if you have to keep fed lol?
P1:26:19 <Azjherben> 2. Survival (no death)
P1:26:21 <Azjherben> 3. sandbox
P1:26:27 <Peroggi> lol why would you want survival with no death?
P1:26:29 <Eagle> Peroggi, but what if you're deep underground and you hit a pocket of water?
P1:26:32 <Eagle> And you're trapped?
P1:26:49 <Peroggi> oh you may have a point there
P1:26:54 <Peroggi> but still you could just tunnel one block up
P1:26:55 <Azjherben> Well eagle
P1:26:58 <Peroggi> and make an air pocket
P1:27:04 <Azjherben> the smart thing would be to destroy some of the roof
P1:27:08 <Azjherben> and swim up there
P1:27:13 <Eagle> Peroggi that is a good point
P1:27:13 <Peroggi> exactly what I just said >.>
P1:27:17 <Peroggi> :D lol
P1:27:22 <Azjherben> Sorry
P1:27:23 <Eagle> But um
P1:27:28 <Eagle> What if you hit a pocket of lava
P1:27:30 <Sean> oh wait 2.6?
P1:27:33 <Eagle> Then you're screwed.
P1:27:36 <Peroggi> it HAS to be 2.6 Sean
P1:27:38 <Sean> Heh I have 3.1
P1:27:40 <Peroggi> no eagle you can outrun lava
P1:27:40 <Sean> ok thanks
P1:27:43 <Peroggi> :P
P1:27:50 <Eagle> He needs to make it faster.
P1:27:56 <Peroggi> naw I think its at a good speed
P1:27:59 <Azjherben> Anyway, [i][u]another[/i][/u] good question for notch, how will the hosters choose between hosting a survival game and a sandbox server?

P1:28:16 <Peroggi> Notch really has to work on his server software
P1:28:24 <Eagle> Lava Survival on survival mode
P1:28:24 <Sean> survivalmode=1
P1:28:24 <Peroggi> since all these custom servers out now are definetly superiour

P1:28:50 <Eagle> Lava Survival on survival mode
P1:28:53 <Eagle> :D
P1:28:54 <Peroggi> I'm sure when full version comes out notch will have worked some GUI into server software
P1:28:57 <Peroggi> so its easier and cleaner to set up
P1:29:07 <Azjherben> oh yay for peroggi's idea
P1:29:10 <Asmageddon> Hey, anybody has idea of when newer version will come out?
P1:29:17 <Azjherben> ..........
P1:29:19 <Azjherben> NO
P1:29:19 <Asmageddon> or what will it include?
P1:29:20 <Eagle> End of month if we're lucky.
P1:29:21 <Peroggi> before september 4th is all we know
P1:29:33 <Peroggi> it will include survival mode
P1:29:39 <Azjherben> well, it will hopefully be during my vacation
P1:30:02 <Asmageddon> no new materials? :/
P1:30:14 <Sean> what else do you want?
P1:30:32 <Sean> I want water to not duplicate. Unless its at eadge of map
P1:30:46 <Peroggi> Sean: you mean finite water

P1:33:39 <AzjheOH> I had to leave
P1:33:41 <AzjheOH> back
P1:33:41 <IceFlinger> And 35 units of water fall in it
P1:33:44 <princepsregulus> K
P1:33:45 <Peroggi> honestly what I can't wait for is for that NewFrontier server to go back up
P1:33:46 <Peroggi> and be awesome
P1:33:51 <Peroggi> with actual monsters and resources
P1:33:56 <IceFlinger> Does the last unit move around on the top looking for somewhere to go?
P1:33:59 <geekahedron> I want gravity-based water
P1:34:08 <geekahedron> it won't flow sideways until it has something below it
P1:34:08 <Eagle> I want gravity-based death

P1:38:11 <IceFlinger> That's what I was thinking
P1:38:17 <IceFlinger> But I don't know how hard that would be to code
P1:38:32 <IceFlinger> The body of water would have to know how many slots above it need to be filled
P1:38:39 <Peroggi> you guys are talking about things that MIGHT be released a year from now
P1:38:41 <IceFlinger> and how many extra units of water it has
P1:38:45 <Eagle> What if cryzed made it so in cMss !kill actually killed a person. :O
P1:38:48 <Peroggi> if Notch doesn't start bathing in money when this is a great success that is
P1:38:59 <killer2329> detection would be kinda hard the actual compression would be easy

P4:50:21 <zagabar> Anyone had this suggestion before? :  That you could be able to host 'subservers' on your computer that runs like a separate process and in all ways acts like a normal server except in the way that it has no welcome screen or external url or anything like that. The purpose would be to extend the map on a ordinary server. The maps would be connected through a 
P4:50:34 <zagabar> portal that could be placed anywhere. On the edge for instance.
P4:50:38 <r4dio> WHUT
P4:50:58 <zagabar> Then when players enters the portals, they travel from one map to the other.

P5:46:13 <citricsquid> Visiiri: It's not about him being god, it's about respect. I don't know what happened, but from his attitude just then he seems like he has a problem with someone being treated "higher" than him.
P5:46:19 <UnknownX> Visiiri: Then who is god of Minetopia?
P5:46:42 <testvan> skewz me whilst i smoke
P5:47:07 <Visiiri> Citric, that's exactly it. Colain treated him with the deepest respect. He looked up to the guy.
P5:47:16 <Visiiri> Ah, well.
P5:47:20 <testvan> what did notch dooooo?
P5:47:21 <Visiiri> I don't agree with him anyway.
P5:47:26 <citricsquid> So uh, why is he being a dick, what did Notch do?
P5:47:34 <Super-Dot> Does anyone have the chat transcript from when Colain left?

P5:47:56 <Super-Dot> I can't find it because my client's search doesn't work properly
P5:47:58 <Visiiri> then he asked if he was being ignored and notch said noothing
P5:48:06 <Super-Dot> Can someone tell me the approximate timestamp?
P5:48:10 <Visiiri> then he asked again
P5:48:29 <UnknownX> [2009-08-14 04:35:35] <Notch> Colain: I find talking to you has a tendency to take up a lot of time, and it rarely is productive
P5:48:30 <Visiiri> and notch said that talking to him was "counter-productive"
P5:48:40 <Visiiri> Yeah tehre.
P5:48:43 <citricsquid> Visiiri: I don't get it half as much as Notch and people doing that to me is so damn annoying. I can see exactly why Notch said that. 
P5:48:45 <testvan> that is it?

P5:50:04 <citricsquid> Visiiri: I get it with the forums, having 5 people keep dinging me to ask about the forums makes me rage, I honestly think Notch handles it ridiculously well, I'd have beaten you all up by now if I got the amount he does.
P5:50:17 <aera> he keeps an impressively level head

P9:54:18 <UnknownX> What?!
P9:54:19 <Drakkar> but they aren't that big
P9:54:22 <PuyoDead> 256MB would be the absolute maximum

P9:54:32 <Drakkar> yeah thats the most the cart can handle isn't it?
P9:54:35 <UnknownX> Still...
P9:54:41 <PuyoDead> average is between 50-150

P9:57:22 <Drakkar> its one or the other

P10:03:01 <PuyoDead> running dsware and such off SD would be excellent

P10:16:27 <fleshBasedProcessor> ok, my computer somehow got the idea that I want to share my root hard drive on the local network and I can not figure out where to turn it off.
P10:16:42 <TheOne> Oh fun
P10:17:04 <TheOne> What ya running?
P10:17:07 <fleshBasedProcessor> XP
P10:17:45 <TheOne> Should be ablt to right click your drive icon in my computer and open the props
P10:18:03 <fleshBasedProcessor> thank you
P10:18:04 <TheOne> then look for an option to share it in there.
P10:19:26 <fleshBasedProcessor> You know what really annoys me. Very similar looking but different types of ram fit in the same type of slot
P10:20:03 <fleshBasedProcessor> I found this out in a long and tedious attempt at stealing my moms ram from her computer and adding it to mine
P10:20:29 <f00thePirate> lol
P10:20:38 <f00thePirate> steal schools ram
P10:20:44 <f00thePirate> they wont know
P10:20:54 <fleshBasedProcessor> by the time I was done neither computer worked and now I still only have 1.5gb and the computer my mom just stopped using regularly still has 2.0gb
P10:21:21 <fleshBasedProcessor> I think the laptop I'm getting from my college in a week or 2 is more powerful than my desktop.
P10:21:50 <fleshBasedProcessor> I'm buying a new computer next summer come hell or high water
P10:22:00 <Animator> I'm still looking for that coder. *cough*
P10:22:04 <f00thePirate> im waiting for 4 gigs of ram to come in the mail
P10:22:09 <f00thePirate> and a new gfx card
P10:22:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> and I'm still a lazy bum that hasn't even worked on the project I had already started.
P10:22:46 <f00thePirate> do you think it will bottleneck with a 8800gts and a 9900gts?

P10:25:43 <Super-Dot> Animator, what do you need coded?
P10:26:05 <Animator> Platformer(s).
P10:26:19 <Animator> Many are small projects.
P10:26:22 <Animator> Some are bigger.
P10:26:32 <UnknownX> Oh Lol
P10:26:34 <Super-Dot> Platformers are easy!
P10:26:42 <UnknownX> You can add music
P10:26:43 <Animator> I'll supply all of the graphics and I've got a guy doing music.
P10:26:46 <Super-Dot> Just use the Game Maker platformer tutorial and modify it.
P10:26:51 <Akai> hrm
P10:26:54 <Animator> Ahahahahaha- no.
P10:26:56 <Akai> An idea...
P10:27:06 <Super-Dot> Why not?
P10:27:15 <Animator> Game Maker isn't that good.
P10:27:22 <Animator> Which is why I'm looking for a coder.
P10:27:28 <Super-Dot> Game Maker is fantastic :U
P10:27:42 <Animator> Well, yeah, there are good Game Makert games.
P10:27:44 <Super-Dot> What do you need coded that can't be done in Game Maker?
P10:28:12 <Animator> Things.
P10:28:15 <Animator> I can't say.
P10:28:18 <Animator> Flesh knows.
P10:28:20 <Animator> I told him.
P10:28:25 <Super-Dot> Why not? /:|
P10:28:39 <Animator> Secret.
P10:28:50 <fleshBasedProcessor> I didn't use to think Game Maker was a valid tool for making proper games, but then I played spelunky
P10:28:56 <Super-Dot> Are you afraid of them being stolen?
P10:29:01 <Animator> A bit.
P10:29:06 <Super-Dot> That never happens
P10:29:15 <Super-Dot> People only clone games that already exist
P10:29:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> be warned that your code can be completely recompiled to get the whole source with game maker
P10:29:17 <Animator> Depends on the quality of idea.
P10:29:30 <Super-Dot> Even the highest-quality of ideas
P10:29:45 <Super-Dot> They need to be implemented before anyone bothers stealing them
P10:30:00 <Animator> YOU'RE A SPY AREN'T YOU?! *masks paranoia*

P10:30:46 <Super-Dot> You're not going to get a coder if he doesn't know what he's coding =/
P10:31:08 <f00thePirate> lol
P10:31:13 <Animator> I only tell to the ones that are interested coding.
P10:31:27 <Super-Dot> Who's going to be interested?
P10:31:31 <toast> Right now, if I could code
P10:31:34 <Animator> And I used to have quite a few. I even had a previous coder.
P10:31:39 <toast> I wouldn't be interested, because you wont explain what you want.
P10:31:41 <Animator> He left me, though. ;_;
P10:31:52 <f00thePirate> i could see if my friend would code it
P10:32:04 <Animator> *sigh*
P10:32:07 <f00thePirate> hes on god level in python
P10:32:13 <Super-Dot> I wonder why he left you
P10:32:13 <Animator> Oooh.
P10:32:21 <Animator> I don't know, I told him everything.
P10:32:22 <geekahedron> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=geekahedron << no one understood my old skin
P10:32:31 <Super-Dot> It /couldn't/ be because he doesn't like the idea you want to guard so much
P10:32:44 <Animator> He liked it.
P10:32:52 <Super-Dot> Oh cool
P10:32:57 <Animator> He actually admired the idea.
P10:33:00 <Super-Dot> Why'd he leave then? :O
P10:33:07 <Animator> I still don't know.
P10:33:17 <Animator> Tried contacting him, nada.
P10:33:28 <Animator> And he had such a good timezone...
P10:33:31 <f00thePirate> he left because the sex was bad
P10:33:37 <Super-Dot> Could you tell me the idea in a PM?
