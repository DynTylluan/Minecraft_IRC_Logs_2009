P2:16:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> So far I have two Yahoos and a Bing
P2:16:29 <Snowman> 3rd. Yahoo -.-
P2:16:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Three Yahoos and a Bing
P2:16:37 <PuyoDead> first was google
P2:16:41 <Eagle> The thing about these is I don't know what to search for. ):
P2:16:47 <PuyoDead> yahoo was worst, heh
P2:16:50 <Snowman> same eagle
P2:17:00 <Snowman> 4th. Google
P2:17:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Three Yahoos, Google, and a Bing
P2:17:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Haha, Bing has by far the best results for AlLnAtuRalX 
P2:17:30 <Snowman> 2 googles, 2 yahoos and a bing
P2:17:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I own binggasm and bingasm.com
P2:17:50 <PuyoDead> google and yahoo so far
P2:17:57 <Snowman> ffs 2 of everything...
P2:17:59 <Azjherben> What'd it reuturn?
P2:18:04 <Azjherben> return*
P2:18:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead's best results are on Yahoo/Bing
P2:18:20 <Snowman> LOL WTF: Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/.taniika/mkordahi/blindsearch.fejus.com/search_funtions.php on line 130
P2:18:22 <PuyoDead> huh?
P2:18:22 <Eagle> :O I searched "Earthbound" and yahoo was best.
P2:18:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> For your nick PuyoDead 
P2:18:29 <PuyoDead> oh, for my name?
P2:18:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Surprisingly, Google prioritizes Flickr, a Yahoo company
P2:18:40 <Snowman> bing crashed at that search XD
P2:18:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P2:18:57 <Azjherben> I'll go search Azjherben on bing now.
P2:19:17 <Eagle> Searching "Eagle" isn't very interesting. :/
P2:19:20 <Azjherben> 72 results
P2:19:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P2:19:30 <Snowman> Eagle, searching Snowman isn't either
P2:19:31 <PuyoDead> google: 2, yahoo: 1, bing: 0
P2:19:37 <Eagle> XD
P2:19:48 <Azjherben> One time, I searched Azjherben, and I found an impersonator of me.
P2:20:00 <Azjherben> Commenting about mythbusters on some 3rd party video sharing site.
P2:20:19 <Eagle> Yahoo: 1  Bing: 1
13P2:21:03 * PuyoDead goes until he gets a bing hit
P2:21:15 <Eagle> Yahoo: 1  Bing: 2  Google: 0
P2:21:16 <Eagle> :O
P2:21:22 <Marach> marach gives some results
P2:22:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9jdpr/is_it_just_me_or_did_google_just_up_their_search/
P2:22:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P2:22:46 <PuyoDead> finally! got a bing!
P2:22:49 <PuyoDead> google: 2, yahoo: 3, bing: 1
P2:22:59 <Azjherben> PuyoDead, you have lots of results.
13P2:23:00 * AlLnAtuRalX throws coin at Puyo.
P2:23:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bing!
P2:23:04 <Azjherben> Like 500, for your name.
P2:23:06 <Eagle> Yahoo: 1  Bing: 3  Google: 0
P2:23:13 <PuyoDead> yea, that's what being old does for ya
P2:23:14 <Eagle> I don't like that Bing is winning. D:
P2:23:33 <PuyoDead> I purposely tried difficult searches
12P2:23:52 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
P2:23:54 <Azjherben> What's t.he scoring for?
P2:24:05 <Eagle> Google had the best results for Bing. XD
P2:24:12 <Azjherben> Lol
P2:24:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P2:24:24 <Eagle> Yahoo: 2:  Bing: 3  Google: 1
10P2:24:48 * Evilgrim (Sean@client-86-27-63-223.brhm.adsl.virgin.net) has joined #minecraft
P2:25:10 <Azjherben> What program should I make?
P2:25:31 <PuyoDead> oh damnit, the one I hit for bing I didn't mean to hit
P2:25:39 <PuyoDead> searched for "goldfish recipes"
P2:25:44 <Eagle> O.o
P2:25:54 <Eagle> I like doing the blind image search.
P2:25:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which one did you mean?
P2:26:14 <PuyoDead> I wanted to see pepperidge farm recipes come up, so I hit the one with pepperidge first
P2:26:37 <PuyoDead> google had the first actual "recipes" hit
P2:26:50 <Eagle> Gah bing is winning D:
P2:26:58 <Marach> noo
P2:27:18 <Eagle> Yahoo just gives me a bunch of concept art for "Bioshock"
P2:27:27 <Eagle> bing actually gives me screenshots
P2:27:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wow.  Reddit comments for Google being bigger: This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened on 9/11
P2:27:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
P2:27:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> What about chile?
P2:27:57 <Snowman> Yeah duh
P2:28:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fuck Pinochet
P2:28:24 <Snowman> Who cares about 3000 stupid dead people, font size is way more important
P2:28:25 <Eagle> lol yahoo gives me pictures of cars when I search "t rex"
P2:28:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Eagle, yahoo image search sucks
P2:28:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's universally agreed upon
P2:28:39 <Eagle> Apparently
P2:28:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just use it for text
P2:29:00 <Eagle> Bing has actually very good image search. A little bit more relevant than Google's. :/
P2:29:21 <PuyoDead> AlLnAtuRalX, sarcasm meter busted?
P2:29:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, that's an asinine comment
P2:30:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> It was obviously a joke, but it doesn't belong on my Reddit :P
P2:30:14 <Eagle> I search "you" and yahoo gives me a bunch of pictures of asians in bikinis
P2:30:15 <Eagle> wtf
P2:30:20 <PuyoDead> hah
P2:30:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jokes like that getting upvotes and being top-thread rather than intelligent discussions are what's ruining Reddit
P2:30:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it's all because of the Digg crowd
P2:30:36 <PuyoDead> meh, I expect that from reddit, honestly
P2:30:44 <PuyoDead> at least, lately
P2:30:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nowadays, yeah :(
P2:30:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> makes me sad
P2:31:05 <PuyoDead> only "news" community I've seen last is fark

P2:35:18 <Eagle> :(
P2:35:25 <citricsquid> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2397 most of the people here
P2:35:33 <Snowman> is that delaying PMs another 10 months?
P2:35:38 <citricsquid> yes.
P2:35:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I got linked that a few days ago
P2:35:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, just put up PHPBB and forget
P2:35:54 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: fuck that
P2:35:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> It has PMs, reporting, more manageable themes, etc
P2:35:58 <Snowman> That's just because WoM is a dick and shit
P2:36:03 <citricsquid> phpbb3 is fucking awful
P2:36:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> OH IM FUCKEN BITTER BECAUSE I USE OBSCURE SOFTWARE TO REBEL AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT
P2:36:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> THE ESTABLISHMENT, MAN!
P2:36:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then use fucking SMF
P2:36:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> If PHPBB is so bad
P2:36:38 <citricsquid> I was paid $120 to do some very basic modding work, pretty much what I did on minecraftforum that should have taken 2 hours
P2:36:38 <Siiseli> how about
P2:36:42 <Siiseli> write your own.
P2:36:45 <citricsquid> took fucking 3 days, because of how wank phpbb3 is
P2:36:49 <citricsquid> Siiseli: too much work :D
P2:36:53 <Siiseli> meh
P2:36:54 <citricsquid> also security is gay
P2:36:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> OH IM RETARDED BECAUSE I DONT KNOW PHPBB SYSTEM
P2:37:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's fine, it's very simple once you know it
P2:37:04 <Snowman> Oh dear, don't use SMF
P2:37:08 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I know it very well :)
P2:37:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then no mod would take you three days
P2:37:17 <Snowman> It's his job
P2:37:23 <Snowman> he does it 5 hours a month >.>
P2:37:25 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: haha, have you worked with it properlu?
P2:37:31 <citricsquid> properly*
P2:37:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've worked with it back in the PHPBB2 days a lot.
P2:37:42 <citricsquid> yes
P2:37:46 <citricsquid> phpbb2 != phpbb3
P2:37:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> I run PHPBB3 now, not done a lot of work with it
P2:38:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Like I said.  Use SMF or even VB
P2:38:02 <citricsquid> had fun with the permissions?
13P2:38:06 * Snowman is learning php in a few months
P2:38:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> they were fine OTB
P2:38:17 <citricsquid> lmao
P2:38:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Is that rare?
P2:38:33 <citricsquid> The second you need to configure permissions you'll rage, they're so overly complicated
10P2:38:34 * liq3 (liquidman3@58.175.123.210) has joined #minecraft
P2:38:40 <citricsquid> "would you like poster to be able to post this in this forum?"
P2:38:44 <citricsquid> and it's all on per forum basis
P2:38:46 <citricsquid> it's horrible.
P2:38:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh, yes... I've many groups
P2:39:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> I thought you meant permissions as in file perms on Unix
P2:39:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> *nix *
P2:39:06 <citricsquid> lolno
P2:39:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I set them up at the beginning and forgot
P2:39:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> they worked fine
P2:39:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Especially because one of the forums I ran was a tracker forum, so it had to have very tight control
P2:39:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> So the perms system seemed fine to me
P2:39:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> the ACP in PHPBB3 is amazing
P2:39:42 <citricsquid> :|
P2:39:47 <citricsquid> You're the first person I've seen say that
P2:39:49 <Snowman> FFS, fuck this shit, I'm not reading all of this
P2:39:56 <citricsquid> and I've spoke to people who work 10 hours a day with phpbb3
P2:39:57 <Snowman> I'm only at like 25% of it
P2:39:59 <citricsquid> and they agree it's horrible
P2:40:17 <citricsquid> they've tried to make some awesome social platform and just fucked up what phpbb is.
P2:40:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I had one forum of ~20k users for my tracker, and one of ~4k on its own.  Both fine, no issues
P2:40:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I heard it doesn't scale
P2:40:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> But MCForums does not have to worry about that
P2:40:42 <BoirG> anyone have any good pervy questions for girls
P2:40:50 <citricsquid> link?
P2:40:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Look at warez-bb
P2:40:53 <Snowman> BoirG, why?
P2:40:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> 3,616 users online
P2:41:01 <Eagle> I just called my dog's name and it turned it's head at me and spit flew EVERYWHERE
P2:41:03 <Eagle> AUGH
P2:41:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> With a peak of 8.5k
P2:41:06 <PuyoDead> hah
P2:41:07 <citricsquid> That's phpbb2
P2:41:08 <citricsquid> afaik
P2:41:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> For now
P2:41:15 <Snowman> Eagle, protip: don't have a dog
P2:41:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> he's working on pushing the upgrade
10P2:41:20 * Logger (mail2345@cpe-67-49-140-109.hawaii.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P2:41:21 <citricsquid> Yeah, phpbb2 and 3 are entirely different
10P2:41:21 * Evilgrim (Sean@client-86-27-63-223.brhm.adsl.virgin.net) has left #minecraft
P2:41:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> (Slowly)
P2:41:25 <citricsquid> phpbb2 was pretty okay
P2:41:29 <Eagle> Snowman that's a terrible tip.
P2:41:31 <citricsquid> 3 is comparticely awful.
P2:41:35 <citricsquid> ugh spelling
P2:41:38 <Eagle> Dog's are like an extra family member.
P2:41:38 <BoirG> snowman its fer truth or dare
P2:41:40 <Eagle> *Dogs
P2:41:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyway, you should use VB then or even SMF
P2:41:50 <Snowman> Oh
P2:41:53 <BoirG> please?
P2:42:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or YaBB if you have balls
P2:42:05 <citricsquid> not paying for VB and hated theming smf when I used it :D I'm picky, flux4life
P2:42:11 <Eagle> Except they're always friendly even when you're mad at something and they're all cuddly
P2:42:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I tested it out on my sandbox
P2:42:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's a piece of shit
P2:42:26 <Eagle> and they have a permanent goofy expression on their face
P2:42:31 <citricsquid> what's wrong with it?
P2:42:39 <Snowman> Azjherben
P2:42:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's got no features.  if I wanted that kind of minimalism, I'd go Vanilla, which does minimalism FAR better
P2:43:19 <citricsquid> no features? It's a forum not a social networking site. That's another problem with phpbb3, how many erroneous things do you need?
P2:43:25 <citricsquid> It's ever so bloated when it's supposed to be a forum.
P2:43:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> What social networking features does it have?

P2:44:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, when you say bloated, it's certainly not *slow*.  I host one on a shared box and its response is more than fair
P2:45:25 <PuyoDead> I personally have no use for "friend lists" or anything of that sort, but I would like more control
P2:45:36 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: what sort of stuff? :D
10P2:45:51 * Kratospie (Mibbit@h56.199.130.174.dynamic.ip.windstream.net) has joined #minecraft
P2:45:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, have you used the ACP (not MCP) on PHPBB3?
P2:46:02 <PuyoDead> the what?
P2:46:07 <citricsquid> admin cp
P2:46:13 <Snowman> cp? 
P2:46:14 <Snowman> :O
P2:46:14 <PuyoDead> (not that I'm aware of
P2:46:20 <citricsquid> yes admin child porn hurr durr
P2:46:26 <PuyoDead> don't know what that ( was there
13P2:46:34 * Snowman calls the party van
P2:46:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's great, really great
P2:46:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's the only reason I upgraded to PHPBB3

P2:46:56 <PuyoDead> ever been to gbatemp?
P2:47:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> no
P2:47:12 <citricsquid> you must have so much patience AlLnAtuRalX, seriously. I can't stand it, there's just so much stuff that doesn't need to be there, or could be simplified.
P2:47:13 <PuyoDead> I don't know what they use, but it seems nice
P2:47:14 <Snowman> :O Puyo, new avatar
P2:47:17 <PuyoDead> yup
P2:47:19 <Snowman> What is it?
P2:47:26 <PuyoDead> you don't know who that is?
P2:47:29 <Snowman> No
P2:47:36 <PuyoDead> that makes me weep
P2:47:36 <citricsquid> they use IPB
P2:47:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, link me and I'll tell ya
P2:47:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh
P2:47:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> IPB is fine... kind of crapped out lately
P2:47:48 <Snowman> Puyo, I don't watch tv
P2:47:56 <PuyoDead> http://gbatemp.net/index.php?act=home
P2:48:03 <citricsquid> Not used IPB before, but didn't really like what I saw when I've been an end user, not really looked into it.
P2:48:05 <PuyoDead> beware, they are under heavy stress right now
P2:48:12 <PuyoDead> so it's going to be stupidslow
P2:48:22 <citricsquid> I had to use cache version to get on :D
P2:48:25 <citricsquid> (google cache)
P2:48:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, hold on I'll get you access to a site I used to admin
P2:48:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> you can play with the ACP tell me if you agree with me or citricsquid 
P2:48:49 <PuyoDead> yea, new pokemon games, scribblenauts, and mario & luigi 3 all came out within 2 days
P2:48:53 <PuyoDead> they're getting hammered
P2:49:21 <citricsquid> admin CP is fine to look at AlLnAtuRalX, but proper use is horrible.
P2:49:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Stop defending yourself and let the thing defend itself
P2:49:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, PMs.  PMs, PuyoDead 
P2:50:00 <citricsquid> oh I'm sorry for clarifying my point
P2:50:12 <citricsquid> I'll just let you assume exactly what I meant.
P2:50:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> You seemed to think it wouldn't stand up by itself
P2:50:26 <citricsquid> wat
P2:50:37 <Eagle> Mario & Luigi 3? Why was I not informed of this
P2:50:40 <Eagle> whyyy
P2:50:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Board version: 	3.0.0

P3:03:22 <Snowman> Citricsquid, I'm finally making the smilies
P3:03:42 <citricsquid> ;D
P3:05:39 <Snowman> You want pngs?
P3:06:21 <Snowman> Hello?
P3:06:25 <Snowman> citricsquid
P3:06:27 <citricsquid> plx
P3:06:29 <Snowman> k
P3:06:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> jpgs for images Snowman
P3:06:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or if citricsquid wants pngs, I hope he at least compresses them
P3:06:39 <Snowman> fuck you allnatural
P3:06:41 <Darke> Hai gais
P3:06:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Snowman, why?
P3:06:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> For images, JPGs are far better than PNGs
P3:06:54 <Snowman> cause jpeg fucks up images
P3:06:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not for text or screenshots though
P3:06:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, idiot.
P3:07:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just stop speaking, do the world a favor
P3:07:13 <Snowman> Also, I'm creating smilies
P3:07:14 <Eagle> .jpgs do fuck up images though
P3:07:21 <Eagle> .png is also very very small
P3:07:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I hate people who don't know what they're talking about, and speak like they do
P3:07:34 <Eagle> listen, .png is better
P3:07:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Eagle, only if you use a high compression
P3:07:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Eagle, it's lossless.  It's not.
P3:07:43 <PuyoDead> because most things will compress .jpg, which isn't needed
P3:07:50 <PuyoDead> with no compression, it's fine
P3:07:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Even with ~90% it's fine
P3:07:58 <PuyoDead> so really, it's just a matter of preference
P3:08:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> anything below that, not so much
P3:08:31 <PuyoDead> but, transparence in png gives it the advantage for me
P3:08:36 <PuyoDead> err, transparency
P3:08:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's true
P3:08:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you need transparency, then go png
P3:08:50 <Eagle> transparenc-E
P3:09:04 <PuyoDead> that's the next super version of transparency
P3:09:10 <TheOne> my mouse is dieing...
P3:09:10 <Eagle> They're smilies, unless they're giant square faces, of course you'll need .png :P
P3:09:17 <Eagle> er
P3:09:23 <Eagle> *you'll need transparency
P3:09:33 <Snowman> tbh, they are square :D
P3:09:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Case in point, wikipedia
P3:09:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Uses.  JPG.  For their logo.
P3:09:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> People who say JPG is not for images and PNG is better have shit for brains
P3:09:38 <Eagle> XD
P3:09:39 <PuyoDead> hah
P3:09:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Barring special cases like transparency ofc
P3:09:53 <Eagle> But .png is much more widely accepted
P3:09:57 <PuyoDead> png isn't all that hot with full high color pictures
P3:10:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Actually, it's not Eagle 
P3:10:14 <Eagle> sure apparently people who like them have shit for brains
P3:10:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Find me one camera that has a "PNG" setting on it
P3:10:15 <PuyoDead> tell that to IE
P3:10:42 <Eagle> but most people either used the screwed up .jpg with artifacts or they use .png without hassle
P3:10:43 <Snowman> Allnatural, that's because cameras take high res pictures
P3:10:58 <Snowman> save that in png and you wont be able to take loads of them
P3:10:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Holy.  Shit.  Get this guy out of here
P3:11:00 <PuyoDead> hence my earlier statement
P3:11:01 <Eagle> Plus they're just smilies x.x why are we debating
P3:11:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why would you save it in RAW then?
P3:11:11 <Eagle> debate club every night here
P3:11:19 <PuyoDead> for editing purposes
P3:11:24 <citricsquid> jpeg requires you to set the quality to get a good quality, png is good by default. I use png, saves me an extra option!
P3:11:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> No answer.  GTFO.
P3:11:39 <PuyoDead> professional photographers need RAW
P3:12:09 <Eagle> Snowman, they're squares? :/ Are they at least rounded squares?
P3:12:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Seriously.  What you were doing to the forums were tolerable up to this point, but to show complete lack of any sort of insight whatsoever and to speak authoritatively anyway is just something I despise
P3:12:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, does the P200 pack a PNG setting?
P3:12:33 <Eagle> Allnatural are you talking to citric?
P3:12:42 <PuyoDead> certainly not

P3:15:31 <PuyoDead> I'm not even through 2 yet
P3:15:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Esper lagged out there a little
P3:15:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> I cut out after my message

P3:16:13 <Marach> and where you will have to skip levels
P3:16:26 <Eagle> But we're going to have like 10 smilies, it's not like we're going to run out of space on the forum if we use .png

P3:16:54 <Snowman> Eagle
P3:17:00 <Snowman> the current smilies are pngs too
P3:17:08 <Eagle> Tell that to allnaturalx
P3:17:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, JPGs are MUCH better on bandwidth
P3:17:21 <Snowman> they currently are 15x15 though, now I'm making them 16x16
P3:17:24 <PuyoDead> wait, does IE still hate png?
P3:17:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> With your obsession with lightness and speed.  There is also no discernible quality-loss
P3:17:29 <Siiseli> oh dear, what I'm using is the only right choice and everyone else is an idiot
P3:17:33 <Siiseli> whoop
P3:17:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, I love PNG
P3:17:37 <Siiseli> said that 30 minutes too late
P3:17:38 <Siiseli> or something
P3:17:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fucking argue for it all the time :P
P3:17:42 <Marach> allnaturalx me too
P3:17:44 <Siiseli> oh wai
P3:17:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> But you use the right tool for the job
P3:17:48 <Siiseli> different conversation
P3:17:51 <Siiseli> same thing
P3:17:56 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, jpg for photos.
P3:17:57 <citricsquid> 1. I don't care about bandwidth. 2. I have no intention of using .png properly, the only reason they're up right now is because I used them for dev and haven't switched out the style sheet yet. 3. Why are you assuming snowman sending me .png is what I'll use on the forum?
P3:17:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Photos or pics should NEVER be done in png
P3:17:59 <Siiseli> png fore small images
P3:18:19 <citricsquid> furthermore, the size difference is TINY
P3:18:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, 1. MY bandwidth not yours.  Some people are still on 56k.  3. I'm not
P3:18:33 <citricsquid> lmao
P3:18:34 <citricsquid> lmao
P3:18:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> LMAO I LIVE IN THE UK AND SOME PEOPLE SUCK ASS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN S AMERICAN AND AFRIACE
P3:18:51 <citricsquid> so ~800 bytes and 1kb is a difference enough to care about?
P3:18:56 <Eagle> 56k? Why are you on irc
P3:18:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> THEY DONT DESERVE RIGHTS TO WEBSITES BECAUSE THEY HAVEC SHIT NET!
P3:19:04 <PuyoDead> I'd hardly consider a 16x16 image in ANY format a danger to 56k
P3:19:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have 30Mb/5Mb Eagle

P3:19:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some people I said
P3:19:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not always selfish reasons that I say what I say.
P3:19:35 <Eagle> But it's tiny little smilies
P3:19:47 <Eagle> with a incredibly hardly noticable size difference
P3:19:57 <PuyoDead> ok, point being, Snowman jumped on AlLnAtuRalX first
P3:20:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hold on let me scroll up
P3:20:17 <PuyoDead> but also, this is moot when dealing with 16x16
P3:20:20 <Snowman> I just said my experciences with jpegs showed me it fucked up my pictures
P3:20:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Snowman> cause jpeg fucks up images
P3:20:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Eagle> .jpgs do fuck up images though
P3:20:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Eagle> listen, .png is better
P3:20:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yay blanket statements!
P3:21:07 <PuyoDead> still, a simple "that's incorrect" would suffice

P3:22:39 <Eagle> allnaturalx this was before you told me that .jpgs are a little tiny bit smaller and if you try hard enough you can get them without artifacts maybe

P3:23:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> AlLnAtuRalX, ridding the world of idiots, one person at a time
P3:23:44 <PuyoDead> either way, at small sizes, png, jpg are essentially the same
P3:23:57 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX, being an umpty angsty teen dick, one channel at a time.
P3:24:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> True.  JPGs, do not, however, fuck up images
P3:24:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, being a lazy fuck with no drive, one day at a time
P3:24:14 <Eagle> Compression completely ruins them
P3:24:19 <PuyoDead> at no compression, no. that was the simple misconcpetion earlier
P3:24:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> 90% works fine
P3:24:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anything below that ruins them

P3:43:03 <Eagle> But anyway vede still insulted us which is a douche thing to do even though it's true
P3:43:08 <Eagle> but we still love him
P3:43:09 <Eagle> a little
P3:43:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, at least you're on a lot
P3:43:11 <Darke> So its probably XChat 2
P3:43:16 <vede> I did say it was full of assholes. Which isn't entirely true, but dealing with a single asshole is far more bad than dealing with a single nice person is good.
P3:43:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which is more than I can say for... all these other people
P3:43:17 <PuyoDead> yup, it is
P3:43:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Except PuyoDead
P3:43:25 <vede> ie. 1 asshole > 2 nice people
P3:43:30 <citricsquid> well

P4:23:20 <Snowman> WHere in Austria?
P4:23:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Kaprun
P4:23:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> It was in Zell am see
P4:23:36 <Snowman> Ah pretty close to where I go
P4:23:39 <AlexVMiner> I haven't left the country ever
P4:23:41 <AlexVMiner> :(
P4:23:44 <Snowman> I go to St. Johann am Tirol
P4:23:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> I went once... I think that's the trip I almost died on an off-pist in a crevace... Unpleasant shit right there
P4:24:00 <Iguana> Hm.
P4:24:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> The lake was amazing though :P
P4:24:05 <Iguana> TheOne, I have it now.
P4:24:12 <Iguana> But once it's opened, it closes.
P4:24:14 <Iguana> Automatically.
P4:24:21 <TheOne> same error?
P4:24:25 <Snowman> Allnatural, you going this year?
P4:24:29 <Iguana> No.
P4:24:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, we vary the location... Switzerland, France, Austria so probably not
P4:24:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P4:24:37 <Iguana> Wwith that IRCLib, it just auto closes.
P4:24:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah I typed before, sorry
P4:24:38 <Iguana> xD
P4:24:56 <TheOne> try running a bat file for it, should be an error
P4:24:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Snowman, currency is also an issue
P4:25:03 <Snowman> because?
P4:25:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Euro has a shit exchange rate with USD
P4:25:14 <Snowman> You're from USA?
P4:25:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Swiss frank, on the other hand... very nice
P4:25:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah
P4:25:29 <Snowman> Why do you go to Europe to ski? >.>
P4:25:30 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: you gotta compare prices of goods though...
P4:25:44 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: just because you get 100 of X for 1 Y, doesn't mean Y is actually worth more. :P
P4:25:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because they're the best mountains in the world besides Canada which is not as beautiful or cultured
P4:25:58 <Snowman> Oh
P4:26:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> liq3, the prices are outrageous also, in almost all places that use Eur
P4:26:09 <liq3> >.<
P4:26:25 <Snowman> I go to Austria cause they have loads of black pistes
P4:26:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just do powder so I'm fine with anywhere
P4:27:06 <liq3> powder?
P4:27:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Usually not far from slopes though, otherwise I get fucked like I did with that crevace
P4:27:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> As in fresh snow liq3, off the sloped
P4:27:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> slopes*
P4:27:33 <liq3> kk
P4:27:49 <Snowman> I used to do like speed races, but cba to do those anymore
P4:27:51 <Iguana> TheOne, how do I do that...
P4:28:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> kinda boring Snowman IMO at least
P4:28:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P4:28:15 <Snowman> Yeah so now I just go for the blacks
P4:28:19 <TheOne> new text file
P4:28:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> I would recommend you try off-pist, but use a guide as well as common sense when doing so :D
P4:28:35 <Iguana> Then?
P4:28:51 <Snowman> Yeah I've done off-piste a few times before
P4:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> guide as in a human not a paper
P4:29:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh god, I have done some extreme ones
P4:29:03 <TheOne> python cmss.py
P4:29:03 <TheOne> pause
P4:29:05 <Snowman> but you have to get a guide, which gets annoying
P4:29:07 <TheOne> 2 lines
P4:29:14 <TheOne> save as cmss.bat
P4:29:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> One of them took me four hours and went from summit to base in Zermatt
P4:30:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> I almost broke my fucking new skis also
P4:30:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> I mean, I'm trying not to get the bottom of these refinished because they won't glide as nicely
P4:30:39 <Snowman> Once I Broke my ski, had to go down on 1 ski with the other on my shoulder
P4:30:43 <PuyoDead> well, I'm off until tomorrow
P4:30:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I done worse
P4:30:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bye PuyoDead 
P4:30:55 <PuyoDead> more of that damn "real life"
P4:30:57 <TheOne> get it Iguana ?
P4:31:07 <Real> What about my life?
P4:31:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> One of my skis snapped on a rock once, off-pist... with deep, deep powder
P4:31:17 <Snowman> lol fail
P4:31:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I got it in a convoluted way
P4:31:32 <PuyoDead> it gets in the way of being lazy entirely too often
P4:31:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Step 1 - Ski to the nearest slope
P4:31:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Step 2 - Radio for brother
P4:31:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Step 3 - Adjust brother's bindings, ski with his skis back up while he waits
P4:31:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Step 4 - Get ski
P4:31:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Step 5 - Give my bro's skis back :P
P4:33:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyway, I'm off.  I'm going to Montauk for the weekend to stay at a four-star oceanside hotel that this conference is paying for.  Bye.  :P
