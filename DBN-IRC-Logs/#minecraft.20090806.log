P7:30:06 <Darkebrz> Heh
P7:30:08 <Darkebrz> Damn
P7:30:13 <Darkebrz> Cave Story is so much fun ^_^
P7:31:18 <liq3> Yes it is!
P7:31:45 <Darkebrz> I've played it once before, but was mortified when I was stuck with the MG!
P7:31:49 <Darkebrz> So, now I got the snake :D
P7:31:54 <liq3> lol.
P7:31:56 <liq3> I got the super gun. :P
P7:32:00 <Darkebrz> Spur
P7:32:04 <liq3> well, i got it second time round.
P7:32:09 <liq3> Maybe... the one that charges up.
P7:32:15 <Darkebrz> Then after this, I have to play the whole game again with the Spur!
P7:32:20 <liq3> hehe. :P
P7:32:20 <Darkebrz> Yeah, its the Spur
P7:32:23 <liq3> It totally rapes.
P7:32:33 <Darkebrz> But I'm planning on doing Sacred Ground
P7:32:40 <PuyoDead> good luck
P7:32:42 <liq3> Yeh, you need the spur for that don't you?
P7:32:45 <Darkebrz> I know >_>
P7:32:49 <Darkebrz> No, you don't
P7:32:57 <Darkebrz> You snake can go through walls, so it has its pluses
P7:33:02 <liq3> Yeh, I tried the real last boss fight... I gave up and just cheated to see the end cutscene <3
P7:33:16 <Darkebrz> Gah, I would never cheat at this game
P7:33:26 <Darkebrz> But I hate killing the sky dragons...
P7:33:27 <liq3> The only problem I really had with it was that i had to do the whole hell level everytime i lost to him, which was fucking annoying.
P7:33:39 <liq3> They needed a save point just before the real last boss. :/
P7:33:40 <Darkebrz> Killing sky dragons makes me want to cry ;_;
P7:34:16 <liq3> Oh i remember how i cheated, haha.
P7:34:25 <liq3> I gave myself infinite health with a memory editor. <3
P7:34:49 <Darkebrz> Okay, got the timer!
P7:34:52 <Darkebrz> Now for the rest of the game!
P7:35:01 <liq3> Darkebrz: I only cheat on badly designed games. i.e. not putting a save point right before the last boss.
P7:35:13 <Darkebrz> Meh
P7:35:25 <Darkebrz> You can't call Cave Story badly designed
P7:35:33 <liq3> It's not.
P7:35:35 <Darkebrz> Hell is supposed to be extremelly hard and annoying
P7:35:38 <liq3> It's just that ONE thing the maker screwed up.
P7:35:42 <Darkebrz> From what Ive heard
P7:35:50 <Darkebrz> Have you seen the new cave story sprites?
P7:35:59 <liq3> Darkebrz: It is. It takes 5-10 minutes to beat, assuming you don't die. If you die, you have to start all over again.
P7:36:07 <liq3> And I think I died like 20 times before I beat it first time.
P7:36:10 <liq3> or more.
P7:36:13 <Darkebrz> Haha
P7:36:49 <liq3> so, when i found out i had to do it ALL OVER AGAIN to fight the last boss again (which I should mention, is like 5x harder then hell), I was like, "FUCK YOU BITCH! I HATE YOU!"
P7:37:14 <Darkebrz> Hmm
P7:37:20 <Darkebrz> I forgot how to get the Nemesis...
P7:37:24 <liq3> All the guy needed was a save point right before the last boss. :(
P7:37:29 <liq3> but nooooooo.
P7:37:35 <Darkebrz> Ah, plantation
P7:37:36 <Darkebrz> Hm
P7:37:43 <liq3> Nemesis?
P7:37:45 <Darkebrz> liq3, I understand what he wanted to do
P7:37:52 <Darkebrz> If you saved before the last boss when low on health
P7:37:59 <Darkebrz> Then you were screwed and couldn't win!
P7:38:07 <Darkebrz> The Nemesis is the upgrade to the Sword
P7:38:09 <liq3> He could put a health thing there. :P
P7:38:25 <Darkebrz> Then that would make it to easy >_<
P7:38:34 <liq3> tho.
P7:38:37 <Darkebrz> Besides, you already have the life pot
P7:38:44 <liq3> anyone who saves on low hp right before the last boss is kinda stupid...
P7:38:47 <TrueWolves> Anyone want to request a minecraft skin?
P7:38:53 <Darkebrz> What if you didnt know?
P7:38:59 <liq3> you're doing hell. -_-
P7:39:14 <Darkebrz> How would you know your about to fight a boss?
P7:39:16 <liq3> the secret level that you probably found about by googling it.
P7:39:21 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P7:39:23 <liq3> and if you didn't you've probably beaten the game 4-5 times already.
P7:39:24 <Darkebrz> But still
P7:39:28 <liq3> and doing it again won't matter much. :P
P7:39:41 <Darkebrz> It would be a worse flaw if it was a save there, because then the damage is unrepairable
P7:39:46 <liq3> no
P7:39:47 <liq3> ...
P7:39:51 <liq3> the damage is unrepairable.
P7:39:53 <Darkebrz> Unless you hack
P7:39:57 <liq3> Ok, the real last boss.
P7:40:00 <Darkebrz> Which a normal user isnt able to
P7:40:10 <liq3> Is the kinda guy most ppl will need 20+ tries to beat.
P7:40:27 <Drakkar> lol
P7:40:32 <liq3> Doing hell (which takes 5-10 minutes) 20 times, is just fucking annoying.
P7:40:44 <liq3> Prince of persion make the same mistake.
P7:40:46 <Drakkar> obviously you've never played ecco
P7:40:49 <Darkebrz> Noob person (like me) who will only read how to get to hell > Gets to a save point on low health "YES!" > Realizes he has to fight the FINAL boss, needs more health > ...
P7:40:53 <liq3> They put a fucking hard boss right after a 5 minute chase bit.
P7:41:13 <Darkebrz> >.<
P7:41:24 <liq3> Darkebrz: It's still better then having to do hell 20 times.
P7:41:36 <liq3> Dude, you don't understand how hard hell is do you?
P7:41:53 <liq3> You ever played N?
P7:42:05 <PuyoDead> Hell is Hell
P7:42:23 <Darkebrz> I have played N
P7:42:36 <PuyoDead> best I've done is the second form of the end
P7:42:56 <liq3> PuyoDead: Not putting a save before a really hard boss is an acceptable design mistake. :/
P7:43:02 <liq3> accepted*
P7:43:02 <Darkebrz> And I do not understand how hard it is
P7:43:02 <PuyoDead> hah
P7:43:11 <liq3> Unless you want to be a bitch and drive 95% of the playerbase away.
P7:43:21 <PuyoDead> it's about 50x harder than anything else in the game
P7:43:23 <Darkebrz> But it is a game breaking flaw to be stuck in a spot where you cant do anything
P7:43:32 <liq3> Darkebrz: You can restart.
P7:43:37 <Darkebrz> YES
P7:43:38 <Darkebrz> OKAY
P7:43:41 <Darkebrz> PLAY THE WHOLE GAME
P7:43:44 <liq3> Honestly, it's probably faster to restart, beat the entire game again, then trying to beat hell 20+ times.
P7:43:45 <Darkebrz> Then restart
P7:43:49 <Darkebrz> Hehe

P10:45:25 <LG_Legacy> Next: Twitter, the massive scare.

P10:45:38 <vede> Then Facebook and MySpace.
P10:46:12 <vede> Then eighty percent of the teenagers in the civilized world will kill themselves.
P10:46:19 <Dudebro> Thank god.

P11:02:30 <flyboy> Hi guys, Why are the forum and wiki down?
P11:02:32 <flyboy> Just joking
P11:02:57 <flyboy> But how do I portforward if my router isn't on portforward.com?
P11:03:50 <PuyoDead> you have a router not on that list? that's impressive
P11:03:58 <flyboy> Yep
P11:04:10 <flyboy> Netcomm something-or-other
P11:04:17 <flyboy> It just isn'ton that list.
P11:04:20 <flyboy> :(
P11:04:34 <flyboy> So do I need to port forward to connect to my own server?
P11:04:38 <citricsquid> the instructions are interchangeable, just follow as best possible, it's mainly just finding the right page on router settings
P11:04:40 <flyboy> Or to run a server?
P11:04:46 <flyboy> Ok
P11:04:53 <PuyoDead> to connect to your own? no. to get others to connect? yes
P11:04:58 <citricsquid> for external sourced outside of your pc to access a server, you need to port forward.

P11:05:20 <Setveen> is there way to port forward if i dont know my router password or account?
P11:05:25 <PuyoDead> so long as you can get into your router settings, it's fairly easy
P11:05:35 <PuyoDead> if you can't get into it, nupe

P11:06:40 <Setveen> yes
P11:06:44 <Setveen> right in front of me
P11:06:54 <PuyoDead> did someone else set the password or something?

P11:07:01 <PuyoDead> ahhhh
P11:07:10 <PuyoDead> yea, there's not really anything to be done about that
P11:07:18 <Setveen> wrote it on a paper, two years later, paper is gone

P11:08:17 <LG_Legacy> Oh cool..
P11:08:20 <LG_Legacy> Steam friends are up
P11:08:25 <Setveen> pretty much, unless i find that paper
P11:08:44 <PuyoDead> if that's the case (and he doesn't care about it being reset), do a factory default reset
P11:09:01 <PuyoDead> 'course, you'd lose any settings currently in it
P11:09:08 <Setveen> what would that do? anything bad?
P11:09:14 <PuyoDead> nah, it'd still work fine
P11:09:26 <PuyoDead> but if you use security now, you'd have to set it again
P11:09:36 <Setveen> would my internet go down for a bit?
P11:09:49 <Setveen> i dont think i have any security
P11:09:54 <PuyoDead> and if there were any special settings before (port forwarding, for example), they'd need to be reset
P11:10:04 <PuyoDead> yea, it'll take the network down for a bit
P11:10:25 <Setveen> bout how long?
P11:10:27 <PuyoDead> it'll be like taking it out of the box again
P11:10:41 <Setveen> so how do i do all of this
P11:10:42 <PuyoDead> y'know, I'm not sure, but no longer than a few minutes, I'd guess
P11:11:02 <PuyoDead> there -should- be a button on the back for it you'd have to hold down. you might want to look it up
P11:11:28 <Setveen> ummm.. ill look
P11:11:41 <PuyoDead> and by button, I mean a little bitty, probably have to hit it with a paper clip button
P11:12:02 <Setveen> a reset hole?
P11:12:08 <Setveen> i have that
P11:12:18 <PuyoDead> yea, should be a button in there
P11:12:25 <PuyoDead> what router is it?
P11:12:44 <Setveen> so once i press that, how do i get a new account and password?
P11:12:56 <Setveen> linksys
P11:13:24 <Setveen> Linksys WRT54GR
P11:13:58 <PuyoDead> find something small enough to hit it, and hold it for like 15 seconds or so
P11:14:15 <PuyoDead> after that, it'll have the default name/pass
P11:14:23 <Setveen> which is?
P11:14:24 <PuyoDead> which should be n: blank p: admin
