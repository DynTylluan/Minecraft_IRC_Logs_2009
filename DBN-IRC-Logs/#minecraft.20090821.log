P4:31:46 <08Notch> Not having this argument again.
P4:31:53 <vede> There was no argument!
P4:31:58 <vede> Well, there was, but it was short.
P4:32:04 <Griskard> Modding?
P4:32:08 <vede> Yeh.
P4:32:08 <Eagle> What was his opinion 'last time'?
P4:32:10 <Griskard> Is AWESOME
P4:32:13 <Eagle> *your
P4:32:26 <vede> Eagle: Can make new gamemodes and such, but can't make new blocks.
P4:32:34 <Eagle> Oh. I see.
P4:32:36 <vede> Or customize blocks.
P4:32:44 <mail2345> wait wat
P4:32:49 <mail2345> no customizing blocks
P4:33:01 <mail2345> so no still lava
P4:33:01 <vede> Which I just don't see the logic in.
P4:33:01 <mail2345> or watervators
P4:33:04 <AlexVMiner> i just pulled more skin off my shoulder
P4:33:04 <mail2345> or portals
P4:33:10 <Griskard> With LUA. shouldnt anyone be able to make new blocks IF they know how to mod a bit?
P4:33:18 <08Notch> you can code custom behavior for blocks, yes. You can't replace the graphics.
P4:33:24 <mail2345> ahh, thx for clearing that up
P4:33:28 <Eagle> you could say that portals are just water
P4:33:30 <AlexVMiner> grisk, you can edit blocks now
P4:33:31 <Eagle> Yeah what notch said
P4:33:33 <vede> Okay, but why?
P4:33:39 <AlexVMiner> others can't see it, though
P4:33:42 <08Notch> I'm not having this argument again, vede
P4:34:01 <vede> Dude.
P4:34:01 <mail2345> screw it, i'm scanning my logger
P4:34:01 <vede> I'm just asking WHY.
P4:34:01 <mail2345> for the argument
P4:34:01 <08Notch> i told you why last time.
P4:34:08 <vede> Because you like your screenshots?
P4:34:17 <AlexVMiner> vede...
P4:34:19 <mail2345> notch, to speed things up, can you give me a segment of the convo to scan for
P4:34:19 <Griskard> Hey Notch, with Lua, in theory, couldn't I change the graphics anyway?
P4:34:21 <AlexVMiner> SHUSH
P4:34:24 <mail2345> no girs
P4:34:29 <mail2345> Lua is server side
P4:34:30 <08Notch> no, gris, it's server-side
P4:34:38 <AlexVMiner> griskard, you can edit the blocks now
P4:34:51 <Griskard> Ahh, the only experience I have is with Python. So I really dont know anything
P4:34:55 <vede> It seems pointless.
P4:35:03 <mail2345> lua is as easy as python
P4:35:12 <Griskard> Im just trying to get a team together who wants to mod. Ill just feed the money :p
P4:35:15 <vede> To allow people to change every single thing about the game, except textures.
P4:35:23 <AlexVMiner> look:
P4:35:24 <AlexVMiner> http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z61/ninjachuck385/TORTERRA-1.png
P4:35:30 <08Notch> you won't be able to change every single thing.
P4:35:37 <vede> And now you even say you can change the way the blocks BEHAVE, but they'll always have to look the same.
P4:35:41 <bombadil> ok did a test call...
P4:35:43 <Evil-Ville> Hey vede shut up
P4:35:45 <bombadil> with Magic Jack
P4:35:53 <vede> Hey Evil-Ville, no.
P4:35:54 <08Notch> haha, awesome, AlexVMiner =D
P4:35:55 <AlexVMiner> cool
P4:35:57 <bombadil> verdict so far: sucks.
P4:36:04 <Griskard> Thats interesting, hehe
P4:36:05 <AlexVMiner> Zuriki told me how to...
P4:36:07 <bombadil> 4 second delay
P4:36:11 <Griskard> At first I was like "OMG THATS HUGE"
P4:36:21 <Griskard> And then eventuallly I saw the lighter outline :p
P4:36:28 <bombadil> oh wait i have bittorrent on
P4:36:33 <AlexVMiner> only 5x5
P4:36:33 <mail2345> okay, Notch did say to keep screenies consistent.
P4:36:48 <vede> We can change the fundamental gameplay of Minecraft, but not change textures.
P4:36:57 <vede> It seems like a pointless restriction.
P4:37:13 <AlexVMiner> let's make an air block that makes sand fly everywhere
P4:37:15 <08Notch> you're entitled to think so, but reiterating that isn't going to make me change my mind.
P4:37:18 <Griskard> Really, its Notches game, and your just another piece of shit like me, and considering how its free atm, Just shut up...
P4:37:31 <vede> What the hell?
P4:37:51 <AlexVMiner> but whatever i say notch puts in the game
P4:37:52 <AlexVMiner> :D
P4:37:54 <mail2345> anyway, there are practicalilty issues with sending images
P4:38:06 <Eagle> vede, if he's allowing modding the game, he's allowing modding the functions of blocks.
P4:38:08 <mail2345> such asn bandwith
P4:38:10 <Griskard> Thats because your AlexfrikkinV Miner
P4:38:12 <mail2345> and*
P4:38:17 <mail2345> as*
P4:38:18 <vede> mail2345, yeah, that's why we couldn't make custom skins, right?
P4:38:24 <Eagle> I don't think it has to do with him saying "NO WAI YOU CAN'T CHANGE ONLY THE GRAPHICS"
P4:38:27 <mail2345> ugh, the skins come from
P4:38:33 <vede> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
P4:38:33 <mail2345> minecraft.net server
10P4:38:36 * Sl1N0 (Nilsoinas@dsl-roibrasgw1-feb8dc00-106.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
P4:38:38 <vede> But it proves that it can be done.
P4:38:42 <Snowman> Oh btw Notch, We need a pickaxe made out of your beard.
P4:38:43 <vede> The texture file is TINY.
P4:38:48 <vede> It's smaller than the level.
P4:38:56 <AlexVMiner> lol snowman
P4:38:57 <Eagle> It's not that he's restricting you from changing the graphics, he's letting you change everything besides the graphics. :P
P4:38:59 <Eagle> If that made sense.
P4:39:08 <Griskard> Speaking of which, Notch, just a question, whats the biggest map I can make?
P4:39:11 <08Notch> Snowman: I trimmed it a couple of days ago, but didn't keep any :-(
P4:39:12 <AlexVMiner> same thing eagle
P4:39:15 <vede> Which is why I'm confused by this.
P4:39:16 <Snowman> :O
P4:39:17 <Eagle> In other words, be happy with what you got
P4:39:21 <Snowman> YOU HAVE NO MORE BEARD?
P4:39:22 <Griskard> I cant use OME, to create superbig stuff, it blows in my face

P7:59:52 <LG_Legacy> Router blocks things half of the time.
P8:00:01 <bombadil> not_famous: what i said is true. it works well. but if you are putting load on your internet line it lags (i.e. downloading). otherwise the quality is great. everyone i've called says it sounds the exact same as a normal phone. i sometimes get a bit of digital-ness to people's voices (does that make sense?).
P8:00:04 <Xeros> Hmmm... well I hate Mac so bad because it.. doesn't make sense to me.. where can I find if a firewall is active?
P8:00:12 <liq3> Legacy: Router shouldn't be blocking if he's trying to connect. Router's only usually cause problems when trying to host.
P8:00:19 <bombadil> not_famous: i'm sending mine back only because i discovered that it is in fact NOT possible to get a Canadian phone number yet :(

P8:24:24 <Eagle> I hate those ads. :/
P8:24:31 <bombadil> agree
P8:24:48 <Not_Famous> Selling Minecraft with cube bewbz
P8:24:52 <Eagle> I especially hate the EVONY ads
P8:25:00 <Xeros> I hate the Evony ads that are like "PLAY IN SECRET" "GET THE PRINCESS"... but I love the game lol.
P8:25:01 <Quatroking> I just ordered two 3D glasses through ebay
P8:25:04 <Quatroking> guess how much I paid
P8:25:17 <Eagle> 599 US DOLLARS?
P8:25:21 <Quatroking> 3 dollers including shipment and handling :P
P8:25:28 <bombadil> okay, howabout that "welcome my lord" or whatever ads, for some online game? it has a painting of an elf woman with huge cleavage. now, another version has started going around and the painting has been replaced with a porn model. 
P8:25:31 <bombadil> not subtle at all
P8:25:50 <Xeros> I only started playing because it said "Free Forever!".. in fact it did have items for real money, luckily you could obtain any pay item without money though
P8:26:08 <bombadil> omg, you clicked that ad and used their game?
P8:26:30 <Xeros> I'm actually addicted to the game.. it's like a mix of Age of Empires and....idk what else lol
P8:26:35 <bombadil> liar, you were hoping for more extreme cleavage
P8:26:54 <LG_Legacy> I can probably find more cleavage
P8:27:02 <LG_Legacy> -seeks-
P8:27:23 <Xeros> No but you should see the stuff that comes out of peoples mouths in that game when they're new... "You can have sex in this game?"

P8:28:25 <AlexVMiner> should i get the water bottle across the room?

P8:29:04 <bombadil> i wouldn't bother to shut the comp down. just flee, tipping furniture, pets, etc over behind you to slow pursuit.
P8:29:13 <Xeros> lmao
P8:29:19 <LG_Legacy> Amazing

P8:31:20 <AlexVMiner> should i investigate?
P8:31:34 <AlexVMiner> it is a plastic one

P8:32:20 <Xeros> When I was a kid I was interested in both Magick and Psychics lol.... had a semi-bad experience attempting psychics
P8:32:27 <Quatroking> everytime I look in the mirror I beat my wife

P8:33:01 <bombadil> probably never even touched a breast
P8:33:03 <Griskard> I just found a sardine in my oyster
P8:33:07 <Xeros> I was just trying to make a "psi ball" haha... and for some reason I got sick immediately and started throwing up nothing, dry heaving... for like ever.
P8:33:19 <AlexVMiner> he probably touched his own man breast at the most
P8:33:25 <bombadil> jeez way to suck at psi balls :P

P8:33:51 <AlexVMiner> brb
P8:34:08 <Xeros> After closer thought, I realized I was not taking energy from around me.. I had my hands up near my stomache and was probably taking energy from...MYSELF.... give me a senso bean :P
P8:34:19 <AlexVMiner> okay
P8:34:21 <AlexVMiner> nothing
P8:34:23 <bombadil> xeros: the trick is that making a psi ball with your own bodily energy will deplete you. if you build a psi ball out of divine energy you aren't depleted, in fact your body is energized by the energy moving through you
P8:34:46 <Eagle> Are you guys seriously talking about energy balls?
P8:34:48 <bombadil> ah so you realized your error !
P8:34:59 <Xeros> Yeah I know. And yes we are lol...
P8:35:12 <Eagle> You guys know that whole website is a joke, right?
P8:35:18 <bombadil> what website?

P8:36:22 <Xeros> I did a "warmth" spell, and I'm very convinced it works, and it still works for me. You'd think that'd motivate me to try out ore but... I can't afford candles and oils and...fairy dust wherever you get that... seriously.
P8:36:23 <bombadil> Eagle: you assume your knowledge is complete. a very foolish mistake
P8:36:40 <bombadil> xeros: stay away from that kinda crap

P8:38:52 <Eagle> Guys just to let you know
P8:38:59 <Eagle> Magic doesn't exist in real life. O.o
P8:39:10 <bombadil> Eagle: depends what your definition of magic is
P8:39:23 <Eagle> I have a broad definition of magic
P8:39:31 <bombadil> if you were to show a computer to a person 500 years ago, they would think it's magic. even a television
P8:39:35 <Eagle> As in 'anything that is not actually possible'
P8:39:46 <Eagle> you can't create fire
P8:39:48 <Eagle> I'm sorry
P8:39:52 <bombadil> what's magic to one person is science to another
P8:39:57 <Eagle> Well you can with tools and crap
P8:40:02 <Xeros> You mean anything that we actually don't know if it is possible or not :p
P8:40:06 <Eagle> You can't just suddenly spawn fire.
P8:40:12 <bombadil> Eagle: who here is claiming to cast fire ball lvl 33 ?
P8:40:15 <Xeros> lmfao
P8:40:18 <Eagle> Warmth spells
P8:40:20 <Eagle> Same thing
P8:40:30 <bombadil> Eagle: i don't know what a warmth spell is. 
P8:40:33 <Eagle> All you are doing is concentrating your blood to your palm or something

P8:40:46 <Xeros> Hey.. the warmth spell was the only thing that worked for me! Whether it was similar to a placebo effect I dunno.. but it continues to work for me to this day
P8:40:53 <Xeros> and no it warms my entire body
P8:41:04 <bombadil> have you tried checking with a thermometer, xeros?
P8:41:05 <Eagle> Placebo effect = mind trick
P8:41:12 <mail2345> science can be objectivly proved
P8:41:14 <Griskard> Yeah, so does opening your blood vessels
P8:41:17 <mail2345> magic cannot\
P8:41:21 <Griskard> Which is what a warmth spell is
10P8:41:22 * TheOne-afk is now known as TheOne
P8:41:33 <Xeros> No I haven't, not only do I not have one but you know, it might not be 'real heat', but it sure warms me up.
P8:41:34 <Griskard> The one, your lava server was lavard
P8:41:41 <TheOne> huh?
P8:41:53 <Griskard> Its opening your blood vessels further
P8:41:54 <Griskard> Nothing else
P8:42:05 <Griskard> Your the one with the lava sevrer right?
P8:42:06 <Testvan> is it engorged
P8:42:12 <TheOne> yes
P8:42:39 <bombadil> the correct definition of magick is: Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will. -- if i desire to make a cup of tea, i boil the water and follow the necessary steps to do so. i have then performed a magickal act of creating a cup of tea. seems mundane? it is, if you know how to make tea
P8:42:41 <Xeros> No I actually think it's not even real heat, I believe more that it is a "mind trick" but it's a very useful mind trick indeed. I've walked around comfortably shirtless in the winter, it was cool
P8:42:50 <bombadil> when you bring you car to be fixed at a shop, you get it fixed by a car magician
P8:42:52 <Xeros> or should I say... "warm"... aah hah hah hah ...no jk lol
P8:43:00 <Real> alright it's getting annoying... people must stop using the word "real"... spell it wrong or abbreviate it or something

P8:44:38 <Real> Don't care.
P8:44:49 <Eagle> Have fun with your flashing irc
P8:44:49 <bombadil> for real, he doesn't care
P8:44:55 <Real> Weak.
P8:44:58 <Xeros> So yeah, even if the warmth spell is just a mind trick, it works well and I'd like to discover more mind tricks. I can tell you that I surely cannot make a cold spell of any sort lol. The warmth sell by the way, is simply a phrase while thinking of a source of heat.
P8:44:58 <Eagle> He's not being very realistic
P8:45:03 <bombadil> oh get real, dude.
P8:45:05 <Testvan> permission to rhyme

P8:45:34 <Eagle> Why do you need permission
P8:45:41 <bombadil> because it's FORBIDDEN
P8:45:46 <Eagle> ...
P8:45:53 <Griskard> The warmth sell by the way, is simply a phrase while thinking of a source of heat.

P8:46:13 <Griskard> Simply concentrating on any source of heat...

P8:46:19 <Not_Famous> @_@
P8:46:20 <bombadil> those are half rhymes
P8:46:43 <Real> fly like an eagle
P8:46:48 <Eagle> to the seeeaa
P8:46:55 <Xeros> But the thing is, if I simply alone concentrate on a source of heat it doesn't work for me. If I concentrate on something cold it doesn't make me cold either.
P8:47:03 <Eagle> time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
P8:47:05 <Real> michael vick is an eagle now, crazy
P8:47:08 <Eagle> into the futuuuure
P8:47:28 <Eagle> Real crazy
P8:47:49 <Eagle> I can't believe he's really changing teams
P8:48:12 <Xeros> The phrase sounds silly actually, but yeah, it goes "I am warm, as warm as fire. All this warmth is my desire." It could be the words but if I change them to fit cooling it still won't work.
P8:48:15 <Real> one bird to another -- first a falcon now an eagle
P8:48:36 <Eagle> I've never heard that saying before. Real nice though.
P8:48:51 <bombadil> Xeros: the trick there is that it works because you believe it will.
P8:48:54 <Real> now you're just being a jackass
P8:48:59 <Eagle> :P
P8:49:02 <Eagle> Sorry?
P8:49:14 <bombadil> but if you test it with a thermometer, it probably won't show temperature change
P8:49:15 <Eagle> Real sorry, man.
P8:49:22 <Eagle> (Okay I'll stop.)
P8:49:24 <Real> man wtf come on
P8:49:26 <Xeros> Well I have to admit, I believe it works because it does work. I'm not sure exactly how much I believed in it when I first used it.
P8:49:30 <Eagle> ;D
P8:49:34 <bombadil> maybe a tiny bit, but of course it's possible for the mind to concsiously increase metabolism to generate internal heat
P8:49:36 <bombadil> it's an old trick
P8:49:48 <Eagle> Xeros your mind is very easily swayed
P8:49:49 <bombadil> Tibetan yoga of inner heat
P8:49:51 <Xeros> Is that why I'm so skinny? :P
P8:50:06 <bombadil> these yogis go into the snowy mountains and meditate in the snow,naked. they melt all the snow around them
P8:50:10 <Xeros> Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Willi...I mean Eagle
P8:50:22 <Eagle> If you can get yourself to believe that you're warm
P8:50:33 <bombadil> several feet in diameter, melted snow
P8:50:44 <Eagle> Your brain is very susceptible to suggestion
P8:50:58 <bombadil> Eagle you're right, but the tricky part is that the body follows the mind
P8:51:18 <Xeros> Any explanation as to why I can't make myself feel cool? lol. I even tried making up an even sillier phrase "I am cold, as cold as ice. All this cold makes me feel nice." xD
P8:51:28 <bombadil> it's funny because you and Xeros are both in fact correct
P8:51:40 <Eagle> Unless his body doesn't actually feel warm and his brain is just making up the information that his nerves aren't giving it

P9:01:29 <Snowman> So he said the name of everyone in this chat and got instant banned?
P9:01:34 <Griskard> yep
P9:01:44 <Eagle> bans only last for a couple of days though
P9:01:47 <Eagle> right citric?
P9:01:49 <Griskard> Is saying "Notch" over and over again while he is trying to work bannable?
P9:02:02 <Snowman> And why does that command exist?
P9:02:06 <Eagle> If he's on the chat he's not working :)
P9:02:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> saying anything over and over again is going to get you in trouble.
P9:02:08 <Xeros> *sniff* I wish Minecraft Multiplayer would work for me.... I want to play it so baaad 
P9:02:08 <citricsquid> Snowman: I have IRC set to alert me and so do most people, so most people he named just got "DING" for no reason.
P9:02:18 <citricsquid> I'll unban him in a few mins, just annoyed me D:
P9:02:22 <Real> what free IRC programs are everyone using?
P9:02:23 <TheOne> lol

P9:02:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't. so i don't have to deal with it.
P9:02:44 <Snowman> but I just think that it's a weird command to say everyone's name
P9:02:50 <Snowman> What's the use of that
P9:02:51 <Real> how's chatzilla, griskard?
10P9:02:51 * citricsquid sets mode: -b *!*@S01060012172da1d3.wp.shawcable.net

P9:03:02 <Snowman> I have ChatZilla too btw
P9:03:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> the use of that is to piss people off.
P9:03:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> or annoy people so they want to ban him.
P9:03:14 <Real> well how is it anyway? any issues?
P9:03:15 <Snowman> Yeah but why is it coded in the server?
P9:03:27 <citricsquid> Snowman: it's a client side command isn't it?

P9:04:56 <mail2345> how do you setup name alarms
P9:04:56 <Xeros> Maybe they should have an anti-ding... be like "unding Xeros" and the ding shall play backwards... and all flashing will stop.. idk I'm just kidding lol
P9:05:04 <Real> does Chatzilla go nuts when someone says your nick? if so can it be turned off?

P9:06:46 <citricsquid> Bradness: aeras the archives will be opensource when mc hits beta, currently there aren't any.
P9:06:56 <Griskard> mIRC has always been free
P9:06:56 <Eagle> XChat isn't free anymore. :/
P9:07:01 <Veronika> I think mIRC was always pay to use, but it lets you use it indefinitely.

P9:26:23 <shawnachu> What.
P9:26:26 <Daidoji> why is that important you ask? well you need olive oil to make compasses

P9:26:40 <shawnachu> olive oil for compasses?
P9:26:41 <Griskard> Its super realistic

P9:26:53 <Griskard> It takes 24 hours to craft plate armour
P9:26:57 <Xeros> Yeah I hate Mac, I can't even find if it has servers. If it were Windows I could easily, but Mac is like so not complicated it's complicated lol

P9:29:05 <Xeros> I have to say that Minecraft is one of the best things I've ever played(at least single player x.x). Exploring the randomly generated world is amazing, finding hidden caverns and barely visible tunnels... and then digging up to look over a huge forest.
P9:29:06 <Griskard> And do not try and outrun a fucking bear
P9:29:07 <Eagle> Slowly die
