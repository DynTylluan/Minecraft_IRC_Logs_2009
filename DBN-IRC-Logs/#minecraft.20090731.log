A12:15:50 <Visiiri> Slow internet tonight.
A12:16:05 <Visiiri> I want to start a server, but I'm out of ideas :(
A12:17:47 <Visiiri> ...Perhaps...
A12:18:53 <Visiiri> Would you play on a large flat server devided into four by admin blocks. In each of the fourths, there would be either Water, Sand, Grass, or Snow.

A12:21:14 <Parthon> I would, but I'm a minecraft slut :P
A12:23:22 <Daidoji> that sounds kind of boring
A12:23:43 <Daidoji> I've been having fun generating random stuff with omen though
A12:24:14 <Daidoji> http://ilm.johnnythemidget.com/image/mcgentest4.png
A12:24:18 <Daidoji> a doomsday pocket of lava.
A12:24:31 <Parthon> tomeout on that address

A12:25:04 <Daidoji> can you get dcc
A12:25:15 <Parthon> well, actually, I'm from australia :P
A12:25:15 <Daidoji> actually it is a problem with the hosting company
A12:25:18 <Daidoji> they said they were gonna fix it

A12:26:47 <Parthon> it looks like a failed dns propagation
A12:26:50 <Daidoji> yeah I love the 'mountain' mode in Omen
A12:27:08 <Daidoji> it makes some nice flat valleys
A12:27:15 <Daidoji> and nice mountainy...well uh mountains.
A12:28:22 <Daidoji> hey did anyone know the setting off hand to connect to larger maps
A12:28:42 <Daidoji> I mean I can connect to huge maps, but a few of my friends can't. I don't remember changing anything in java.
A12:28:47 <Daidoji> I do have 4gb of ram though.
A12:28:58 <Daidoji> I mean huge as in over the 17m block 'limit'
A12:29:13 <Daidoji> I made a 512x512x256 for example and I connected okay

A12:31:08 <mail2345> the number after it
A12:31:11 <mail2345> increase that
A12:31:20 <Daidoji> is that just server  though?
A12:31:22 <Daidoji> I did that already
A12:31:24 <Daidoji> I mean for clients
A12:32:28 <Daidoji> unless that someone tells the clients to use that much and if they can't maybe it just black screens? I know it's a memory thing since setting it back to a normal size map they connect fine.
A12:32:42 <mail2345> ahh, tell the users
A12:32:54 <mail2345> to dl the html file for minecraft and edit that in.

A12:51:49 <LG_Legacy> Basically, find the needle in the hat stack.
A12:51:54 <Daveisawesome> yep
A12:52:11 <Daveisawesome> but more challenging because everyone is creating tunnels all over the place
A12:52:25 <LG_Legacy> And if you win?
A12:52:29 <Daveisawesome> i dunno
A12:52:36 <LG_Legacy> I hope i win a cookie
A12:52:44 <LG_Legacy> Reminds me
A12:52:47 <Daveisawesome> by the time game modes are implimented, who knows what reward system will be in place

A1:13:00 <mail2345> hmm, i see how you could do that mode.
A1:13:23 <mail2345> actually, it would be very easy assuming that notch has a random underground
A1:13:30 <mail2345> tile function for use with ores.

A2:40:00 <Daveisawesome> i could pretty easily convert it to the one servers use if i felt like mapping out the serialized data
A2:40:01 <Forch> Well, not start it, but connect.

A2:43:54 <Forch> God damnit I got to connect, but it says Illegal Name
A2:47:07 <aera> Forch: that means your authentication is wrong
A2:47:16 <aera> refresh the minecraft.net page

A2:54:04 <Daveisawesome> yeah, i know its nasty
A2:54:37 <Daveisawesome> im guessing you already tried comparing empty maps of varying sizes in a hex editor?
A2:54:39 <Daveisawesome> im about to
A2:54:53 <Daveisawesome> if i find a pattern i might persue doing it
A2:54:55 <Daveisawesome> :p
A2:57:21 <aera> Daveisawesome: tbh, I didn't bother, my map ripper uses my own server's format
A2:57:36 <Daveisawesome> yeah
A2:57:38 <aera> but I will eventually make it spit out PNGs
A2:57:41 <aera> 'cause that's easy
A2:57:43 <Daveisawesome> i might do it though
A2:58:06 <aera> if you figure it out, I'd love to know some pointers
A2:58:11 <Daveisawesome> :p
A2:58:12 <aera> it's a nasty serialised java class
A2:58:40 <Daveisawesome> yeah
A2:58:55 <Daveisawesome> i hate serialized java
A2:59:15 <Daveisawesome> not a single interpreter for it anywhere
A2:59:36 <aera> well, at least it's documented

A7:47:02 <ez> since you dont see it now, u can only guess from changed titles..
A7:47:12 <citricsquid> yeah, and some normal members have diff titles.
A7:47:30 <ez> yep
A7:47:52 <ez> oh and a thought on that, you and notch and robot should have even another colour?
A7:48:34 <citricsquid> I'll probably just have a mod colour and give Notch a different colour, I keep getting asked about the game, people think I made it, it'd be better if I'm just seen as a moderator and notch as the creator :P
A7:48:45 <ez> and now u only see moderators in each forum, u cant see the names of admins, is there anywhere to put that nicely? except in user list when u search for admins?
A7:48:58 <citricsquid> oh I could add myself there, I'll do that now.
A7:49:01 <ez> citricsquid: smart move, that sounds good
A7:49:26 <citricsquid> there, I show on the list now :P
A7:49:31 <PuyoDead> excellence
A7:49:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: Mod colors is an extremely bad idea
A7:49:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> And I mean extremely bad
A7:50:13 <PuyoDead> how so?
A7:50:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: Were you there when Reddit tried it?
A7:50:31 <PuyoDead> nope
A7:50:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> I swear there was such a huge backlash that two of the top 5 submitters left for good
A7:50:51 <PuyoDead> I... don't see why, though
A7:50:58 <ez> why?
A7:51:00 <citricsquid> yes, but why?
A7:51:06 <peerkoel> but, why?
A7:51:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because at first they were talking to mods as equals, but then when the colors were introducted, all of the people started acting differently among mods
A7:51:11 <citricsquid> =D
A7:51:22 <citricsquid> so how did people identify mods?
A7:51:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Consistent with my broom metaphor, they didn't want a crown, they mainly didn't even ask for mod
A7:51:30 <ez> I mean, alternatively we could just have something under the title stating "Moderator" but that makes it kinda cluttered
A7:51:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> they wanted to be treated as equals
A7:51:32 <peerkoel> among mods or towards mods?
A7:51:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> With the old system, and after Reddit got rid of colors
A7:51:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> people have to view the mod list for a specific subreddit
A7:51:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> tthere's no custom colors, titles, anything
A7:52:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Now though, there's a distinguish button to change the name colors if mods need to speak with authority
A7:52:10 <ez> oh ok
A7:52:11 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/3ap3q9q3w_modideas.jpg
A7:52:11 <PuyoDead> that's mighty bizzare
A7:52:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> but it's not used in regular conversation
A7:52:21 <citricsquid> They were my ideas on how to show mods, a little icon next to a post.
A7:52:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: My favorite redditor left because of it
A7:52:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> kleinbl00
A7:52:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
A7:52:40 <PuyoDead> I've been in a few communites with colored names, and I've never seen anything even close to that
A7:52:41 <citricsquid> numbers in name, instafag.
A7:52:50 <PuyoDead> that seems like a terribly immature reaction
A7:53:01 <ez> well, I wouldn't mind a colour name, but I wouldn't mind it staying as it is now either, since you CAN find mods if you want to
A7:53:01 <citricsquid> + reddit != forum
A7:53:26 <ez> so count me vote as neutral lol
A7:53:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I don't think it'll make a difference here, because the community is not as..... distinguished as that of rREddit, to say the least
A7:53:31 <ez> my vote*
A7:53:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> (looking at General Discussion)
A7:53:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> But I still don't think it's right to put mods in a separate group as regular users
A7:53:51 <PuyoDead> plus, reddit is about, oh, 50,000 times larger, or so
A7:53:51 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/3ap3q9q3w_modideas.jpg Which of those is best then? (top 3 = potential mod ideas, bottom is normal user)
A7:54:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> My vote is for leave it as is
A7:54:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A7:54:29 <citricsquid> how do people identify mod posts then? 
A7:54:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> If people need a mod, it's not too hard to find
A7:54:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> they shouldn't
A7:54:47 <PuyoDead> reddit is already a popularity contest, so I guess I can see why that would happen there
A7:54:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why would you want to distinguish?
A7:54:52 <ez> second one is not good, I vote agains the second one, neutral to the rest lol
A7:55:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Remember, mods are supposed to serve not lead
A7:55:30 <PuyoDead> true, but there should be a way for members to know who to contact
A7:55:31 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: because my thoughts on the forum development are more "important" than a normal users, if I say "we're having x feature" that's more important that if some normal user said it, they have no ability to do that? =\
A7:55:33 <TrueWolves> ha
A7:55:40 <TrueWolves> games don't count towards post count anymore?
A7:55:46 <ez> PuyoDead: there is, you can see under index who's mods
A7:55:47 <citricsquid> TrueWolves: nope :P
A7:55:49 <PuyoDead> not since yesterday
A7:55:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fine, then do a distinguish button
A7:55:57 <PuyoDead> oh, didn't know that, heh
A7:56:02 <ez> lol
A7:56:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ignoring the egocentric nature of that post that is

A7:56:37 <PuyoDead> oh yea, duh.
A7:56:42 <PuyoDead> <-- forgots
A7:56:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't see how this would help
A7:57:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> especially with people who already have large egos
A7:57:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> a la z******
A7:57:09 <citricsquid> zebbidi?
A7:57:15 <PuyoDead> zuel?
A7:57:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> for sure
A7:57:24 <ZomBuster> citricsquid its quite normal that mods have a different color username, title etc.
A7:57:36 <citricsquid> I don't see how it functions to increase egos, if it's only showing in the post bit it serves as nothing more than an identifier.
A7:57:46 <ZomBuster> its for other users
A7:57:57 <ez> citricsquid: closed topics still show as overlined for me?
A7:58:04 <citricsquid> ez: clear cache :P
A7:58:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly, identifying someone as being in a separate "group", or being "special" will never do anything but fracture the community and hurt the discussion
A7:58:08 <ZomBuster> so when they see someone posts "please don't do that" they know they can get banned
A7:58:23 <PuyoDead> I think you're taking that a little extreme, natural
A7:58:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> They should know that anyway, it's obviously not a ghost forum
A7:58:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> ha, I don't
A7:58:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> How is it extreme?
A7:58:36 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: So a normal user can come along and say "This is happening" and a user can't tell if it's "official" or not?
A7:58:37 <PuyoDead> yea, that can certainly happen
A7:58:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: make a button if you must
A7:58:52 <ez> citricsquid: oh right, that old thing :P
A7:58:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> change the color for one post, and the rest look normal
A7:59:01 <ZomBuster> moderators are supposed to be different!
A7:59:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or they could just... check the list?
A7:59:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, they're not
A7:59:11 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: What if I appoint a new mod?
A7:59:11 <PuyoDead> everyone knows there are mods, and has been pointed out how to find them
A7:59:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: I know you appointed PuyoDead... even though nobody told me
A7:59:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's pretty clear to see
A7:59:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> (Moderated by PuyoDead, Wolfram, Zuriki, citricsquid, ez)
A7:59:43 <citricsquid> if I haven't been to the forum for xx days and then someone in IRC links a post where a new moderator I don't know about says something which affects the way the game and/or forum functions, surely they'd want to know?
A8:00:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
A8:00:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't follow that one
A8:00:20 <citricsquid> I don't want to seperate mods from normal users, but there needs to be a way to see if a post is from an "official" source.
A8:00:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then don't do general posts with your official username
A8:00:36 <PuyoDead> plus, what happens down the road when there are more mods, and that little "modereated by" list gets longer than the title of the section itself?
A8:00:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or get a fucking button
A8:00:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's not uber difficult to make

A8:01:05 <citricsquid> I could post a topic on the forum - assume I'm a normal user - that says "Forums are shutting down on the 12th of august!" and then someone might link it here, then someone who hasn't been to the forums for a few days will be all "wtf is this official?!?!"
A8:01:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> (Moderated by PuyoDead, Wolfram, Zuriki, citricsquid, ez)
A8:01:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> And I've never, ever seen that reaction
A8:01:21 <ez> well, whatever you decide to do, I prefer the first or third alternative, the second one was yukk lol
A8:01:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> if you'd like to prove me wrong using past history
A8:01:28 <citricsquid> ez: :P
A8:01:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'd be glad to see that
A8:01:38 <citricsquid> reddit is not a forum.
A8:01:45 <citricsquid> they're not comparable.
A8:01:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> No?  What is it then?
A8:01:58 <TrueWolves> @.@
A8:01:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, but users still need to know when something is "official"
A8:02:02 <citricsquid> massive circle jerk, from what I've seen.
A8:02:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> What if someone says, this subreddit is closing on 6/25
A8:02:10 <PuyoDead> a user submitted article sharing site
A8:02:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> And someone's like
A8:02:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> WTF is that official?
A8:02:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: some subreddits consist entirely of self posts
A8:02:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> a la forum
A8:02:28 <ez> *giggles*
A8:02:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> reddit.com/r/askreddit being one
A8:02:35 <TrueWolves> This is a lot >.>;
A8:02:45 <citricsquid> minecraftforum had a porn post, does that make it a porn site?
A8:03:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> It wasn't intended to have a porn post
A8:03:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> So no
10A8:03:08 * Quatroking (Quatroking@86.90.159.252) has joined #minecraft
A8:03:22 <Quatroking> hai
A8:03:23 <citricsquid> okay, so what about the share your creations images topic? Does that make the forum an imageboard?
A8:03:27 <PuyoDead> hey quatro
A8:03:29 <citricsquid> yoquatro
A8:03:39 <ez> yo yo
A8:03:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, but Reddit has redditchan, and it's still not an imageboard
A8:03:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> had actually, I think the owner got sick of it
A8:04:05 <Quatroking> I seriously need to get a new cabinet
A8:04:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I still don't understand how this is relevant
A8:04:16 <PuyoDead> point being, reddit and minecraftforums aren't really comparable. yes, they have some similar features, but that's all
A8:04:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> or how separating mods and users for EVERY POST could be useful
A8:04:27 <Quatroking> I'm now having a few minifigures on my subwoover and they keep falling off due to the bass
A8:04:37 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: it's not seperating. It's identifying.
A8:04:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> I wouldn't be against a button that lets them distinguish themselves
A8:04:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's one and the same
A8:04:46 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: that's the same thing :|
A8:04:54 <PuyoDead> what exactly do you mean by a button?
A8:05:07 <citricsquid> a button IS a unique identifier, just a different way to how I demonstrated. How is that any different to a diff coloured name?
A8:05:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right, right, the green moderator highlighting. Contrary to popular conspiracy theory, we weren't trying to create a caste society or intimidate anyone or lay the groundwork for a new moneymaking scheme based on corruption and bribery. We just thought it would be neat for people to know when a post is official, since there can sometimes be confusion. Unfortunately, an unexpected effect of this was the appearance that modera
A8:05:27 <AlLnAtuRalX>  in some ways superior to regular contributors or could crush them like a gnat. They're not. Their powers / duties are few and unspectacular. To paraphrase Wikipedia administrivia, being a moderator doesn't mean you wear a crown. It means you carry a mop.
A8:05:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nonetheless, we realized that there was the appearance of favoritism and the potential for resentment, so we're now going to make moderator highlighting optional and off by default. In the rare case where a moderator really does want to speak officially, they will have the ability to "turn on the [M]" for a particular post or comment.
A8:05:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Now you know where I got that quote
A8:06:13 <ZomBuster> I still prefer just a Moderator title under the names
A8:06:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> By button citricsquid
A8:06:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I mean a button you press
A8:06:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> to add the badge
A8:06:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> for ONE POST only
A8:06:32 <Quatroking> are you guys discussing the fact that a submit button can have hazardous results?
A8:06:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> So if you need to be official, be official by all means
A8:06:39 <ez> AlLnAtuRalX: that sounds complicated and weird
A8:06:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Complicated not so much
A8:06:52 <citricsquid> So you can be a mod for some posts and not for another? :| 
A8:06:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Weird, maybe
A8:07:00 <citricsquid> I don't see how reddit experience with mods is relevant to mcforum
A8:07:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, you're always a mod
A8:07:11 <ez> well, some will use it more than others, and u'd be all err what so special about THIS post just cause it got the badge
A8:07:16 <citricsquid> no, I get that, I mean you're only presented as a mod for specific posts.
A8:07:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not... My experience with running a forum with 12k users might be though
A8:07:19 <PuyoDead> this may just be me, but I really don't think the people in this community are going to have that same reaction
A8:07:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> for four years
A8:07:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: of course they're not
A8:07:48 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I regular a forum with 20million posts, over 1mil users and they have unique identifers and it works perfectly.
A8:07:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> this community is generally made up of 12 year olds who will have their finger too far up their noses to notice
A8:08:02 <PuyoDead> and it kind of surprises me that reddit would be so immature to react that way
A8:08:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ha! Do it like SA the
A8:08:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> then*
A8:08:12 <Quatroking> goddamnit
A8:08:13 <ez> well, Im against that button idea for sure, it could either be like now or with colour name/star next to name
A8:08:19 <PuyoDead> I was under the impression the reddit was a bit brighter than that
A8:08:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: it surprises you that trolls would target mods first?
A8:08:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> And that regular users might not disagree with figures of authority?
A8:08:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> The MODS are the ones that got pissed, not the users
A8:08:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because their quality of discussion tanked
A8:09:07 <Quatroking> guys
A8:09:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> No more 100 post articles about programming or mechanics, instead just "yeah your right"
A8:09:12 <Quatroking> hold da phone
A8:09:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> So that's the reason
A8:09:15 <Quatroking> HOLD DA PHONE
A8:09:19 <Quatroking> what the hell are we discussing
13A8:09:22 * PuyoDead holds a phone
A8:09:26 <ez> lol Quatroking 
13A8:09:33 * ez drops the phone
A8:09:35 <citricsquid> Quatroking: AlLnAtuRalX says it's bad to have diff coloured names for mods on the forum
A8:09:42 <citricsquid> and we're all disagreeing.
A8:09:43 <Quatroking> thats racist
A8:09:43 <aera> someone on the internet is wrong! It's terrible!
A8:09:51 <ez> lol
A8:09:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: You  could call them Janitors
A8:09:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> that would be fun
A8:09:58 <PuyoDead> I'm not necessarily disagreeing
A8:10:00 <Quatroking> alnaturalx you're a racist
A8:10:10 <Quatroking> you are.
A8:10:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> ha
A8:10:14 <PuyoDead> I just don't think it'll have the same effect as reddit
A8:10:15 <Quatroking> bad person.
A8:10:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: see my above post
A8:10:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> this community is generally made up of 12 year olds who will have their finger too far up their noses to notice
A8:10:32 <ez> I see the point, not sure it would such a big problem though, that's why Im neautral to the two options... but agains the button idea!
A8:10:35 <Quatroking> basically you're saying that all black, white, tinted and yellow people should have the same skin color
A8:10:40 <PuyoDead> not for that reason (which isn't a reason anyway)
A8:10:41 <Quatroking> RACISM
A8:10:50 <citricsquid> I agree that seperating users and mods is bad, but it's not that we have a choice. However much you try and fight it users and mods ARE different. The same way women and men aren't the same.
A8:10:52 <PuyoDead> but for the fact that reddit posts are laid out completely differently
A8:10:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nah, I'm fine with everyone having a different, group agnostic color
A8:11:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: How so?
A8:11:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because mods have a ban button?
A8:11:18 <citricsquid> exactly.
A8:11:28 <Quatroking> in the last 5 days I've blocked over 10 people on the wiki
A8:11:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right, right, the green moderator highlighting. Contrary to popular conspiracy theory, we weren't trying to create a caste society or intimidate anyone or lay the groundwork for a new moneymaking scheme based on corruption and bribery. We just thought it would be neat for people to know when a post is official, since there can sometimes be confusion. Unfortunately, an unexpected effect of this was the appearance that modera
A8:11:37 <AlLnAtuRalX>  in some ways superior to regular contributors or could crush them like a gnat. They're not. Their powers / duties are few and unspectacular. To paraphrase Wikipedia administrivia, being a moderator doesn't mean you wear a crown. It means you carry a mop.

A8:11:38 <citricsquid> a moderators job is to delete and ban abusive users/posts, but also to steer discussion.

A8:11:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fine, do whatever you want
A8:11:42 <Quatroking> SPAM
A8:11:43 <Quatroking> AGH
A8:11:43 <PuyoDead> ohgodspam
A8:11:48 <ez> om AlLnAtuRalX 
A8:11:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> sorry, dont know how that went through
A8:11:56 <ez> omg* please
A8:11:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> client bug, relax
A8:11:56 <Quatroking> yes you do
A8:11:57 <ez> oh ok
A8:11:58 <Quatroking> BURN HIM
A8:12:03 <Quatroking> BURRRN
A8:12:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyway,. do whatever you want
A8:12:08 <Quatroking> BUUUUUUURN
13A8:12:15 * Quatroking gets the torches
A8:12:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't read the forums anyway
A8:12:20 <Quatroking> BURN YOU SINNER
13A8:12:28 * ez poors water over IRC
A8:12:30 <PuyoDead> I think the tree format of reddit had something to do with that
A8:12:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> The quality of discussion is FAR too low in General Discussion
A8:12:34 <Quatroking> deja vu, I feel like I burned someone before
A8:12:45 <Quatroking> I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing
A8:12:49 <Quatroking> :/
A8:12:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: No, it's the discussion that makes my ears bleed
A8:13:00 <PuyoDead> no, no, not that
A8:13:08 <PuyoDead> that whole reaction to colored mod names
A8:13:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: it was the fact that you can have personal arguments, debates, discussions within the main discussion that did it
A8:13:28 <Quatroking> SPAMBOT FAIL
A8:13:29 <Quatroking> http://minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Talk:Tree_%28structure%29&rcid=2392
A8:13:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Mods weren't getting the personal discussions / debates that they used to
A8:13:44 <PuyoDead> yea, I can see that happening
A8:13:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> and they got pissed, for all the right reasons, though they should have waited until the admins reverted it
A8:13:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> three days later
A8:14:04 <PuyoDead> but the way that reddit allows you to directly reply to specific people
A8:14:15 <citricsquid> seems to me that the reddit community couldn't handle different people of power existing, I don't see how that reflects on the use of identifiers for mods.
A8:14:24 <Quatroking> stop being a whiny bitch allnaturalx
A8:14:27 <Quatroking> its annoying
A8:14:33 <citricsquid> Quatroking: calm down =\
A8:14:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I told you to do whatever you want citricsquid
A8:14:43 <PuyoDead> much in the same way digg does... but digg is a bit, well, lower quality
A8:14:47 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I'd rather underatand your point of view.
A8:14:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Honestly, I can't read the forums any more anyway, so it's not my fight
A8:15:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> My point of view is pretty simple to understand
A8:15:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't think, by principle, mods/ops/admins should be in a separate group than regular users
A8:15:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which is why I use an IRC client that doesnt have @citricsquid instead of citricsquid
A8:15:36 <PuyoDead> now that's just silly
A8:15:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> But, like I said, do whatever
A8:15:37 <citricsquid> but they are different?
A8:15:41 <Quatroking> allnaturalx: "Honestly, I can't read the forums any more anyway, so it's not my fight" ???
A8:15:50 <PuyoDead> I agree that mods shouldn't be held on a higher platform
A8:15:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Absolutely Quatroking
A8:15:57 <citricsquid> I am different from you, as an IRC OP I have to stop spam and ban abusive users. That makes ME different from YOU.
A8:16:01 <Quatroking> does that mean you're banned
A8:16:04 <Quatroking> or something
A8:16:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, I just can't stand General Discussion
A8:16:16 <Quatroking> I'm wiki mod
A8:16:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft Discussion*
A8:16:22 <Quatroking> oh, I'm so different
A8:16:26 <ez> Quatroking: you're not really helping the discussion
A8:16:31 <Quatroking> feel the wrath of my edit-blocking rights
A8:16:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> So citricsquid, I'll tell Notch to make all mod names green in-game
A8:16:51 <Quatroking> sorry ez, but I still don't understand the discussion.
A8:16:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> That would probably be useful
A8:17:01 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: we're not ingame mods.
A8:17:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll e-mail him now
A8:17:03 <citricsquid> forum != game
A8:17:07 <Quatroking> doesn't notch want to keep colored names for himself
A8:17:10 <PuyoDead> that's a totally different situation, and you know it
A8:17:12 <ZomBuster> he means ops?
A8:17:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> How so?
A8:17:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> So griefers can't know?
A8:17:22 <PuyoDead> how NOT so?
A8:17:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> They know when they're being followed anyway
A8:17:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Two groups. ops and users
A8:17:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> one group controls the server
A8:17:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> they can ban, etc
A8:17:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> They can speak on behalf of the server
A8:17:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> But they're not identified
A8:18:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just because it's a forum... doesn't mean anything
A8:18:06 <ez> don't mix the game with the forum =)
A8:18:17 <PuyoDead> which in game, is prefered
A8:18:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> People are people, whether they're behind an avatar, a username, a forum account, or an IRC nick
A8:18:24 <PuyoDead> real time is a lot different
A8:18:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Forget it, I'm done
A8:18:44 <Quatroking> kthx
A8:18:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Make mods use <blink><marquee> and <big> for all I give a shit
A8:19:10 <Quatroking> isn't colors for mods actually useful
A8:19:13 <ZomBuster> html is alwaysd funny
A8:19:17 <Quatroking> players can quickly go to them for help[
A8:19:23 <Quatroking> how is that bad
A8:19:25 <PuyoDead> nobody disagrees that mods are equals to the users
A8:19:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead: citric does
A8:19:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can get yoiu a quote on that in fact

A8:19:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> [09:16:16] <citricsquid> I am different from you, as an IRC OP I have to stop spam and ban abusive users. That makes ME different from YOU.
A8:20:08 <Quatroking> Thats true
A8:20:16 <citricsquid> I'm not saying my opinion is more valid than yours
A8:20:20 <citricsquid> but my job is different from yours
A8:20:23 <citricsquid> therefore, we're different.
A8:20:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> there are several more
A8:20:29 <PuyoDead> that's technical differences, not personal
A8:20:32 <citricsquid> I'm not aying I AM RIGHT YOU ARE WRONG I AM AN OP SO I AM RIGHT
A8:20:43 <ez> getting hot in here
A8:20:44 <citricsquid> I'm saying I am tasked with banning spammers and abusive people, you're not.
A8:20:49 <ez> someone want a beer?
A8:20:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Flashing an OP in front of my face does nothing to improve quality of discussion
A8:20:55 <PuyoDead> cops have more power than citizens, yet they are still citizens
A8:20:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> I said I'm done
A8:21:01 <Quatroking> ez: i suggest ice
A8:21:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Do whatever the fuck you want
A8:21:10 <ZomBuster> beer with ice? eww
13A8:21:11 * Quatroking gets a bucket of ice and throws it over the IRC
A8:21:20 <ez> aah that felt good
A8:21:24 <Ausfriend> fuck you
A8:21:26 <ez> lol ZomBuster

A8:21:31 <Quatroking> lmao
A8:21:35 <PuyoDead> oh snap, are we having a wet t-shirt contest in here?
A8:21:39 <ZomBuster> its still warm in australia
A8:21:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'd have assumed it would, but can't find it anywhere
A8:21:43 <ZomBuster> it always is
A8:21:44 <Quatroking> we're having a snow t-shirt contest
A8:21:47 <Ausfriend> yeah
A8:21:48 <Quatroking> with... snow
A8:21:51 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: lmao, how lame.
A8:21:51 <Ausfriend> but today was fucking freezing
A8:21:53 <ez> glad my clothes aren't see through
A8:21:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ha!  Trust me you don't want to see my wet t-shirt PuyoDead
A8:21:58 <Quatroking> SNOW MACHINE GO!
A8:21:58 <citricsquid> I'll delete it if you want, but that's just pathetic.
A8:21:58 <Ausfriend> it was 25 degrees and i was still cold
13A8:22:04 * Quatroking covers everyone with snow

A8:22:08 <Ausfriend> no fuckyou
A8:22:09 <PuyoDead> e
A8:22:12 <Ausfriend> my laptop doesnt like snow
A8:22:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: I'm just saying, if you do the mod tags, I have no reason to use the forums anyway
A8:22:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only section I currently read is Server Administration
A8:22:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> so I can help people out
A8:22:32 <ez> that's a bit over the top aint it AlLnAtuRalX  =)
A8:22:33 <PuyoDead> which we appreciate
A8:22:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> General Discussion is 5 year old level, as is server forum and ummm... forumg ames or whatever
A8:22:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why ez?  I only read one section anyway
A8:22:54 <ez> that's nice AlLnAtuRalX , and people cant always agree
A8:22:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> I quit most of the forum a while ago
A8:23:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A8:23:09 <Quatroking> then what is your problem if you quit
A8:23:15 <Quatroking> for fucks sake
A8:23:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
A8:23:17 <ez> because it seems like u doing it cause we almost disagree on a small matter lol

A9:44:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Relax, it was my clanleader tag in UrT
A9:44:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> }o$x{iPimp
A9:44:42 <flyboy> That was odd
A9:45:03 <AlexVMiner> AlLnAtuRalX, are you a pimp?
A9:45:08 <flyboy> Silly goose flyboy came up in my irc.esper.net tab
A9:45:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> For sure
A9:45:18 <AlexVMiner> LIAH
A9:45:22 <flyboy> also, alex, where do you live?
A9:45:31 <flyboy> lik what country?

A9:47:23 <AlexVMiner> sorry
A9:47:27 <AlexVMiner> i am in and out
A9:47:29 <flyboy> switching transports.....
A9:47:31 <AlexVMiner> I live in the US
A9:47:36 <flyboy> Ohk
A9:47:44 <AlexVMiner> why?
A9:47:49 <maver> Hey guys, when I turn off the server program, if I try and restart it I get an error about the address already being in use. Any idea on how to get rid of that, rather than just waiting for the port to clear (Or whatever is actually being used)?
A9:47:59 <citricsquid> port issue
A9:48:02 <flyboy> you just reminded me of someone i knew called alex
A9:48:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> maver: What OS is this on?
A9:48:05 <citricsquid> change port or wait a few mins
A9:48:09 <AlexVMiner> are you funning more than one server?
A9:48:12 <maver> Debian stable
12A9:48:12 * Ausfriend (B04175@220-244-127-48.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Quit: Ausfriend)
12A9:48:12 * Ausfriend_ (B04175@220-244-127-48.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Quit: Ausfriend_)
A9:48:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right, how large is the server?
A9:48:22 <AlexVMiner> *running
A9:48:37 <maver> Just the one atm, I'd just change ports but that means changing iptables every so often
A9:48:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> The problem being that some people have unclean disconnects, causing their sockets to be stuck in FIN_WAIT1
A9:48:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> you should be able to see them using netstat -ao
A9:48:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Check for your server port
A9:49:14 <flyboy> LOAD
A9:49:21 <flyboy> BLOOD Interwebs
A9:49:30 <flyboy> I want to see the shuttle
A9:49:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> maver: Did you kill the server using kill -INT ?
A9:49:52 <AlexVMiner> OH NOEZ
A9:49:56 <AlexVMiner> HE KILLED THE SERVER
A9:50:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you just kill'd or killall'd it, that could also cause it
A9:50:01 <AlexVMiner> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
A9:50:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> For small servers (0-10 people on at average) it'll generally go away in a few minutes (@maver)
A9:50:14 <maver> Ta, I've got 10 going atm
A9:50:26 <maver> Just turned it back on, went for a smoke, came back and it had been trashed
A9:50:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> But for large servers, port change (not optimal due to External URL change) or just reboot the box
A9:50:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> and make sure you use -int
A9:50:45 <maver> Err, how do I do that?
A9:50:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, how do you kill the server now?
A9:51:01 <maver> C-c :P
A9:51:16 <flyboy> I MISSED IT
A9:51:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh, you dont run it using nohup or screen?  mmkay, I guess ctrl-c should send an int
A9:51:51 <maver> I run it from inside a screen
A9:52:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, the command screen....
A9:52:07 <aera> screen still sends Ctrl-C as SIGINT, though
A9:52:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> In other news, Notch knows about it, says he'll fix it next server update
A9:52:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I'd just deal until then, not much choice
A9:52:23 <flyboy> tv about rockets is BORING
A9:52:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> He said a screen not screen aera... which I assume means a display
A9:52:39 <maver> I use screen AlLnAtuRalX
A9:52:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> ctrl-c is fine though
A9:52:44 <AlexVMiner> allnatural, i just banned a griefer named LetsBuild on your server
A9:52:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> did you put a reason AlexVMiner?
A9:53:01 <AlexVMiner> yes
A9:53:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> k awesome
A9:53:08 <AlexVMiner> just griefing random things
A9:53:14 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: I call instances of screen "a screen", but that might just be me
A9:53:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah, I see it... thanks :D
A9:53:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't use the a, but that might just be me
13A9:53:41 * aera wonders if you could algorithmically detect griefing
A9:53:52 <aera> fast, random placement of one block type, or deletion
A9:53:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> ha!  Would frag people who are clearing or deleting their own buildings :P
A9:54:03 <aera> hmm, indeed
A9:54:04 <maver> Ah well, this is only an annoyance.
A9:54:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Next server update maver
A9:54:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A9:54:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> So Notch claims
13A9:54:29 * aera has considered giving ownership to invidual blocks, but the memory requirements are horrific
A9:54:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> do NOT do that
A9:54:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A9:54:42 <peerkoel> really?
12A9:54:44 * flyboy (chatzilla@121-73-114-37.cable.telstraclear.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
A9:54:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold on, I has an SMS
A9:55:01 <peerkoel> you'd just flush that into a database, right?
A9:55:04 <Dilt> yeah aera
10A9:55:10 * Durandan (Dura@61.6.225.65) has joined #minecraft
A9:55:12 <Dilt> the issue with that is that most of the time?
10A9:55:16 * flyboy (chatzilla@121-73-114-37.cable.telstraclear.net) has joined #minecraft
A9:55:18 <aera> well, there's a hell of a lot of blocks in a map
A9:55:20 <Dilt> the blocks they destroy aren't owned by people
A9:55:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> aera: you could probably build an interface to an SQLite database, but hell
A9:55:43 <aera> it'd have to have up to 4million rows
A9:55:58 <peerkoel> not all blocks are changed, so you can get away with a decent database connection
A9:56:02 <aera> besides, my main concern is caching that info to make block operations fast
A9:56:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> right, it's not practical
A9:56:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> you could do areas though, as in plots
A9:56:26 <aera> currently, my server uses about 0.5MB of RAM per map, I'd like to keep it that way
A9:56:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Even though I'm still against any sort of perms system
A9:56:34 <aera> oh, yes, areas I have considered
A9:56:45 <aera> although my solution to that ultimately was per-world ops
A9:57:07 <aera> i might make it so anyone can claim a 64x64 piece of land as their own, as their own op
A9:57:13 <aera> (as a separate world)
A9:57:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> A /create generated My world 1 could do it
A9:57:35 <maver> I think the only thing I dislike about minecraft is people sucking up for ops
A9:57:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> And then just give OP rights to the creator by default
A9:57:55 <aera> yup, pretty much what I was imaginging
A9:58:04 <aera> I have a /new command already, but it's admins-only
A9:58:10 <aera> you get to specify a template tho
A9:58:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> hell, you could even have templates
A9:58:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah
A9:58:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
A9:58:18 <peerkoel> you also have writers, which is another userlevel
13A9:58:29 * AlLnAtuRalX has pretty bad core lag, the core of this IRC client is on a differnet machine
A9:58:29 <aera> yup, that's really useful for griefers in general
A9:58:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A9:58:33 <Dilt> yeah
A9:58:51 <Dilt> back in original blockland, there were -no- protections at all
A9:59:03 <maver> AlLnAtuRalX: IRC on your server?
A9:59:06 <Dilt> people were walking around, spamming shit, stretching to uncollidable sizes
A9:59:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> maver: yeah, #redditpublic
A9:59:13 <Dilt> hammering everything
A9:59:18 <Dilt> it was horrible
A9:59:23 <aera> ew
A9:59:41 <Dilt> even with the new ownership and the removed ability to stretch blocks
A9:59:48 <Dilt> people did join, spam shit, and leave
A10:00:05 <maver> Hmm, you guys might know. Any way to change a map without restarting the server?
A10:00:16 <Dilt> the only way I've found to cure this is to literally not let people build. Whitelisting, basically
A10:00:17 <peerkoel> edit it ingame?
A10:00:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> maver: not on the default server client
A10:00:26 <aera> Dilt: which is why I have writers
A10:00:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> JTE has /load though
A10:00:31 <UnknownX> Shit that you can delete with a single button
A10:00:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> aera's server has /new and /world
10A10:00:50 * Aquain (Mibbit@nat-resnet9.uwa.net.au) has joined #minecraft
A10:00:58 <Durandan> yay
A10:01:01 <Dilt> aera: which is why i suggested what you called 'writers' way way back BEFORE griefers started showing up in minecraft
A10:01:08 <Aquain> Hooray!
A10:01:09 <Dilt> i paralleled it to op/voice in IRC
A10:01:13 <aera> Dilt: indeed, it makes a lot of sense
A10:01:14 <Dilt> so i called them 'voices'
A10:01:19 <aera> yeah, I almost did
A10:01:20 <aera> h
A10:01:25 <aera> IRC works most of the time
A10:01:26 <Dilt> with +m being a reflection of 'voice or higher mode'
A10:02:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Dilt: I have a problem with the concept, but as long as servers employing it were clearly marked and it was optional, I don't see an issue
A10:02:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> are*
A10:02:22 <Dilt> AlLnAtuRalX: agreed
A10:02:30 <Dilt> +m can be seen before viewing a channel (/list)
A10:02:35 <Dilt> and can be turned on/off at will
A10:02:45 <aera> it is _really_ confusing to users currently to be dumped into my default, non-writable world
A10:02:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Where's citricsquid?  I want to see him arguing that drawing parallels to IRC and the game is wrong
A10:03:11 <aera> drawing some parallels is fine, others is useless
A10:03:12 <Dilt> honestly
A10:03:33 <Dilt> i'd like to see a server mention of 'Moderation Mode: You may not build until you are Voiced' when I join a game with the mode on
A10:03:34 <Dilt> or such
A10:03:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's what he said when I was drawing parallels from Reddit (a forum) to minecraft forums (a forum)
A10:03:39 <peerkoel> aera, how about getting grass to grow, water to flow, wind to blow, ... on your server
A10:03:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A10:03:50 <aera> peerkoel: that's tonight's work
A10:03:53 <peerkoel> \o/
A10:03:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> peerkoel: those things wouldnt mean anything on an archive server
A10:03:59 <aera> I have to write it in a memory-efficient way, though
A10:04:03 <aera> and it'll be per-world
A10:04:17 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: it'll be limited physics
A10:04:17 <peerkoel> I have an event system in my server

A10:04:31 <UnknownX> So citricsquid, when will bob ross become that mod status you told me about yesterday?
A10:04:41 <aera> I think physics is going to be an external batch process that sends its own block updates

A10:04:48 <aera> that way it'll work well

A10:05:48 <maver> What I'd love to see is sunlight from only one point in the map, so you get shadows
A10:05:55 <maver> tbut like, not just under the blocks :P
A10:06:01 <aera> that's a task for the client :)
A10:06:15 <aera> it'd be nice to have bloom/etc too, but hey 
A10:06:22 <aera> it works because it's simple
A10:06:52 <aera> i can probably implement erosion though
A10:07:06 <Durandan> uhhh
A10:07:32 <Durandan> Sounds like you're getting into the kind of area that gets comps crashed
A10:07:37 <Aquain> If I've got a PM, I don't know where to look for  it. ><
A10:07:59 <Durandan> :[
A10:07:59 <Aquain> Whoops, ignore me.
A10:08:10 <Durandan> look up top
A10:08:24 <maver> ctrl-n cycles through windows for me =]
A10:08:25 <aera> it doesn't crash the comp if you run it asynchronously
A10:08:36 <Aquain> I'm using mibbit
A10:08:37 <aera> but yeah, erosion is hard anyway
A10:09:31 <maver> I must say, minecraft is a good game because of its simplicity
A10:10:23 <aera> yup - I've always called it "online lego" to people not familiar with it
A10:10:25 <maver> although I'd love two things. Stairs you can WALK up and proper sunlight/shadows
A10:10:31 <aera> oh, stairs
A10:10:35 <aera> they'd be great
A10:10:50 <aera> can't really do those server-side
A10:10:54 <maver> I wouldn't mind being able to build things on a vertical diagonal a little better
A10:11:02 <aera> portals yah, stairs nah
A10:12:23 <Durandan> portals would be great
A10:12:25 <maver> I really should get to work on finishing the parthenon
A10:12:36 <Durandan> although I can kind of get the same effect, just for myself

A10:14:48 <PuyoDead> 2400 baud, rather
A10:14:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> 2800 baud is a luxury sir!

A10:23:20 <TrueWolves> A huge Tree
A10:23:26 <maver> Yeah, just googled that
A10:23:27 <TrueWolves> It has gathered quite a home fan base
A10:23:43 <aera> sounds interesting
A10:23:46 <TrueWolves> I got like... 6 people bugging me to bring it back up again, but I personaly can't host it
A10:23:51 <maver> depending on what it is, I could probably chuck it on my vps
A10:23:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> TrueWolves: How large is the map?
A10:23:52 <TrueWolves> Citric hosted it before me, he made a video of it
A10:23:54 <aera> I hope you made a tall map ^_^
10A10:23:57 * ParOut is now known as Parthon
A10:24:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can /msg me if you'd like TrueWolves
A10:24:07 <TrueWolves> Look on youtube for a  "TrueWolves huge tree biuld"
A10:24:26 <TrueWolves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1--ljv_C4
A10:24:27 <Parthon> it's not just huge, it's HUGE
A10:24:46 <TrueWolves> it's as big as a 256/256/256 map
A10:24:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Would it require frequent restores?
A10:25:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> And if so, could you do them via SSH?
A10:25:06 <aera> bloody nora
A10:25:06 <TrueWolves> It's meant for people to biuld on, so no
A10:25:18 <TrueWolves> That is TreeBiuld1.0
A10:25:30 <TrueWolves> I made a 2.0 version with some fixes and rainbowizing the fall chute
A10:25:40 <aera> i HAVE to see if my server copes with that
A10:25:51 <aera> but alas, I can only get maps by ripping ATM
A10:25:52 <maver> AlLnAtuRalX: just extend your irc bot to read irc's and do backups on !backups if people are scared of doing a backup themselves
A10:26:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> maver, the problem is not backups, it's restores
A10:26:12 <TrueWolves> It should be able to be hosted by any server that can host a 256/256/256 map
A10:26:28 <maver> maybe !listbackups, and !restore xxx.backup
A10:26:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> In its current form,. that would require killing hte server
A10:26:45 <aera> well mine can theoretically 1024x1024x1024, although that makes the client die
A10:26:46 <maver> Oh, of course
A10:26:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> and being a big server, there's always a need for a reboot
A10:27:13 <maver> No.. firefox died
A10:28:31 <TrueWolves> But yeah... I got like 6 people wanting me to bring the tree back, even peroggi wants me to
A10:28:46 <UnknownX> I want it
A10:29:03 <TrueWolves> Unknown was one of are common visiters
A10:29:13 <TrueWolves> and makes 7 >.>;
A10:29:13 <aera> i'd love to see it
A10:29:24 <maver> Hmm, lemme startup emacs + swank + clj and see what my ram usuage is like If it's pretty low, I might host it for you
A10:29:26 <TrueWolves> I want to host a race to the top

A10:41:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh, the mod color is GLARING PINK
A10:41:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's nice
A10:41:51 <maver> and I dislike the templates in django

13A10:42:49 * aera stops being his day job

A10:43:27 <aera> ah, fair enough
A10:43:31 <maver> plus having access to all the java libraries is a bloody nice thing
A10:43:35 <aera> always write in the language you write most
A10:43:40 <aera> *cough* jython
A10:43:49 <aera> write most? like most, even
A10:43:58 <maver> haha :P
A10:44:03 <ZomBuster> jython waht is that
A10:44:18 <maver> I like python, but I like clj better. The code "sits" better in my head
A10:44:36 <aera> ZomBuster: python, on the JVM. If you're not a programmer, it won't make sense :)
A10:44:48 <ZomBuster> well I am but not a very broad one
A10:44:59 <maver> You've got cpython(Most people use this), stackless python, Jython
A10:45:01 <aera> maver: I suppose; python fits in my head, but then I've heard good things about clojure
A10:45:13 <maver> Some form of python on .net as well I think
A10:45:21 <aera> there's also ironpython, pypy, and unladen swallon
A10:45:27 <aera> *swallow
A10:45:35 <ChJees> "whoever made this? should be shot"
A10:45:36 <aera> basically, the python community attracts interpreter people
A10:45:37 <ChJees> lol
A10:45:39 <maver> aera: I'm not really a programmer, I just do things to keep me entertained
A10:45:54 <aera> i am a programmer, and it entertains me :)
A10:46:01 <maver> Clojure makes it very easy to do what I want so I'm happy
A10:46:04 <ChJees> Im right now struggling with making basic collision detection :p
A10:46:06 <aera> good!
A10:46:08 <maver> Python did the same thing I suppose
A10:46:14 <aera> ChJees: 2D? 3D?
A10:46:17 <ChJees> 2D

A10:46:24 <ChJees> Simplifies a great deal :p
A10:46:30 <aera> yup :)
A10:46:36 <maver> 4d is just time, right?
A10:46:47 <PuyoDead> I still consider Braid to be a 4D game
A10:46:53 <ZomBuster> collision detection is pretty cool
A10:47:09 <ZomBuster> but such a mess to create something complicated yourself
A10:47:10 <ChJees> http://files.getdropbox.com/u/547140/buggycollision.jar
A10:47:12 <aera> Braid is awesome
A10:47:13 <maver> Ergh, reminds me of my year 11 programming class
A10:47:13 <ChJees> What i made so far
A10:47:16 <ZomBuster> much easier to use a nice library
A10:47:33 <aera> yes, there's some nice 2D physics/collision libraries
A10:47:41 <ChJees> Way too buggy to be of any use :p
A10:47:42 <maver> The most advanced thing we did was use a library that made collision detection as simple as if touching(ob1, ob2): blah blah
A10:47:44 <aera> mind you, if you don't try writing it yourself, you'll never learn
A10:47:57 <aera> ...that libraries are really useful and save time
A10:48:05 <ChJees> Im doing it from scratch :3
A10:48:15 <ChJees> Modeling it after Box2Ds way of doing stuff
A10:48:21 <maver> aera: hehe. Doing things from scratch is nice when you're learning and don't have any real projects in mind
A10:48:35 <ChJees> About time i made some real collision detection :p
A10:48:54 <aera> I'm a great lover of redoing the wheel, actually
A10:48:58 <ChJees> public class CollidableSimWorld
A10:49:00 <maver> Same
A10:49:08 <ChJees> What handles the whole collision "world"
A10:49:13 <maver> I'm 90% sure I'll be writing my own forums shortly =]
A10:49:33 <ChJees> I made a simple Guestbook in PHP once :p
A10:49:35 <ChJees> And it sucked
A10:49:38 <ChJees> Horribly
A10:49:45 <maver> haha, yeah. Mine'll suck
A10:49:59 <maver> If not, I might write an admin tool for minecraft
A10:50:05 <ChJees> I stored everything in a text file XD
A10:50:10 <maver> o.0
A10:50:22 <ChJees> All info and then used Regex for parsing stuff :p
A10:50:31 <maver> Sounds painful
A10:50:57 <maver> my extent of regex... grep "maver" or some other word
A10:51:11 <ChJees> lol
A10:51:25 <ChJees> (*.?)
A10:51:38 <ChJees> I think it takes anything :P
A10:51:39 <aera> i'm eventually going to write a webadmin for my server, since I can envisage more than around 5 worlds happening, and then they won't fit on the text part in the client
A10:51:51 <aera> but that's a long way off
A10:52:02 <ChJees> I has some Server<->Client writing experience :P
A10:52:12 <ChJees> Made it in C++ x_x
A10:52:16 <aera> ew :p
A10:52:22 <maver> drill to the head
A10:52:29 <ChJees> I migrated from C++ to Java :3
A10:52:34 <aera> i have too much server <-> client experience now, I'm starting to know the packets by number
A10:52:42 <maver> haha
A10:52:50 <ChJees> I use simple protocols
A10:52:51 <ZomBuster> What is wrong with C++ >:|
A10:52:56 <ChJees> that are easy to make
A10:53:01 <maver> Where can I start?
A10:53:04 <ChJees> ZomBuster, TAKES TOO MUCH TIME
A10:53:06 <aera> ZomBuster: it's too verbose for me
A10:53:19 <ChJees> maver, make a Protocol "class"
A10:53:22 <aera> most of the time, I don't need the speed
A10:53:26 <ChJees> For reading and making packets
A10:53:32 <ChJees> Will help you a LOT
A10:53:37 <maver> C++ is fine reall :P I don't hate it. But I can never justify using it as I don't require speed

A11:04:13 <aera> indeed
A11:04:22 <aera> that's physics, it's harder
A11:05:13 <ChJees> This test i am making now is so far only 8 class files big

A11:05:42 <ChJees> After i has mastered AABB and sphere collision i will master Polygon\Line collision
A11:05:43 <aera> well, it's 1 line of code rather than 2, yes

A11:27:09 <ChJees> Hmm, i know
A11:27:22 <ChJees> LET'S CREATE A HELLO KITTY ONLINE GUILD
A11:27:33 <Quatroking> hello kitty online is free?

A11:27:40 <maver> "Go do a play for nagisa Akki (hehe :P)" 
A11:27:40 <ChJees> :P
A11:27:54 <maver> Because he like, gave it up for her... would of been so touching if it was worded right
A11:28:03 <ChJees> The Minecraft community dominates Hello Kitty Online :P
A11:28:15 <maver> I'm scared
A11:28:16 <ChJees> Or wait, i think the Goons will do that
A11:28:24 <ChJees> Or the channers will troll the heck out of it
A11:28:27 <maver> I keep thinking that 4chan will come on my server and kill it
A11:28:42 <Quatroking> i remember when the publisher of hello kitty online claimed it would be more successful than World of Warcraft
A11:28:44 <ChJees> No Lulz = They won't come

A11:36:01 <ChJees> :|
A11:36:32 <ChJees> I do not like Bleach, One Piece & Naruto
A11:36:35 <ChJees> Same crap
A11:36:44 <ChJees> Naruto did i get bored after the 3rd episode
A11:36:49 <Quatroking> I don't like any anime that has no ending

A11:37:39 <Quatroking> Ghost in the Shell, both seasons
A11:37:41 <ChJees> IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET ANYTHING DONE
A11:37:50 <Quatroking> GITS IS AWESOME
A11:38:09 <ChJees> While Berserk has lots of fighting it is too serious :p

A11:38:30 <ChJees> Only watched the Stand Alone Complex ones
A11:38:32 <Quatroking> I WANT A REAL TACHIKOMA

P12:16:44 <Saer> Hello there
P12:16:47 <Droqen> Hi
P12:16:52 <Saer> Now, idk where evils
P12:16:53 <Saer> is
P12:17:00 <Saer> but he knows what he wants
P12:17:02 <Droqen> Maybe still trying to figure it out?
P12:17:07 <Droqen> Okay
P12:17:16 <Saer> Humans: What will be their advantages?
P12:17:24 <Saer> Dwarves are obvious
P12:17:31 <Saer> Elves, idk what they will have either
P12:17:37 <Saer> Orcs, still dunno
P12:17:38 <Tyoko> the races need downsides
P12:17:40 <Droqen> Humans could be better with crafting.
P12:17:44 <Tyoko> other wise why be a human
P12:17:48 <Darkebrz> TYOKO!
P12:17:49 <Droqen> ( wanna make a side # thing? )
P12:17:50 <Saer> Elves would be the best I would bet
P12:17:52 <Darkebrz> Tyok
P12:17:58 <Darkebrz> Go on AVMs server
P12:17:59 <Tyoko> go to your server
P12:18:04 <Darkebrz> Noo
P12:18:05 <Tyoko> theres like 4 people on
P12:18:07 <Tyoko> no ops
P12:18:07 <Darkebrz> Im having to much fun!
P12:18:10 <Darkebrz> Oh well
P12:18:12 <Darkebrz> Your op
P12:18:17 <Tyoko> im on evils
P12:18:22 <Droqen> Ha! Only elves are allowed to jump+build :P
P12:18:31 <Saer> No
P12:18:34 <Droqen> xD
P12:18:35 <Saer> That seems to drastic
P12:18:45 <Saer> Oh you mean at the same time?
P12:18:50 <Droqen> Yes
P12:18:51 <Saer> that shouldn't be physically possible?
P12:18:55 <Droqen> I mean

P12:19:30 <Droqen> Inverted gravity with down jumping?

P12:34:08 <TrueWolves> I fixed up hell a bit so it won't flood unless someone WANTs it to, and then I'll find out who and banthem, I also made the kilometer dropchute rainbow colored

P12:39:20 <maver> TrueWolves: I can't help ya in C++
P12:39:29 <maver> But if you like I can send ya the code for my bot
P12:39:44 <TrueWolves> What is it written in?
P12:39:48 <maver> clojure
P12:40:01 <maver> It'll do ya good to get away from C++
P12:40:03 <maver> :P
P12:41:04 <TrueWolves> C++ is all I have been /able/ to learn, I picked it up really fast, if I find a way to learn another language I'd do that to, I'm just to broke to get a good book, and I've never met a person who's bothered to teach me anything past "Hello World" in any one thing
P12:41:23 <TrueWolves> It's not that I favor it, it's all I've learned so far, best not to asume something becuase someone brought something up.
P12:41:44 <maver> I'm not assuming anything
P12:41:57 <maver> Exposure to any language that's vastly different to what you already know is a good thing
P12:42:03 <maver> And *never* pay for a book
P12:42:23 <maver> oodles of free books out there
P12:42:41 <Quatroking> hai

P12:43:08 <maver> that works too
P12:43:12 <Quatroking> you'll find enough
P12:43:18 <maver> But that involves leaving the house.. that would be scary
P12:43:22 <maver> and involving taking a shower!
P12:43:23 <TrueWolves> My sister stuck a 45$ debt on to my card *shakes fist*
P12:43:32 <TrueWolves> I take daily showers

P3:56:51 <PuyoDead> but this map is only 256x256x64

P3:57:10 <Darkebrz> *97
P3:57:32 <PuyoDead> you got something mixed up there, then
P3:57:46 <PuyoDead> should be 85kB
P3:57:55 <Darkebrz> Erm
P3:57:59 <Darkebrz> Thats the file you gave

P6:31:56 <PuyoDead> has been for a long time
P6:32:11 <Super-Dot> All avatars and signatures are from popular culture things, without exception
P6:32:20 <Darkebrz> Where can I find it?
P6:32:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> my avatar is not very popular culture related, is it
P6:32:53 <PuyoDead> I sent you the link half an hour ago :P but I'll get it again
P6:33:05 <PuyoDead> I made my avatar... but of course, I ripped it from a game

P6:34:22 <Darkebrz> I need you to clarify what you said
P6:35:55 <setveen> Hmm. i have a question, how would i open a level i downloaded for singleplayer? i need it cause i might be getting my own server up and will make edits to the map first
P6:36:32 <PuyoDead> you'll have to run your own server to use it
P6:36:48 <setveen> no way to run it on singleplayer?
P6:36:51 <PuyoDead> nope
P6:37:09 <setveen> thats gay
P6:38:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> gay
P6:38:11 <PuyoDead> SP maps are stored on Notch's server
P6:38:18 <PuyoDead> and only there
P6:39:31 <setveen> so if i made a SP map that said NOTCH IS GAY, he could see it?
P6:39:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P6:39:56 <PuyoDead> I somehow doubt he inspects every single map
P6:40:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> but why would he
P6:40:11 <setveen> that would be quite funny
P6:40:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> uh huh
P6:40:25 <PuyoDead> nor do I think he'd care
P6:41:21 <Darkebrz> Good news: I am getting remote access to my server:D

P6:58:00 <Super-Dot> Are server_level.dats used during the server's usage, or only to create a map at the beginning?
P6:58:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> beginning
P6:58:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> and then they get overwritten periodically
P6:58:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> I could probably host another server by the way
P6:58:38 <mail2345> i'm out of slots.
P6:58:57 <Super-Dot> Hooray
P6:59:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Full SSH, Telnet, FTP, etc... :P
P6:59:10 <Super-Dot> Though I need to figure out whether I can make such a server first
P6:59:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmkay
P7:00:00 <Super-Dot> The idea is to generate a level twice as tall as usual, with a regular level at the bottom and an upside-down level at the top
P7:00:13 <Super-Dot> And, once an hour, use a script to flip the whole thing upside down
P7:00:29 <Snowman> lol would be awesome
P7:00:31 <Super-Dot> Which would probably entail warning everyone and then kicking them out for a moment
P7:00:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you set up the script as a cronjob, it's not an issue
P7:00:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm more concerned about the bind exceptions

P7:03:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> On OS X Opera has that problem
P7:03:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Every time
P7:03:48 <Shoozza> the other problem is that mac os x has just java 1.5 with 32bit os
P7:03:49 <Super-Dot> Shoozza: The workaround I've been using is to click outside the Java applet while it's loading, and to click inside only once you see the world
P7:04:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Shoozza, that's true
P7:04:15 <Super-Dot> Yeah, Java 1.5 is annoying
P7:04:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Switch to Linux?

P7:06:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> No idea
P7:06:35 <Super-Dot> Hmm
P7:06:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Speak to JTE or aera about htat
P7:06:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> They reverse engineered the protocol
P7:07:19 <Shoozza> i want to add more feature to the chat console
P7:07:25 <Super-Dot> JTE made his own level storage system, so I'm not sure that he can help
P7:07:34 <Super-Dot> Though he probably does understand the system
P7:08:09 <Super-Dot> When a server gets shut off, does the level get squished into a server_level.dat again?
P7:08:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> no

P7:10:36 <Super-Dot> So it would be possible to tell everyone "hey the map's getting flipped now" when that happens
P7:10:49 <Super-Dot> And flip the server_level.dat
P7:11:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> It would probably look like this: Warn the people, kill java, run the script to flip the level, start up java
P7:11:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> You could easily do a cronjob to do all that
P7:11:23 <Shoozza> hey does someone know how to undo that java disallow thingy on mac os?

P8:03:19 <Shoozza> The solution to get it running again was: restart browser

P8:18:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha.... Are people really dumb enough to run the server as root?
P8:18:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's the #2 dumbest way to run a Minecraft server, after using a GUI
P8:19:27 <Shoozza> meh safari fails
P8:20:18 <Shoozza> it has the same issues but the workaround fails
P8:20:57 <Shoozza> also nice: when you press command + t MC gets an exception and quits
P8:21:30 <Super-Dot> There are GUIs for Minecraft servers now? :O
P8:21:49 <Shoozza> but at least it doesnt show the screen of MC on every tab if its open
P8:22:01 <Shoozza> (that happens in fx)
P8:23:05 <mail2345> wait, why not run a server as root?
P8:23:13 <mail2345> though I'm not runing as root, fyi
P8:23:24 <mail2345> don't think anyone will take the effort
P8:23:25 <Shoozza> wait why dont give a baby a gun
P8:23:30 <mail2345> of breaching MC
P8:23:59 <mail2345> there are about 218 servers
P8:24:00 <Super-Dot> If you run Minecraft as root, breaching MC means breaching the whole dang computer
P8:24:06 <mail2345> not much of a target
P8:24:21 <mail2345> why take down MC, when you can take down more common fruit
P8:24:38 <Super-Dot> It could be fun if you enjoy hacking without ulterior motives
P8:24:46 <Shoozza> lol what is the problem? too lazy to read the useradd manpage :P?
P8:24:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> mail2345, any software in the stack can have a vulnerability... Adura's script, JSON, Perl, Java itself, Miencraft server
P8:25:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> One of those and you're F-F-F-F-FUCKED
P8:25:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> especially if it's a production machine
P8:25:40 <Shoozza> especially if it runs programms
P8:25:51 <PuyoDead> P-P-P-POWERBOOK
P8:26:46 <Shoozza> oh nice safari crashed when i closed it
P8:26:59 <Shoozza> i guess MC has good influence :)
P8:27:31 <Super-Dot> It's so nice that I'm not alone in my OS X problems
P8:27:39 <Super-Dot> Although it isn't
P8:28:14 <Shoozza> well i just tested it today and i can say mac os x isn't really that nice
P8:28:39 <Super-Dot> It's not for everyone
P8:28:50 <Shoozza> but maybe its just normal that everything crashes what i touch
P8:29:30 <Super-Dot> The main problem is that Apple creates Java distributions rather than Sun
P8:29:41 <Shoozza> how long do you use mac os x?
P8:29:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> You could theoretically compile the JRE
P8:30:00 <Super-Dot> I've been on it for two years now, I think
P8:30:36 <Shoozza> why they want do this? I mean they are slow. Even linux has the stuff earlier.
12P8:30:48 * citricsquidatlan (sam@client-86-25-243-53.mcr-bng-013.adsl.virginmedia.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P8:30:55 <Super-Dot> Theoretically, but if it made everything better someone would have done it by now
P8:30:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just saying... if you want to use 6
P8:31:34 <Super-Dot> There are probably countless confusing problems with doing so
P8:31:51 <Shoozza> well i guess since i can run the emulated version of 6 ( the 64bit version) i dont need to
P8:32:16 <Super-Dot> Apple wants to make Java distributions because it wants Java on OS X to not suck
P8:32:26 <Super-Dot> It does suck, but in different ways
P8:32:38 <Shoozza> btw why does mac os require you to press command + Q to close an app 
P8:32:59 <Super-Dot> Because it's a different design philosophy from Windows
P8:33:30 <Shoozza> also installing stuff is different
P8:33:44 <Shoozza> often i cannot delete the dmg packages when i installed stuff
P8:33:51 <Super-Dot> Installing stuff is a pain because third-party developers are stupid
P8:33:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Shoozza, you ahve to make sure you move the .app to Applications
P8:34:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Run it from there, not the DMG
P8:34:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it's 100x better than Windows' install
P8:34:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linux is 1000x better than both
P8:34:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> package management > all
P8:34:33 <Shoozza> you mean copy the dmg to the folder and then run it?
P8:34:38 <Super-Dot> The established procedure is to download the DMG, mount the DMG, drag the .app onto your hard drive, eject the DMG, and delete the DMG
P8:34:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> no
P8:34:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> open the dmg, drag the .app to applications
P8:34:46 <Shoozza> yeah apt-get install virus
P8:34:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> eject the volume not the DMG
P8:34:54 <Super-Dot> DMG is short for "disk image"
P8:35:02 <Super-Dot> It's like a fake CD
P8:35:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's just a volume
P8:35:15 <Shoozza> i see its on my desk
P8:35:19 <Super-Dot> Except rather than being stored in a disk, it's stored in a file
P8:36:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyone here have good graphics design skills?
P8:36:06 <Shoozza> the funny thing is that i am used to rename files when i open or save files which is not possible on mac os x
P8:36:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'd like to design and sell a Minecraft wallet
P8:36:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> $15... would anyone be interested in buying>
P8:36:28 <Super-Dot> I'm a good graphic design critic, but not much of a graphic designer
P8:36:54 <Super-Dot> Shoozza, what do you mean?
P8:37:57 <Shoozza> example on windows: I edit stuff in notepad then save it and then want to save it again but i notice an old txt is there too with a wrong name so i rename it.
P8:38:08 <Shoozza> this happens while i am in the save file dialog
P8:38:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> umm... you can do that on OS X easily
P8:38:22 <Shoozza> i think thats not possible on mac
P8:38:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> what?
P8:38:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's very possible....
P8:38:35 <Shoozza> not in the save dialog
P8:38:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> umm yeah it is
P8:38:41 <Super-Dot> What you're describing isn't possible, yeah
P8:38:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> save it as a new name?
P8:38:56 <Super-Dot> AlLnAtuRalX, he means renaming a different file from the one you're saving
P8:38:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> save as -> type whatever
P8:39:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh
P8:39:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> no idea

P8:42:03 <Shoozza> which editor do you use Super-Dot 
P8:42:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> On Linux, ummm... I forget which was the good one
P8:42:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know it's Notepad++ on Windows
P8:42:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> TextMate, that was it
P8:42:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm thinking of changing my online persona to vede instead of vdgmprgrmr. Retains the "v-d" theme, while not being directly conducive to venereal disease comments.
P8:42:33 <Super-Dot> I use several depending on how I feel that day
P8:42:51 <Shoozza> i use vim for my linux server
P8:42:54 <Super-Dot> TextEdit is good for text
P8:43:00 <Super-Dot> Bean is good for essays
P8:43:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> NEdit / vi life.
P8:43:06 <Shoozza> good that is available on mac too
P8:43:13 <Super-Dot> Xcode and Smultron are good for code

P8:43:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> there's a graphical vim for OS X Shoozza

P8:56:44 <mail2345> ugh rapidshare
P8:56:50 <Super-Dot> And adding flames and smoke
P8:57:25 <Shoozza> AlLnAtuRalX: do you have links to the stuff SA members did?
P8:57:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes
12P8:58:10 * d0ohan (doohan@client-86-10-10-141.leed.adsl.virgin.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P8:58:22 <Shoozza> what about now?
P8:58:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> still yes
P8:58:28 <Shoozza> :)
P8:58:33 <mail2345> 2d replace first layer of water with grass
P8:58:47 <Shoozza> would like to see how far they are
P8:59:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmkay
P9:00:47 <mail2345> starting up SCP/
P9:01:29 <Shoozza> Super-Dot: you know how to open zip files windows like?
P9:01:56 <Super-Dot> You can't
P9:02:06 <Super-Dot> You have to unzip them to see their contents
P9:02:13 <Shoozza> doh
P9:02:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are plenty of programs that'll do it "windows-like"
P9:02:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Like I said, you'll be happier if you stop expecting everything to be like Windows
P9:02:32 <Shoozza> how to zip them again?
P9:02:34 <Super-Dot> I think it automatically trashes the .zip and puts the contents in a folder
10P9:02:38 * Setveen (Mibbit@d24-57-111-173.home.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
P9:02:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> sounds like me you're missing the point of OS X :P
P9:02:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> sounds to me*
P9:02:45 <Setveen> boobs
P9:02:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Shoozza, right click the files/folder, create archive
P9:03:05 <Shoozza> heh ok
P9:03:09 <Super-Dot> In Leopard, it's "Compress"
P9:03:21 <Shoozza> AlLnAtuRalX: its just i want to rempace one file in the zip
P9:03:39 <Super-Dot> Can you even do that on Windows?
P9:03:41 <Shoozza> dunno if thats so good to extract it everytime
P9:03:51 <Super-Dot> I thought you couldn't
P9:03:56 <Shoozza> 7zip does nice job
P9:04:08 <Leight0n> Is it bad if I spent the last 30 minutes counting the blocks on the outer layer of my castle?
P9:04:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> 7zip should have an OS X version
P9:04:16 <mail2345> yes.
P9:04:19 <Leight0n> :s
P9:04:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's bad that you HAVE a castle
P9:04:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> they're so cliched
P9:04:31 <Shoozza> whats the common way to search for mac os x software?
P9:04:34 <Leight0n> eh
P9:04:37 <Super-Dot> 7zip is Windows-only
P9:04:41 <Leight0n> mines based off a few things
P9:04:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Super-Dot, I'm 100% sure there's a command line linux util
P9:04:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> ive used it before
P9:04:52 <Leight0n> not your medieval drawbridge kind :P
P9:04:55 <Super-Dot> Though Macs can open 7zip files, yeah
P9:05:10 <Super-Dot> But it sounds like he wants a GUI for wrangling
P9:05:26 <Shoozza> http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
P9:05:34 <Shoozza> unofficial stuff yeah
P9:05:51 <Shoozza> so whats the normal zip tool ppl use on mac?
P9:06:00 <Super-Dot> Protip: http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html unzips a million formats
P9:06:28 <Super-Dot> You can open .zips and a bunch of disk image formats by default by double-clicking them
P9:06:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Protip: unrar in Linux unzips rars, unzip unzips zips, and 7zip 7zs
P9:06:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> unrars rars I guess
P9:06:56 <LG_Legacy> Huzzah for 7-zip
P9:07:01 <LG_Legacy> Thats my main unpacker
P9:07:39 <Shoozza> is Notch often here?
P9:07:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> 7z's a pretty cool buddy

P9:15:47 <LG_Legacy> I knew it: http://i32.tinypic.com/21jdo9x.png I was so right
P9:17:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Would you guys be willing to pay $20 shipped for a Minecraft plush?
P9:17:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have a guy that can make them
P9:17:27 <LG_Legacy> Heh
P9:17:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> But they're handmade, so that's how much they'll run
P9:17:42 <LG_Legacy> I would if i could <_<
P9:17:47 <LG_Legacy> Hell i would even buy minecraft if i could

P9:19:48 <Super-Dot> That's the problem with free web games
P9:20:07 <Super-Dot> Their fans tend to mostly not like spending money
P9:20:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> ill get you guys a sample, hold one
P9:20:33 <PuyoDead> I wonder how things will change here when the game goes full paid (minus the free sandbox)
P9:20:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh, I can't wait
P9:20:58 <Super-Dot> The game right now pretty much IS the free sandbox
P9:21:14 <Super-Dot> With the exception of skins and a few custom(ized) servers
P9:22:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> what's that firefox extension to screenshot the whole page >.<
P9:22:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> got it
P9:24:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm far more partial to the wallets, but ill upt he plush stuff first
P9:24:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://imgur.com/2nioD.jpg
P9:25:07 <PuyoDead> cool stuff
P9:25:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold on, wallets are way cooler
P9:25:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> only problem is the first page is a full first page, so the image is way larger... h/o
P9:25:58 <Super-Dot> Ah, so levels are held in RAM while the server is running
13P9:26:07 * Super-Dot wonders why this didn't occur to him before
P9:26:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes
P9:26:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Did I not say that?
P9:26:20 <Daveisawesome> hai
P9:26:25 <Daveisawesome> :D
P9:26:44 <Daveisawesome> whats up mah homies
P9:26:56 <Super-Dot> I don't think you did, but it should have occurred to me
P9:27:07 <Super-Dot> Hello Daveisawesome
P9:27:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> hmm could've sworn I did... whatever :P
P9:27:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> gawd this is a huge image
P9:28:09 <Shoozza> cant believe it the other unarchiver does the same unpacking 
P9:28:12 <LG_Legacy> Btw random server is random http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=ca9be602d61389aa41b7fbe82d502541
P9:31:00 <Shoozza> Super-Dot: if thats true and the server doesnt save them form time to time a crash can be fatal :S
P9:31:12 <Super-Dot> The server does save them from time to time
P9:31:29 <Super-Dot> I wonder how often
P9:31:36 <Shoozza> yeah
P9:31:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> HOLY SHIT
P9:31:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> wallet.png - 47.4 MB
P9:31:57 <Shoozza> whats the filename it saves too?
P9:32:08 <Super-Dot> Nice
P9:32:14 <Super-Dot> server_level.dat
P9:32:19 <PuyoDead> ehh
P9:32:28 <PuyoDead> good lord man, jpg it
P9:32:32 <Super-Dot> AlLnAtuRalX, how often does the server save the current map?
P9:32:46 <Super-Dot> Yeah, jpg compression is no biggie
P9:32:47 <Shoozza> just make it unwriteable and wait till the server starts crying :)
P9:32:57 <Super-Dot> Haha
P9:33:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> wallet.jpg is 4.9

P9:51:06 <LG_Legacy> Only if you like to throw people with mind control, control them, cset them on fire, drain them with electricity
P9:51:08 <LG_Legacy> Heave shit at them
P9:51:15 <LG_Legacy> Crush em with whatever you can find
P9:51:44 <mail2345> Read this, this is aesome: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravoux%27s_slavemaker_ant"
P9:52:03 <LG_Legacy> When i got the demo on those little Xbox discs that had media and demos on it, i spent DAYS playing it in the practice mode throwing people in barrels and what not.
P9:52:43 <LG_Legacy> Oh and ragdoll physics
P9:52:49 <LG_Legacy> Can't go wrong with that
P9:53:00 <LKA> that is a hardcore ant
P9:53:03 <LG_Legacy> A flying barrel to the face? BIFF you fly backwards.
P9:53:05 <LG_Legacy> And it is
P9:53:11 <LG_Legacy> But i bet there is a even more hardcore

P9:53:27 <LKA> not as hardcore as that ant that screams as it divebombs into your face from a tree

P11:29:44 <Animator> Oh hey! PuyoDead's a mod! Congratulations are in order.
P11:29:54 <PuyoDead> danke sehr
P11:30:13 <UncleBibby> eur velk'm
P11:31:43 <UncleBibby> There should be JUST as much western interest into chinese culture as there is into japanese culture...
P11:31:52 <UncleBibby> ...because china is way bigger!
P11:32:25 <UncleBibby> Who thinks hacking is EVIL?
P11:32:37 <PuyoDead> hacking what?
P11:32:48 <UncleBibby> hacking technology in general?
P11:32:51 <PuyoDead> and hacking is never evil, by definition
P11:33:14 <UncleBibby> you know how I get my music?
P11:33:20 <PuyoDead> magic?
P11:33:33 <UncleBibby> I borrow CDs from the library and upload into my ipod
P11:34:04 <PuyoDead> sounds reasonable
P11:34:11 <UncleBibby> thats as evil as my consciounce will let me go
P11:34:57 <UncleBibby> you probably get it using a combination of black market computers and wiccan spells
P11:35:11 <mail2345> hack actually means to
P11:35:22 <PuyoDead> nah, wiccans are terrible at piracy. voodoo is the way to go
P11:35:27 <mail2345> make a strange and quick solution to a problem
P11:35:40 <mail2345> proper term is cracking.

P11:36:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> what.
P11:36:20 <PuyoDead> anyone who goes more into just what the instruction manual says is pretty much a "hacker"
P11:36:55 <UncleBibby> tantric means "tanning trick"
P11:37:10 <UncleBibby> just like how together means "to gather"

P11:40:15 <UncleBibby> who here looked up "Minecraft Hack" and found more than they thought they would?
P11:40:30 <UncleBibby> looked it up on youtube, I mean
P11:41:35 <vede> I guess it's impossible for anything I do to not be hacking...
P11:41:43 <UncleBibby> VEDE!!!!
P11:41:54 <vede> Because not a single instruction manual I've ever read has actually WORKED.
P11:42:12 <UncleBibby> Except the one for the potato peeler
P11:42:18 <mail2345> man pages.
P11:42:37 <UncleBibby> Don't read that book! Read some good old MAN PAGES
P11:42:59 <mail2345> man potato_peeler
P11:43:13 <vede> It's pretty frustrating, knowing that no matter how thorough an instruction manual is, you're gonna have to figure it out on your own.
P11:43:44 <UncleBibby> goodbye, my lovers, I've got to sleep farty winks

P11:44:14 <vede> And usually problems will only be fixed when SOMEONE ELSE does the exact same thing you've been doing, or you just beat the shit out of what you're trying to fix enough that its entire function can only be described as "sitting there and being useless".
