A4:47:32 <Super-Dot> That's true

A4:47:44 <Super-Dot> Nifty :D
A4:47:58 <Super-Dot> Will he also be hosting minecraftskins and minecraftwiki?
A4:48:15 <Tich> Yes please
A4:48:42 <citricsquid> skins, definitely, not sure about the wiki as it's very resource intensive, going to try it out though :)
A4:48:56 <Super-Dot> Cool
A4:49:11 <aera> citricsquid: i take it there's no moneys coming then? :)
A4:49:14 <Super-Dot> Would it be possible to host it on Wikia if that doesn't work?

A5:00:39 <iPope> Guys, Im going to IBM
A5:00:56 <liq3> IBM?
A5:01:03 <Super-Dot> What will you do there?
A5:01:22 <iPope> Work Experience :3
A5:02:07 <liq3> ew.
A5:02:09 <offset> iPope, make me a coffee
A5:02:13 <offset> iPope, clean the toilets
A5:02:26 <offset> >:)
A5:02:33 <liq3> iPope, polish my shoes.
A5:02:35 <iPope> I wont be doing that at IBM will I... WILL I?
A5:02:37 <Super-Dot> Neato
A5:02:48 <offset> You probably will =p
A5:02:56 <iPope> dont say that
A5:03:05 <offset> not the toilets, but the other trivial chores
A5:03:42 <Super-Dot> Also you'll INVENT THE NEXT PROCESSOR
A5:03:54 <Super-Dot> *~/glamour/~*
A5:03:59 <liq3> when they say "work experience" it's really "break the guy so he thinks work is doing nothing but trivial stuff and loses all spirit and motivation"
A5:04:22 <liq3> which also happens to be schools #1 goal.
A5:04:34 <liq3> along with making you as stupid as possible. ;/
A5:04:59 <Super-Dot> School is nice sometimes, but not when they make stupid courses required courses
A5:05:20 <liq3> Super-dot: examples of school being nice? :P
A5:05:55 <Super-Dot> Art classes
A5:06:04 <Super-Dot> Math classes
A5:06:05 <liq3> Art classes are mostly just people drawing w/e.
A5:06:08 <liq3> You can do that without school.
A5:06:10 <liq3> Same with math. :/
A5:06:15 <iPope> Like schools IT courses suck, you could learn more about your computer by browsing Minecraft Forums.
A5:06:24 <Super-Dot> Art classes are great because the school supplies the supplies
A5:06:36 <Super-Dot> Otherwise you'd be paying a lot for some of the stuff
A5:06:50 <liq3> As far as math goes, Khan Academy > school. http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy
A5:07:01 <Super-Dot> Math is great because I could never motivate myself to learn on my own
A5:07:08 <liq3> ...
A5:07:14 <liq3> How do you know that?
A5:07:17 <liq3> Have you ever tried?
A5:07:24 <Super-Dot> Yes I have
A5:07:28 <liq3> And if you can motivate yourself, do you really need to know it?
A5:07:30 <Super-Dot> It didn't work so good
A5:07:31 <liq3> can't*
A5:07:41 <liq3> Super-dot: How long have you been at school?
A5:07:58 <Super-Dot> I'm a Sophomore at university now
A5:08:06 <liq3> Yes, so you've already been broken. :p
A5:08:30 <liq3> One of school's purposes (which is does really really well) is to stop people taking the initiate themselves.
A5:08:38 <liq3> i.e. teaching themselves just about anything.
A5:08:40 <Super-Dot> Math is useful in programming, and programming is useful in game making
A5:08:45 <Super-Dot> And I like game making
A5:09:03 <liq3> Heh. You don't need school to learn it. :/
A5:09:21 <Super-Dot> I needed school to learn Calculus
A5:09:25 <liq3> http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy
A5:09:59 <liq3> Did you?
A5:10:11 <liq3> Do you even use calculusL?
A5:10:12 <liq3> ...
A5:10:38 <Super-Dot> I will, it's useful like EVERYWHERE
A5:11:05 <liq3> you "will"
A5:11:06 <liq3> Right...
A5:11:14 <Super-Dot> >_>
A5:11:20 <liq3> What other things "will" you use that school taught you eh? :P
A5:11:22 <Tich> I tried university maths once, I never knew what maths could be like until then
A5:11:23 <Tich> :(
A5:11:29 <Super-Dot> Have you made a game before?
A5:11:41 <liq3> Super-dot: Yes, only basic stuff though. Pong, Tetris.
A5:11:51 <liq3> I don't have the motivation to make anyhting bigger. :/
A5:11:55 <Super-Dot> Yeah, those things you only need algebra for
A5:11:57 <iPope> I have, I never used calc
A5:12:12 <Super-Dot> In a platformer, you probably don't even need trigonometry
A5:12:20 <iPope> Do
A5:12:22 <liq3> Super-dot: And when would you need calc?
A5:12:26 <iPope> If you want to make it good
A5:12:38 <Super-Dot> But once you divorce yourself from up down left right, trigonometry becomes ubiquitous
A5:12:53 <liq3> trig isn't calc. :/
A5:13:00 <iPope> I thinking more of projectiles
A5:13:02 <Super-Dot> I'm getting to that :U
A5:13:46 <Super-Dot> And once you divorce yourself from basic cause and effect stuff, and start using more complex systems, Calculus becomes ubiquitous
A5:13:51 <Super-Dot> Stuff like liquids
A5:13:56 <liq3> ...
A5:14:05 <Super-Dot> Or gravity converging to a point rather than a plane
A5:14:19 <Super-Dot> Or magnets
A5:14:25 <iPope> Rail guns
A5:14:28 <liq3> Super-dot: point gravity doesn't need calc.
A5:14:46 <Super-Dot> It depends on what you're doing with the point gravity
A5:14:59 <Super-Dot> But yeah, I guess you only need trig for that
A5:15:11 <liq3> magnets?
A5:15:15 <liq3> yeh...
A5:15:27 <liq3> you do realise all the best games use nothing more complex then trig?
A5:15:32 <Super-Dot> Springs
A5:15:44 <Super-Dot> Some games use stuff more complex than trig
A5:16:02 <liq3> Yes, those are generally niche games.
A5:16:04 <iPope> Physics Games
A5:16:04 <Super-Dot> Okay, so Calc isn't ubiquitous, that was an exaggeration
A5:16:11 <Super-Dot> But it's certainly useful sometimes
10A5:16:12 * Snowman is now known as Snowman|Studying
A5:16:15 <iPope> But not for your general game
A5:16:18 <aera> any kind of physics naturally involves calculus
A5:16:19 <liq3> RTS, FPS only use trig.
A5:16:24 <Super-Dot> And I want powers available to me
A5:16:38 <Super-Dot> RTS and FPS are boring :U
A5:16:47 <liq3> Yes, but they cover pretty much every game coding wise. :p
A5:16:56 <liq3> Only other kind is "puzzle" really.
A5:17:21 <Super-Dot> Have you played Plasma Pong?
A5:17:27 <liq3> yes.
A5:17:31 <liq3> It's quite terrible honestly.
A5:17:35 <Super-Dot> D:
A5:17:37 <liq3> Excellent for a pong game.
A5:17:37 <Super-Dot> I love that game
A5:17:41 <liq3> But little replayability.
A5:17:57 <Super-Dot> Well yeah, it is a Pong game

A5:20:40 <iPope> dynamic water for fps would be, maybe?
A5:20:47 <Super-Dot> My last game was an entry in a domestic violence game competition
A5:21:41 <Super-Dot> FPSes generally don't care about water beyond making it look pretty
A5:21:57 <Snowman|Studying> Water is sometimes used for gameplay
A5:22:06 <Snowman|Studying> underwater puzzles
A5:22:30 <Super-Dot> Yeah, but that water doesn't usually act like real water
A5:22:34 <liq3> Yes, even basic water lags horribly.
A5:22:49 <liq3> At least the way it's been done. ;/
A5:22:59 <Snowman|Studying> No cause to have that you need like 25 nasa supercomputers just to calculate a glass of water
A5:23:11 <iPope> Phun does water
A5:23:13 <Snowman|Studying> Real water is heavy on performance
A5:23:19 <iPope> Albeit its rubbish
A5:23:27 <Snowman|Studying> Very heavy
A5:23:38 <Snowman|Studying> the best there is atm is like water made up out of small balls
A5:24:03 <iPope> isnt that what a liquid is, small particles :P
A5:24:23 <Snowman|Studying> yeah but the balls there are used arent nearly as small as real water
A5:25:12 <Snowman|Studying> And also, water applies a force on itsself irl, but not afaik in games
A5:25:37 <Snowman|Studying> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwASbUzt0s
A5:26:10 <iPope> Is that real time?

A5:26:36 <iPope> Thats awesome
A5:26:44 <iPope> Can it do all liquids?
A5:26:55 <offset> The tech demo just has that
A5:27:00 <Snowman|Studying> at 1:08 you can see the little balls
A5:27:11 <iPope> Yeh seen them
A5:27:34 <iPope> Thats very awesome

A8:04:05 <mezo> i like the equipment in viewport

A8:05:26 <mezo> you should put a fade timer on resources and recycle them back into the map
A8:05:28 <08Notch> i find it very entertaining to run around holding a rose
A8:05:36 <mezo> so we cant just leave heaps of stuff littered around the bases
A8:05:42 <citricsquid> Notch: When do we get a screenshot of you running up to ez holding a rose? :D
A8:05:43 <08Notch> yeah, resources vanish after a few minutes
A8:05:44 <Magnulus> The new video looks really good. Looking forward to it.
A8:05:50 <08Notch> dunno how to recycle it, really..
A8:05:53 <mezo> yea
A8:06:01 <Snowman> Notch, can other people see what you are holding?
A8:06:05 <mezo> maybe just add another gold block somewhere
A8:06:08 <Maulrus> [08:04] <@Notch> although you CAN just go hide in a corner and be safe forever
A8:06:09 <mezo> or whatever kind of ore it was
A8:06:10 <Maulrus> i see myself doing that
A8:06:11 <08Notch> i finally implemented simple space partitioning on the collision detection last night
A8:06:11 <Maulrus> a alot
A8:06:21 <08Notch> went from O(n^2 ) to O(n), pretty much
A8:06:29 <Magnulus> Can you carry as much as you want?
A8:06:38 <mezo> the pushing is good for friendly/neutral stuff
A8:06:40 <08Notch> collision between mobs went from MOST EXPENSIVE THING IN THE GAME to PRETTY CHEAP, ACTUALLY
A8:06:44 <Zachariasmith> ok i gotta go
A8:06:46 <mezo> imo should be hard collision on opponents
A8:06:54 <mezo> PRETTY CHEAP, ACTUALLY
A8:06:55 <08Notch> there's a cap of 99 per type at the moment, Magnulus
A8:07:02 <Zachariasmith> the game is looking very good notch 
A8:07:04 <Zachariasmith> congrats
A8:07:09 <Zachariasmith> bye everyone
A8:07:14 <08Notch> mezo: Hard collisions don't work too well with lag
A8:07:23 <08Notch> thanks Zachariasmith =) bye
A8:07:24 <Snowman> Notch, if 1 slot if full, can you fill a diferent one with the same material?

A8:07:37 <Magnulus> Well, that's not bad.
A8:07:39 <08Notch> No, Snowman. But that's an interesting idea
A8:07:52 <Snowman> So you could carry like 150 stone
A8:07:54 <Magnulus> 99 should be more than enough, though.
A8:07:59 <mezo> what kind of lag are we talking about? works fine in halflife and stuff
A8:08:01 <08Notch> 99 fills up pretty fast
A8:08:19 <08Notch> brb, more cooking!!
A8:08:22 <Magnulus> yeah, but not so fast as to be annoying, I would imagine.
A8:08:24 <08Notch> oh yeah, it does..
A8:08:25 <Magnulus> FOOD!
A8:08:34 <Peerko> 99 is not enough
A8:08:43 <Snowman> Especially when diggin out a cave
A8:08:52 <Peerko> if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing
A8:09:14 <Snowman> Oh and do you pick up the blocks automatically?
A8:09:22 <Snowman> or do you have to press something?
A8:09:28 <Peerko> just walk over them iirc
A8:09:33 <citricsquid> Snowman: looks automatic in the video
A8:09:34 <Snowman> yeah thought that
A8:10:29 <08Notch> the resources get picked up when you get close
A8:10:40 <08Notch> omg frying noises. sizzle. omg
A8:10:52 <Snowman> And if all slots are full they just stay there for a few minutes before they vanish
A8:11:09 <zagabar> Frying stuff smells awesome. Especially with onion. Now I got hungry damn you!!!
A8:11:31 <Snowman> frying onions is awesome, cutting them isnt
A8:11:44 <Snowman> I had a really strong one last week

A8:12:10 <zagabar> citricsquid: Yeah! Full HP!
A8:12:30 <Snowman> We need caviar in the game :D
A8:12:35 <citricsquid> "You found a steak, now prepare it!" *sizzle* "Steak ready, you're almost as good as Notch!"
A8:13:00 <Snowman> How do you prepare it? throw it in the laval? :p
A8:13:43 <zagabar> Maybe put it on a block near lava to fry it. and meanwhile, the lava spawns lava golems that you have to fend off from the steak
A8:13:57 <zagabar> When it is done, you can eat it for full hp. XD

A8:38:18 <citricsquid> DNS servers dictate where domains are pointed to
A8:38:20 <08Notch> thank you sir
A8:38:27 <citricsquid> and normally you'll be using your ISPs and they update not very often
A8:38:32 <citricsquid> and OPENDNS is pretty much instant
A8:38:33 <Quatroking> does it speed up or not
A8:38:37 <Snowman> A dns server basically translates the url you enter to an ip, and connects you to it
A8:38:43 <citricsquid> it'll make domain changes resolve instantly
A8:38:47 <Snowman> And yes it does
A8:38:50 <citricsquid> so if you switch to opendns forum will load.
A8:38:56 <Snowman> cause its faster than the one you have atm probably
A8:39:01 <LG_Legacy> Bzzt
A8:39:14 <BoirG> openDNs is much faster, yes. however, how do i switch. i know that my  friend uses it, but...
A8:39:14 <LG_Legacy> Oh hey cool
A8:39:25 <citricsquid> BoirG: You need access to your router
A8:39:30 <citricsquid> then you just switch the IPs around
A8:39:32 <BoirG> yup i have dat
A8:39:33 <citricsquid> it's very easy :D

A10:23:30 <citricsquid> lemme see if I can change it
A10:23:34 <aera> no, everything comes from 127.0.0.1 because of the whole lighttpf-apache conf

A10:23:47 <Peerko> can I just give you some infos and you create an account for me in the meantime, aera?
A10:23:54 <aera> and/or make it use the forwarded header

A11:20:46 <aera> what other feature were you planning?
A11:20:49 <citricsquid> aera: I meant like gameservers
A11:20:53 <Peerko> so ehm, this needs updating citricsquid http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=628
A11:21:04 <citricsquid> so you could get a free server, for minecraft.
A11:21:08 <aera> ahhhhhh
A11:21:22 <aera> and then presumably buy a beefier one :)
A11:21:53 <citricsquid> I gave up though, partly because of the bug that means you have to change a servers port after rebooting and mainly because I'm lazy :D
A11:22:11 <citricsquid> then I decided to make it into a more advanced server list with reviews, but didn't even start that

A11:58:30 <asiekierka> "craftr"
A11:59:13 <gordenfreechmen> ok
A11:59:30 <gordenfreechmen> probably wont become so terribly popular though
A11:59:35 <Marach> be fast with it
A11:59:44 <Marach> :)
P12:00:02 <asiekierka> I don't want it to be terribly popular
P12:00:06 <asiekierka> I want it to be free
P12:00:13 <asiekierka> and preferably open source
P12:00:14 <Marach> what language do you use?
P12:00:20 <asiekierka> Pascal I guess
P12:00:25 <asiekierka> not sure yet
P12:00:29 <asiekierka> but i know pascal the most
P12:00:33 <Marach> use C++ and SDL!
P12:00:33 <gordenfreechmen> add the feature to make custom player skins
P12:00:35 <gordenfreechmen> please :(
P12:00:36 <ZomBuster> pascal is uh not very suitable
P12:00:47 <asiekierka> Marach: C++ and GLUT you mean
P12:00:50 <Marach> then it can be ported to everything
P12:00:50 <asiekierka> also i hate C++
P12:00:51 <ZomBuster> but it's not that hard to learn a different language
P12:00:54 <asiekierka> If anything I'd use C

P12:02:13 <asiekierka> I guess GLUT
P12:02:17 <asiekierka> cuz it's the most portable, lol
P12:02:23 <Marach> use SDL + OpenGL!
P12:02:26 <asiekierka> you have OpenGL-esque libs on the DS and the Wii
P12:02:28 <Marach> thats most portable
P12:02:33 <asiekierka> SDL on DS sucks and SDL on Wii is... unfinished
P12:02:33 <Conundrumer> has anyone ever made a race track that involves using the hack that enables you to move really fast?
P12:02:43 <Marach> SDL on PSP is fully ported
P12:02:49 <asiekierka> I DON'T OWN A PSP
P12:03:00 <Marach> so i will do a port
P12:03:14 <asiekierka> k :P

P12:05:10 <Marach> there is "pspgl"
P12:05:11 <asiekierka> Could be probably ported to the wii 'swell then

P12:05:54 <asiekierka> not like i care :P
P12:06:05 <asiekierka> Also pascal is portable to PC platforms as well
P12:06:08 <Marach> you dont have to change a single line of code to compile on both pc and psp
P12:06:11 <asiekierka> Though it can't be ported to the PSP, though

P3:48:32 <calaris> Heya people
P3:48:35 <Siiseli> spawns fashion
P3:48:37 <doohan> lo calaris
P3:48:47 <Siiseli> spawns people who live by societys definitions
P3:48:55 <Siiseli> they feed on each other for information
P3:48:57 <doohan> Siiseli, we're just not cool.
P3:49:02 <doohan> We just "don't get Wow"
P3:49:02 <liq3> Real: WoW takes no real skill, that's the big problem with it. It's simply a matter of investing time, mindlessly.
P3:49:03 <Siiseli> they go by the flow
P3:49:13 <Siiseli> they do what the other guys do
P3:49:18 <Siiseli> losing all individuality
P3:49:44 <Siiseli> they become gray mass whose life follow the same stupid patterns, they dress the same, they act the same, they have trends like fucking twitter
P3:49:45 <liq3> Siiseli: "You laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same" - Some person I can't remember.
P3:49:54 <Siiseli> liq3, yeah
P3:50:05 <Siiseli> but I don't bring my being "different" up
P3:50:07 <Siiseli> that's just silly

P3:50:41 <Real> liq3: This started of by you implying that WoW makes people happy by adversely affecting other people's happiness. I still don't see how that is true.
10P3:50:50 * Siiseli sets mode: +b *!*arricadei@*.kymp.net
P3:50:52 <doohan> Patrick, you are an idiot.
P3:51:00 <Siiseli> too late
P3:51:01 <Siiseli> sorry
P3:51:03 <doohan> What is he trying to say anyway?
P3:51:07 <liq3> Real: It degrades society. People could be doing better things with their time hten playing WoW.
P3:51:21 <Siiseli> doohan, that's finnish for "suck a dick you dickboys"
P3:51:26 <doohan> Ahh
P3:51:26 <Siiseli> so yeah, he's retarded
P3:51:34 <doohan> Yeah he's pretty stupid.
P3:51:35 <ZomBuster> ah boring
P3:51:41 <Siiseli> so yeha
P3:51:42 <ZomBuster> some steam scammer
P3:51:47 <Real> liq3: And lots of people are! They remain doing these "better" things and their happiness is not at all affected by some fat schlub in Switzerland leveling up his gnome.
P3:51:48 <doohan> Him and his other friend helping him type.
P3:51:51 <Siiseli> leaving Patrick here so he can watch us mock his intelligence
P3:51:58 <liq3> Real: It is, indirectly. :p
P3:52:00 <ZomBuster> I act like im french and I dont know any english
P3:52:11 <Marach|java> in example http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/05/fail-safe.php this game doesnt make you happy when you win... it makes you try again just to find out that other endings are even worse...
P3:52:14 <doohan> Siiseli, you reckon he can read english?
P3:52:19 <Siiseli> doohan, oh right
P3:52:21 <Real> liq3: HOW? Please, how could the two things possibly be related?
P3:52:23 <doohan> :)
10P3:52:24 * Patrick was kicked by Siiseli (because I like doing that)
P3:52:29 <doohan> I wanted to do that.
P3:52:35 <Siiseli> I did it for you
P3:52:35 <calaris> I wonder how many pm's notch gets when he comes on?
P3:52:38 <Siiseli> :D
P3:52:39 <doohan> Too many
P3:52:40 <Siiseli> a million?
P3:52:54 <liq3> Real: Because one day he might bump into this guy (who's mostly likely a dick). 
P3:52:55 <Real> 5 times the number of people in the chat
P3:53:18 <Real> liq3: Seriously? That's your argument? I think you're missing your own point.
P3:53:23 <liq3> Real: No, not really.
P3:53:36 <doohan> Real, if the people that play wow play to the point of being unfit lazy slobs then its'
P3:53:38 <doohan> my problem
P3:53:40 <liq3> Real: And yes, I think I am missing my own point. Hang on.
P3:53:43 <doohan> I have to pay tax
P3:53:55 <doohan> Which is spent by the nhs to treat fat people.
P3:53:57 <liq3> doohan wins! :P
P3:54:09 <liq3> Real: These people who waste their time playing WoW aren't helping society at all. 
P3:54:22 <Siiseli> so yeah. I don't bring up my views on the state of the world, I don't comment on what people like to do with their spare time, I don't comment on how they are all mindless consumers in this consumer driven culture and I don't tell them they're all the same, stupid and happy, I don't tell them to change I know they're happier than me. In irl, that is
P3:54:24 <calaris> I say, people who play wow, are so stupid to donate the insane amount of time they do donate to it, that their quite frankly best staying there playing wow
P3:54:25 <liq3> They accomplish NOTHING playing it.
P3:54:32 <Siiseli> that way I can live my life in peace
P3:54:35 <calaris> instead of getting in our way with their innate stupidity
13P3:54:41 * TheOne thinks the chat moves to fast to read...
P3:55:02 <Real> liq3: While they may not be helping society, they certainly aren't hurting it.
P3:55:10 <liq3> Siiseli: Darn. I'd agree with you, but most poeple I see are less happy then I am. And I'm some guy with no social life that sits n his PC every waking hour, so imagine how sad they are? :P
P3:55:14 <doohan> calaris, if you can double the cost and make half of that tax I'm all for it
P3:55:14 <Siiseli> the negative stuff I think will not help them realize their silly "mistakes" if you can call them that. I bet I'd be happier if I didn't know anything about anything
13P3:55:24 * Marach|java agrees with TheOne
P3:55:30 <Siiseli> anyway
P3:55:32 <Siiseli> rant over
P3:55:35 <calaris> "I dont comment on how they are all mindless consumers in this consumer driven culture and i dont tell them they are all the same" says the person who plays the most commercial and popular mmo :P
P3:55:37 <Siiseli> needed to get that off my chest
P3:55:38 <TheOne> thats a first
P3:55:44 <Siiseli> calaris, I don't play wow?
P3:55:49 <Siiseli> did you think I play wow?
P3:55:54 <liq3> Real: They acctually are. You're either moving forward or backwards, there is no inbetween.
P3:55:57 <doohan> I think he meant minecraft.
P3:56:00 <Siiseli> frankly I'm offended calaris

P3:56:17 <Siiseli> doohan, minecraft is not an mmo. Not the most popular. Not the most commercial
P3:56:20 <calaris> I did
P3:56:27 <calaris> Fortunantly you don't seem retarded :P so I changed my mind
P3:56:29 <Real> liq3: I believe there certainly is an in between. There are always neutral factors.
P3:56:32 <Siiseli> calaris, well I don't. I tried it out to be able to juge it
P3:56:33 <doohan> Yeah, I know that Siiseli, but it's what he meant.
P3:56:36 <calaris> Minecraft is technically a MMO
P3:56:38 <calaris> just not a MMORPG
P3:56:39 <Siiseli> doohan, no he meant wow.
P3:56:45 <Siiseli> calaris, it's not massive 
P3:56:48 <Siiseli> it's an mo
P3:56:49 <Siiseli> at most
P3:57:00 <liq3> Real: Nope. If you are moving forward, you stagnate, which is the same as moving backwards.
P3:57:00 <calaris> true, room based games aint MMO, my mistake
P3:57:06 <Marach|java> MO
P3:57:15 <Siiseli> anyway, calaris I tried WoW just so that I wouldn't be one of those dicks whining about something they haven't even tried
P3:57:15 <liq3> arent*
P3:57:17 <doohan> liq3, stagnation is neither moving forward or backwards
10P3:57:20 * gdude2002 (colesgaret@93.107.140.87) has joined #minecraft
P3:57:24 <doohan> Backwards is regression
P3:57:27 <doohan> Stagnation is nothing
P3:57:27 <gdude2002> Hai guise
P3:57:33 <doohan> And forward is discovery and new stuff
P3:57:45 <Siiseli> forced myself to pay for a month or two and then decided to never touch it again ever
10P3:57:50 * Saer is now known as furryhobo
P3:57:52 <liq3> doohan: Stop exercising (not moving forward or back) and you're muscles degrade. Pretty much every aspect of RL is the same.
P3:57:53 <Real> liq3: How is "not moving" the same as "moving backwards"? That literally makes no sense.
P3:58:16 <doohan> Well in that example liq3 gave I'll give him a point
P3:58:22 <doohan> But that's more literal
P3:58:24 <gdude2002> Guys, can you do me a favour?
P3:58:40 <Siiseli> nope
P3:58:40 <TheOne> ?
P3:58:43 <Siiseli> shoot
P3:58:43 <vede_SLEEP> I wouldn't say that that's true of all aspects of real life, but in a few, it is.
P3:58:44 <Dilt> Hum?
P3:58:44 <gdude2002> I need to find ho the ophack works, The Archives got hit by it
10P3:58:46 * vede_SLEEP is now known as vede
P3:58:47 <gdude2002> how*
P3:58:54 <Siiseli> umm, what
P3:58:55 <liq3> A good example is culture. If the culture doesn't keep trying to improve itself, it will eventually get corrupted.
P3:58:59 <gdude2002> Because, It really shouldn't be able to work :P
P3:58:59 <TheOne> interesting
P3:59:11 <gdude2002> Seeing as it uses Python
P3:59:20 <doohan> Anyone else getting spammed by Patrick in pm?
P3:59:24 <gdude2002> Nope
P3:59:28 <Siiseli> doohan, haha. Ignore him
P3:59:35 <Siiseli> he's permabanned anyway
P3:59:35 <gdude2002> Anyway, #archives if you want to discuss this :P
P3:59:44 <vede> A culture can hardly improve itself. Cultures can change, but I'd say cultures are also pretty neutral.
P3:59:46 <doohan> Well if I can find an ircop I'll try get him banned from the network
P3:59:52 <doohan> :)
P3:59:53 <gdude2002> Is vede a bot by any chance? :P
P3:59:56 <doohan> Yes.
P3:59:57 <liq3> Real: Also, those fat lazy slobs playing WoW have to be supported by society, since they clearly can't support themselves. 
P3:59:57 <Siiseli> doohan, yeah
P3:59:58 <vede> What?
P3:59:59 <TheOne> try #help
P4:00:05 <gdude2002> lol.
P4:00:05 <vede> Why would I be a bot?
P4:00:08 <gdude2002> No idea :D
P4:00:09 <Siiseli> liq3, wrong
P4:00:15 <gdude2002> Mine tends to talk like that though
P4:00:16 <liq3> Siiseli: Oh really, how?
P4:00:17 <gdude2002> Anyway,
P4:00:18 <Siiseli> liq3, here's a free tip: don't base arguements on stereotypes
P4:00:25 <gdude2002> If anyone has anything on the ophack
P4:00:29 <gdude2002> Please join #archives :P
P4:00:31 <Siiseli> makes you look like a silly person
P4:00:39 <liq3> Siiseli: "Fat, lazy slobs". I didn't mean every person playing WoW.
P4:00:47 <Siiseli> liq3, sounded like it
P4:00:54 <vede> In liq3's defense, he really didn't say that all people playing WoW were fat, lazy slobs.
P4:01:06 <Siiseli> sorry if I misunderstood you but that's because of your phrasing or something
P4:01:08 <calaris> Hey guys
P4:01:14 <Siiseli> or me being tired. Or pie
P4:01:18 <calaris> What's the most popular current Minecraft server?
P4:01:19 <Real> liq3: Clearly? Really? That cannot be said of the majority of players. Now, I'm not trying to defend WoW by any means, and I'm not a player. But to make a sweeping generlaization that all of its players are incapable of supporting themselves is ridiculous.

P4:01:27 <gdude2002> It's The Archives, I believe
P4:01:31 <liq3> Siiseli: Actually, it seems to be the natural way for most people to interpet that phrasing. It's the second time that's happened.
P4:01:34 <gdude2002> It's ufullsually pretty 
P4:01:38 <calaris> how many plyers does archives get?
P4:01:41 <Siiseli> liq3, yeah
P4:01:42 <gdude2002> Usually pretty full*
P4:01:49 <liq3> Siiseli: Which is sad, because it's the wrong way. :P
P4:01:51 <gdude2002> It has a max of 32, usually got about 15
10P4:01:51 * furryhobo is now known as Saer
P4:01:56 <vede> Although, "fat lazy slobs" are pretty much a problem no matter what they happen to be playing, so specifying WoW was pointless...
P4:02:00 <calaris> haha
P4:02:00 <TheOne> Id say mine, I get full with 20 
P4:02:03 <calaris> thats not the most popular
P4:02:03 <gdude2002> Give it about 20 secs, it's being upgraded
P4:02:04 <liq3> vede: haha good point. :P
P4:02:09 <TheOne> tat least half the day
P4:02:09 <Siiseli> you should add something to define more specifically that it's only meant to say something about like 1% of WoW players
P4:02:10 <LG_Legacy> Holy shit thats alot of chat
P4:02:11 <calaris> WOM usually has around 20 people + on at once
P4:02:22 <gdude2002> I know

P4:02:39 <calaris> then dont say its the most popular gaaaaargh
P4:02:39 <liq3> Real: You also misinterpeted it haha.
P4:02:41 <Siiseli> so yeah

13P4:02:42 * calaris stares

P4:02:52 <gdude2002> Yes,
P4:02:56 <gdude2002> But they don't visit
P4:02:57 <gdude2002> :P
P4:02:58 <calaris> Honestly though, what would you guys HONESTLY say is the most popular server
P4:03:02 <calaris> dont be advertising your server
P4:03:04 <vede> Chances are they HAVE.
P4:03:05 <calaris> cause im not looking to join it

P4:03:14 <vede> The IRC was used for testing in the Archives.

P4:04:07 <vede> Honestly, all games are basically pointless.
P4:04:13 <calaris> i wanted the right answer, not server advertising in my face
P4:04:15 <liq3> Real: no, i mean all of them.
P4:04:37 <Real> liq3: Okay but I'm still fuzzy on your exact argument here.
P4:04:39 <Quatroking> aera: I've witnessed someone using it today
P4:04:41 <liq3> vede: "Wasted time enjoyed is not wasted time at all."
P4:04:48 <liq3> vede: or something to that effect.
P4:05:02 <aera> Quatroking: right. how does it look?
P4:05:04 <liq3> Real: WoW is not productive in any way what so ever.
P4:05:05 <vede> Yeah, so... you're saying that people who play WoW don't actually enjoy it?
P4:05:16 <vede> Minecraft and Half-Life are not productive either.
P4:05:19 <Real> liq3: My philosophy is that I prefer as many people as possible to be happy as long as it doesn't adversely affect the happiness of others.
P4:05:23 <Quatroking> aera: well, someone just gets op powers and fucks up the server.
P4:05:25 <vede> They're GAMES.
P4:05:33 <liq3> TF2 is at least slightly productive. Reaction time, strategy (more so then woW), etc.
P4:05:39 <vede> They produce nothing but entertainment.
P4:05:40 <Marach|java> no games actually help in real life
P4:05:40 <liq3> for one example.
P4:05:45 <aera> Quatroking: okay. Someone claimed they saw it used on the archives, but i find that hard to believe
P4:05:45 <calaris> World of minecraft - seems to be the most populated atm, is this the norm? people please answe
P4:05:55 <Marach|java> games are technically poitless
P4:06:01 <liq3> vede: Want an example of a good game that does more then create enjoyment? Go.
P4:06:02 <Marach|java> pointless*
P4:06:05 <Quatroking> aera: you mean the WoM archive server?
P4:06:10 <liq3> vede: "Go" is a game btw. :P
P4:06:15 <Real> liq3: I cannot agree that people playing video games, regardless of productivity levels, adversely affects the happiness of others.
P4:06:16 <Snowman> Anyone here op on Grave's server?
P4:06:18 <aera> Quatroking: no, The Archives, _my_ custom server
P4:06:18 <vede> I know what Go is.
P4:06:32 <aera> it's got a completely different codebase, so I don't see how I have the same exploit :/
P4:06:43 <vede> Yeah, games that require reflexes or dexterity might help in, say, crazy life-or-death situations, MAYBE, but that's basically it.
P4:06:48 <liq3> vede: Go is pretty much a mental exercise. Playing it makes you smarter. :]
P4:06:58 <vede> Tetris is also a mental exercise.
P4:07:07 <Quatroking> aera: oh. Well, the hacker first went through the main WoM server and then went on to "the archives", not sure if he ment your server or WoM's one.
P4:07:28 <calaris> so WOM is the most popular?
P4:07:28 <liq3> vede: reflexes also help is stuff like sparring (martial arts), running cross country, any sport.
P4:07:32 <aera> Quatroking: Right. I'll be curious to see if and how it works.
P4:07:38 <Real> liq3: I add that last part to my philosophy statement to ensure that nobody thinks I approve of people becoming happy by committing murder, rape, etc.
P4:07:42 <aera> and then stop it!
P4:08:04 <vede> So?
P4:08:15 <liq3> vede: tetris isn't a mental exercise, not compared to Go. The limit of skill in tetris is extremely low, and it quickly degrades into quick reflexes and simple pattern matching.

P4:10:50 <Quatroking> VIDEOGAMES ARE FUN. <fact
P4:10:59 <Quatroking> woo I'm winning this conversation
P4:11:01 <Real> liq3: I don't believe I was. You just chose one small part of what I said to change the argument to.
P4:11:08 <vede> Yeah, Real, you should give up on adapting. As soon as your first argument fails, it's obvious that you've lost completely. >.>
P4:11:27 <vede> I don't see the problem with changing arguments...
P4:11:28 <liq3> Sarcasm, meta arguing? Time to stop.
P4:11:35 <liq3> SO, 3D MINECRAFT IS GONNA BE AWESOME!

P4:11:45 <Real> liq3: Concession?
P4:11:53 <Quatroking> because now I don't go around raping people
P4:11:56 <Quatroking> you know?
P4:11:59 <liq3> Real: No. We've gotten into meta arguing and sarcasm, this argument has died.
P4:12:05 <Real> I was only trying to understand your point of view, liq3.
P4:12:05 <vede> Not really.
P4:12:12 <vede> I think we should continue.
P4:12:17 <liq3> Real: If you want, pick this up again later, like tomorrow.
P4:12:26 <vede> Right, yeah.
P4:12:27 <vede> Okay.
P4:12:29 <liq3> Real: rigght now we need a break at the very least tho. :P
10P4:12:38 * ModernOrgzniedJewry is now known as Maulrus
P4:12:43 <vede> First sign of sarcasm -> end the whole argument immediately
P4:12:51 <vede>  :|
P4:12:56 <Real> liq3: I'm confused. Why? I feel like we were just about done anyway. I don't like this.
P4:12:58 <liq3> vede: not so much, Real made a meta arguing statemen.t :P
P4:13:05 <vede> Who cares?
P4:13:09 <Real> what are you talking about?
P4:13:12 <liq3> This is generally the point where the argument decends into pointlesseness.
P4:13:15 <Real> i did no such thing
P4:13:24 <vede> Actually, Real, you sort of did.
P4:13:26 <Real> you took it off track and i was trying to get back on dude
P4:13:27 <vede> But it was minor.
P4:13:36 <vede> ACTUALLY...
P4:13:44 <vede> Liq3 made the first meta argument, I think.
P4:13:49 <liq3> I did?
P4:13:57 <vede> I think...
P4:14:05 <liq3> peh.
P4:14:08 <liq3> This is why we need a break!
P4:14:20 <vede> <liq3>Real: Maybe you should stop changing the argument?
P4:14:24 <vede> Seems good enough to me.
P4:14:27 <liq3> vede: shhhh! :P
P4:14:33 <Real> it doesn't really matter, liq3 can still continue to explain why he thinks gamers becoming happy by playing their games can adversely affect others' happiness
P4:14:45 <liq3> Real: not gamers, people playing WoW.
P4:14:56 <vede> Who cares if people play WoW a lot?
P4:14:56 <liq3> Honestly, I don't even consider them gamers.
P4:15:12 <Quatroking> You know, there's a reason this channel is called #minecraft
P4:15:15 <Real> liq3: Fine, back to the specific players. No problem. But I urge you to continue trying to make your point.
P4:15:17 <vede> WoW is a game, the people who play it are definitively "gamers"
P4:15:20 <liq3> vede: me. I won't do anything about it, but it's still a waste of time.
13P4:15:27 * Marach|java should /clear the screen because or this conversation taking too much RAM...
P4:15:28 <liq3> vede: Techinically, yes.
P4:15:40 <vede> liq3, games are pointless.
P4:15:46 <vede> The only "point" is entertainment.
P4:15:47 <liq3> vede: nope... ugh hang on.
P4:15:52 <vede> For some, WoW does this.
P4:15:57 <vede> For others it does not.
P4:16:03 <Quatroking> vede so is IRC, because instead of making this stupid conversation you could help the kids in africa
P4:16:13 <Quatroking> but nooo, you have to do a stupid conversation
P4:16:18 <Quatroking> CRUEL.
P4:16:25 <vede> If you want to deny this, I can probably show you more than a hundred people who will easily say that WoW is fun.

P4:17:23 <liq3> vede: would they find WoW fun is school had not made them stupid? That's the real qusetion!
P4:17:40 <doohan> Marach|java, :)
P4:17:41 <vede> NetHack is not a mental exercise along the lines of Go or anything, and it requires little to no reflexes.
P4:17:41 <Real> liq3: That wasn't my question.
P4:17:47 <liq3> Real: It's my qusetion. :P
P4:18:06 <vede> So you're saying intelligence level can affect what a person finds to be fun?
P4:18:07 <Quatroking> what a lovely MINECRAFT conversation is going on here
P4:18:44 <Real> liq3: So do you still think that those who attain happiness by playing WoW (OR MINECRAFT OR WHATEVER Quatroking damn) can adversely affect the happiness of others?
P4:18:44 <liq3> vede: Heh. I'll describe my habbits. I stick to strictly games I can keep learning in, since I find learning fun. This means games like WoW bore me almost instantly.

P4:19:04 <doohan> Hey Quatroking have you done any more propaganda type pics?>
P4:19:05 <mib_ip2xqx> hello
P4:19:08 <vede> Does that mean people who play WoW have faulty opinions?
P4:19:10 <Quatroking> Nah
P4:19:25 <mib_ip2xqx> im having problems with my server
P4:19:26 <liq3> vede: it's human nature to find learning fun. School does everything it can to make learning hated.
P4:19:28 <mib_ip2xqx> it wont start
P4:19:44 <liq3> vede: So people choose games like WoW over games like Go or TF2, because WoW has almost no learning.
P4:19:52 <doohan> mib_ip2xqx, any errors?
P4:19:54 <vede> Also, you can probably learn a hell of a lot (about WoW) from WoW.
P4:19:55 <mib_ip2xqx> uh
P4:20:09 <vede> From what I hear, WoW has tons and tons of crap to do.
P4:20:13 <liq3> vede: the limit of learning one can do in WoW is small.
P4:20:18 <mib_ip2xqx> well everytime i try to start the server a red square appears and my computer goes off
P4:20:23 <Real> It seems I am now being ignored. Interesting methodology.
P4:20:23 <liq3> vede: they are all the same with different specifics. 
P4:20:25 <mib_ip2xqx> so im not sure
P4:20:30 <doohan> mib_ip2xqx?
P4:20:31 <liq3> Real: Use my name. :P
P4:20:34 <vede> Learn what the classes can do, learn about different areas, learn about different spells.
P4:20:34 <doohan> A red square?
P4:20:37 <mib_ip2xqx> yes
P4:20:42 <Real> liq3: I did.
P4:20:43 <liq3> real: Oh, I missed that.
P4:20:55 <doohan> How are you starting the server?
P4:20:58 <liq3> vede: Those are all secondary to time investment.
P4:21:07 <mib_ip2xqx> i doubleclick on the server file
P4:21:13 <vede> TF2 doesn't really include much learning at all.

P4:21:32 <liq3> vede: I can get the exact same thing (learn about different areas, spells etc) by playing say, AI War. The catch is there is no up front time investment, I play right away.
P4:21:41 <vede> Definitely less than WoW, but that means nothing.
P4:21:47 <liq3> vede: Learning all the classes takes a long, long time.
P4:21:50 <Eagle> TF2 taught me to never trust people I can't walk through
P4:21:54 <mib_ip2xqx> what do i do
P4:21:59 <vede> Whether or not you can learn things has nothing to do with whether the game is good or bad.
P4:22:02 <liq3> vede: I've spent 70 hours on spy, and I'd still only call myself medicore.
P4:22:09 <vede> Some people like it.
P4:22:27 <vede> I love learning, but I also like me a good mindless shooter romp, too.
P4:22:34 <liq3> vede: <liq3> vede: it's human nature to find learning fun. School does everything it can to make learning hated.
P4:22:42 <liq3> vede: TF2 does both. :]
P4:22:48 <mib_ip2xqx> this is the minecraft channel right
P4:22:53 <vede> Wait, so...
P4:22:53 <liq3> vede: I greatly enjoy mindlessly shooting people in the face sometimes (sniper).
P4:23:04 <mib_ip2xqx> cuz honestly u guys sound like nerds
P4:23:22 <vede> You say that in TF2, you have to spend a lot of time to learn about the different classes, and that's good, but in WoW, you have to spend a lot of time to learn the classes, and that's BAD.
P4:23:32 <liq3> vede: no, you mistake the 2.
P4:23:37 <liq3> vede: ah, hang on.
P4:24:16 <mib_ip2xqx> hello
P4:24:19 <mib_ip2xqx> can someone help me
P4:24:21 <liq3> vede: ok, the endgame goal (only important one for replayability) is to win at pvp. The victor of pvp is decided more by time investment and class imbalances then any player skill or knowledge.
P4:24:37 <Real> Alright, so now the conversation has shifted and liq3 is talking with vede. I still do not know liq3's final stance on our earlier chat, nor do I understand his initial stance.
P4:24:46 <liq3> mib_ip2xqx:what with?
P4:24:53 <mib_ip2xqx> my serve won't start

P4:25:07 <mib_ip2xqx> i did
P4:25:09 <liq3> hrm.
P4:25:12 <vede> I believe liq3 seems to think that games can be factually better than other games, but I'll leave explaining his position to him.
P4:25:19 <calaris> lol
P4:25:40 <liq3> Real: I consider WoW a waste of time. People would be better off finding "fun" in better games.

P4:25:56 <liq3> for example, pong. :P

P4:27:07 <vede> vede: Obviously, some people think that WoW is fun.
P4:27:12 <liq3> vede: do they?
P4:27:14 <vede> Whoa, how did I do that?
P4:27:16 <Real> liq3: That is not at all what we were talking about. I said "I prefer as many people as possible to be happy, as long as they aren't doing it at the expense of another's happiness." You said people playing WoW violates my statement. I don't understand how. You were trying to explain your stance.
P4:27:25 <vede> Yes, liq3, they do.
P4:27:35 <liq3> vede: how do they know? They might confusing fun with something else. :]
P4:27:39 <mib_ip2xqx> guys
P4:27:40 <liq3> Like socialising.
P4:27:41 <mib_ip2xqx> guys
P4:27:43 <vede> Or do all those people who play it think it's a boring piece of shit, and play it because they're forced to?
P4:27:46 <liq3> mib: wut?
P4:27:54 <mib_ip2xqx> tf2 and wow suck cock
P4:28:00 <mib_ip2xqx> none of them is any good
P4:28:01 <vede> liq3, it's impossible to confuse the concept of fun with something else.
P4:28:02 <liq3> vede: they might be enjoying the socializing, not WoW.
P4:28:04 <vede> It's a basic idea.

P4:28:20 <Snowman> Great, I'm on a server with no ops and someone named niggertits909 just joined >.<
P4:28:20 <LG_Legacy> Because obviously one person opinion matters even though the devlopers spend alot of time making the games.
P4:28:28 <LG_Legacy> Yeah... right
P4:28:32 <vede> "fun" is a concept that doesn't really need a word to understand.
P4:28:33 <Quatroking> snowman: lol
P4:28:53 <Eagle> Is Half-Life 2 better than Half-Life?
P4:28:55 <Quatroking> vede: hey, guess what, I know what fun it
P4:28:56 <vede> People think WoW is fun. A lot of people.
P4:28:57 <Quatroking> is*
P4:28:59 <gordenfreechmen> Eagle: yeah
P4:29:01 <gordenfreechmen> kinda

P4:29:07 <Quatroking> fun is anything BUT YOU
P4:29:09 <Quatroking> HA
P4:29:10 <Quatroking> HA
P4:29:21 <Eagle> It's pretty much the same game but with more stuff and better graphics, environments, interactions, physics

P4:29:44 <gordenfreechmen> thats kinda what most sequels are meant to be, Eagle
P4:29:49 <vede> I have a friend that preferred HL1 to HL2, but you're really just going off-topic.
P4:29:53 <Eagle> And so Half-Life 2 is better
P4:29:56 <gordenfreechmen> mib_ip2xqx: no wai, have online is so much better

P6:18:28 <PuyoDead> this is fun
P6:18:34 <calaris> I thought he was intelligent enough to realise I was joking about fdisk as simple as that
P6:18:37 <calaris> so i told him the real way
P6:18:38 <Quatroking> where the hell is the ignore option in xchat
P6:18:45 <calaris> Quatro
P6:18:47 <calaris> you wanna forward a port
P6:18:48 <calaris> i told you how
P6:18:50 <vede> Anyone who falls for fdisk kinda deserves to fall for it...
P6:18:52 <calaris> simple as that
P6:18:56 <PuyoDead> right click, windows, ignore list
P6:18:57 <vede> Like cliff-jumping.

P6:19:30 <calaris> Seriously, I make a joke, have my fun, then tell you the right answer
P6:19:31 <vede> You say, "Hey go jump off a cliff!" and anyone who actually does it, I'm totally okay with their jumping off of the cliff.
P6:19:40 <Quatroking> ignore'd
10P6:19:50 * TheOne is now known as TheOne-AFK
P6:19:51 <calaris> congrats, you ignored the 1 person who helped you
P6:19:53 <Maulrus> yes but someone who constantly yells 'Hey go jump off a cliff!' to someone that obviously won't is just annoying
13P6:19:53 * calaris claps
P6:19:55 <Quatroking> Honestly, that was the worst trolling ever.
P6:19:56 <PuyoDead> maybe you should actually tell a funny joke next time, just a suggestion
P6:20:04 <Maulrus> that was terrible trolling
P6:20:04 <vede> I agree, Maulrus.
P6:20:13 <PuyoDead> this isn't fun anymore, I'm off to play video games
P6:20:13 <TheOne-AFK> Did you know that: 1 in 5,000 north Atlantic lobsters are born bright blue.
P6:20:17 <calaris> yes but i didnt say use fdisk like 10 times
P6:20:19 <Maulrus> no i did not
P6:20:23 <calaris> i said twice, then he said are you stupid
P6:20:33 <calaris> and then you starting arguing about it being called dos
P6:20:37 <calaris> so i told him the right answer
P6:20:47 <Maulrus> no
P6:20:48 <calaris> and then you still argued .... about dos ....
P6:20:55 <Maulrus> but 3 times, which is still annoying
P6:20:57 <vede> He was replying to me...
P6:21:00 <Maulrus> then you went off about how i called it DOS
P6:21:01 <Maulrus> >_>
P6:21:13 <calaris> cause you went off on how its called dos
P6:21:19 <calaris> and how i was wrong when it was evidently a joke
P6:21:21 <Maulrus> oh god
P6:21:23 <Maulrus> i am falling into this
P6:21:34 <calaris> seriously, you should have showed some fucking common decency when i gave him the correct answer afterwards
P6:21:35 <vede> The argument basically ended, and I said "Yeah man that can lead to some pretty awkward situations calling it that" and then SOMETHING happened, and now everyone's pissed.
P6:21:38 <calaris> instead of dragging the argument along
P6:21:41 <Maulrus> ogood
P6:21:44 <Maulrus> mirc has an ignore
P6:21:46 <Maulrus> k ignored
P6:21:48 <vede>  D:
P6:21:58 <Maulrus> this is just a stupid bitchfight
P6:22:13 <Quatroking> what the hell xchat I put in the right hostname, ignore it already
P6:22:14 <calaris> Even though I called for the arguing to end multiple times cause i give him the right answer in the end ...
P6:22:17 <Quatroking> piece of shit
P6:22:40 <vede> calaris, it's pretty pointless to try and keep arguing right now.
P6:22:42 <vede> coughcough
P6:22:43 <calaris> Shut up quatro, I aint talking to you now, I gave you the right answer after it, use it or not, just stop your fucking whining and I will

P6:24:15 <calaris> gladly
P6:24:15 <Maulrus> this is just annoying
P6:24:19 <Quatroking> I don't care, shut up.
P6:24:19 <Maulrus> how bout
P6:24:21 <Maulrus> you stop first
P6:24:33 <calaris> Talking about you not to you quatro seriously
P6:24:39 <vede> calaris, I think that we'd all be better (even you) if you just stopped sending messages long enough for the topic to change.
P6:24:40 <Quatroking> So, guys, anyone played some new games that are worth the try?
P6:24:53 <Maulrus> uh
P6:24:54 <PuyoDead> professor layton!
P6:24:55 <Maulrus> lesse
P6:25:00 <vede> Quatroking, new, like AGE, or new, like, first time we played them?
P6:25:00 <Quatroking> PC games, that is
P6:25:03 <Daroh_> that new batman game seems fun, tried the demo on steam
P6:25:05 <PuyoDead> oh, nevermind
P6:25:08 <Maulrus> red faction: guerilla is gonna be sweet
P6:25:12 <Maulrus> coming out for pc soon i thank
P6:25:16 <PuyoDead> well, you CAN play it on pc, techincally
P6:25:17 <Quatroking> new as in new
P6:25:21 <vede> Oh.
P6:25:26 <UnknownX> The forums are back but the skins are down :/
P6:25:30 <calaris> Red faction Guerilla is ... odd
P6:25:30 <Quatroking> I've already finished Bionic Commando this morning which is worthless compared to the original on the NES
P6:25:31 <calaris> its fun
P6:25:31 <calaris> but odd
P6:25:40 <Maulrus> red faction is fun purely cause of mega-destruction
P6:25:43 <calaris> although you do get a hammer than can smash through like ... everything and anything :P
P6:25:44 <Maulrus> i spent an hour just blowing shit up
P6:25:47 <Maulrus> doing nothing else
P6:25:47 <Quatroking> Sure, grappling hook was fun but its such an awful port
P6:25:56 <Maulrus> it's what force unleashed should've been
P6:25:57 <vede> Has RFG been released for the PC yet?
P6:26:00 <Maulrus> or at least closer
P6:26:00 <Maulrus> no
P6:26:06 <Maulrus> a few days or weeks or something i think
P6:26:08 <vede> Damn.
P6:26:10 <calaris> well in guerilla its different
P6:26:12 <Maulrus> i played it on 360
P6:26:12 <calaris> less blowing shit up
P6:26:14 <vede> I really want to play that.
P6:26:15 <calaris> more smashing shit up
P6:26:20 <calaris> but just as destructive none the less
P6:26:22 <Quatroking> Someone played [Prototype] yet?
P6:26:27 <Maulrus> yeah but there's loads of explosives
P6:26:28 <Evil-Ville> RFG is september 15th I just checked
P6:26:34 <Maulrus> and black hole generators n shit
P6:26:36 <vede> I only wish developers would start looking into better ways to store all their freaking shit.
P6:26:39 <Maulrus> prototype? yeah
P6:26:40 <calaris> mhmm :3
P6:26:41 <Maulrus> pretty cool
P6:26:49 <calaris> completed prototype, is a good game
P6:26:50 <Quatroking> Prototype is cool, but so short :/
P6:26:51 <vede> RFG requires FIFTEEN EFFING GIGABYTES of HDD space.
P6:26:53 <calaris> anyone play any MMO's?
P6:26:58 <Maulrus> vede: what
P6:27:00 <Maulrus> whatatat
P6:27:10 <Maulrus> goddamnit
P6:27:11 <calaris> ack reminds me of last remnant

P6:27:22 <Conundrumer> it's fun to crash servers

P8:02:18 <Iguana> It's called Cube2, right?
P8:02:23 <Iguana> Or something..
P8:02:24 <Animator> I've heard of that game.
P8:02:27 <vede> Sauerbraten made on the Cube 2 engine.
P8:02:29 <Quatroking> I hate fat people.
P8:02:29 <Iguana> Yeah.
P8:02:31 <Iguana> OH
P8:02:33 <Quatroking> this is why: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jU5QjVKeXg
P8:02:36 <Iguana> I like the map editor.
P8:02:55 <vede> The Cube Engine has an amazing level editor, yes.
P8:03:09 <Iguana> Quatroking...I'd be fucking scared.
P8:03:15 <vede> And, for being indie and free, is VERY pretty.
P8:03:20 <Iguana> I watched the first 10 seconds and got scared.
P8:03:48 <Quatroking> lol

P8:07:20 <PuyoDead> well quatro, it worked. he's getting a hell of a workout there
P8:07:36 <Quatroking> yeah and he's dieing due to his fat
P8:07:58 <Iguana> Lol. Is that even possible? To like...slowly die, 'cause you're fat?
P8:08:06 <Iguana> That would be so fun to watch. :D
P8:08:12 <Animator> Survival mode looks wicked.
P8:08:17 <Iguana> Second that.

P8:10:09 <vede> But I think mailing the cash to someone here so they could buy it for me would be easier than convincing my dad to buy it for me.
P8:10:24 <Snowman> mail it directly to Notch
P8:10:35 <Animator> I'll make you a skin if you buy it.
P8:10:36 <vede> Hmm...
P8:10:49 <vede> It's USD, though...
P8:10:55 <Snowman> Notch doesn't care

P8:11:26 <Snowman> If you send it, always :D
P8:12:26 <vede> That, and I'm young. I'd be lost if I tried to mail something via mailbox.

P8:17:00 <Quatroking> for example, oprah

P8:17:17 <Amatsu> Or some bullshit like that.
P8:17:19 <PuyoDead> oh, that transends country, oprah is just a herd leading idiot
P8:17:21 <Quatroking> uh
P8:17:42 <Amatsu> Personally, in a fight, I'd MUCH rather have a sword then a pen.
P8:17:53 <PuyoDead> "oprah said it, so I must do the same thing!"
P8:17:56 <Quatroking> I don't know about you but if I hit you with a sword instead of a pen, I'm pretty sure you DIE.
P8:18:18 <PuyoDead> THE PENIS MIGHTIER
P8:18:23 <vede> Oh come on, you know that depends on where you hit a person.
P8:18:23 <PuyoDead> oh, sorry, missed a space there
