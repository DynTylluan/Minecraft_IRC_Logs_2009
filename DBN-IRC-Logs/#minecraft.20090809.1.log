A1:24:25 <Alkan> i need to learn this frickin lua crap so i can host a BA server
A1:24:25 <LG_Legacy> I just started installing Gmod.
A1:24:29 <liq3> but it's much harder to learn the Lua.
A1:24:32 <liq3> then*
A1:24:33 <mail2345> gp
A1:24:39 <mail2345> anyway, lua is easy
A1:24:41 <liq3> BA?
A1:24:51 <LG_Legacy> I imagine lava floods are going to be easier
A1:24:52 <Visiiri> Mum ate this and mum ate that, but mum is sad because mum is fat
A1:24:52 <Alkan> bad ass
A1:24:55 <LG_Legacy> Countdown and spawning lava.
A1:25:00 <mail2345> actually
A1:25:01 <Darke> Visiiri, I just drilled you into a hole
A1:25:03 <Alkan> yeh
A1:25:04 <Darke> Then flooded it :D
A1:25:07 <Alkan> like a modded dam
A1:25:08 <mail2345> I could see how you could do it with 
A1:25:10 <Alkan> time limited
A1:25:11 <Visiiri> oh no
A1:25:13 <mail2345> regular crap
A1:25:19 <LG_Legacy> I can also imagine
A1:25:21 <mail2345> have a timed thing on stdio

A1:25:25 <mail2345> and yea
A1:25:36 <Alkan> make 2 dams

A1:25:54 <Alkan> lol
A1:25:56 <liq3> Alkan: Eh?
A1:25:58 <liq3> Nah.
A1:26:01 <liq3> What i'll do is like
A1:26:13 <liq3> have half the level floode with water (only to sea level), the other half ith lava.
A1:26:16 <liq3> both same height.
A1:26:19 <liq3> so you can build up and be safe...
A1:26:25 <liq3> assuming the enemy doesn't drop you xd
A1:26:38 <Alkan> lol
A1:26:42 <liq3> i'll probably use pregened maps.
A1:26:51 <liq3> and make some script to flood them.
A1:27:13 <liq3> damn i seriously want CTf.
A1:27:24 <Alkan> who here know how to use fucking lua?
A1:27:26 <liq3> once they do it i can finally make my "lava room of doom" useful. :(

A1:31:12 <liq3> it'll be really useful.

A1:31:27 <liq3> I might even make it a simplier "hall of doom"

A1:31:31 <Bobo> would need some sort of draining method though
A1:31:34 <liq3> nah.

A1:31:46 <Bobo> well if you could have switches
A1:31:46 <vede> I can't wait for dungeon mode.
A1:31:55 <liq3> or i could rebuild the walls in something non-stone, then flood it and dig it out, then sponge it.
A1:31:59 <vede> Then you can mindlessly slaughter all the folks in my cave city.
A1:32:09 <Bobo> mmh
A1:32:20 <liq3> but i'd probably just go one-use. xD

A2:24:44 <Darkebrz> And do you always lose in DF?
A2:24:52 <TrueWolves> well not always
A2:24:55 <TrueWolves> just that you can't win
A2:24:56 <vede> By playing DF, you automatically lose.
A2:25:18 <Darkebrz> I'm not very good at this game, can I still play?
A2:25:18 <Darkebrz> Hell yeah!
A2:25:20 <TrueWolves> so it's either you get bored with a 200year old fort (which not many have done) or you lose
A2:25:23 <TrueWolves> XD
A2:25:31 <vede> Fortress of Dorfs FOR TEH LOOZE.
A2:25:40 <liq3> TrueWolves: Nah, you never get bored.
A2:25:42 <Darkebrz> I love how Fun in the wiki directs to Losing XD
A2:25:43 <liq3> You always lose.
A2:25:46 <TrueWolves> XD
A2:25:50 <TrueWolves> yes it does
A2:25:52 <Darkebrz> XD
A2:25:52 <liq3> see, when you get bored, that's when you remove all the doors and grates.
A2:25:55 <Darkebrz> EVERYONE USE XD
A2:25:56 <liq3> and flood the entire fort. <3
A2:26:00 <Darkebrz> XD
A2:26:06 <TrueWolves> I had a death lever once
A2:26:10 <TrueWolves> forgot about it
A2:26:16 <liq3> and pulled it?: P
A2:26:21 <TrueWolves> 1 month later, an imp thing pulled it
A2:26:27 <liq3> rofl.
A2:26:32 <liq3> i'm gonna do that later...

A2:26:51 <TrueWolves> It wasn't meant to be a death lever, I just had a half complete lava cannon that I never finished, so when it was pulled, the lava channeled in to my fort

A2:28:51 <Darkebrz> Shit I have to play thos
A2:28:51 <vede> For example, Spelunky. People were always like ":D I DIED ON TEH LAST LEVEL :D" but when I died in Spelunky I just wanted to hit things.
A2:28:56 <TrueWolves> Dark, read the LP
A2:29:01 <TrueWolves> they made a lava cannon in it
A2:29:14 <Darkebrz> Awsum
A2:29:23 <TrueWolves> eh DF is only fun to lose on when your prepaired for it
A2:29:30 <TrueWolves> once in a while it is a pain
A2:29:34 <Darkebrz> Lol at all the elephants XD
A2:29:47 <TrueWolves> but once in a while you cuase your own death just to see what happens
A2:29:49 <liq3> TrueWolves: I think while playing DF one should expect to lose always.
A2:29:54 <liq3> Because it's so god damn easy.
A2:29:55 <liq3> lol.
A2:30:02 <TrueWolves> I have only ever lost twice
A2:30:08 <liq3> Lies. :P
A2:30:09 <vede> Then there's TF2, where generally people get all pissy when their team isn't doing so good, but I'm ambivalent unless it starts to seem like I don't actually have a realistic chance.
A2:30:12 <liq3> you haven't played long enough then!
A2:30:18 <TrueWolves> my first fort lasted 12 years, and I lost the data
A2:30:23 <liq3> vede: I gave up caring if my team is loing in TF2.
A2:30:31 <Darkebrz> Nothing out of the river yet, and the elephants have been pretty quiet. Too quiet. I see them out there, staring at me with those beady eyes, those gleaming tusks. Looking over the river. Elephants can't swim, can they?
A2:30:38 <TrueWolves> after that I either get bored past 10 years, or once I died of no water, once I died of tantrum spiral
A2:30:40 <vede> I never cared in the first place, liq3.
A2:30:42 <Darkebrz> This sounds hilarious
A2:30:52 <liq3> vede: i'm super competitive, so i used to.
A2:31:21 <liq3> TrueWolves: holy shit, just i got 21 migrants in one go.
A2:31:37 <vede> The only time I CARE is when it's so bad that I could shoot rockets at my feet and have it actually be an IMPROVEMENT.
A2:31:38 <TrueWolves> yeah, my record is 31, but mostly I get 17
A2:31:48 <TrueWolves> 31 was pure luck
A2:31:50 <liq3> vede: yeh...
A2:32:04 <TrueWolves> (got a huge platnium artifact at the start of the game)
A2:32:10 <vede> But even winning in a game like that isn't fun.
A2:32:16 <TrueWolves> I play to play
A2:32:19 <liq3> yeh
A2:32:20 <liq3> same
A2:32:21 <TrueWolves> I could care less in a win or lose
A2:32:27 <liq3> i gave up trying to win, and just focus on getting score.
A2:32:34 <vede> Getting points is fun.
A2:32:36 <liq3> i.e. doing well.
A2:32:46 <liq3> actually i don't even care if only get around half way.
A2:32:51 <liq3> as long as i either have fun, or do well.
A2:32:55 <liq3> tho do well results in fun. xD
A2:32:56 <vede> I like games that give you abstract "points" for doing stuff.
A2:33:01 <liq3> haha.
A2:33:06 <liq3> like killing a medic while it's fully charged? :P
A2:33:07 <TrueWolves> Example: in an RPG on IRC I play with, my character got cripled to all hell, he's going to be phisicaly useless for a long time now, and I just had to laugh becuase It was my characters stubbronness that let to it, I had fun all the way up to the event and after
A2:33:09 <liq3> you get a bonus poin for it. xD
A2:33:56 <liq3> TrueWolves: Do Dwarves need to eat?
A2:34:13 <liq3> I know they need bear...
A2:34:17 <liq3> beer*
A2:34:22 <vede> I think more games (especially single player games) should look into adding a "points" system.
A2:34:31 <vede> Shoot a zombie, get 100 points!
A2:34:31 <liq3> what do you mean vede?
A2:34:42 <TrueWolves> They do need to eat
A2:34:57 <liq3> TrueWolves: Hrm, all I'm doing atm is spamming plump hemlets lol.
A2:35:01 <liq3> Can they eat those? XD
A2:35:09 <vede> For every consecutive zombie you kill, you get DOUBLE POINTS.
A2:35:16 <TrueWolves> they don't need beer, only water if you don't have beer, just 99.5% of dwarves are alcoholics at birth and think they need it, with out it they get sickish and slower
A2:35:25 <vede> 100... 200... 400... 800... HIGH EFFING SCORE
A2:35:37 <TrueWolves> plump helmets are like dwarven bread
A2:35:39 <vede> No one does that anymore, though.
A2:35:49 <TrueWolves> you can cook them, and make them in to wine, and eat them raw
A2:35:52 <liq3> TrueWolves: So yeh, they can survive on nothing but plump?
A2:35:56 <TrueWolves> and they grow all year long
A2:35:58 <liq3> sweet. <3
A2:36:04 <TrueWolves> they get sick of it, but they can live off them
A2:36:05 <liq3> I have like 90 plump atm.
A2:36:09 <liq3> ah...
A2:36:11 <TrueWolves> heres a tip
A2:36:12 <liq3> "bad thoughts'?
A2:36:50 <TrueWolves> brew ALL your plump helmets, then turn everything but wine off for cooking, and have a kitchen that cooks all the wine
A2:36:59 <TrueWolves> you get 5 times as much food and you keep the seeds for growing
A2:37:18 <TrueWolves> (just turn off the cooking of anything put wine and things that need to be cooked to be eaten)
A2:37:23 <TrueWolves> but*
A2:37:37 <liq3> hmr
A2:37:48 <liq3> you can cook wine? O.o
A2:37:52 <TrueWolves> yes
A2:38:01 <liq3> crazy.

A3:09:46 <OmegaLlemru> I shall check on IE.
A3:09:57 <OmegaLlemru> Slooooowly.
A3:10:03 <TrueWolves> try firefox, most say it works best on firefox (I hear chrome is better, but it's not working in this case)
A3:10:10 <TrueWolves> most say IE hates minecraft
A3:10:17 <TrueWolves> (half speed in some tests)
A3:10:58 <OmegaLlemru> Yeah, Chrome's having problems with some of my games, it fails to load certin broswer games.
A3:11:12 <OmegaLlemru> I just don't trust Firefox.
A3:11:17 <OmegaLlemru> Looks too comfy.
A3:11:29 <OmegaLlemru> IE's broken too.
A3:11:38 <OmegaLlemru> Let me check Java, again.
A3:12:10 <TrueWolves> Chrome > Firefox > IE
A3:12:20 <mail2345> I disagree
A3:12:23 <TrueWolves> In most tests
A3:12:32 <mail2345> tests != real world
A3:12:39 <TrueWolves> I perfer firefox just for familierty reasons
A3:12:49 <OmegaLlemru> I prefer Chrome for simplicity.
A3:13:02 <OmegaLlemru> SOFTWARE HAS BEEN INSTALLED, screw you Java.
A3:13:11 <OmegaLlemru> Wait...
A3:14:09 <OmegaLlemru> CCleaner, you better of not screwed this up.
A3:16:14 <OmegaLlemru> 4 Loading screens to get to the update section, nice.
A3:16:22 <TrueWolves> heh
A3:16:46 <TrueWolves> also, the comparasion thing I posted was speed
A3:16:57 <OmegaLlemru> I heard that.
A3:17:15 <TrueWolves> there is many other reasons to pick one over another other then speed however.
A3:17:20 <OmegaLlemru> Chrome was fast, but lacking, Fire was a little slower, but Modded to the core, and IE..
A3:17:31 <OmegaLlemru> IE sucks.
A3:17:36 <TrueWolves> XD
A3:17:44 <TrueWolves> I've only used IE for 2 things
A3:17:59 <mail2345> installing firefox
A3:18:03 <mail2345> and retarded sites
A3:18:03 <TrueWolves> looking at a page to see if it works in IE for someone, or said page when it won't work right in FF
A3:18:22 <TrueWolves> and this 1 game that crashed every 15 minutes in FF
A3:19:18 <mail2345> btw
A3:19:26 <mail2345> firefox 3.5 or 3.0?
A3:19:27 <OmegaLlemru> I only miss one thing in IE after I switched to Chrome, downloading.

A5:12:54 <cryzed> yes he did, and he also said that he kept us updated
A5:12:55 <cryzed> he didn't

A5:13:05 <cryzed> yes

A5:13:18 <LG_Legacy> Didn't he post a video on resources ?

A5:13:23 <cryzed> yes from the first day
A5:13:30 <LG_Legacy> MEh
A5:13:34 <LG_Legacy> I wouldn't worry too much about it
A5:13:49 <cryzed> first he's sick, than he's doing a week break
A5:13:55 <cryzed> then he delays it for 3 days
A5:14:03 <cryzed> and now he only posts one update about his 3-days working sprint
A5:14:10 <cryzed> it's a bit irritating
A5:14:19 <LG_Legacy> Irritating if you let such a thing get to you.
A5:14:28 <cryzed> Irritating if I paid for such a thing ._.
A5:14:36 <LG_Legacy> Out of free will
A5:14:55 <cryzed> Yes out of free will and the assurement that Notch is going to develop this game further
A5:14:59 <cryzed> just like how he stated it
A5:15:17 <LG_Legacy> Indeed he will.
A5:15:23 <LG_Legacy> Keyword 'going to'
A5:15:33 <cryzed> Yes but if it takes him over 9000 days it isn't really worth it
A5:15:59 <LG_Legacy> (I doubt it would.) IF it takes him a long time, so what? If it gets atleast somewhere, then whatever.
A5:16:11 <LG_Legacy> Am i the only one not so worried about the progress of minecraft?

A5:16:28 <LG_Legacy> Bah..
A5:16:29 <Basic> I'd like to pay if I only knew whats it's like to play it
A5:16:38 <LG_Legacy> What?
A5:16:54 <Basic> Yeah, seems like I cant start Minecraft :(
A5:16:58 <LG_Legacy> How so?
A5:17:20 <Basic> It pops up a few milliseconds then dissappears

A6:48:57 <Plinky> That a better idea?

A6:49:17 <Plinky> In a wave sort of format
A6:49:31 <Visiiri> I can't code bots.

A7:05:11 <Visiiri> So should I start it now or what?
A7:05:18 <osici> do you need to set up port forwarding to be able to connect to a server yourself, or is just for others?
A7:06:19 <utilitas> now
A7:06:24 <Visiiri> Portforwarding only applies to hosting servers.
A7:06:32 <Visiiri> It allows others to read the server information and use it.
A7:07:15 <osici> yeah i am hosting on my desktop, and i can connect fine, but I haven't set up port forwarding (may be difficult, this is a uni connection)
A7:07:39 <Visiiri> If you haven't portforwarded, other people cannot connect to your server.
A7:07:58 <Visiiri> Logic says you shouldn't be able to host a server, but IDK.

A8:20:31 <Quatroking> the problem with linux is, THERE ARE TOO MANY FUCKING DISTRO'S
A8:20:33 <citricsquid> Exactly, they're entirely different. So suggesting windows instead of linux, or linux instead of windows is stupid and doesn't work.
A8:20:44 <cryzed> citricsquid: in some cases it does work
A8:20:46 <iPope> everyone knows that the zx spectrum will be the ruling os by 2050

A8:20:54 <PuyoDead> arguing over which OS is "better" is even worse than arguing which game console is better
A8:20:58 <Quatroking> we're not reaching 2050
A8:20:59 <Jakkarra> Yeah
A8:20:59 <cryzed> citricsquid: you could call it an alternative
A8:21:11 <Jakkarra> Everyone knows its the Xbox 360
A8:21:19 <Quatroking> lmao
A8:21:20 <Jakkarra> :3
A8:21:22 <iPope> fuck of mate, ps2 all the way
A8:21:26 <PuyoDead> none of them are "better" than the other
A8:21:28 <Jakkarra> DDDDDREAMCAST!
A8:21:32 <Jakkarra> best
A8:21:33 <citricsquid> but they work for DIFFERENT things. Linux is fine if you want to play around with your OS and get more out of it, but it isn't suitable if you want to play games all day and never have to deal with any administration stuff.
A8:21:34 <Jakkarra> console
A8:21:34 <Quatroking> the 360 is the biggest hardware failrue ever
A8:21:36 <Jakkarra> EVAR

A8:22:18 <Quatroking> after two red rings I gave up
