A12:15:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> red mushroom HELL
A12:16:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> the whole mario franchise's actual purpose was to emphasize on drug abuse

A12:18:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> but in reality, he's actually a broke drug addict plumber lying in a street corner
A12:18:22 <Foe> Talk about shitty kingdom
A12:19:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> he would have all those wild dreams about having a racoon tail and being able to fly, and saving the princess which happens to be taken away from him all the damn time

A12:19:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> the next thing you know he's in space, in the galaxy saving the world... god i feel sorry for him
A12:19:43 <asiekierka> i had a weird dream

A12:19:53 <asiekierka> with a 32mhz 6502
A12:19:59 <asiekierka> and a bunch of other stuff
A12:20:04 <asiekierka> it even had ethernet IIRC
A12:21:22 <Evil-Ville> holy shit there's over 1000 mobs in huge map at the beginning
A12:22:59 <PuyoDead> I couldn't wait for it to load
A12:23:11 <Hunter2458> Back when we could create water blocks I flooded a huge map.
A12:23:20 <Hunter2458> You could see all the mobs bobbing at the top 0-0
A12:23:36 <PuyoDead> I was getting 2FPS and 4-8 chunk updates
A12:23:41 <PuyoDead> so I gave up
A12:23:52 <Hunter2458> I managed to get 0fps and 0 chucnk updates.
A12:23:58 <Hunter2458> So I did something else while it loaded
A12:24:04 <Hunter2458> And when I did it was hilarious
A12:26:40 <Colain> 200 points after death O.o

A1:10:27 <asiekierka> what are you doing them for
A1:10:41 <Azjherben> (Black is a color btw)
A1:10:47 <asiekierka> heh
A1:10:50 <asiekierka> well i see two whites
A1:11:07 <asiekierka> and you could mix that orange and yellow if you're out of colors
A1:11:21 <asiekierka> aldo make the 4th color (blue) look slightly better
A1:11:30 <asiekierka> add a bit of red of green
A1:11:32 <asiekierka> not much but still
A1:11:39 <asiekierka> other than that
A1:11:43 <asiekierka> can't see anything to fix really
A1:11:50 <asiekierka> you can make the gray a little bit darker tho
A1:11:52 <Azjherben> Hmm
A1:11:59 <Azjherben> That's light gray and white
A1:12:06 <asiekierka> it's too light
A1:12:06 <Azjherben> but they are very simular
A1:12:11 <Azjherben> so yeah
A1:12:20 <asiekierka> color 4 (first white is 0) is too bright
A1:12:29 <asiekierka> oh wait
A1:12:32 <asiekierka> you have a darker gray
A1:12:34 <Azjherben> the blue?
A1:12:34 <asiekierka> but yeah
A1:12:36 <asiekierka> no
A1:12:38 <asiekierka> the gray
A1:12:41 <asiekierka> colors start from 0
A1:12:42 <asiekierka> and count to 15
A1:12:45 <asiekierka> most of the time
A1:12:48 <asiekierka> so color 3 is blue

A1:50:28 <bjzaba> haha
A1:50:41 <bjzaba> interesting way of describing them
A1:50:55 <bobo> they most definitely are zombie penises
A1:52:37 <Griskard> Ill have to actually start testing if mushrooms grow
A1:54:06 <bjzaba> what would they grow into?
A1:54:14 <bjzaba> do flowers grow?
A1:54:33 <liq3> only trees grow afiak.
A1:54:47 <bjzaba> thats what i thought...
A1:58:09 <Griskard> Dammit
A1:58:12 <Griskard> DAAAAMMIT
A1:58:19 <bjzaba> ?
A1:58:20 <Griskard> I was luring creepers into a hole
A1:58:27 <Griskard> A really, really deep hole
A1:58:30 <bjzaba> lol
A1:58:33 <Griskard> And was gonna see if I could chain them
A1:58:47 <Griskard> I had got like 3 in there, then Im going back from this other one

A2:00:17 <bjzaba> trying to find a cave
A2:00:28 <Griskard> Pity theres no crafting/armour/weapons

A2:05:23 <bjzaba> ?
A2:05:32 <Griskard> I filled this super deep hole on the beach with about 10 creepers
A2:05:43 <Griskard> (Spawned near 3 nests)
A2:05:46 <bjzaba> :D
A2:05:55 <Griskard> And got them all down to within 2 arrows of death
A2:06:02 <Griskard> They blew up in a chain
A2:06:07 <Griskard> But because it was sand
A2:06:11 <Griskard> I fell in and died

A2:09:34 <Griskard> Now
A2:09:44 <Griskard> Im testing if mushrooms spread

A2:09:46 <bjzaba> woot
A2:09:49 <Griskard> You know, like grass
A2:09:51 <bjzaba> trapped a pig
A2:10:21 <Griskard> YOOHOO
A2:10:28 <bjzaba> im awesome, you don't have to tell me
A2:10:39 <Griskard> Because Im a builder, the whole running aspect doesnt make me feel much enjoyment
A2:10:44 <Griskard> If I can grow mushrooms
A2:10:48 <Griskard> Then I can be a builder
A2:10:56 <Griskard> Because it will give me a reason to have a fort
A2:11:51 <bjzaba> a mushroom fort
A2:12:32 <Griskard> Well without a source of food, you dont need to return. I mean, I could do stuff, but its not as good as the security of having food
A2:12:50 <Griskard> Shrooms are not growing
A2:13:32 <bobo> damnit
A2:13:37 <bobo> i keep forgetting about fall damage
A2:14:17 <Griskard> Same
A2:14:27 <Griskard> I just leap of a cliff and go "Ohs hi-"
A2:14:48 <Griskard> If you land in water you are Ok though
A2:16:39 <bjzaba> unless there is a creeper underneath you
A2:16:52 <Griskard> Thats interesting
A2:17:00 <bjzaba> ??
A2:17:03 <Griskard> Just one layer of water will protect you from fall damaghe
A2:17:08 <Griskard> No matter how high you are
A2:17:32 <bjzaba> lol
A2:18:44 <bobo> is it possible for monsters to kill themselves?
A2:18:50 <Griskard> Yeah
A2:18:55 <Griskard> Well I dunno normally
A2:19:05 <Griskard> But I have injured them, they fell of a cliff and died
A2:19:09 <bobo> i just stumbled upon a huge sphere of space underground, with rock items everywhere
A2:19:10 <Griskard> So in theory they can
A2:19:14 <Griskard> Yeah
A2:19:17 <bobo> so this penis zombie was underground and just exploded
A2:19:26 <Griskard> Creeper probably fell a heap or something
A2:20:08 <bobo> what purpose do red shrooms have?
A2:20:18 <bjzaba> lol
A2:20:26 <bjzaba> im herding them
A2:20:38 <bjzaba> puttin fences around them
A2:20:47 <bobo> you're herding mushrooms?

A2:22:01 <Griskard> bobo
A2:22:06 <Griskard> Red mushrooms are rare
A2:22:13 <Griskard> They heal 10 HP
A2:22:46 <bobo> they hurt you
A2:25:06 <Griskard> Damn
A2:25:11 <Griskard> Did you eat one though to see?

A2:36:26 <liq3> crazy, wood is harder to mine then stone!
A2:36:26 <liq3> >.<
A2:36:57 <PrinceOfFire59> XD
A2:37:54 <Azjherben> Maybe cause it's tree wood
A2:38:06 <Azjherben> planks are krazy fast
A2:38:12 <liq3> No, I mean the wood you get when mining trees.
A2:38:15 <Azjherben> so it's probally kause of the tree
A2:38:15 <liq3> I.e. planks.
A2:38:25 <liq3> No, planks are slowre then stone, I swear. :P
A2:38:33 <Azjherben> I noe
A2:38:41 <liq3> Yes, they definately are!
A2:38:44 <liq3> Like 2x slower.
A2:38:57 <Azjherben> I said I new
A2:39:28 <Azjherben> So what's the slowest thing to mine?
A2:39:30 <Azjherben> Koal?
A2:40:12 <Azjherben> Te slowest Tings to mine are the ores.
A2:40:18 <Azjherben> T
A2:40:22 <Azjherben> It's a theta
A2:40:25 <Azjherben> not a "T"
A2:40:45 <Azjherben> What does this look like to you: T
A2:41:59 <Griskard> Planks are quicker
A2:42:11 <Griskard> I counted 14 swings for coal compared to 9 for planks
A2:42:35 <liq3> I said STONE, not coal.
A2:42:39 <liq3> Oh, nvm.
A2:42:41 <liq3> lol sorry. XD
A2:42:59 <liq3> Azjherben: Planks are still slower then stone, which doesn't make much sense.
A2:43:29 <Griskard> I dunno
A2:43:38 <Griskard> Its pretty hard to cut woor
A2:43:40 <Griskard> wood
A2:44:04 <Griskard> But on the other hand, some stone shatters easy
A2:45:46 <Griskard> Anyone wanna have a fort building contest?

A2:55:31 <Griskard> I was hoping for some ability to grow your own food

A2:55:42 <liq3> Yeh.
A2:55:47 <liq3> It is a test. :P
A2:55:48 <Griskard> As it is theres no reason for me to build a home
A2:56:04 <Griskard> As it is, Its like, yeah, I could build a fort, but I still have to leave it
A2:56:07 <Xeros> you build many outposts heh
A2:56:21 <liq3> Xeros: No point, you can just build tiles like 3-4 high, stand on top.
A2:56:23 <liq3> A pillar that is.
A2:56:26 <liq3> Enemies can't gte you.
A2:56:28 <Griskard> But whats the point,Im just as safe running and doing a pilla
A2:56:34 <Griskard> And then shooting the crap out of them
A2:56:54 <Chemo> :o
A2:57:06 <Griskard> Notch could always just add some sort of plant that grows on dirt like grass
A2:57:09 <Griskard> But is edible
A2:57:14 <Xeros> if only there was like a ladder function... to maybe make one face of a block climbable... and probably an overlapping texture of a ladder or something to show it can be climbed
A2:57:17 <Griskard> Bit of a hack, but whatever
A2:57:44 <liq3> Xeros: I prefer there is no ladders, ever.
A2:57:47 <Griskard> So, how do you get lava to the surface to overflow everwhere
A2:57:47 <liq3> It makes it much much more interesting.
A2:57:56 <liq3> Griskard: can't anymore.
A2:57:58 <bobo> Xeros: notch said he doesnt like ladders
A2:58:03 <bobo> and yeah i spose i agree
A2:58:04 <Xeros> not even hard to get ladders? maybe if he ever puts in "crafting"
A2:58:04 <Griskard> Saw some screenies of it
A2:58:08 <bobo> no ladders makes it more interesting
A2:58:19 <bobo> stairs are cooler
A2:58:19 <Griskard> No laddars means you have to build stairs
A2:58:20 <bobo> :p
A2:58:21 <liq3> yes, that was probably me Griskard. There was a bug where you could get "lava" blocks.
A2:58:23 <Griskard> Which are way more awesome
A2:58:26 <PrinceOfFire59> NOTCH HATES LADDERS
A2:58:28 <Griskard> Ahh

A3:00:19 <Xeros> like you see in Age of Empires hah
A3:01:18 <Xeros> then again I remember you can make a spiral staircase that only takes up 4 blocks width and length

A3:37:28 <bobo> hehee
A3:37:31 <liq3> like a basic one does a radius 3 explosion.
A3:37:40 <liq3> or you can stack them, and each extra adds 1 radius. :]
A3:38:54 <liq3> i'd love stacking like 50.

A3:39:10 <liq3> although, now that i think about it.
A3:39:12 <liq3> it should probably be scaled.
A3:39:26 <liq3> so like each one adds a 3x3x3 cube of blocks... so 27 blocks.
A3:39:41 <liq3> so add 3 radius you only need 1 for 1 more radius, but at 10 you need more, like maybe 5.
A3:39:41 <liq3> :P

A3:45:18 <PrinceOfFire59> and has a cool crown

A3:53:45 <liq3> I don't like the current arrows too much. :P
A3:53:50 <liq3> Very very short ranged.
A3:53:58 <bobo> yeah
A3:53:59 <Evil-Ville> They feel way too floaty
A3:54:08 <bobo> i think enemies need to have proper agro
A3:54:16 <Snowman> wtf got a weird mail
A3:54:22 <liq3> Evil-ville: yeh they do, they need to move faster.
A3:54:22 <bobo> they give up too easy
A3:54:29 <liq3> Or i dunno.
A3:54:34 <Snowman> From: Michael Talbert (minecraftlb@gmail.com)
A3:54:37 <Snowman> Hi! I was wondering if you could help with the leader board by helping me keep it up to date?
A3:54:38 <liq3> bobo: most of the stuff atm is place holders.
A3:54:39 <Evil-Ville> I think the enemies need to be less retarded about jumping over things
A3:54:51 <Snowman> wtf, who is Michael Talbert and what leaderboard?
A3:54:52 <bobo> lol agreed
A3:54:55 <Evil-Ville> Sometimes they just look at you for 30 seconds before jumping where they need to
A3:54:59 <liq3> Evil-Ville: I think most of the stuff atm is placeholders. :P
A3:55:04 <Evil-Ville> Yeah
A3:55:06 <liq3> ESPECIALLY the AI
A3:55:19 <liq3> The current AI looks like Notch just threw it together in 30 minutes.
A3:55:27 <Evil-Ville> It does
A3:55:31 <PrinceOfFire59> he probabl did
A3:55:50 <liq3> Ugh, I have a strange feeling that any mobs you're looking in the direction of render.
A3:55:54 <liq3> It't causing terrible lag. :P
A3:56:46 <liq3> I can't wait till we get AI that is smart tho... Ugh 3 weeks >.<
A3:57:05 <Evil-Ville> I just had to turn off sound because the walking sounds of mobs really gets on my nerves
A3:57:16 <liq3> Evil-Ville: I turned sound off the day it was released. :P
A3:57:24 <liq3> Even the normal walking sounds and stuff drove me nutty.
A3:57:58 <bobo> i want full screen minecraft
A3:58:03 <Griskard> I built a water palace

A3:59:45 <Griskard> Yeah there is
A3:59:47 <Griskard> To die
A3:59:51 <liq3> Dragonfist: yeh there is. I might make an arena full of like 50 mobs.
A3:59:56 <Griskard> The most entertaining death you can
A3:59:58 <liq3> And then save it, and see how many tries it takes to beat it! :]
A4:00:10 <liq3> and other stuff like lava pits >:)
A4:00:19 <liq3> or dig out some huge underground base and save that. etc etc.
A4:00:37 <liq3> Seriously, the resource system alone makes the game so much more interesting.
A4:00:55 <liq3> that, with fall damage, drowning and lava damage.
A4:01:01 <liq3> oh and disabled respawning.
A4:01:10 <bobo> agreed
A4:01:10 <liq3> Doing stuff like skybridges is REALLLY dangerous.
A4:01:18 <bobo> lol
A4:01:18 <liq3> You fall and you probably die.
A4:01:31 <liq3> Same with flags.
A4:01:36 <bobo> flags?
A4:01:40 <liq3> I have to build 2 pillars instead of one, so I can use the second to get back down.
A4:01:50 <bobo> yeah
A4:01:59 <liq3> Yeh, sometimes I build flags so I know where my mine/hut/cave entrance is, from anywhere on the map. :P
A4:02:00 <bobo> no different to before
A4:02:27 <liq3> bobo: I used to be able to just fall 30 + tiles when I was done flag building.
A4:02:37 <bobo> oh ok
A4:02:39 <liq3> Not to mention using respawn to get back up if I accidently fell.
A4:02:39 <bobo> fair enough

A6:06:04 <asiekierka> it would be an infinite game

A6:06:21 <asiekierka> you finish the currently generated part of the map

A6:07:42 <r4dio> lol
A6:07:44 <r4dio> epic
A6:07:44 <d0ohan> asiekierka, you could use 2 seeds and have double the number!
A6:07:55 <asiekierka> d0ohan: Well i'll do just that
A6:07:56 <asiekierka> that is
A6:08:02 <asiekierka> I will have a seed do the first level
A6:08:10 <d0ohan> No two seeds per level
A6:08:11 <asiekierka> and an empty value (=0)
A6:08:14 <asiekierka> each joypad press it's +1
A6:08:30 <asiekierka> then I use that as a seed
A6:08:32 <asiekierka> to generate a new value
A6:08:35 <asiekierka> use THAT as a seed
A6:08:39 <asiekierka> and do the levels

A6:16:15 <liq3> HrmI know there's a way to do it, but dunno on the code.
A6:16:16 <asiekierka> I would need to implement bignum

A6:16:38 <liq3> that's what i  mean. XD
A6:18:17 <asiekierka> I guess I could do it differently
A6:18:22 <asiekierka> Change the seed every 65536 values
A6:18:27 <asiekierka> and do not change the seed between them
A6:18:44 <asiekierka> that theoretically allows for 2^31 levels
A6:19:01 <PrinceOfFire59> awesome
A6:19:02 <asiekierka> if the pseudorandom algorithm can generate 65536 different numbers

A6:24:03 <Marach> why not gba? its more powerful
A6:25:15 <d0ohan> asiekierka, since you have the seed surely you can generate the bit of the level as you get near to it.
A6:25:28 <d0ohan> So you don't need the whole map in ram ever
A6:25:50 <liq3> Yeh, youd' only need to gen what's currently on screen.
A6:25:53 <d0ohan> just generate a buffer of 2 tiles around the screen as you move

A7:26:43 <asiekierka> d0ohan: THE SEED CHANGES AS PART OF A LOT OF RANDOM ALGORITHMS EVERY TIME YOU REQUEST A RANDOM NUMBER
A7:26:59 <asiekierka> to reply to what you said earlier
A7:28:03 <asiekierka> So if I wanted to move to the right
A7:28:06 <asiekierka> I would need to do this:
A7:28:18 <asiekierka> *load the previous seed*
A7:28:24 <asiekierka> *calculate the random number 40 times*
A7:28:26 <asiekierka> *do stuff*
A7:28:31 <asiekierka> and so on (the last two steps) 24 times
A7:28:34 <asiekierka> That's a LAGFEST
A7:28:48 <Xeros> O...M....G.... http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/08/us-govt-says-192m-p2p-damage-award-constitutional.ars Um.... apparently some girl got caught filesharing 30 SONGS... and it cost her $1,920,000. W..T...F..
A7:29:16 <asiekierka> Win!
A7:29:23 <asiekierka> I'm now scared of what Viacom does to me
A7:29:37 <asiekierka> if I make a movie parodying them over 9000 times (but not their trademarks other than the name Viacom)
A7:29:43 <Xeros> Supposedly congress "meant" it to be that high to prevent people from doing this... even "non-commercial people"...aka the average person downloading songs
A7:30:17 <d0ohan> get a hold of that seed
A7:30:25 <d0ohan> And re use it for each random number selection
A7:30:32 <asiekierka> Well
A7:30:37 <d0ohan> Get a better rng if it messes with your seed
A7:30:37 <asiekierka> So store each seed in memory?
A7:30:40 <d0ohan> Cuase that's funky
A7:30:41 <asiekierka> Well
A7:30:48 <asiekierka> Each rng has a few variables it stores
A7:30:51 <asiekierka> independent of the seed
A7:30:55 <asiekierka> used to calculate the random number
A7:31:03 <Xeros> So everyone... don't pirate songs anymore.. or else your life will be completely ruined financially ^.^
A7:31:11 <asiekierka> Also I can have up to 12KB of RAM for the stuff if i have a proper mapper
A7:31:14 <liq3> Xeros: Like that's ever gonna happen.
A7:31:31 <liq3> asiekierka: WHOA, 12kb! XD
A7:31:36 <asiekierka> on a gameboy color
A7:31:49 <asiekierka> And I still have 4kb (and 28kb in GBC banks) left
A7:31:51 <KrimZon> avoid listening to copyrighted music
A7:32:01 <d0ohan> I gotta go to the post office, I shall leave you to your folly asiekierka .
A7:32:03 <Xeros> Like that's every gonna happen? It just happened lol x.x
A7:32:04 <asiekierka> Cuz I can access up to 8kb at once, 16kb if my cartridge has a mapper with extra RAM
A7:32:08 <liq3> KrimZon: The copyrihted stuff is the good stuff tho. :/
A7:32:26 <KrimZon> it's not that good if it costs you a million bux

A7:33:00 <Xeros> Of course not... but... I've never seen the government so straigtforward saying "We can easily make you pay this much whoever you are."
A7:33:00 <asiekierka> liq3: Nothing will ever be defeated except if no-one wants it
A7:33:27 <Evil-Ville> It has happened many times Xeros
A7:33:35 <Evil-Ville> It's just useless scare tactics
A7:33:35 <KrimZon> people can just swap usb drives of music i suppose
A7:33:35 <citricsquid> Piracy will forever exist, but it could easily be decreased if the music industry were to engage in better business models
A7:34:14 <asiekierka> I was thinking of making 64x64 map slots
A7:34:15 <liq3> citricsquid: Yeh, like not using fucking annoying DRM methods like iTunes does.
A7:34:21 <asiekierka> As in you can access up to 64x64 of the map at once
A7:34:26 <Xeros> A scare tactic that kinda seems to be working.... you know... my internet has been shut off 2 seperate times because COX KNEW I was downloading copywrited stuff....
A7:34:26 <citricsquid> Spotify is a great example.
A7:34:27 <asiekierka> and you can't scroll between them
A7:34:30 <asiekierka> but in them, yes
A7:34:34 <liq3> Spotify?
A7:34:38 <asiekierka> this allows for doing a map up to 256x128

A7:34:51 <asiekierka> up to 256x256 with compression
A7:35:00 <citricsquid> liq3: Apparently the record labels make quite a bit of it and I haven't once pirated music since I started using it
A7:35:06 <citricsquid> shame the US doesn't have a free version yet
A7:35:14 <liq3> What's spotify?
A7:35:15 <citricsquid> once again the record labels fucking up.
A7:35:18 <citricsquid> music streaming
A7:35:24 <citricsquid> basically a free itunes
A7:35:24 <Xeros> Yes... the first time I just had to remove the software.... uninstall the p2p software and click a link.. the second time I had to get my dad to call them...
A7:35:24 <liq3> hrm.
A7:35:35 <citricsquid> http://www.spotify.com/en/#top
A7:35:37 <liq3> citricsquid: So basically, you can listen to it, but it requires internet?
A7:35:37 <Xeros> Just the fact that the internet company can KNOW what I'm doing....idk man
A7:35:37 <citricsquid> Watch the video :)
A7:35:43 <citricsquid> liq3: basically, yes.
A7:35:50 <citricsquid> and a 10 second add every 30 mins or so
A7:36:08 <liq3> Xeros: I'm pretty sure packet sniffing is illegal, even if ISPs do it.
A7:36:14 <Xeros> in fact at both times... they knew I was downloading copywrited software before the download even finished....

A7:36:41 <KrimZon> what was it that you were downloading?
A7:36:42 <liq3> Xeros: If you had the money and evidence, you could probably sue them (after you check laws and ToS and such). >.<
A7:37:04 <Xeros> I'm pretty sure it's legal... the page told me about this "blah blah act that started in 19whatever"
A7:37:06 <liq3> Xeros: And of course after checking with a laywer. :]
A7:37:15 <citricsquid> They can legally check what you do
A7:37:17 <Xeros> I was downloading games
A7:37:24 <liq3> Xeros: Packet sniffing itself is illegal. I dunno if it's legal for ISPs or not tho.
A7:37:41 <Xeros> One was a pretty new game... but the second time I got a really old game and..didn't expect it
A7:37:42 <liq3> citricsquid: Can ISPs packet sniff you?
A7:37:47 <liq3> legally.
A7:37:56 <citricsquid> who said they were packet sniffing?
A7:38:08 <liq3> There's no other way to really know what he's doing. :]
A7:38:09 <citricsquid> They can track everything that goes through their network.
A7:38:16 <liq3> That's packet sniffing. 
A7:38:22 <liq3> Packet sniffing = looking at packets that aren't yours. :/
A7:38:32 <liq3> well, that's the illegal ver anyway.
A7:38:39 <Dasleah> sigh
A7:38:44 <liq3> Dasleah: What?
A7:38:52 <Dasleah> it pains me that water doesn't have pressure
A7:38:59 <Xeros> are you sure it's not illegal if they simply don't LOOK at it.. but it just detects copywrited content and sends a message and etc?
A7:39:10 <Dasleah> or at least there seem to never be any high-level lakes ;-;
A7:39:23 <citricsquid> It's entirely legal for them
A7:39:27 <citricsquid> you agree to it when you register
A7:39:35 <liq3> citricsquid: Yes, I thought that might happen.
A7:39:51 <offset> 99.9% they won't be looking at clients viewing materials
A7:39:55 <liq3> dasleash: there's no finite water yet. :(
A7:40:00 <offset> especially a large ISP
A7:40:10 <liq3> Yeh, because packet sniffing everyone will lag  like fuck.
A7:40:10 <citricsquid> I doubt they actually will unless pressured by companies like Sony
A7:40:15 <Dasleah> even a spawnable water block would be nice
A7:40:16 <liq3> Not to mention need a super computer or 2.
A7:40:18 <citricsquid> because they don't gain from it, only lose.
A7:40:28 <offset> yeah, the cops come to them, then they get involed :\
A7:40:32 <Xeros> found an article saying AT&1, Comcast, and Cox are all aiding RIAA which is a totally serious anti-piracy or whatever thing
A7:40:34 <asiekierka> I was thinking of making a sandbox game
A7:40:43 <asiekierka> for the gameboy color
A7:40:45 <offset> they don't want to cut off pirates, probably 75%+ of their user base?
A7:40:47 <liq3> Xeros: RIAA is a joke. >.<
A7:40:50 <asiekierka> it could have a 64x7x64 map without any special problems
A7:40:56 <Dasleah> i mean, as a DF player, water pressure is the devil, but it'd be nice in Minecraft for the sandbox mode
A7:40:59 <flyboy> or being able to soak up water in sponges and take it elsewhere
A7:41:06 <citricsquid> offset: exactly, pirating must be so much of their bandwidth.
A7:41:23 <offset> exactly why they turn a blind eye till the cops show up :D
A7:41:55 <liq3> Wish all the big companies (and government) would realise that pirating is perfectly fine. :/
A7:42:04 <citricsquid> no it isn't.
A7:42:08 <citricsquid> what a stupid thing to say :|
A7:42:08 <offset> stealing someones hard work? :D
A7:42:10 <asiekierka> Is poking fun at a big company in an artistic form legal?
A7:42:16 <liq3> citricsquid: Yes it is. People who want to pay money for it will anyway.
A7:42:16 <Xeros> I think they check what you're downloading if you're downloading a large amount or for a long time.. or mayeb uploading. Because usually I got caught if I left it alone and it automatically started uploading(I'm not a seeder, don't have internet for such stuff).
A7:42:28 <citricsquid> liq3: While that argument is sometimes relevant, not always.
A7:42:48 <liq3> citricsquid: No it is. They've said that out of 1000 pirates, only one would actually buy it (assuming you stopped them all).
A7:42:50 <citricsquid> Take me; I used to download music and now I use spotify, I went from providing them with no revenue to providing them with revenue.
A7:43:04 <citricsquid> If you let people do it legally, they will.
A7:43:21 <citricsquid> The majority of people pirate because they cba to pay, if you provide an easy way for them to ahve the content with other revenue streams they will.
A7:43:30 <asiekierka> citricsquid: Is poking fun at a big company in an artistic form legal?
A7:43:31 <citricsquid> There are very few people who go HURR DURR FUCK DA COMPANIES STEAL IS AWESOME!!!
A7:43:40 <liq3> citricsquid: Heh. There was a band a while ago that allowed the people to pick the price for album (even $0). They made like 7 million or something in the first week of sales.
A7:43:42 <citricsquid> asiekierka: parody, isn't it? I guess it's legal.
A7:43:47 <citricsquid> liq3: Exactly.
A7:43:50 <asiekierka> yeah
A7:44:01 <liq3> They could have gotten the album for free, but they didn't, they payed money.
A7:44:07 <liq3> Legally for free. :/
A7:44:11 <asiekierka> citricsquid: by poking fun i mean infiltrating their building
A7:44:15 <asiekierka> citricsquid: in a clay form
A7:44:22 <asiekierka> just so you know it's not IRL
A7:44:32 <Xeros> they also got to choose the price if they DID pay... unlike the two choices of "a lot of money" to "zero"
A7:44:46 <liq3> Xeros: haha true.
A7:44:59 <citricsquid> liq3: That backs up my point; most people pirate because they find the prices unreasonable, if you let people choose a reasonable price they will pay.
A7:45:07 <Xeros> for example when I download Rosetta Stone...eheh.. that's an EXPENSIVE program.. and so is Fruity Loops Producer edition....and...Adobe Suite thing.... etc..ahem
A7:45:11 <citricsquid> Pirating is only so widespread because the majority of record labels have ridiculous prices.

A7:45:14 <liq3> I know a lot of online comics ask for donations, and get a lot. Anywhere from $500 to $1000 a motnh.
A7:45:20 <Quatroking> hay
A7:45:27 <asiekierka> hi Q-man
A7:45:44 <liq3> citricsquid: Yeh, like Assassin's creed. I pirated that, because it was way overpriced (Sims 3 too). 
A7:45:59 <asiekierka> I bought GMod because it's awesome and it wasn't overpriced at all
A7:46:09 <Quatroking> liq3: some online comic artists earn enough by donations and merch that they quit their job and get dedicated fully to their comics
A7:46:10 <Xeros> I'd probably definitely pay for stuff if... I ever had moeny lol... but usually everything I get is pretty temporary anyway so I'm glad I downloaded it for free because I'd never truly use it
A7:46:18 <liq3> Quatroking: I know. XD
A7:46:19 <Evil-Ville> I've never bought any music
A7:46:27 <Evil-Ville> Not even before I had internet
A7:46:35 <Quatroking> liq3: however, sometimes it causes the comic to go down in quality
A7:46:37 <Evil-Ville> Before I had internet I didn't even listen to it
A7:46:38 <citricsquid> I buy it if I have the money, but now I use spotify :P
A7:46:38 <Quatroking> for example, CAD
A7:46:47 <liq3> lol.
A7:46:50 <liq3> CAD's not bad.
A7:46:51 <liq3> :p
A7:46:53 <Evil-Ville> CAD was always terrible what are you talking about
A7:47:00 <liq3> :/
A7:47:03 <liq3> I don't why everyone picks on it.
A7:47:11 <Evil-Ville> Because it's the worst web comic
A7:47:15 <offset> I definitely wouldn't donate on a web comic :d
A7:47:21 <Xeros> CAD? wait isn't that a 3D modelling engineering product...thing?
A7:47:31 <liq3> Xeros: Nah there's a comic. Ctrl-Alt-Del.
A7:47:32 <Quatroking> liq3: ever since the "CHOOSE WHAT ETHAN DOES" comic it started lacking enw stuff

A7:47:42 <Quatroking> new*
A7:47:42 <liq3> Quatroking: New stuff?
A7:47:52 <Quatroking> well
A7:47:54 <Quatroking> good stuff
A7:47:56 <Evil-Ville> Do people actually like CAD?
A7:47:59 <Evil-Ville> That's terrifying
A7:48:02 <Xeros> Hey my favorite comicz I've seen are Cyanide and.. Happiness? I forget

A7:48:08 <Evil-Ville> B^U
A7:48:30 <liq3> Quatroking: Megatokyo is far worse then CAD.
A7:48:32 <Quatroking> evil-ville: you hate everything
A7:48:47 <Quatroking> megatokyo is comparable to mouthshitting
A7:48:49 <liq3> CAD is a... "good" comic.
A7:48:53 <Evil-Ville> Yes hating CAD sure is hating everything
A7:48:59 <liq3> It's ok. It's not terrible tho. :/
A7:49:10 <liq3> I don't know why everyone hate it so bad.
A7:49:14 <Quatroking> evil-ville: you're always such a downer :(
A7:49:16 <Evil-Ville> It's such shit I can't even begin to imagine why anyone would think it's even ok
A7:49:17 <Xeros> But anyway yeah I've probably downloaded over thousands of dollars worth of programs.. so someone having to pay 1.92mil for 30 songs worries me
A7:49:25 <liq3> Evil-Ville: Because it makes me laugh. durp.
A7:49:34 <Evil-Ville> Then there's something wrong with you

A8:01:29 <Quatroking> in localsettings.php, set $wgallowuserskin to false
A8:01:51 <Quatroking> I added some javascript in the default skin and I don't want users to bypass it by using an other skin.

A8:03:06 <Quatroking> Thanks
A8:03:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> So, are any high profile MC members that are still free users?
A8:03:47 <asiekierka> what do you mean by "high profile"
A8:03:57 <Quatroking> Hmm
A8:04:12 <Quatroking> Strange
A8:04:17 <asiekierka> cuz i'm still a free user but i think notchsong ruined my chances to ever be high profile
A8:04:20 <Quatroking> aera, you sure you did it right?
A8:04:25 <Quatroking> Nothing changed.
A8:04:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Anyone who regularly contributes to IRC and/or runs an interesting or top server?
A8:04:46 <asiekierka> I had a server that had 10 or so users half a day
A8:04:48 <aera> Quatroking: i did. sure you got the case of the variable right?
A8:04:51 <asiekierka> but i prefer TA now

A8:05:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh
A8:05:19 <asiekierka> Also I made 3 minecraft-related clay animations
A8:05:20 <aera> yeah, Quatroking, it's got capitals in it
A8:05:24 <Quatroking> Oh
A8:05:31 <Quatroking> silly php and case-sensitive stuff.
A8:05:42 <aera> Quatroking: try now?
A8:05:54 <Quatroking> Yep
A8:05:55 <Quatroking> Working
A8:06:27 <Xeros> I am a high profile free MC player, I regularly come on this channel, and I am the reason for an interesting AND top channel, #C++.. it's top because it's probably the only C++ channel here maybe. I am also high profile because my name is in the TOPIC! :P
A8:06:51 <Evil-Ville> heh high profile minecraft player
A8:07:12 <asiekierka> I'm more high profile
A8:07:16 <asiekierka> my VIDEO is in the TOPIC
A8:07:20 <Xeros> I am also high profile because I'm a minecraft player that CAN'T PLAY MINECRAFT. It's so ridiculous it's..high profile.
A8:07:21 <asiekierka> not just the name
A8:07:23 <Quatroking> I'm a fucking elite, bitches.
A8:07:34 <asiekierka> I found out how to enjoy survival for free. I AM HIGH PROFILE

A8:09:16 <Xeros> ehehe ^.^
A8:09:16 <Marach> but i wont :)
A8:09:29 <Marach> its b4d
A8:09:30 <citricsquid> Marach: we know, but anyone who does this will find themselves banned :)
A8:09:49 <Parthon> Marach: update graphics drivers?
A8:09:53 <asiekierka> And notch will fix it tomorrow anyway
A8:09:56 <asiekierka> Marach
A8:09:57 <Xeros> How could people get banned for that? Well besides SAYING they were doing that
A8:10:05 <Marach> i havent been banned or kicked from irc even once
A8:10:10 <Xeros> I mean isn't it hidable? hide-able idk
A8:10:17 <asiekierka> Xeros: Yes it is
A8:10:19 <citricsquid> Xeros: because distributing the files for survival test is bad?
A8:10:23 <asiekierka> Well
A8:10:26 <aera> distribution of the minecraft software is illegal, so banning is perfectly acceptable...
A8:10:27 <asiekierka> no-one is distributing
A8:10:30 <Marach> its B4D!
A8:10:35 <Xeros> no I meant... how could you ban someone if you didn't know they were doin it
A8:10:47 <citricsquid> Xeros: obviously we can;t
A8:10:48 <Xeros> I was expecting a response like maybe "oh it tells us this and this" or idk how it works
A8:10:50 <citricsquid> but if we find someone doing it
A8:11:19 <citricsquid> I doubt Notch cares that much if you give it to a friend, but mass distribution is bad and if you're caught doing it you can expect to be banned.
A8:11:28 <Marach> from where?
A8:11:36 <asiekierka> what if he doesn't distribute it
A8:11:38 <asiekierka> AND tells notch
A8:11:45 <asiekierka> about the fail
A8:11:52 <asiekierka> 15 minutes after survival is released
A8:11:53 <Xeros> Is there like a list of people who have paid.. and maybe someday you see someone playing future survival multiplayer and you're like "ftw NOT ON LIST!" *bouncer*
A8:12:05 <asiekierka> well, Notch knows about it already
A8:12:06 <citricsquid> Obviously for multiplayer it can be tested
A8:12:08 <citricsquid> but not for singleplayer.
A8:12:16 <asiekierka> and protection may be added soon :P
A8:12:19 <Xeros> oh okay.. that's what I was wondering
A8:12:19 <Parthon> Xeros: yes, but notch forgot to impliment that :P

A8:13:06 <Marach> CITRIC HAS 666 POSTS ON FORUMS
A8:13:09 <asiekierka> OH NO
A8:13:10 <Marach> HAHA
A8:13:13 <Quatroking> any way to remove the submit button altogether when its not previewed yet?

A8:13:20 <Xeros> :o
A8:13:29 <Xeros> Hey what's the link to the forum?
A8:13:40 <Marach> printscreened it!!
A8:13:56 <Quatroking> The current code disables the button and makes it say "use preview first"
A8:14:36 <Quatroking> It would be better to have the button not show up at all, leaving only preview and that other one
A8:14:47 <Xeros> It'd be cool I guess if Notch like.. made a seperate opensource version or something.. but still continued on the main project... then there would be two minecrafts or something :P
A8:14:55 <asiekierka> yeah
A8:14:58 <aera> Quatroking: you should be able to remove it from the DOM. Line number?

A8:28:35 <Quatroking> alnaturalx: retrieving password requires personal confirmation when you have a shit ton of money
A8:28:49 <asiekierka> ok
A8:28:50 <asiekierka> new step
A8:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> fine.  Steal his Minecraft cookie, hope it's the same password.  either that, or hope he empties it regularly, which he does if he wants to spend the money
A8:29:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> And define a shit ton.  I know it doesn't for $2k, but that's as high as I've been
A8:29:16 <asiekierka> well
A8:29:22 <asiekierka> Add a new step
A8:29:27 <Quatroking> my plan is a lot better
A8:29:28 <asiekierka> - Steal Minecraft source
A8:29:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> -Make small, incremental withdrawls
A8:29:32 <asiekierka> - Sell it on eBay for $100000
A8:29:40 <asiekierka> - Pay off paypal's employees to get notch's password
A8:29:46 <asiekierka> - Steal all the cookies
A8:29:49 <Quatroking> It takes a long time for my plan to complete but at least its solid
A8:30:00 <asiekierka> Well
A8:30:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> If there's no personal confirmation, we should be good
A8:30:08 <citricsquid> easier just to hold ez to ransom

A9:10:32 <Xeros> oh... well I also don't drink it because of... well I'm sure YOU guys would call them "scare tactics" or something =P but all the bad crap in it
A9:10:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fluorinated tapwater in general
A9:10:46 <citricsquid> I drink lots of bottled water, dislike the taste of our tap water.
A9:10:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nah, that's all BS... But fluorine scares me
A9:11:06 <Peerko> fluorine isn't that bad, fluor is
A9:11:12 <liq3> WATER IS AWESOME. Especially TAP WATER.
A9:11:15 <Xeros> I can't even drink water from a fridge and enjoy it... although bottled water is good.. best water I'VE had comes from water N ice
A9:11:30 <PrinceOfFire59> Time to learn abou CLASSES
A9:11:33 <liq3> Xeros: Tap water > bottled water.
A9:11:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> fluorine is terrible.  It has a higher affinity than oxygen, which itself is poisonous
A9:11:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Especially fluoride.... o.O
A9:11:54 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Really? O.o... Also, only O3 is poisonous. 
A9:11:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it's a very powerful oxidant
A9:12:16 <Xeros> liq3 I'm not gonna go as far as saying that when it says "spring water" that it's LYING
A9:12:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> O2 is poisonous.  It's just that our bodies need it and have adopted to using it.  It oxidizes our DNA over time, and we die... Same thing with our brain, etc
A9:12:21 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: yes, but in small quantities it's good for you
A9:12:28 <aera> (flourine/ide)
A9:12:45 <Peerko> as is alcohol
A9:12:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Good for your teeth maybe, but not too good to drink... That won't help teeth anyway
A9:12:49 <aera> most things are poisonous in large enough amounts
A9:12:53 <aera> for example, chocolate
A9:13:00 <citricsquid> and pepsi.
A9:13:01 <aera> i believe the lethal dose is something like 20kg
A9:13:15 <liq3> Xeros: There was some guys that did a test, bottled water vs tap water. They used unmarked cups, one with each. The concensus was tap water tastes better. 
A9:13:15 <Xeros> I drink so much soda it's ridiculous
A9:13:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> There is no reason to put fluorine in tapwater.
A9:13:27 <citricsquid> liq3: That doesn't work though
A9:13:28 <liq3> Xeros: They used random ppl on the street btw. :P
A9:13:31 <citricsquid> because it tastes different everywhere
A9:13:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can see it in toothpaste, but not tapwater
A9:13:35 <citricsquid> they took it from one location
A9:13:37 <Peerko> soda is indeed ridiculous
A9:13:38 <liq3> citricsquid: Was NYC.
A9:13:45 <citricsquid> liq3: Penn and teller? :P
A9:13:46 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: well, it doesn't do any harm
A9:13:47 <Xeros> oh cool an opinionated test.. I'm guessing 100% of the people chose the tap water? because then I'd be so wrong
A9:13:50 <liq3> citricsquid: Yep.
A9:13:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> aera, many people would disagree with you
A9:13:57 <aera> and a few studies showed benefits IIRC
A9:14:17 <Xeros> and obviously tap water seems to be different everywhere anyway

A9:14:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's true aera and I recognize that...
A9:14:52 <Peerko> yep, it's like what you could buy in bottles as springwater or whatyoumightcallit

A9:15:01 <Xeros> I don't care if it's bad for me ^.^ I've been talking about taste the entire time
A9:15:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> To give you an idea, 1 pack of Crest toothpaste has enough Fluorine to kill a baby
A9:15:18 <Xeros> if tap water was just as bad but tasted good I'd drink it.. simply because I like challenging my immune system a bit
A9:15:37 <aera> incidentally, some areas naturally have flourinated water
A9:15:38 <Peerko> you should lick old people
A9:15:40 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: 1 road has enough cars to kill a family
A9:15:45 <liq3> Xeros: This isn't immune system bad, it's digestive and general health bad.
A9:15:50 <Peerko> that'll test your immune system a great deal
A9:15:51 <aera> it was the discovery that these areas had less cavities that led to the practice
A9:16:21 <Xeros> I believe adapting to anything considered "bad" can become good to some degree

A9:16:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> that was it
A9:16:35 <aera> well, so can an inch of water
A9:16:41 <aera> depending how it's applied
A9:16:48 <AlLnAtuRalX>  1990 fluoride was found to be an equivocal carcinogen by the National Cancer Institute Toxicology Program. (Maurer, et. al.,"Fluoride an equivocal carcinogen. J.National Cancer Institute 82, 1118-26, 1990) In 1992 further studies by the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed a 6.9 fold increase in bone cancer in young males. (Cohn, Perry D. Ph.D. "An Epidemiological Report on Drinking Water" Fluoridation and Osteosar
A9:16:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> coma in Young Males, New Jersey Department of Health, Environmental Health Service, Trenton NJ November 8, 1992) In 1997 there were more than 80 references available, linking fluoride to cancer.

A9:17:13 <Zararara> so
A9:17:15 <Zararara> how is this going
A9:17:21 <Xeros> Again.. the topic was taste and not health
A9:17:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes. Fluorides lower the intelligence capacity of humans, with children, again, especially susceptible to early fluoride toxicity. IQ levels were significantly lower than children not exposed to fluorides in all age groups listed. (According to Dr. Hirzy, 5 to 19 points lower!) (Li, X.S., Zhi, J.L., Gao, R.O., "Effects of Fluoride Exposure on the Intelligence of Children", Fluoride;28:182-189, 1995) Further studies provi
A9:17:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> ng the neurotoxicity of fluoride in rats have also been conducted by Dr. Phyllis Mullinex and her co-workers. (Note: this also explains a recent University of South Florida study relating fluoride intake during pregnancy to the yearly 1% increase in learning disabilities found in children...)
A9:17:37 <liq3> Xeros: Taste? I think cordial + soda water is better then most soda. :P
A9:17:41 <PrinceOfFire59> I'm pythoning and they're arguing about flurdide
A9:17:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> At least there are sources on there :P
A9:17:45 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX:  so is chlorine, but sodium chloride is very safe
A9:17:56 <Peerko> best thing about plain water is you can drink it with anything

A9:18:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> So is sodium you should have said also
A9:18:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A9:18:04 <Xeros> Idk what cordial is
A9:18:04 <Peerko> it won't interfere with taste
A9:18:09 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: ah, but a study cannot necessarily be trusted
A9:18:14 <liq3> Xeros: It's basically syrup.
A9:18:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Never said it should be blindly trusted
A9:18:21 <aera> read Bad Science, it's a great book an all this stuff
A9:18:24 <PuyoDead> I think we can all agree anything is bad in excess
A9:18:26 <liq3> Xeros: You mix it with water to dilute it, or it's simply too strong.
A9:18:42 <liq3> PuyoDead: Yep.
A9:18:48 <aera> doesn't cover flourination, but it's a good overview of some worrying areas of medicine
A9:18:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> cordial FTW
A9:19:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> In high concentrations, soluble fluoride salts are toxic and skin or eye contact with high concentrations of many fluoride salts is dangerous. Referring to a common salt of fluoride, NaF, the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 1-10 grams.[1] A lethal dose is approximately 28 mg per kilogram of body mass.[2]
A9:19:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Straight from Wiki
A9:19:21 <Zararara> so how is survival mode going
A9:19:22 <Zararara> is it secret
A9:19:24 <Zararara> is it safe
A9:19:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides[5] or rodenticides (e.g. sodium fluoroacetate[6]) containing fluoride. Currently most cases are due to the ingestion of toothpaste.[4] Other sources include glass-etching or chrome-cleaning agents like ammonium bifluoride, industrial exposure to fluxes used to promote the flow of a molten metal on a solid surface, volc
A9:19:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> anic ejecta, for example in cattle grazing after a 1845-1846 eruption of Hekla, and the 1783-1784 flood basalt eruption of Laki, and metal cleaners. Malfunction of water fluoridation equipment has happened several times, including a notable incident in Alaska.[7]
A9:19:31 <aera> AlLnAtuRalX: mmhm, and?
A9:19:49 <aera> bleach is FAR more deadly
A9:19:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not saying you'll die by drinking tapwater and brushing your teeth
A9:19:55 <aera> and we use it in homes all the time
A9:19:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> But it's certainly not good for you

A9:26:31 <Xeros> actually now that I think about it.. I said the word "used"...it has a z sound.... "uzed
A9:26:52 <Xeros> and not like.. ooh-sed
A9:26:54 <PuyoDead> I may have the same birthday as Richard Pryor, but not almsot the same name

A9:27:39 <PuyoDead> http://i29.tinypic.com/1sikqt.jpg
A9:28:34 <Xeros> oh but wait... I realized(realised?) that "used" also has an 's' sound when I use it a different way... like past tense"I used to do this and that" or using as in "I used the object"..
A9:29:08 <Xeros> I mean the "I used an object" is the z sound for me... the other phrase is an S sound

A9:46:59 <PrinceOfFire59> and who knows what comes next
A9:47:00 <Xeros> hmmm... COOL
A9:47:10 <Xeros> As if pogramming can be annoying ^.^ :P
A9:47:32 <PrinceOfFire59> It can give me a twitch, that's for damn sure
A9:47:32 <Xeros> My favorite parts are the surprising bugs... especially the ones it doesn't tell you about!
A9:47:42 <chaos95> Xeros: how long have you been coding?
A9:47:59 <PrinceOfFire59> Python is good at telling you
A9:48:20 <Xeros> 3 days.. or maybe... about an hour of actually writing code... the rest reading 2 chapters trying to understand it as best I can
A9:48:43 <liq3> Xeros: Learning to program (and getting better in general) is about 20% reading, and 80% programming. :P
A9:49:05 <Xeros> duh
A9:49:06 <Xeros> lol
A9:49:06 <chaos95> amen
A9:49:11 <liq3> Also, when I say "programming", I don't mean just writing code. Including things like debugging, and figuring out what code does in general.
A9:49:39 <PrinceOfFire59> I learned that reading on the beach and forgetting EVERYTHING
A9:49:51 <liq3> PrinceOfFire59: What...?
A9:49:54 <Xeros> I'd say the figuring out what code does is kinda half n half in reading and seeing results
A9:50:04 <liq3> Yeh.
A9:50:07 <liq3> Programming is like...
A9:50:16 <liq3> 25% thinking about what to code, 25% actually coding, and 50% debugging.
A9:50:25 <liq3> Damn bugs...
A9:50:31 <PrinceOfFire59> XD
A9:50:37 <Xeros> I told you where the term "bug" came from right?
A9:50:40 <liq3> Yeh.
A9:50:40 <PrinceOfFire59> nope
A9:50:50 <chaos95> PrinceOfFire59: once you've done the tutorials and a few basic mucking-around programs, take a look at my bot: http://sf.net/projects/pygbot - our aim is to develop a plugin system that lets beginners write basic irc bots without too much trouble
A9:51:16 <chaos95> PrinceOfFire59: and I'm always looking for fresh meat to test it on :D
A9:51:20 <PrinceOfFire59> written in python...
A9:51:24 <chaos95> yup
A9:51:40 <PrinceOfFire59> Alright, I'll finish the base and check it out
A9:52:07 <PrinceOfFire59> I've been looking for a python bot shell anyway!
A9:52:16 <Xeros> In the beginning, there was an ENIAC Mark I. One day an operator happened to notice the machine was malfunctioning and traced the problem to a moth that had flown into the machine and gotten beaten to death by the relay contacts.
A9:52:22 <chaos95> :D the only thing we're lacking at the moment is decent docs, which I guess is a problem, but if you drop by #pygbot or #mafia on irc.foonetic.net we're almost always around to answer questions
A9:52:41 <Xeros> She removed the moth, taped it in the log book, and made a notation: "Found a bug in the system." Thus, the first computer bug.
A9:52:51 <Xeros> I love that ^.^

A10:42:44 <LucanC> Hello folks.
A10:42:45 <Xeros> I've done too much thinking in my life and not enough knowledge.
A10:42:52 <Xeros> Lucan.. IRELAND?
A10:43:04 <LucanC> Ya
A10:43:06 <Xeros> Awesome
A10:43:07 <LucanC> Where I live.
A10:43:09 <LucanC> you?
A10:43:14 <Xeros> United States x.x
A10:43:17 <LucanC> oh.
A10:43:17 <LucanC> :D
A10:43:25 <Xeros> lol
A10:43:27 <LucanC> How do you know of Lucan then?
A10:43:43 <Xeros> Oh I just saw your ip address thing and it said "dublin" in there.
A10:43:48 <LucanC> ah.
A10:43:51 <Marach> xD
A10:43:53 <Xeros> lol
A10:44:08 <LucanC> It's just that Lucan itself is a town in dublin.
A10:44:12 <Xeros> I'm a fan of Ireland... and Canada... and Japan... and Antarctica....
A10:44:22 <Xeros> And the International Space Station

A10:50:36 <LucanC> jesus christ that is a big hole, citric.
A10:50:49 <Xeros> ok apparently this is the hardest logic puzzle int he world.. never knew of it till now http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever
A10:52:03 <FNugget> its pure logic
A10:52:19 <LucanC> it hurts my brain
A10:52:50 <FNugget> read the solution
A10:53:18 <LucanC> that hurts more.
A10:53:20 <LucanC> :(
A10:53:36 <liq3> Xeros: If it's so hard, why have they already solved it? -_-
A10:53:50 <LucanC> hard =/= impossible
A10:54:06 <Xeros> I've done a much simpler version of "There are two doors, one leads to freedom the other to eternal nothingness, and two guards... one always speaks the truth and the other always speaks a lie"
A10:54:33 <FNugget> hold on liq3, let me make a logic puzzle without a solution
A10:54:34 <Xeros> but this adds difficulty to the fact of the "random" god.. and especially that you can't tell which word is yes or no
10A10:54:36 * PuyoZwei is now known as PuyoDead
A10:54:48 <Marach> If we ask A "Is it the case that {[(you are going to answer 'no' to this question) AND (B is Zephyr)] OR (B is Eurus) }?", a response of 'yes' indicates that B is Eurus, a response of 'no' indicates that B is Aeolus, and an exploding head indicates that B is Zephyr. Hence we can determine the identity of B in one question.
A10:55:05 <LucanC> :|
A10:55:09 <Marach> lol

A11:29:26 <Quatroking> xeros: lololol I have a total of 31 figurines and 3 dolls
A11:29:30 <Dilt> i did watch chobits and it was decent
A11:29:39 <Dilt> i have a total of 0 figurines and 0 dolls
A11:29:44 <d0ohan> Quatroking, you are a girl.
A11:29:47 <Dilt> then again, i have no money
A11:29:48 <d0ohan> Girls play with dolls.
A11:29:53 <d0ohan> You have dollies.
A11:29:54 <Dilt> and if i had one i might get a couple of figurines
A11:29:57 <Quatroking> d0ohan: not those
A11:30:01 <d0ohan> Those are dollies.
A11:30:06 <Dilt> ah well
A11:30:06 <Quatroking> the fluffy kinds

A11:31:07 <Quatroking> you don't understand an Otaku, do you
A11:31:09 <Dilt> hey now.
A11:31:17 <Xeros> Chobits had some meaningful stories in there... at least in a world where human-like robots are everywhere... which is a very realistic future we may have.
A11:31:18 <Dilt> teddies and dollies are ok. just depends on what they are
A11:31:30 <d0ohan> Yeah I do, loser that collects tat.
A11:31:34 <Dilt> Xeros: if japan made robots, i have no doubt they would make them humanoid
A11:31:36 <Quatroking> I have two Totoro's and one big Totoro Tree
A11:31:49 <Dilt> simply because most robotics fans tend to follow robotics careers
A11:31:49 <Quatroking> d0ohan: the hell is your problem all of the sudden?
A11:31:52 <Dilt> and watch robot anime
A11:31:59 <Xeros> Japan already makes humanoid robots like more than anyone haha

A11:40:15 <Xeros> funny how we were discussing psychics on "esper"net... since an esper is well.. ESP-er
A11:40:15 <Dilt> and that's not an issue with minecraft
A11:40:20 <Dilt> it's an issue with my damn Eee PC

A11:41:24 <Xeros> yahhhh lol
A11:41:26 <Dilt> endless eight will live forever.
A11:41:33 <Xeros> Only watched like the first 8 episodes online or something
A11:41:44 <citricsquid> Anyone think the white forum theme is too bright? (besides LG :P)
A11:41:45 <Xeros> first episode confused me like "wtf" lol
A11:42:01 <Dilt> anyway, i watched the original anime, i'm keeping up with the new season (blargish endless eight), and i read the light novels
A11:42:05 <taodih> all the eps are mixed up
A11:42:14 <Xeros> The White Forum? Sounds kinda racial discriminatory.... not that I know if discriminatory is a word
A11:42:25 <citricsquid> Xeros: no black themes!

A11:42:35 <citricsquid> they're inferior.

A11:42:51 <Xeros> My mIRC colors are actually a black background and green text.... like an old terminal ^.^
A11:42:57 <Dilt> how do you like that 99 item limit and 'can't build over dirt'?

A11:43:13 <citricsquid> I got trapped because of it haha
A11:43:15 <Xeros> and besides I find it visually easier to see the green against black
A11:43:18 <Dilt> do you guys have a potential solution for that?
A11:43:27 <Dilt> example: 'collecting' the blocks while not upping the 99 limit
A11:43:37 <Dilt> or actually
A11:43:46 <Dilt> it might be able to remain as is, if we're going for realistic
A11:43:52 <Dilt> since you have to 'move dirt' to build in places
A11:44:07 <Dilt> and making a wall of dirt when you're digging into the side of a hill is reasonable
A11:44:11 <Dilt> that dirt has to go somewhere after all
A11:44:20 <Xeros> wtf.... the "terminal" font actually becomes smaller from "12" to "14" hah
A11:44:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> or you could leave them as they were the tiny floating blocks
A11:44:34 <Xeros> doesn't even look terminally anymore hm =/
A11:44:58 <Dilt> anyway
A11:45:11 <Dilt> i think it's just the fact that when i was digging my stone fort out of a dirt mountain
A11:45:16 <Dilt> i had to constantly go dump dirt
A11:46:11 <Azjherben> Do pigs hurt you?
A11:46:18 <citricsquid> nope
A11:46:26 <geekahedron> aside from emotional scarring
A11:46:32 <liq3> dilt: good! :D
A11:46:39 <Dilt> pigs are supposed to drop FOOD
A11:46:40 <Dilt> FOR ME TO EAT
A11:46:41 <Dilt> TO HEAALLL
A11:46:42 <liq3> dilt: use it to make fortifactions and walls around the entrance.
A11:46:55 <Dilt> liq3: it's supposed to be a classy fort so i had to make dumps
A11:47:00 <Dilt> digging the moat was the most annoying part
A11:47:01 <liq3> classy?
A11:47:11 <Dilt> 'classy' as in no dirt except on the ground and in pots
A11:47:11 <liq3> dilt: make the highest walls ever! :D
A11:47:21 <liq3> ah, I meant stone walls. ;]
A11:47:30 <Dilt> in an hour i had a large first floor with wooden floor and ceiling, 3 units high interior
A11:47:43 <Dilt> and a moat without water
A11:47:49 <Dilt> class ended though and no save :(
A11:47:57 <Dilt> and water was like on the opposite side of the map
A11:47:59 <Dilt> so i was a little lazy
A11:48:23 <liq3> yeh.
A11:48:27 <liq3> This no save thing is really ruining it.
A11:48:54 <Azjherben> how do I use mushrooms?
A11:49:26 <liq3> right click
A11:49:29 <liq3> the red ones heal you.
A11:50:06 <Dilt> anyway
A11:50:24 <Dilt> i think three improvements that notch can probably add pretty quickly would be
A11:50:25 <Dilt> 1) saving
A11:50:27 <Dilt> well
A11:50:31 <Dilt> not sure about quickly with saving but yeah
A11:50:35 <Azjherben> Brown heals
A11:50:36 <Marach> anyone knows if i get points for killing pigs?
A11:50:41 <citricsquid> Yes
A11:50:43 <Dilt> 2) a 'spawn some more mobs' button
A11:50:43 <citricsquid> but only a few
A11:50:44 <Dilt> and finally
A11:50:50 <Azjherben> How do I drop a red mushroom
A11:50:52 <Azjherben> without dieing
A11:50:56 <Dilt> 3) a 'make all mobs immediately attack'
A11:51:00 <Dilt> so we can have some REAL survival :D
A11:51:02 <liq3> Dilt: Instead of 2, have mobs slowly respawn.
A11:51:10 <Dilt> liq3: yeah, that's an alternative.

P12:55:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> OH NOEZ!
P12:55:23 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX doesn't use the forums because seperating mods and users makes us all nazis.
P12:55:26 <Snowman> now I have to look at a shitty white theme
P12:55:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Too bad I would never use that word in that way.  ;)
P12:55:50 <citricsquid> well, however you phrased it.
P12:56:08 <Quatroking> hitler was a pretty cool guy, eh, not afraid of killing jews and stuff.
P12:56:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> That was just the last straw.  I was only trying to help in Server Administration prior, because the rest of the forum is retarded.  So is Server Administration, but at least I could contribute to help that one.

Her statement was straightforward, but also included a "haha" showing that she's not seriously creeped out. My suggestion is to stay this slightly joking/humor path and respond casually, along with a possible "haha" or "lol" etc.
P1:34:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> because ogg is pretty cool

P1:44:12 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, just get the rc
P1:44:18 <Snowman> No 3D drivers for my card
P1:44:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, have it in a VM
P1:44:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's dreadful
P1:44:28 <Snowman> Any other way?
P1:44:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Took my least favorite part of OS X, added it to my least favorite part of Windows
P1:44:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> and voila!
P1:45:01 <Zuriki> Windows XP is the best Windows OS to date.
P1:45:04 <Darkebrz> Wow, Minecraft Survival Guide fails
P1:45:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yup.  The last one I used as my sole O/S.
P1:45:13 <Darkebrz> Why wouldn I use melee on a creeper?
P1:45:14 <potato> yeah, xp was great
P1:45:15 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, sure is nice for me
P1:45:21 <Darkebrz> Getting hit by one of them is nearly impossible
P1:45:24 <potato> they should have stuck with it

P1:45:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Siiseli, no way I can argue with that, but Windows being an unstable POS is a known fact
P1:46:00 <AlLnAtuRalX>  14:49:21 up 27 days, 17:58,  1 user,  load average: 0.79, 0.58, 0.46
P1:46:02 <Snowman> ok, trying the iZ3D now
P1:46:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> cant get 27 days of uptime on Winblows
P1:46:32 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, not unstable for me
P1:46:47 <Snowman> I had like 100 days uptime on windows once
P1:47:15 <PuyoDead> this XP instal very rarely crashes. the only reason I don't have long uptimes is those damn updates that reboot my machine overnight
P1:47:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've seen 5 years on a Solaris box... but that's no hibernation, suspend, etc.  That's real uptime... It was one of the oldest boxes I've ever seen
P1:47:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> okay
P1:48:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> what are we talking about
P1:50:05 <PuyoDead> salami
P1:51:16 <Drakkar> <AlLnAtuRalX> cant get 27 days of uptime on Winblows I've had about 3/4ths of a year on this box
P1:51:18 <Drakkar> previously
P1:51:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> screenshots?
P1:51:32 <Drakkar> after that I got too lazy to bother
P1:51:35 <Drakkar> god no
P1:51:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> thought so
P1:51:38 <Drakkar> it was two years ago
P1:51:45 <Drakkar> I've formatted 3 times now
P1:51:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's not a big deal get over it
P1:51:49 <Drakkar> between then that is
P1:51:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup.  I'm also Jesus.
P1:51:59 <Drakkar> lol
P1:52:14 <Drakkar> funny stuff
P1:53:52 <PuyoDead> I almost bet money I could do it on this
P1:54:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> If someone was willing to bet me USD$500 or more, I'd go for 6 years on this one
P1:54:44 <PuyoDead> $600 for 6 years work? that's a ripoff
P1:54:47 <Drakkar> it wouldn't be worth a cent
P1:54:49 <PuyoDead> err, $500
P1:54:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> work?
P1:54:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> what work?
P1:55:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> you mean starting it up on the first day and sshing in and typing uptime on the last?
P1:55:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> might take 30 seconds total, yes
P1:56:07 <PuyoDead> </weak joke>
P1:56:29 <PuyoDead> ehh, not bad so far: System Up Time:            6 Days, 5 Hours, 17 Minutes, 21 Seconds
P1:56:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> That stat was for my server
P1:56:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only times I ever rebooted it were for that fucking socket error
P1:56:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> that Notch has not fixed
P1:59:56 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Alright well I'mma go to sleep now so that I'm rested for my friends when they come over.... FEMALE FRIENDS THAT IS LULZ lmao jk big deal... Farewell and Wellfare!

P2:13:13 <Quatroking> I eat eggs all the time.
P2:13:16 <Quatroking> Wanna know why>
P2:13:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> self sacrifice is the best way out
P2:14:23 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: No it doesn't. His fox thing... Foxes can't survive without meat.
P2:14:33 <liq3> Humans do NOT need meat.

P2:14:56 <Dilt> oh yes we do need meat. Or more specifically, what's in meat
P2:14:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> true.  There was an even better point somewhere deep in that comment thread about the fact that there's no market for male chicks, and no way to ensure females
P2:14:58 <Quatroking> GET RID OF IT NAO
P2:15:00 <liq3> One is due to survival, the other is simply because we enjoy it.

P2:21:14 <liq3> We're not designed to even digest it.

P2:21:38 <Dilt> oh right, i remember why i don't argue with vegetarians/their variants now
P2:21:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> if you have too much protein you can deaminate and convert to any other biomolecule

P2:26:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I had to binge on McDonalds afterwards though
P2:26:22 <PuyoDead> there's no "ahead" here :P

P2:26:45 <PuyoDead> hmm, good point
P2:26:51 <PuyoDead> you are now ahead
P2:26:51 <Dilt> i'm in calc III and microeconomics
P2:26:52 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Try going vegan for a month. It's very noticible.
P2:26:59 <Dilt> and the second class is teaching algebra.
P2:27:02 <liq3> Going vegeterian doesn't help that much.
P2:27:02 <Dilt> basic algebra.
P2:27:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> but, but, but... my eggs and..... my milk and yogurt and cheese.  <sobs>
P2:27:25 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Milk is one of the worst. :P
P2:27:35 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Eggs are basically just liquid meat. :/
P2:27:44 <PuyoDead> oh wow
P2:27:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, eggs not so much, cheese and yogurt more
P2:28:00 <PuyoDead> on that *chuckle* note, I'm off for some game action
P2:28:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> bai
P2:28:18 <liq3> seeya

P2:29:03 <Azjherben> "No purchase nessacary."
P2:29:06 <liq3> Man, what I really love is that when people realise they can't win the nutrition argument, they resort to taste... Haha, which is funny, because honestly vegan diets are tastier. :/
P2:29:17 <Dilt> oh wait
P2:29:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's just why I won't try it, not why it's better
P2:29:22 <Dilt> i can win this arguement instantly
P2:29:23 <Dilt> BEEF JERKY
P2:29:26 <Dilt> YEAHHH
P2:29:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Have you ever *had* McDonalds?
P2:29:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmm
P2:29:36 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Yes. A lot.
P2:29:49 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: It's extremely "meh".
P2:29:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Savory Angus, sweet Bacon and Swiss Angus
P2:29:55 <PuyoDead> err, sorry... but tastier? are you serious?
P2:29:57 <Dilt> anyway, running off to class
P2:30:00 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Give me a salad over McDonalds anyday.
P2:30:01 <PuyoDead> I almost got away, too
P2:30:03 <Dilt> by the time i get back i want survival mode updated
P2:30:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> :'(
P2:30:06 <Dilt> so that i can EAT THE PIGS
P2:30:06 <liq3> PuyoDead: yes.
P2:30:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Salads make me cry
P2:30:16 <Dilt> i also want to eat the flowers too
P2:30:16 <liq3> salads are epic.
P2:30:20 <Dilt> afk~
P2:30:26 <PuyoDead> yes, all the top chefs and restaurants of the world are vegan
P2:30:38 <liq3> PuyoDead: They would be if it was profitible.

P2:31:26 <PuyoDead> question: why do vegans feel the need to "correct" everyone else's diets?
P2:31:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yay for bypasses!
P2:31:37 <liq3> PuyoDead: Because I care about people hurting themselves?
P2:31:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm back, and better than ever.  BRB, McDonalds
P2:31:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P2:31:54 <liq3> PuyoDead: Also, because most non-vegans are extremely illogical, and won't even try it for a month.
P2:32:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Think.  Of.  The.  Pizza!
13P2:32:07 * Siiseli is vegan
P2:32:13 <liq3> Siiseli: :D
P2:32:16 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, vegan pizza is good too
P2:32:17 <PuyoDead> your diet has nothing to do with "logic"
P2:32:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> You mean sauce-only?
13P2:32:26 * AlLnAtuRalX throws up.
P2:32:29 <liq3> PuyoDead: Most claim vegan diets suck, but they won't even try one.
P2:32:35 <liq3> PuyoDead: That's illogical.
P2:32:37 <PuyoDead> I'll try it, it's food
P2:32:40 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, no. say only cheese, tomato and other stuff like that
P2:32:51 <liq3> PuyoDead: That means no meat, eggs, fish, milk etc for a month. :p
P2:32:52 <Siiseli> PuyoDead, most wont
P2:33:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> cheese isn't vegan!
P2:33:01 <Siiseli> but yeah I'm just getting off milk
P2:33:04 <Siiseli> not completely off
P2:33:05 <PuyoDead> shit, it's far more than that
P2:33:05 <liq3> PuyoDead: And preferably no lollies either.
P2:33:07 <Siiseli> and right you are AlLnAtuRalX 
P2:33:15 <PuyoDead> reading labels, asking places what they cook with, etc.
P2:33:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which reminds me.  Cheese http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kaasmarkt2_close.jpg
P2:33:23 <liq3> Siiseli: You still drinking dairy milk?
P2:33:29 <PuyoDead> "oh, this was cooked with the fish? can't eat it"
P2:33:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> mmmmmmmmmmmhhhhmmmm
P2:33:38 <PuyoDead> no leather, no animal products
P2:33:42 <liq3> PuyoDead: Most restruants have something vegan.
P2:33:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Have you guys tried Chevre cheese from France?
P2:33:46 <PuyoDead> if you're going to do it, do it all the way
P2:33:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> With some Bordeaux?
P2:33:52 <liq3> PuyoDead: No, it's only diet. 
P2:33:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Chevre cheese and Bordeaux.  For the win.
P2:34:17 <PuyoDead> then you're saying you're only in it for the diet, not the treatment of animals?
P2:34:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's fine PuyoDead, I'll double my meat intake to restore the balance of the Chi.  BRB
P2:34:40 <Siiseli> liq3, no way
P2:34:43 <liq3> PuyoDead: I was mostly in it for the diet. Then I saw that video... And honestly, I doing it morally now too.
P2:34:48 <liq3> Siiseli: Oh good >.<
P2:34:53 <Siiseli> liq3, I'm using some other dairy products though like cheese.
P2:35:00 <liq3> Siiseli: Awww. >.>
P2:35:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Back with milk chocolate, ice cream, and bacon (Canadian)F
P2:35:27 <PuyoDead> you know, "animal" food isn't the only thing that is so terribly bad for you
P2:35:34 <liq3> PuyoDead: what, lollies?
P2:35:35 <Siiseli> though liq3 it's not irrational to not want to try something completely new they suppose they won't enjoy
P2:35:40 <Siiseli> it's too radical a change for some people
P2:35:43 <PuyoDead> some additives and other foods can be just as harmful as your meats
P2:35:48 <liq3> Siiseli: Yeh. 
P2:35:49 <Siiseli> yeah
P2:35:56 <liq3> PuyoDead: Yes. and?
P2:36:04 <PuyoDead> alcohol, salt, etc
P2:36:10 <PuyoDead> then why limit it to meat?
P2:36:10 <liq3> PuyoDead: And?
P2:36:17 <liq3> PuyoDead: I never said I did. :/
P2:36:35 <liq3> There's unhealthy vegan diets.
P2:36:36 <liq3> >.<
P2:36:44 <liq3> you can go vegan and still binge on junkfood.
P2:36:47 <potato> if all you eat is plants why eat at all
P2:36:58 <liq3> Says the one called potato.
P2:36:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Should I go to the store and buy beef jerky?
P2:37:00 <liq3> >.>
P2:37:15 <potato> pfft
P2:37:20 <liq3> PuyoDead: Do you have any idea why people don't try to be logical?
P2:37:25 <potato> i don't even eat at all
P2:37:29 <liq3> Seriously, I can't understand why people ignore logic so much. :?
P2:37:35 <PuyoDead> mental conditioning
P2:37:38 <liq3> Hrm.
P2:37:41 <PuyoDead> it goes far beyond any "logic"
P2:37:52 <potato> i inject myself with clorophyll and get my energy from the sun
P2:37:57 <liq3> And they are never taught to be logical. The opposite, in fact.
P2:38:12 <liq3> Grrr..
P2:38:15 <potato> liq3: you still talking about veganism
P2:38:22 <liq3> potato: not really, no point.
P2:38:23 <PuyoDead> this goes into a whole new can of worms, but... http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/logic.html
P2:38:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> potato, you should also use carotenoids
P2:38:46 <liq3> potato: I've got a better chance of convincing a tree to go vegan then these poeple.
P2:38:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> They'll boost your intake!
P2:38:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup, sure do
P2:38:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> trees are already vegan
P2:39:00 <potato> liq3: that's because people like meat!

P2:39:39 <potato> true
P2:39:45 <potato> but not everyone hunts for their food
P2:40:14 <PuyoDead> and some people think killing deer is terrible, yet gassing the honets nest out back is great. again, logic isn't something you can just "explain" to someone
P2:40:22 <PuyoDead> err, hornet's
P2:40:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some people squish ants and cry when chicks die.

P2:41:12 <potato> animals eat meat, why shouldn't we? there are plenty of carnivores
P2:41:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some people breathe, eat, have a house, use air-conditioning and heat
P2:41:22 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: Some people are stupid. I'm talking to one. ;]

P2:47:00 <Quatroking> to be honest

P2:59:12 <PrinceOfFire59> A fruit is a ripened ovary. Inside the ovary is one or more ovules where the megagametophyte contains the mega gamete or egg cell.[8] The ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers.

P3:04:15 <liq3> PuyoDead: yes, I beat you to googling it. :p
P3:04:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> A fruit is the ripened ovary—together with seeds—of a flowering plant. In many species, the fruit incorporates the ripened ovary and surrounding tissues. The fruits of a plant are responsible for dispersing the seeds that contain the embryo and protecting the seeds as well.
P3:04:36 <liq3> PrinceOfFire59: Still doesn't change the fact plants have no brains.
P3:04:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Like I said, they use chemical signals rather than electrical nervous signals to transmit messages

Fruits and vegetables, by contrast, are usually lacking several essential amino acids contained in meat. It is for this reason that people who abstain from eating all meat need to plan their diet carefully to include sources of all the necessary amino acids.

P4:41:38 <Dilt> is writing a useful mod for your server going to get you 'in trouble' or 'banned', especially when it's a good idea and potentially popular?
P4:41:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> clone1018, we have that for reddit public :P
P4:42:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's annoying though.  It basically parses players.txt to remove linebreaks and replace with commas, but it hasn't worked since the archives switch because there's no players.txt

P7:48:38 <clone1018> Do you have Java JDK installed?
P7:48:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Seriously.  I knew right away, it's right in the README
P7:48:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> of course
P7:48:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> JRE btw
P7:48:47 <Riobe> Not the JDK
P7:48:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> you dont need JDK to run minecraft
P7:48:49 <Galaxy613> nonono, I think clone is right. Every GOOD server admin has the inate knowlage on how to set one up
P7:48:51 <Riobe> JRE
P7:48:58 <clone1018> No
P7:49:04 <Galaxy613> They are born with it, like how to walk etc. etc.
P7:49:06 <clone1018> Thats what you need to play it
P7:49:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> i... what?
P7:49:12 <clone1018> To run it
P7:49:19 <clone1018> You need the Java Developers Kit
P7:49:21 <clone1018> JDK
P7:49:38 <Riobe> The server is up, I just can't log into it. I'm thinking because I'm trying to get in from the same router that it's being hosted on.
P7:49:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> clone1018, what?
P7:49:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> are you smoking marijuana
P7:49:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's probably true, unless you have verify names off
P7:49:56 <clone1018> YOu need the JDK
P7:49:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> You don't need to compile anything
P7:50:00 <clone1018> I sware to god

P7:50:13 <Riobe> I can try that, but I don't see why you'd need the JDK. Worth a try though.
P7:50:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> hands down
P7:50:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK
P7:50:22 <clone1018> You need the Java Runtime Enviorment
P7:50:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> or JRE
P7:50:27 <Riobe> I know what the JDK is. I'm learning how to program in Java.
P7:50:30 <clone1018> to PLAY
P7:50:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> and to RUN A SERVER
P7:50:48 <clone1018> You need eaither the JDK or the SDK
P7:50:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I run four, I have since pretty much when the game came out, and you think I don't know?
P7:50:51 <clone1018> I forgot which one
P7:50:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> there is no SDK for Java
P7:50:55 <Riobe> You need the JDK to get javac

P8:19:00 <setveen> http://i25.tinypic.com/6teko6.jpg
P8:19:19 <vede> I'd say... no.
P8:19:25 <setveen> thats what i thought
P8:19:26 <clone1018> I am getting things like that too
P8:19:32 <setveen> how do i fix it?
P8:19:38 <vede> I'd also say, maybe you should try playing on the standard client?
P8:19:50 <rey> looks like an old glitch lke used to see in doom, is the art infront of the walls or in the walls?
P8:19:52 <setveen> i need my fly hax though
P8:19:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> no you don't
P8:20:02 <vede> You don't need fly hacks.
P8:20:03 <setveen> in front of the walls
P8:20:14 <setveen> i need it to make that blastoise
10P8:20:29 * Balobo is now known as AlLnAtuRalX
P8:20:40 <setveen> that would take me forever without them
P8:20:41 <vede> You can't do anything but FLY with flyhax that you can't do with the standard game.
P8:21:02 <vede> Be awesome. Make scaffolding.
P8:21:05 <vede> Don't cheat.
P8:21:14 <setveen> without flying pixelart becomes 100 times longer to make
P8:21:23 <vede> Not necessarily.
P8:21:29 <setveen> then its just annoying to do
P8:21:30 <rey> no not at all
P8:21:36 <vede> Make scaffolding, like I said.
P8:21:45 <setveen> not the way i do it
P8:21:59 <setveen> trust me, i need that
P8:22:18 <setveen> i obviusly dont when im fmaking houses
P8:22:19 <vede> No you don't.
P8:22:24 <vede> You're addicted.
P8:22:35 <setveen> buy when i am making 80 pixel high art, yes, i need it
P8:22:50 <vede> I've seen pixel-art just as big done with scaffolding.
P8:23:05 <setveen> and i could do five before he finishes
P8:23:28 <setveen> also, minecraft needs blb like in archives
P8:23:40 <vede> blb?
P8:23:56 <setveen> make a block  in one corner
P8:24:02 <setveen> then make the other corner
P8:24:13 <setveen> and it auto fills in everything else for you
P8:24:25 <vede> Uh, dude.
P8:24:26 <setveen> saves so much time
P8:24:36 <vede> The fun in Minecraft is in actually having to build things.
P8:25:05 <vede> If you want to fly, and have special tools, go get Sauerbraten and edit levels.
P8:25:07 <setveen> i dont want to build crap for 5 hours when i could get it done in one
P8:25:22 <setveen> i have fly, and special tools
P8:25:26 <vede> Sauerbraten even has multiplayer level-editing.
P8:25:33 <Darkebrz> And its a lot more satisfying when you dont hack
P8:25:43 <setveen> ANYWAY
P8:25:51 <vede> I think it's retarded that the vast majority of Minecraft players absolutely NEED hacks to play.
P8:25:53 <setveen> how would i fix those lines?
P8:26:05 <vede> coughcough you're just going to have to deal with them I guess.

P10:11:22 <vede> GAH!
P10:11:45 <vede> I wanna fucking install Java.
P10:11:56 <Eagle> Then do it.
P10:11:59 <vede> can't.
P10:12:02 <vede> No permission.
P10:12:10 <vede> Can't figure out how to get effing permission.
P10:12:22 <Eagle> Are you admin of your computer?
P10:12:34 <chaos95> vede: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
P10:12:36 <chaos95> oh wait :D
P10:12:38 <vede> It's DSL VM.
P10:12:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> he's on linux
P10:13:10 <Eagle> Why are you on linux.
P10:13:10 <chaos95> dsl is pretty useless if you want to do normal day-to-day stuff like use a java applet
P10:13:17 <chaos95> I'm on linux!
P10:13:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> because it's for cool people
P10:13:20 <vede> Yeah, but it was easy to download.
P10:13:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> word
P10:13:21 <LG_Legacy> LINUX YAY
P10:13:25 <vede> So I wanna try it.
P10:13:34 <Eagle> I'm not saying it's a bad thing to use linux
P10:13:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're saying it's an inconvenience?
P10:13:47 <chaos95> in fact not only am I using linux on this workstation, but I'm actually using IRC via an ssh session to _another_ linux box
P10:13:51 <Eagle> But if you could do stuff you wanted to with a mac or a pc there's no reason to switch to linux.
P10:13:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> because i'm using windows right now and it's pretty convenient
P10:14:01 <chaos95> so right now I'm using two linuxes at once
P10:14:06 <Eagle> er
P10:14:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> but trying out linux won't do any harm
P10:14:12 <Eagle> *osx or windows
P10:14:12 <vede> Eagle: It's a principle thing, really.
P10:14:47 <chaos95> for me it's a power thing. linux is a lot more functional than windows in the ways that I need as a programmer
P10:15:02 <chaos95> visual studio notwithstanding
P10:15:03 <vede> I would prefer to use a free OS with no bad restrictive licenses, than a pirated version of Windows.
P10:15:27 <Eagle> You were running a pirated version of Windows?
P10:15:30 <vede> Yeah.
P10:15:32 <vede> Still am.

P10:15:57 <Eagle> What the hell
P10:15:58 <LG_Legacy> Pro here
P10:15:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> ah
P10:16:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> i should try linux sometime soon
P10:16:29 <Eagle> Just get the free Windows 7 RC
P10:16:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> because apparently if you use linux, you're more cooler
P10:16:41 <vede> I'd like to get as far from Microsoft as I can.
P10:16:53 <Eagle> Windows 7 is Vista sans phail
P10:16:55 <vede> Because open-source makes me warm inside.
P10:17:09 <TheOne> what are we chatting about now?
P10:17:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> and google is making its own open source os, how is that?
P10:17:18 <vede> That's cool.
P10:17:28 <Eagle> Chrome OS?
P10:17:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
P10:17:33 <vede> Google is filled with win.
P10:17:38 <Eagle> I heard it's going be very minimalistic
P10:17:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah, and it's meant to be used on portable devices
P10:17:57 <Eagle> i.e. barely any features, pretty much a web browser
P10:18:06 <vede> How does one properly use chmod?
P10:18:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> haha yeah
13P10:18:40 * TheOne feels ignored...
P10:18:50 <vede> TheOne, we're chatting about...
P10:18:55 <vede> Operating systems.
P10:19:15 <Eagle> Real men use DOS
P10:19:26 <TheOne> ah
P10:20:26 <vede> I'd like to use DOS.
P10:20:36 <vede> Have a separate machine for running DOS.

P10:20:41 <vede> Would be cool.
P10:20:57 <chaos95> just use dosbox
P10:21:00 <Eagle> Or you could use the same thing with an interface. It's called an "Operating System"
P10:21:09 <vede> dosbox =/= DOS
P10:21:11 <chaos95> DOS is an operating system...
P10:21:17 <Eagle> Hm.
P10:21:43 <vede> Eagle's saying that Windows is essentially DOS plus pikshurs, I believe.
P10:21:47 <chaos95> vede: it's close enough :D what feature do you want that dos has that dosbox doesn't?
P10:21:54 <Eagle> vede is correct
P10:21:56 <Eagle> :P
P10:21:59 <chaos95> well it used to be
P10:22:06 <vede> Um, not being an emulator.
P10:22:20 <Eagle> Except I was saying that Linux and Macs and Windows is essentially DOS plus pikshurs
P10:22:20 <chaos95> vede: there's also freedos
P10:22:28 <vede> Yeah.
P10:22:28 <chaos95> o_O
P10:23:13 <chaos95> none of those are dos plus pikshurs
P10:23:30 <vede> Uh, yeah...
P10:23:51 <vede> Really, only earlier versions of Windows were DOS plus pikshurs.
P10:24:01 <chaos95> yuh
P10:24:02 <vede> XP and...
P10:24:11 <vede> NT are "dos-like" plus pikshurs.
P10:24:24 <vede>  :D
P10:24:29 <Eagle> You guys are just getting technical.
P10:24:55 <vede> Yeah.
P10:24:57 <chaos95> Eagle: the only similarity that linux or osx bear to 'dos plus pikshurs' is that they have both a gui and a command line interface
P10:25:03 <vede> But you were not being technical enough.
P10:25:07 <Eagle> What I'm saying is that instead of using DOS you could make everything easier on yourself and do the same thing but with easier access.
P10:25:41 <Eagle> As in, instead of typing in something you can click twice and do the same thing.
P10:25:46 <Eagle> Jesus.
P10:26:01 <chaos95> Eagle: I use XWindows on my linux systems, but I spend most of my time in a terminal. why? because the terminal gives me access to much more powerful functionality, and a more efficient interface with which to use it
P10:26:16 <Eagle> interface
P10:26:35 <vede> ... ?
P10:26:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> terminals are cooler
P10:26:40 <chaos95> sentence fragment
P10:26:52 <Eagle> AGAIN. You guys are just getting too technical. I was making a joke. My god guys get a life.
P10:26:52 <chaos95> AnnihilatorBeta: it's true
P10:27:04 <vede>  :'(
P10:27:11 <TheOne> Another cmss question... would it be possible to make different log files based off of restores
P10:27:12 <Eagle> I wasn't insulting you guys. D:
P10:27:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm not too technical at all
P10:27:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> so i have a life? COOL
P10:27:21 <vede>  :','(
P10:27:24 <chaos95> I should start a website called PimpMyTerminal.com
P10:27:47 <chaos95> and people can post requests for someone to customise their terminal app to look hotter
P10:28:10 <gordenfreechmen> ok

P10:44:00 <TheOne> they put out a report that all the livestock raised as a food source creates more greanhouse gasses than all the cars, or something close to that
P10:44:06 <TheOne> let me look it up again
P10:46:00 <gordenfreechmen> what the hell
P10:46:05 <gordenfreechmen> whats up with TF2 having halos
P10:46:06 <TheOne> Eh I was close, peta broght it into the spotlight
P10:46:09 <TheOne> a recent United Nations report determined that raising animals for food generates almost 40 percent more greenhouse-gas emissions than all the world's cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes combined.
P10:46:45 <vede> So, raising animals NOT for food doesn't?
P10:47:11 <TheOne> I guess, but I just find that hard to believe...
P10:47:16 <vede> Me too.
P10:47:25 <Darkebrz> Cows fart
P10:47:25 <rey> so was there more co2 produced back in the colonal days with all the bufflo?
P10:47:26 <Darkebrz> A lot
P10:47:38 <vede> Right, so...
P10:47:56 <vede> Cows are gonna fart regardless of whether or not we eat them.
P10:48:10 <vede> So that's an unfixable problem in the eyes of PETA.
P10:48:19 <vede> You can let people eat cows, or kill all of them.
P10:48:36 <vede> (but still not eat them)
P10:50:10 <vede> Didn't PETA also say that processing beef uses, like, MORE WATER than processing grain?
P10:50:25 <vede> Like, we need to avoid wasting water, because that's a resource we can't get back or some crap.

P11:48:24 <Darkebrz> He said he might if he gets the Prem only script
P11:48:54 <TheOne-Sleeping> that mail made?
P11:50:30 <Rodifan> Haven't seen AvM too often.
P11:50:43 <Rodifan> Wonder what made him stop holding servers?
P11:51:36 <setveen> hmm

P11:52:52 <setveen> Any of you here go to the archives?
P11:53:02 <Darkebrz> setveen: I would if I didn't hate the admins
P11:53:10 <setveen> lmao, why
P11:53:16 <Darkebrz> They ignore everyone
P11:53:17 <setveen> they are fine
P11:53:29 <setveen> just PM them, they answer then
P11:53:46 <Darkebrz> I requested something every 30 seconds or so when it would scroll up, and then after like 5 minutes they kicked me
P11:54:09 <Darkebrz> Then when I came back, asked why I was kicked then said that it would be easier if they just gave me my request, I was kicked again
P11:54:37 <setveen> ive never seen them do something like that
P11:54:42 <Darkebrz> I just wanted Writer on "long" which had been taken away before for no reason
