P1:01:10 <Sharkz> not very experienced with omen. Loaded my server's map in there now what?
P1:01:56 <PuyoDead> edit > map size...
P1:02:11 <Sharkz> thanks
P1:03:02 <citricsquid> On a nice boat, having a nicer dinner with the love of my life. No irc tonight, sneaking in some Twitter.
P1:03:11 <citricsquid> I assume the love of his life is his HTC.
P1:03:21 <PuyoDead> if you add 32 to the top and 32 to the bottom of Y, it'll basically expand the top and bottom with blank space
P1:03:24 <Quatroking> Nah, that would be me.
P1:03:38 <Sharkz> right
P1:03:45 <Sharkz> and that won't raise the sea level?
P1:03:52 <PuyoDead> nope, it'll stay in the middle
P1:03:59 <Sharkz> ok thank you very much
P1:04:09 <PuyoDead> no problem
P1:05:03 <ZomBuster> you might want to expand the bottom with rock instead of air
P1:05:56 <PuyoDead> yea, do a flood fill down there

P3:01:31 <killer2329> smaller blocks would require him to rewrite a large portion of the code
P3:01:59 <Bellum> Bummer
P3:02:16 <PuyoDead> I haven't really been playing much lately, what with no significant updates in so long. I still love the game, I'm just getting impatient for all these planned things
P3:02:20 <killer2329> like most if not all of the physics 
P3:02:48 <killer2329> you do know that this isnt even to beta yet right?
P3:02:50 <vede> Oh god someone on a server I just joined asked why Minecraft said it was in alpha.
P3:02:55 <Bellum> How about...Bigger people!
P3:02:58 <PuyoDead> oh geez, really?
P3:03:27 <killer2329> thought-> alpha -> beta-> game
P3:03:35 <vede> Yeah, that's how it goes.
P3:03:43 <PuyoDead> thanks captain obvious
P3:04:01 <killer2329> alphas for most games take about half a year
P3:04:22 <vede> But he thought beta was the "testing stage".
P3:04:25 <PuyoDead> where'd you pull that number from?
P3:04:51 <killer2329> ok howlong dose it take for a game to be released?

P3:06:52 <vede> No.

P3:07:17 <Bellum> I'm pretty sure the average development time goes over a year. :P
P3:07:21 <killer2329> how many people are working on this game?

P3:11:02 <citricsquid> pre-orders 13th june
P3:11:13 <Bellum> Got my copy w00t
P3:11:14 <citricsquid> survival beta will be out in about 3 weeks.

P3:11:33 <killer2329> meh back to my e2 code
P3:11:43 <citricsquid> vede: started I think.
P3:11:57 <citricsquid> vede: It was available to play a few days later, multiplayer came out around the end of may, I think.

P3:13:25 <PuyoDead> Bellum, not above sea level, and not without hacks/clients
P3:13:31 <citricsquid> I'm just not motivated to build anymore, hoping survival will change that :D
P3:13:33 <Bellum> :(
P3:13:39 <PuyoDead> yea, same here
P3:13:41 <vede> I haven't played all that much recently either, but that's just because multiplayer has devolved from really fun to massive wasteland.
P3:13:46 <PuyoDead> I've been playing RtCW lately
P3:14:02 <citricsquid> vede: Yeah, it's become constant complaining and griefing :(
P3:14:03 <cryzed> Return to castle Wolfenstein?
P3:14:04 <vede> Now that everyone has hacks and it seems half of all the players are griefers.
P3:14:21 <PuyoDead> yup
P3:14:32 <PuyoDead> I played the hell out of Wolf when it first came out
P3:14:32 <vede> And EVERY server has a spawn prison, and half of those don't even let people out.
P3:14:40 <Bellum> egh that's annoying.
P3:14:57 <cryzed> vede: you can't first complain about griefers
P3:15:03 <cryzed> vede: and then about spawn prisons
P3:15:10 <vede> I'm not complaining about spawn prisons.
P3:15:22 <vede> I'm complaining about the "half of those don't even let people out" part.
P3:15:29 <citricsquid> spawn prisons are the silliest idea ever, because they don't work.
P3:15:30 <Bellum> Sure you can, cry, it's easy. :P
P3:15:36 <killer2329> dont attack me for saying this but griefers add a bit of a challenge to the game to try to make you building harder to grief  
P3:15:38 <vede> They do work, to a certain extent.
P3:15:38 <cryzed> Bellum: ._.
P3:15:45 <citricsquid> killer2329: =\
P3:15:49 <killer2329> lies
P3:15:57 <citricsquid> vede: They just make people more determined to grief.
P3:16:09 <vede> Not really.
P3:16:14 <PuyoDead> that's the silliest idea I've heard yet
P3:16:19 <citricsquid> If I see a spawn prison I'll purposefully try and escape it, just to piss off the server op. (when I played, anyway)
P3:16:50 <vede> I think that might just be due to you being a douchebag, then.
P3:16:53 <killer2329> and half of them are just so damn easy to get out of
P3:16:54 <citricsquid> :(
P3:17:08 <Bellum> haha
P3:17:22 <PuyoDead> a lot of them don't realize how easy they are to get out, so they're entirely too basic

P3:19:07 <Bellum> boo
P3:19:10 <cryzed> citricsquid: come to my server :(

P3:19:16 <vede> citricsquid, are hacks being included?
P3:19:21 <citricsquid> cryzed: I don't have hacks, but anyone can use them and escape.
P3:19:29 <vede> I can't.
P3:19:30 <citricsquid> vede: I don't use them, but people do and they make spawn prisons moot.
P3:19:36 <vede> Dude.
P3:19:36 <killer2329> people that dont see the point of spawn prisons should be added to a depopulation list
P3:19:43 <PuyoDead> and considering how many hacks are floating around, that makes a lot of people able to get out

P3:19:51 <cryzed> yeah
P3:19:51 <LKA> i don't see the point in spawn prisons considering it's just a game
P3:19:56 <vede> You seem to think that the fact that some people use hacks means that people that DON'T use hacks cease to exist.
P3:19:56 <citricsquid> cryzed: so? I can just get hacks. 
P3:20:02 <cryzed> citricsquid: :3
P3:20:05 <vede> You WILL keep out the people that don't use hacks.

P3:21:00 <citricsquid> LKA: SRS BSNS
P3:21:07 <vede> You can either keep out NO GRIEFERS, or you can keep out the SMALL GRIEFERS but not the BIG GRIEFERS (ie. with hacks).

P3:21:27 <vede> People like you piss me off.
P3:21:28 <killer2329> the only way to 100% stop griefers is a 1:1 ratio of op to players with each op following a player nonstop

P3:21:46 <JoeyJo0> No, we care about our time.
P3:21:48 <doohan> Life's too short/
P3:21:51 <citricsquid> the IDEA of spawn prisons is great, BUT the implementation is not. This is my point and it's undeniable.
P3:21:51 <JoeyJo0> We spent time into something.
P3:22:00 <LKA> Don't put work into something if you think/know it can be destroyed
P3:22:01 <JoeyJo0> And we don't want to see our efforts gone to waste.

P3:22:06 <JoeyJo0> Okay
P3:22:08 <killer2329> lka you dont like videogames do you?
P3:22:08 <vede> If I built something, and I like the thing I built, I don't want someone to destroy it.
P3:22:15 <vede> The fact that it's virtual is irrelevant.

P3:28:45 <vede> Because everyone should essentially be making their own game.
P3:28:48 <mib_2z0k8h> so i need to use a key command to force quit in safari
P3:28:49 <JoeyJo0> No
P3:28:50 <Doohan> Zoinks!
P3:28:52 <JoeyJo0> Then atleast stop whining.
P3:29:01 <vede> Dude!
P3:29:02 <Doohan> mib_2z0k8h, try using firefox?
P3:29:02 <vede> NO!
P3:29:08 <mib_2z0k8h> should java work the same way on a mac
P3:29:13 <Bellum> Bah, there is no progress there is only change.
P3:29:14 <mooogle> lolol have any of you guys read the scoobydoo copypasta?
P3:29:15 <vede> It's Notch's job to listen to players.
P3:29:15 <mib_2z0k8h> good idea
P3:29:16 <JoeyJo0> I'm saying that if people go whining, they should do something against it or stop whining.
P3:29:18 <Doohan> Yeah it should, but not sure about the safari plugin
P3:29:19 <mib_2z0k8h> i didn't think of that
P3:29:22 <mib_2z0k8h> i have it installed
P3:29:23 <JoeyJo0> No, it's not.
P3:29:30 <Doohan> Give it a go and let us know how you get on.
P3:29:35 <mooogle> what safari plugin?
P3:29:36 <vede> Yes, it seriously is.
P3:29:37 <PuyoDead> hey Joey, my car has been running funny, should I learn mechanics and rebuild the car myself?
P3:29:39 <killer2329> you have to understand this  MAC EPICFAILS AT GAMEING
P3:29:39 <vede> He's the developer.

P3:29:47 <mooogle> oh, i have it installed
P3:29:54 <JoeyJo0> Puyo: Or you could go to the mechanic.
P3:29:59 <vede> Alpha and beta testers are SUPPOSED TO say, "hey mr developer man, there's somethign wrong."
P3:30:06 <PuyoDead> and whine to the mechanic?
P3:30:09 <JoeyJo0> As long as you don't go telling people that your car is broken without doing something against it.
P3:30:13 <citricsquid> vede: no they'r supposed to suck them off and give them money!
P3:30:27 <Doohan> citricsquid, you've been watching the wrong training material.
P3:30:33 <PuyoDead> also, Windows has been giving me some weird errors... guess I'l going to go work at Microsoft to get to the bottom of this
13P3:30:39 * citricsquid takes notchs' penis out of his mouth
P3:30:41 <vede> So, hey, Joey, should people who don't know how to code just stop caring about games then?
P3:30:42 <Bellum> Really citric? I think I should become a developer.
P3:30:45 <Parthon> JoeyJo0: you do realise that the world is *FULL* of people who don't go to the mechanics and just whine for months that their car is making a funny noise?
P3:30:51 <mooogle> lolz wtf
P3:30:52 <TD|Blah> I love the sarcasm in this channel.
P3:30:57 <Doohan> Do most of these DIY vids start with a a mustachioed guy saying "I've come to fix your fridge"
P3:31:01 <Doohan> ?
P3:31:06 <killer2329> theres a difference between reporting a problem with the game and reporting a problem with the player base 
P3:31:21 <vede> I mean, obviously they're not allowed to actually say anything's wrong with the game if they're not going to fix it themselves.
P3:31:23 <JoeyJo0> Vede, Puyo, I'm getting pissed off, if you want to have a discussion with me, actually come with thought-through statements/questions. You're just repeating shit now.
P3:31:26 <Doohan> citricsquid, why did Notch have his penis in his mouth?
P3:31:36 <JoeyJo0> Whining = Telling something is wrong.
P3:31:36 <vede> No, I'm not.
P3:31:41 <PuyoDead> it was a terribly flawed idea in the first place, expect this
P3:31:45 <mooogle> hahahaha i was just lolwtfing all over the place about that citrtic
P3:31:48 <Doohan> Yeah but it's whining if you keep repeating  it.
P3:31:49 <mooogle> citric***

P3:31:57 <Parthon> JoeyJo0: btw, I'm a very skilled programmer that would like to make an anti grief server .. how would I do that?
P3:31:58 <citricsquid> citritic
P3:31:58 <vede> Do you realize what alpha/beta testers are meant to do, Joey?
P3:32:07 <JoeyJo0> Parthon, PM me.
P3:32:16 <Bellum> Make a server where nobody could actually join.
P3:32:25 <Doohan> Like some sort of private game?
P3:32:29 <JoeyJo0> Yeah, test the server, then tell the admin that something's broken.
P3:32:31 <citricsquid> The problem is that most people seem to think that griefing can be fought with validation and/or some sort of algorithim.
P3:32:35 <vede> And even then, why are we not allowed to discuss the game here?
P3:32:39 <JoeyJo0> But NOT go whining in the IRC channel that there are griefers.
P3:32:40 <mooogle> does minecraft even have testers?
P3:32:43 <killer2329> griefing is a player base problem not a problem with the game
P3:32:49 <vede> Are we only allowed to PRAISE Minecraft here?
P3:32:55 <citricsquid> vede: Yes.
P3:32:55 <Parthon> mooogle: everyone is a tester
P3:32:58 <vede> But not discuss flaws?
P3:33:01 <mooogle> well i know that
P3:33:06 <PuyoDead> yea, god forbid people complain about something
P3:33:07 <mooogle> but i meant before the next release
P3:33:09 <citricsquid> vede: EXACTLY. mention a flaw and it's an instaban!!!
13P3:33:31 * Doohan polishes the banhammer.
P3:33:33 <killer2329> theres a difference between saying theres a problem and whining  
P3:33:38 <JoeyJo0> You can mention flaws alright, but mentioning flaws that are already mentioned over 9000 times in the past is getting tiresome.
P3:33:44 <Doohan> Yeah but we all know there's a problem with griefers
P3:33:51 <vede> Well, it's a pretty damn big flaw.
P3:33:52 <Snowman> Griefing is a not a Minecraft problem
P3:33:56 <Doohan> And patiance is required.
P3:33:58 <killer2329> griefing is a player base problem not a problem with the game
P3:34:00 <Bellum> Be sure to tell me all of the flaws that have been mentioned over 9000 times so I know not to mention them.
P3:34:01 <citricsquid> griefing is a human problem, not programming problem.
P3:34:10 <citricsquid> killer2329: you stole what I was saying >:(
P3:34:21 <PuyoDead> kind of difficult to "program" a problem with human nature
P3:34:22 <killer2329> no scroll up i said it a while ago
P3:34:22 <Snowman> Prove it :p
P3:34:25 <vede> Okay, so, the lack of anti-grief is a Minecraft problem.
10P3:34:28 * Saer (Saer@c-68-60-135-121.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P3:34:38 <JoeyJo0> Yes
P3:34:40 <vede> As of yet, the best anti-grief is good ops, but ops can only be so good.
P3:34:43 <citricsquid> There is no viable anti-grief though.
P3:34:44 <Snowman> Everyone hacking is a porblem
P3:34:49 <JoeyJo0> And either you can do something about it, or just shut up and live with it until it's fixed.
P3:35:01 <vede> Joey, fuck you.
P3:35:01 <PuyoDead> that's a terrible idea
P3:35:06 <PuyoDead> absolutely terrible
P3:35:14 <killer2329> no anti-grief is not a required part of the game
P3:35:31 <Bellum> I don't see how an op who has the time to unlock prisons doesn't have the time to just ban instead. :(
P3:35:40 <vede> If we don't get better anti-grief (ie better op tools) then I give up on MP.
P3:35:46 <mib_2z0k8h> WORKS!!!
P3:35:50 <mib_2z0k8h> thx doohan
P3:35:57 <Doohan> Np :)
P3:35:58 <Snowman> Bellum, you have to know someone is griefing before you ban them

P3:36:20 <Snowman> The banning itself isn't that long
P3:36:42 <marky> banning is the easy part... catching them though..
P3:36:52 <Snowman> And OPs can't keep their eyes on everyone the whole time, they want to play the game too
P3:37:15 <killer2329> op =/= player op = job
P3:37:26 <vede> That's shit.
P3:37:30 <Snowman> So OPs can't play the game?
P3:37:32 <killer2329> thats the truth
P3:37:39 <Snowman> that's bullshit
P3:37:41 <Bellum> Hmm, perhaps all placed blocks should be listed as owned by player x. I dunno. 
P3:37:41 <vede> If ops aren't allowed to play, then fuck being an op.
P3:37:42 <PuyoDead> with a large enough amount of people, no
P3:37:48 <Snowman> Bellum, no
P3:38:10 <Doohan> Just treat your server as a beach. At hide tide, everything goes.
P3:38:12 <vede> Block ownership is never going to happen.
P3:38:15 <PuyoDead> there's been times on reddit where all I've done is check the server. then again, with a large, well known public server, that happens
P3:38:34 <killer2329> everyone should just go play gmod >.<
P3:38:44 <PuyoDead> pass
P3:38:47 <Snowman> Today I met a greiefer who griefed because he himself was griefed once
P3:38:49 <PuyoDead> and I bought gmod
P3:38:51 <vede> Right, because gmod gives you the exact same experience as Minecraft, right?
P3:38:58 <Snowman> W
P3:38:59 <Snowman> R
P3:39:00 <killer2329> close but not the same
P3:39:01 <Snowman> O
P3:39:03 <Snowman> N
P3:39:04 <Snowman> G
P3:39:06 <Snowman> LOl, no
P3:39:21 <citricsquid> gmod is to sandbox what rape is to sex.
P3:39:28 <PuyoDead> they have very few similar aspects
P3:39:31 <Snowman> Haven't we had this discussion already?
P3:39:34 <citricsquid> I honestly have no idea what I mean by that.
P3:39:46 <Bellum> What's wrong with owned blocks? :/
P3:39:48 <PuyoDead> it was entertaining either way
10P3:39:49 * UnknownX (chatzilla@66.247.218.200) has joined #minecraft
P3:39:53 <Snowman> Gmod rapes sandbox?
P3:39:57 <citricsquid> Bellum: lmao, do you need to be asked?
P3:39:57 <PuyoDead> Bellum, there's a lot of problems with it
P3:39:59 <vede> Owned blocks would take way too much memory.
P3:40:00 <killer2329> gmod has the same problems but people dont whine about minges ..... asmuch
10P3:40:00 * Doohan changes topic to 'http://www.minecraft.net/ | Forums and Wiki down because citricsquid ran out of money, back soon, stop asking about it! |  My HTC Hero arrived! -notch | Citricsquid is on the naughty step'
P3:40:01 <citricsquid> to ask*
P3:40:04 <Snowman> Takes up too much space and can be used for griefing
P3:40:09 <Durnus> Even if blocks are owned, you can still encase them.
P3:40:28 <citricsquid> owned blocks; increase overhead, just as much griefing potential.
P3:40:32 <PuyoDead> imagine a griefer hops on a server, and covers some building in a bunch of crap
P3:40:41 <PuyoDead> you can't delete it, so then what?
P3:40:52 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: you get an admin to de- OH SHIT.
P3:40:55 <killer2329> with named blocks would come for a demand for block protection 
P3:40:56 <PuyoDead> heh
P3:41:02 <UnknownX> You RAGE QUIT
P3:41:21 <Bellum> Nah, I'm thinking if player y deletes n number of blocks belonging to player x, message ops. Or something.
P3:41:30 <killer2329> like puyo said it just changes the problem
P3:41:31 <PuyoDead> that's also flawed
P3:41:50 <PuyoDead> take the above example without ownership
P3:41:59 <Doohan> Nah block owning also means more memory usage
P3:42:00 <vede> So then we still have the problem of it taking way too much memory.
P3:42:15 <Bellum> I can see how that would be a problem.
P3:42:17 <citricsquid> Bellum: and what about no ops?
P3:42:23 <PuyoDead> yea, this is all pretty much null and void due to the extra data required
P3:42:53 <PuyoDead> "OMG I CANT PLAY LAGGGGGG"
P3:42:58 <citricsquid> there are no viable anti grief "strategies", you can't police user input unless you only allow specific things and minecraft can't be limited like that. Just a good team of ops is perfect.
10P3:43:02 * nolye (Mibbit@user-10mt3uv.cable.mindspring.com) has joined #minecraft
P3:43:21 <Doohan> And we still need to wait and see how paid servers change the dynamics too.
P3:43:23 <vede> Ops still need better tools.
P3:43:29 <Bellum> I don't think it could hurt to give the ops information about what other players are doing.
P3:43:47 <PuyoDead> I do have to admit, the custom server option of having people only be able to edit client side is hillarious
P3:43:49 <citricsquid> Bellum: you need to consider overhead though. Tracking every player action is bad.
P3:43:52 <vede> If you think just having a good team of ops makes the server PERFECT, you're extremely wrong.
P3:43:58 <UnknownX> "Player X is having sex!"
P3:44:01 <citricsquid> vede: How so?
P3:44:03 <nolye> Hi guys
P3:44:05 <PuyoDead> "haha, I'm griefing everything here!" everyone else: nothing changed.
P3:44:09 <vede> Ops can only do so much.
P3:44:11 <citricsquid> nolye: hi :D
P3:44:17 <citricsquid> vede: /ban, sorted.
P3:44:25 <vede> I mean before the ban.
P3:44:31 <vede> Ops can't follow everyone.
P3:44:38 <PuyoDead> then you don't have enough ops
P3:44:43 <nolye> Do you mind answering a question about running a Minecraft server?
P3:44:43 <citricsquid> vede: a GOOD team of ops wouldn't let it get to the point where any irrepairable damage done.
P3:44:43 <vede> Ops DEFINITELY can't follow everyone AT THE SAME TIME.
P3:44:46 <Snowman> We need a cool people server
P3:44:57 <Durnus> Not unless they can, maybe with a separate view for each person. Keep constant watch over everyone. :D
P3:45:00 <Snowman> Where only the best know people of the MC community are allowed
P3:45:09 <Durnus> Mostly joking with that.
P3:45:13 <citricsquid> Snowman: fun idea :}
P3:45:15 <Doohan> Snowman, you have a point. What you're talking about is a private server
P3:45:25 <PuyoDead> nolye, what's the question?
P3:45:27 <killer2329> durnus that would sap bandwidth like no tomorrow 
P3:45:45 <vede> Not necessarily.
P3:45:47 <Snowman> I know it already exists, but we really need one for the famous people
P3:45:50 <Durnus> I don't know exactly how the server's run, so I dunno.
P3:45:52 <nolye> Is it possible to spawn water or lava in your own server? Let's say, to fill up a moat or volcano?
P3:46:00 <Durnus> But it seems to me like ideally it would just use CPU.
P3:46:00 <Snowman> No
P3:46:02 <vede> It could be done without requiring any bandwidth at all.
P3:46:03 <UnknownX> Doohan: But if someone else gets it that isn't cool they can give it out
P3:46:06 <Snowman> Unless it's SP
P3:46:15 <nolye> Well, alright.
P3:46:23 <Durnus> It's just multiple views of the same world IMO.
P3:46:23 <nolye> Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
P3:46:23 <PuyoDead> you could use Omen, if it's your own server
P3:46:24 <killer2329> vede are you an idiot
P3:46:28 <vede> No.

P3:46:55 <Doohan> UnknownX, sorry
P3:46:57 <killer2329> video streaming takes bandwidth  
P3:47:06 <vede> You don't need to stream video.
P3:47:07 <Durnus> O.o
P3:47:18 <Durnus> You think minecraft streams video to each user?
P3:47:26 <vede> The client can tell what the angle and rotation of any player's head is.
P3:47:30 <PuyoDead> I'd be more concerned about the multiple renders causing my PC to kill itself
P3:47:43 <Durnus> But that's the OP's problem. Clipping plane can be really short.
P3:47:47 <killer2329> durnus: "Not unless they can, maybe with a separate VIEW for each person. Keep constant watch over everyone"
P3:47:49 <vede> So if you have the angle and rotation of another player's head, you can render it on your own PC from there.
P3:47:55 <killer2329> video streaming
P3:48:02 <Durnus> ??? I did not say video streaming.

P3:48:07 <vede> No, killer, NOT video streaming.
P3:48:08 <citricsquid> killer2329: no, it'd just be how you view now but with multiple people.
P3:48:14 <PuyoDead> you're confusing "video" with the rendered viewpoint
P3:48:17 <vede> You can render the view from every person on your OWN COMPUTER.
P3:48:19 <Bellum> Killer, you 'view' the stuff your computer renders. :P
P3:48:35 <vede> All they have to do is send you the rotation of their head, which they do anyway.
P3:48:56 <vede> (Well, and their location, but they do that anyway as well.)
P3:49:00 <Durnus> And it you keep clipping plane short, it'll be just as fast as normal rendering. (Unless your computer sucks reeeeally bad.)
P3:49:27 <Bellum> You'd still have to have the op have the coordinates for every player. And this is a silly conversation anyway because there is no way any one OP is going to be able to sit there and look at several different views. :P
P3:49:29 <killer2329> would take separate camera entitys each would have to send its own separate information
P3:49:44 <vede> There's no SENDING involved, killer.
P3:49:50 <vede> Not any more than there already is.
P3:49:50 <killer2329> then your in sp
P3:49:51 <mooogle> #NERDZ
P3:49:54 <PuyoDead> I built this damn machine (you heard me, computer) 6 years ago, and it's already trembling at the idea of multiple rendered views
P3:50:16 <vede> No, killer, you don't seem to understand what we're saying.
P3:50:17 <Durnus> Then you could be a limited-op. Not everyone needs to be a multi-view user.

P3:50:25 <killer2329> each rendered view takes a separate camera it cant be donw with one
P3:50:38 <PuyoDead> not to derail this or anything... but the current "client" floating around shows everyone's location at the same time
P3:50:38 <Durnus> It doesn't need to be!
P3:50:40 <vede> So what?
P3:50:49 <Doohan> Is it really necesary to see everyone at once?
P3:50:49 <vede> That doesn't mean it would take bandwidth, killer.
P3:50:52 <PuyoDead> Doohan, sure thing, do you have any money to give me?
P3:50:56 <killer2329> so each camera HAS TO SEND INFORMATION
P3:51:01 <Doohan> Surely just being able to cycke through them is enough?
P3:51:01 <vede> NO IT DOES NOT.
P3:51:01 <BeatUp90> Hey, since the forums are down, can someone please provide me with a link to download Omen 0.5.0?

P3:51:24 <killer2329> vede if the camera isnt sending information its like not pluging in the moniter
P3:51:35 <vede> Killer, do you know what bandwidth is?
P3:51:36 <killer2329> the prerenderd information
P3:51:37 <Bellum> Killer man
P3:51:47 <Durnus> There is no prerendered information, killer!
P3:51:47 <Bellum> There is no prerendered information

P3:51:51 <Durnus> :D

P3:51:57 <Doohan> killer2329, I had to say this but: stop talking.

P3:52:09 <Doohan> You're embarrassing yourself now.

P3:52:41 <BeatUp90> Does anyone perhaps have a mediafire or rapidshare link to Omen 0.5.0?
P3:52:42 <citricsquid> Leight0n: it only works clientside.
P3:52:48 <PuyoDead> Leight0n, clientside only
P3:52:48 <Doohan> BeatUp90, no idea.
P3:52:54 <Leight0n> someone just deleted admin blocks on my server to flood the entire map :\
P3:52:56 <BeatUp90> Oh, ok.
P3:52:56 <killer2329> ok 1 view renders only the blocks you see right?
P3:53:02 <Leight0n> no ops on in the logs, and verify names is true
P3:53:06 <BeatUp90> Well, thanks anyways.
P3:53:06 <vede> beatUp90, I can send it to you.
P3:53:17 <BeatUp90> That would be great, I would really appreciate it.
P3:53:17 <Doohan> Leight0n, did they maybe dig around them?

P3:53:44 <Leight0n> bottom, top, and sides
P3:54:11 <Bellum> You're CPU / GPU handles that, no matter how many views it would be. It's got nothing to do with bandwidth. 
P3:54:55 <killer2329> dose the server transmit the location of every single block in the server
P3:54:58 <Durnus> Bandwidth doesn't change no matter what with my idea. So please, killer2329, learn the basics of what's going on.
P3:55:06 <citricsquid> killer2329: Your computer downloads the map from the server, the client then loads this map and shows you the map based upon your position. If you were to see what someone else sees you'd just have your co-ordinates changed to those of that user.
P3:55:11 <PuyoDead> the only thing being sent by the players is where they add/remove blocks
P3:55:17 <PuyoDead> which is already happening anyway
P3:55:28 <PuyoDead> so there would be no new information being sent
P3:55:46 <Durnus> And you need that add/remove information no matter where you're looking, so no bandwidth difference. :D
P3:55:51 <killer2329> ok i admit i was wrong   i was tinking of how more advanced games render views
P3:56:01 <Durnus> But not over a network!
P3:56:03 <vede> Um, man.
P3:56:10 <citricsquid> killer2329: no problem :P 
P3:56:16 <vede> Most games render views pretty much the same.
P3:56:41 <PuyoDead> at least, games where everyone is in the same "location" (s in, map)
P3:56:48 <PuyoDead> something like WoW would be totally different
P3:56:50 <killer2329> no they use a camera entity that only sends information in you los
P3:56:54 <UnknownX> Citricsquid: How close are we to that new server?
P3:56:57 <Durnus> Ugh, whatever, as long as I don't hear killer and bandwidth in the same line again.
P3:57:11 <Bellum> I think he may be talking about something else, like with huge maps where some information is loaded and some isn't.
P3:57:16 <JoeyJo0> Bandwidth monsters are killers.
P3:57:17 <Durnus> Oh no... I might have to just repond to that.
P3:57:23 <PuyoDead> exactly
P3:57:36 <citricsquid> be nice now, he apologised for not understanding it, no need to beat him up :D
P3:57:46 <PuyoDead> I'll give him that, yes...

P3:58:03 <UnknownX> Oh...

P3:58:12 <Bellum> Like say, in Fallout 3, detailed information is loaded for the surrounding area, but not for the entire game area.
P3:58:20 <killer2329> hmm i didnt get punched 
P3:59:11 <Durnus> Minecraft has no "zones" so that's non-issue, but I see how he could get that confused.
P3:59:25 <JoeyJo0> Well, it depends on the server
P3:59:47 <JoeyJo0> The default server software makes the client load the map at start.
P3:59:59 <JoeyJo0> And everything else is chunk updates.
P4:00:17 <JoeyJo0> Certain other servers have multiple worlds.
P4:00:36 <Durnus> Guess I just haven't played Minecraft enough then. :P
P4:00:50 <vede> Those aren't actually all the same server, though, Joey.

P4:02:01 <PuyoDead> so it's all really a moot point
P4:02:16 <killer2329> i changed the point now what?
P4:02:17 <PuyoDead> at least, right now
P4:02:19 <vede> I think Notch should have waited a bit longer before starting on Survival.
P4:02:33 <PuyoDead> people probably said that about MP, too
P4:02:44 <PuyoDead> (which was right when I joined, so *shrug*)
P4:02:46 <AngryRob> i like it, a new gameplay mode will really make things interesting

P4:03:03 <vede> Yeah, but it won't be good if he ends up ignoring sandbox mode.
P4:03:21 <UnknownX> vede: I'm barely trying to continue playing sandbox because its boring now
P4:03:39 <PuyoDead> I think we're all going through that, UnknownX
P4:03:53 <killer2329> well you cant really do that much to sandbox and keep it sandbox

P4:04:26 <vede> You can only build so many castles, Bellum.

P7:39:27 <PuyoDead> not at all
P7:39:35 <Zuriki> Since I own none of the games on the list.
P7:39:37 <Zuriki> :D
P7:39:56 <Zuriki> You save something like 75%
P7:40:09 <Eagle> Steam always has amazing deals.
P7:40:17 <Zuriki> Indeed. :)
P7:40:46 <Zuriki> Oh dear. My payment failed. I think I did a step wrong though...

P7:40:54 <Zuriki> I'll check my steam account.
P7:41:05 <Zuriki> Hm, indeed.

P8:24:08 <Eagle> Dwarf Fortress
P8:24:16 <Bossman> Is it any good?
P8:24:18 <Tenoenar> It's not text based, it's tile-based, but uses text for tiles.
P8:24:22 <Darke> Yes
P8:24:23 <Eagle> Depends on what kind of games you like.
P8:24:24 <Darke> So
P8:24:30 <Tenoenar> You can change them to not-text if you want.
P8:24:32 <Darke> Is anyone as good as StarkRavingMad?
P8:24:32 <Eagle> It's pretty much a sandbox roguelike
P8:24:45 <Tenoenar> It's more of a strategy game
P8:24:54 <Tenoenar> built on a roguelike engine
P8:24:55 <Eagle> Sandbox roguelike RTS
P8:24:57 <Tenoenar> which is crazy
P8:25:19 <LG_Legacy> Rts...
P8:25:28 <Eagle> Sandbox roguelike RTS.
P8:25:45 <Tenoenar> it's not incredibly sandbox-y in normal gameplay

P8:26:18 <Eagle> And there is no set goal
P8:26:25 <Eagle> It's very much a sandbox
P8:26:30 <Tenoenar> It's more of a strategy/sim game.
P8:26:38 <Tenoenar> Like Sim City
P8:26:56 <Eagle> But in Sim City you do not need to get resources or anything
P8:27:08 <Eagle> Which is why it's an RTS since you have to actually get all of your resources.
P8:27:09 <Tenoenar> yeah you do o_O
P8:27:20 <Eagle> You just need money in Sim City to build stuff. :P
P8:27:26 <Tenoenar> it's more of an rts because you have to get your resources
P8:27:33 <Tenoenar> money is a resource
P8:27:44 <Tenoenar> and there are also less visible oens, like power and population
P8:27:51 <LG_Legacy> I always liked sim city
P8:27:58 <Eagle> I think you're just stretching it here.
P8:28:30 <Tenoenar> I consider time to be a resource.
P8:28:34 <Eagle> It's like saying that Half-Life 2 is a strategy game because you need to think out strategies sometimes.
P8:28:42 <Tenoenar> not really...
P8:28:43 <Eagle> In order to kill things.
P8:29:31 <Eagle> Sure DF is a sim game, but it's more of an RTS. :P You order around your dorfs to do things that you yourself can't do.
P8:29:52 <Tenoenar> Strategy video games are a genre of video game that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory. -Wikipedia

P8:32:00 <Eagle> <Eagle> Sure DF is a sim game, but it's more of an RTS. :P You order around your dorfs to do things that you yourself can't do.
P8:32:19 <Eagle> You said it wasn't an RTS. That's it. I said it was a sim game too.
P8:32:34 <Tenoenar> It is possible for a game to be in multiple genres!

P8:33:58 <Eagle> :P
P8:34:08 <Visiiri> Ohok.
P8:34:10 <Tenoenar> I think it is both strategy and sim.
P8:34:21 <Eagle> So do I. But it is also sandbox.
P8:34:29 <Visiiri> Well, I'm visiiri there. I just became a sargent. :D 
P8:34:33 <Visiiri> Adios, amigos.
P8:34:37 <Bossman> Sandbox you say?
P8:34:41 <Bossman> Like GMod?
P8:34:47 <Tenoenar> I think it is sandbox less than strategy and sim.
P8:34:51 <PuyoDead> *groan*
10P8:34:52 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|CombatArms
P8:35:06 <Eagle> Sandbox isn't like a sliding meter.
P8:35:10 <Eagle> It's either sandbox or it's not
P8:35:22 <Eagle> You either have a set goal or you don't.
P8:35:28 <Eagle> There is not a winning set goal in DF.
P8:35:38 <Tenoenar> Many games have sandbox modes, as opposed to full sandbox gameplay.
P8:35:56 <LG_Legacy> RTS Sandbox?
P8:35:59 <Tenoenar> Most games have enough room in their possibility space for that kind of behavior.
P8:36:12 <Eagle> Those modes are not "sorta sandbox"
P8:36:43 <PuyoDead> GTA is very much a sandbox like environment, yet there is an overall story to complete
P8:37:06 <Eagle> Yes, but when you aren't doing the main story, there is no set goals
P8:37:07 <Tenoenar> But a game with a sandbox mode, as opposed to it being the main feature, would be less sandbox-centrc.
P8:37:43 <Eagle> When you aren't doing the main storyline in GTA, you can do anything you want. It's not a "sorta sandbox mode"
P8:38:05 <Tenoenar> ah
P8:38:07 <Tenoenar> this will help:
P8:38:10 <Tenoenar> Sandbox mode
P8:38:12 <Tenoenar> In a game with a sandbox mode, a player may turn off or ignore game objectives, or have unlimited access to items.[11] This can open up possibilities that were not intended by the game designer. A sandbox mode is an option in otherwise goal-oriented games, and should be distinguished from open-ended games with no objectives such as SimCity.[11]
P8:38:20 <Tenoenar> -More Wikipedia
P8:39:16 <Eagle> You and your damn Wikipedia. Fine it isn't sandbox. It's open ended. That is what I meant by sandbox.
P8:39:25 <Tenoenar> Okay, I'll agree on that.
P8:39:57 <Eagle> Alright. :D
P8:40:27 <Eagle> So Bossman, Dwarf Fortress is an Open-ended Sim RTS Roguelike on heroin.
P8:40:28 <Eagle> There.
P8:40:32 <Eagle> Definition complete.
P8:41:49 <Tenoenar> I have no personal experience with drugs, but I think "acid" might be more appropriate. =p
P8:41:54 <Eagle> :P
P8:42:30 <Eagle> *Open-ended Sim RTS Roguelike on acid. There. Now enough of your silly literal take on things.
P8:43:11 <Tenoenar> After playing Infiniminer and Minecraft, in the last couple of days, I've decided that there isn't any reason DF can't be done in 3D (graphically)
P8:43:34 <Tenoenar> I've used the tool to export DF maps and view them in 3D, but...
P8:43:43 <Tenoenar> yeah
P8:43:46 <Tenoenar> it would be awesome
P8:44:40 <Eagle> I think that it would be a little bit harder to manage with all of the 3D walls and such getting in the way of your view. But I think it could still work.
P8:45:36 <Tenoenar> you could simulate the 2D view  by moving the camera, and allowing it to cut away walls when needed
P8:45:44 <Tenoenar> the 3D-viewer thing I used could do that
P8:46:07 <Tenoenar> it could theoretically be exactly like the 2D version, if you needed it to be
P8:46:57 <Tenoenar> It'd be awesome to just be able to change layers with the scrollwheel
P8:47:38 <Eagle> Or you could have it like the Sims where you can just choose to not render walls and instead only show the very bottom. :P
P8:47:49 <liq3> Eagle: Yeh, you could have like a “cut-away” thing to view only up to a max z-level.
P8:48:17 <liq3> I tihnk the biggest problem with 3d DF would be getting enough different art assets.
P8:48:25 <Tenoenar> or even... have it draw unfocused levels transparently
P8:48:34 <PuyoDead> back to wolf
P8:48:50 <liq3> The amount of weapons and different materials is crazy.
P8:48:52 <Tenoenar> you could use 2D billboards to start, and slowly work in 3D models
P8:49:17 <Tenoenar> Like how infiniminer has 2D characters.
P8:49:19 <liq3> well you can do basic 3d models like minecraft at first.
P8:50:02 <Tenoenar> Frankly, I'd just like to be able to see more than one thing on a tile at once
P8:50:03 <liq3> it’s just, unless you go the cheap way and just have somewhat differently coloured texture,s you’re going to need like 40 different textures just for land/walls.
P8:50:15 <Tenoenar> as opposed to the "flash through each item" thing
P8:50:20 <liq3> heh.
P8:50:50 <liq3> might be problamatic with the infinite space stone garbage dumps. xD
P8:51:00 <Tenoenar> For a game like DF, I'd stay away from going for realism

P8:51:19 <liq3> hey Alkan.

P8:58:49 <Eagle> It shows what key does what very efficiently.

P9:00:02 <Tenoenar> It has 3 ways to scroll, which are uses inconsistently.
P9:00:08 <Tenoenar> used*
P9:00:10 <Irock> oh that makes sense
P9:00:38 <Eagle> The only way to scroll I've seen is when you change your z layer.
P9:01:14 <liq3> */ and PGUP PGDN are used to scroll, depending on menu.
P9:01:38 <Eagle> Oh right. Thinking of Omen here. :P

P10:01:36 <CrazyCasey> I need a little bit of help if someone doesn't mind, in a server
P10:01:39 <Darke> mail2345|semi-afk, what is the server called??
P10:01:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> unless you know of a really good psp emulator
P10:01:50 <CrazyCasey> I made my own server, opened the port and what not, and everyone can logon to my server
P10:01:52 <CrazyCasey> But I can't logon
P10:01:52 <LG_Legacy> How so Crazt?
P10:01:57 <LG_Legacy> Hm..
P10:02:06 <LG_Legacy> Normally a case of something is blocking you from joining.
P10:02:14 <LG_Legacy> Such as a program doesn't want to let you in minecraft.
P10:02:20 <fleshBasedProcessor> CrazyCasey, you have to use a different link
P10:02:21 <CrazyCasey> I can join other servers just fine though
P10:02:25 <LG_Legacy> Oh
P10:02:27 <fleshBasedProcessor> try looking for it in the wiki
P10:02:29 <PuyoDead> there are no PSP emulators yet
P10:02:31 <LG_Legacy> Use the external link
P10:02:32 <CrazyCasey> The wiki is down, isn't it?
P10:02:36 <Darke> Yes
P10:02:37 <fleshBasedProcessor> oh fuck

P10:03:35 <LG_Legacy> Theres a method but i forgot which.

P10:45:51 <CrazyCasey> hm.
P10:45:53 <LG_Legacy> Did you restart the server?
P10:46:07 <LG_Legacy> Changing the properties without restarting won't affect it.\

P10:49:31 <LG_Legacy> Ah
P10:49:36 <PuyoDead> 25565

P10:49:42 <PuyoDead> that's default
P10:50:04 <Plinky> Okay guys
P10:50:06 <Dex> i have 3 places to put that in, Global PortStart, Global PortEnd, and Base HostPort
P10:50:09 <Dex> where does it go?
P10:50:09 <Plinky> Anyone wanna test this map?

P10:50:21 <LG_Legacy> Now*
P10:50:32 <PuyoDead> start and end can both be 25565
P10:50:33 <LG_Legacy> If it doesn't work then, we put it in all three./
P10:50:46 <Dex> is it TCP or UDP protocol?
P10:50:49 <LG_Legacy> Both
P10:50:53 <Dex> i can only select one
P10:50:59 <Dex> >_>
P10:51:00 <LG_Legacy> Then make two of the same ports.
P10:51:01 <CrazyCasey> Make two opening ports
P10:51:04 <Dex> k
P10:51:07 <CrazyCasey> One as TCP and one as UDP
P10:51:11 <Dex> okay
P10:51:35 <Plinky> Anyone got a server they might be willing to test a map on?
P10:51:35 <Dex> okay i got a invalid Global PortStart range
P10:51:40 <Dex> i can't just put it into base
P10:51:40 <LG_Legacy> Ojh
