A3:28:27 <vede> No griefing, no chance of spawn prisons with stupid ops, no chance of stupid maps.
A3:28:30 <mail2345> and  the

A3:28:33 <Bobo> lol
A3:28:41 <Bobo> i can't stand people complaining about spawn prisons
A3:28:43 <mail2345> well, I have my own server
A3:28:46 <mail2345> it's awesome
A3:28:48 <mail2345> but
A3:28:50 <mail2345> not 24/7
A3:28:51 <vede> I don't dislike spawn prisons.
A3:28:55 <vede> But GODDAMN.
A3:28:57 <mail2345> because I op it so much
A3:29:11 <Bobo> i always have a spawn prison on my server
A3:29:20 <mail2345> me too
A3:29:24 <mail2345> big one
A3:29:24 <Bobo> well, when i ran one

A3:29:31 <Bobo> havent played mc for a fair while
A3:29:36 <Bobo> waiting for some new features 
A3:29:39 <mail2345> and I forced everyone to agree to a contract
A3:29:43 <Bobo> lol
A3:29:45 <mail2345> before coming in
A3:29:46 <vede> When EVERY SINGLE EFFING SERVER has a damn spawn prison, and so many have ops that are either not there or just don't care.

A3:30:44 <vede> And you HAVE to deal with spawn prisons in order to play the freaking game without griefers, and even with them, server still get griefed.
A3:31:04 <mail2345> record on my server for a long griefing attack
A3:31:08 <mail2345> is two creations
A3:31:12 <mail2345> sorry
A3:31:16 <mail2345> that is the high average
A3:31:27 <mail2345> average creation destruction is about
A3:31:46 <mail2345> a quater of a standard sprite's worth of damage
A3:31:49 <mail2345> if you op well
A3:32:04 <vede> The entire multiplayer landscape is like a field of corroded, barely recognizable structures.
A3:32:17 <vede> EVERYWHERE I GO, it seems like a freaking warzone.
A3:32:40 <mail2345> hmm
A3:32:49 <vede> But singleplayer is pristine.
A3:32:50 <mail2345> I'll go tell you when my server is up
A3:32:54 <mail2345> try it for your self
A3:33:20 <Bobo> my server was always really clean and nice
A3:33:24 <vede> All that combined with the fact that hacks may as well fucking be part of the core game now.
A3:34:28 <mail2345> well
A3:34:37 <mail2345> if notch just keeps on shifting memeory around
A3:34:43 <mail2345> hacks aren't a problem
A3:35:17 <vede> Shifting memory around?
A3:35:32 <vede> I don't see how that could fix it...
A3:35:43 <scanlonman_> The only way to fix it is to move everything server side.
A3:35:53 <scanlonman_> Or have the server authenticate the data being sent to it.
A3:35:59 <mail2345> it's a temp solution
A3:36:01 <vede> A hacked client could just figure out the mix during the coordination process.
A3:36:05 <mail2345> the hacks scan memory
A3:36:21 <mail2345> so, if notch just goes and hides some stuff
A3:36:28 <mail2345> you get a bit more time w/o hacks
A3:36:35 <mail2345> just automate changes
A3:36:43 <mail2345> and incorpate them every update
A3:36:44 <mail2345> done
A3:36:54 <vede> I doubt that would help much.
A3:37:21 <mail2345> eh, deoends on how good at hdihg
A3:37:31 <mail2345> he is, and how many updates there are
A3:37:52 <vede> And it's far too temporary to be any good.
A3:38:48 <vede> The only good multiplayer would be a self-run server, if you ask me.
A3:39:22 <vede> So you can rain pure unadulterated terror upon people for whatever reason you wish.

A9:36:24 <Hughes_dePayens> it's not public

A9:38:39 <Miclee> Canada.
A9:38:50 <Plinky> Pfft
A9:38:54 <Miclee> Well, actually I'm Irish.
A9:38:57 <Miclee> And French.
A9:39:00 <LucanC> No I'm Irish.
A9:39:03 <Plinky> It would be today for the real people.
A9:39:13 <Plinky> I.E. the Australians.
A9:39:16 <Miclee> I was born in Ireland.
A9:39:19 <Miclee> Moved to Canada
A9:39:24 <JoeyJo0> Wow, I've got like over 9000 Billon bars, in DF
A9:39:32 <LucanC> where abouts were you born?
A9:39:42 <JoeyJo0> When will I strike the next Tetrahedrite vein?
A9:39:49 <Plinky> Joey tgat was a good joke XD
A9:39:56 <Plinky> Billon bars worth it then?
A9:39:56 <Miclee> And my last name was taken from King Louis the Sixteenth during the French Revolution.
A9:39:58 <Plinky> that*
A9:40:00 <JoeyJo0> Well
A9:40:08 <JoeyJo0> If you have Tetrahedrite, yes.
A9:40:15 <maver> grrr
A9:40:24 <LucanC> Miclee, where in Ireland were you born?
A9:40:25 <Miclee> Now, I'm off to play Civ 4, I guess.
A9:40:26 <maver> smoothing floors doesn't give much exp, does it?
A9:40:28 <Miclee> Dublin.
A9:40:32 <LucanC> cool.
A9:40:41 <JoeyJo0> Tetrahedrite has 20% change of making silver alongside the usual copper.
A9:40:51 <JoeyJo0> But it has a 100% chance of tetrahedrite.
A9:41:07 <JoeyJo0> Tetrahedrite needs equal parts silver and copper.
A9:41:09 <JoeyJo0> So yeah, it's worth it :P
A9:41:25 <JoeyJo0> Also, Billon ;/
A9:41:30 <JoeyJo0> Maded a mistake
A9:41:52 <maver> You guys think Ishould just go and start engraving the floors now or wait till I've smoothed enough stuff so that I have a team of legendary engravers?
A9:42:00 <JoeyJo0> Hehehe
A9:42:13 <JoeyJo0> I am going to build a fractal bedroom
A9:42:17 <JoeyJo0> After that's engraved...
A9:42:27 <JoeyJo0> Also, all my miners are legendary
A9:42:43 <JoeyJo0> So are all my Gem cutter/setters >_>
A9:43:04 <JoeyJo0> Damn Gem cutters always get Fey moods while the blacksmiths get possessed.
A9:43:37 <maver> :(
A9:43:43 <SMP> is the server up yet?
A9:43:47 <Plinky> I'm gonna be so cheap
A9:43:49 <maver> I got a fey mood, but it was on a miner :(
A9:43:54 <JoeyJo0> lolol
A9:44:07 <Plinky> I'll start on a kobold/goblin fortress
A9:44:09 <JoeyJo0> I get fey moods on useless people all the time.
A9:44:13 <Plinky> Then I'll abandon
A9:44:19 <Plinky> The reclaim.
A9:44:20 <JoeyJo0> Cheesemaker gets a fey! :P
A9:44:29 <JoeyJo0> Plinky: Yeah, that's useful.
A9:44:40 <maver> I want my fort to be worth over 1,000, 000
A9:44:42 <Plinky> Joey, which symbol is kobold and which is goblin? (fortress wise)
A9:44:52 <JoeyJo0> k = Kobold
A9:44:55 <JoeyJo0> g = Goblin.
A9:45:00 <Plinky> My fort on my good save is worth over 1mil
A9:45:03 <JoeyJo0> Or do you mean on the local map?
A9:45:07 <Plinky> Joey as in on the map?
A9:45:12 <JoeyJo0> Don't know that one.
A9:45:21 <JoeyJo0> I think it appears the same as a human settlement
A9:45:32 <JoeyJo0> Just hover over it, you'll see.
A9:46:34 <Plinky> Pink pi like symbols
A9:46:39 <JoeyJo0> I'm going to continue on my king's room.
A9:47:41 <Plinky> And it didn't give me a warning

A10:06:02 <criticaloctopus> Google Chrome is so much faster
A10:06:06 <JoeyJo0> Chrome sucks
A10:06:08 <JoeyJo0> Use Opera
A10:06:14 <maver> it's a far cleaner design
A10:06:17 <criticaloctopus> I want to go to a site? I type in the first letter then press enter
A10:06:21 <JoeyJo0> But it's fucking Google.
A10:06:28 <maver> but there is one or two things I dislike about chrome which ruin it

A10:09:25 <criticaloctopus> It is a lot faster and simpler than firefox
A10:09:43 <ChJees> Less clutter Underd0g
A10:09:45 <criticaloctopus> Now when I go on firefox, I have to get rid of all my toolbars and have a chrome skin >_>
A10:09:56 <JoeyJo0> But it's Google, and it uses a single process for every tab...
A10:10:17 <Underd0g> I don't think Firefox or Opera are cluttered. They're customizeable too
A10:10:20 <JoeyJo0> Which is actually slower.
A10:10:24 <JoeyJo0> And Opera is not cluttered.
A10:10:25 <criticaloctopus> But the processes are about as small as all the firefoxes ones together
A10:10:38 <JoeyJo0> I keep 13 tabs open in Opera at the moment.
A10:10:46 <criticaloctopus> Besides, thats actually a plus with minecraft, seeing as it freezes _ a lot_
A10:10:48 <JoeyJo0> And it's very easy to use, still.
A10:10:53 <ChJees> All i see on Chrome: Tabs, Back and Forward Buttons, Favorite Button, Adress Bar, Go Button, Edit and Dev Stuff & Settings and Help

P12:51:04 <SteGriff> http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=30250
P12:51:09 <brorave> you can play online to
P12:51:10 <Marach> ninja and 3d are right
P12:51:21 <SteGriff> Teenage mutant ninja puppets is an existing game
P12:51:23 <Marach> this game is hard
P12:51:37 <SteGriff> link above
P12:51:56 <Marach> but actions are repetitive so you can just copy killer moves from a wiki :)

P1:28:34 <venn177> My computer is angry with me about something, and my server will be up again once my router decides it wants to have a static IP

P10:18:19 <Cueball> oh jesus

P10:19:35 <Cueball> i feel compelled to
P10:19:38 <Darke> Deadpool isn't even related to either one of those?
P10:19:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> Animator, what game were you working on and why are you trying to find a programmer?
P10:20:00 <Cueball> though whenever i want to talk to notch, he's never here
P10:20:13 <Cueball> how can he prove to me that i should give him money if i cant see him
P10:20:14 <Cueball> :(
P10:20:19 <LG_Legacy> Notch is on tuesday through thursday
P10:20:32 <Darke> He will be on tomorrow
P10:20:42 <Animator> I was going to work on a couple of platforming projects.
P10:20:43 <flyboy> What'shis timezone?
P10:20:44 <Darke> Cueball: He is on when you sleep
P10:20:49 <Darke> I dont remember

P10:20:59 <Darke> But its around 3 AM for him
P10:21:00 <flyboy> What's his timezone?
P10:21:05 <flyboy> ok

P10:21:23 <flyboy> :(
P10:21:28 <Animator> A programmer.
P10:21:31 <Animator> Eventually I did.
P10:21:38 <Animator> But hes bailed on me.
P10:21:51 <Animator> We haven't spoken for almost a month. I've e-mailed him twice.
P10:21:59 <Darke> Okay guys
P10:21:59 <Darke> So
P10:22:00 <Animator> No response.

P10:22:13 <Darke> Though I warn you
P10:22:14 <Darke> It is shit
P10:22:25 <Animator> I'll take out my sadness on Tasty Static.
P10:22:30 <fleshBasedProcessor> Couple of questions. I might be willing to try and code some things for you, but I want to make sure you know what you are talking about first
P10:22:31 <Cueball> :(
P10:22:45 <fleshBasedProcessor> for all I know your coder was compleatly justified in dropping you
P10:23:02 <Cueball> oh well
P10:23:08 <Cueball> notch is a good guy
P10:23:12 <Cueball> weve talked before
P10:23:19 <Animator> Actually, no.
P10:23:24 <fleshBasedProcessor> First, are you providing the art assets. I can not draw and that is the main reason I would be willing to let you be a designer for me
P10:23:29 <Cueball> NO?
P10:23:30 <Animator> I already plotted out the entire game and art.
P10:23:52 <Animator> Some things aren't done yet, but a great majority is complete.
P10:24:00 <fleshBasedProcessor> Ok, give me a quick rundown, this might be worth my time
