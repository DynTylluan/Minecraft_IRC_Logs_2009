A12:53:44 <PrinceOfFire59> lol
A12:53:56 <gear1> you cant do that on the DS i think

A1:39:02 <mail2345> here
A1:39:29 <ache> I was wondering, 'cause i just started the game like.. yesterday?
A1:39:54 <ache> You know, there was no-clip etc. which i noticed from threads, has been removed.. 
A1:40:13 <ache> My friend, told me about this ''hack'' But a load of people have it
A1:40:31 <ache> and it lets you fly, so it's easyier/faster to construct your builds. 
A1:40:43 <mail2345> idk where it is
A1:40:46 <ache> Is it like, account bannable or anything?
A1:40:51 <ache> :[
A1:41:03 <mail2345> err, you will possibly get banned based if the op
A1:41:07 <mail2345> approves or not
A1:41:21 <ache> Would you just get banned from the certain server though?
A1:41:34 <mail2345> yea.
A1:41:38 <ache> Because all it runs of a network of private servers, bascially.. 
A1:41:59 <ache> Not one main server, plus it's not really a hack that makes the game unfair to other players.. 
A1:42:13 <ache> I was just wondering, i'd rather know then not and get banned D:
A1:42:22 <mail2345> the fourms will ban you
A1:42:49 <ache> What?
A1:42:57 <mail2345> if you psot a hack on the fourms
A1:43:01 <mail2345> you will get banned

A1:43:16 <gear1> if you're on a server with people you know
A1:43:21 <gear1> then you're not going to get banned

A1:48:26 <ache> 'cause, i did this mario thing, and he took it down. and put another one, which sucked ass.

A2:49:43 <LG_Legacy> Anyone on the minecraft forums can see

A2:49:50 <LG_Legacy> News and announcements
A2:49:58 <LG_Legacy> I believe
A2:50:06 <LG_Legacy> That Lg-legacy was that same person under a proxy
A2:50:13 <LG_Legacy> Thats just my belief
A2:50:58 <LG-Legacy> I don't see anything under news and announcement
A2:51:03 <Kirbycode> ..anyway, this game needs more swastikas.
A2:51:08 <LG_Legacy> Heh
A2:51:27 <LG_Legacy> Fun munther
A2:51:38 <LG_Legacy> The XIII/troll input is interesting
A2:51:42 <LG_Legacy> And has high suspiciouns
A2:51:49 <mail2345> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=11996#p11996
A2:51:53 <LG_Legacy> That makes me believe that you, are the same person

A2:52:18 <mail2345> and whois LG-Legacy
A2:52:26 <mail2345> notice a pattern?
A2:52:30 <LG_Legacy> Heh
A2:52:47 <LG-Legacy> So wait
A2:52:57 <LG-Legacy> Are you saying Munther and Munther_V2 are the same person?
A2:53:01 <mail2345> oh, wait he got a new ip.
A2:53:04 <mail2345> the troll.
A2:53:14 <Dave___> haha soiling = my pants lmao
A2:53:19 <Kirbycode> Does it really matter?
A2:53:32 <Dave___> i thought of that as soon as i saw the client say that the first time i played
A2:53:35 <LG_Legacy> Either way, i would like this to be taken care of before he causes anymore... 'damage'
13A2:53:48 * Kirbycode reloads map
A2:53:49 <Kirbycode> what damage?
A2:53:55 <LG-Legacy> Yes
A2:53:55 <LG_Legacy> Nothing kirby
A2:53:57 <LG_Legacy> You missed it
A2:53:58 <mail2345> and I'm a bit paranoid and think a few people
A2:54:01 <LG-Legacy> Exactly what damage has been done?
A2:54:10 <mail2345> actaulyl belive what trolls say
A2:54:17 <TestDummy> You guys know what? This almost sounds like something your op should be handling.
A2:54:23 <LG_Legacy> He's afk
A2:54:23 <LG-Legacy> Lol
A2:54:25 <TestDummy> We're not babysitters.
A2:54:26 <LG_Legacy> I tried to callsign him
A2:54:27 <mail2345> who is AFK forever
A2:54:27 <LG-Legacy> They wish they were ops
A2:54:37 <LG_Legacy> I would op it myself, but the main man is almost never on
A2:54:45 <mail2345> We need more ops.
A2:54:48 <LG_Legacy> Indeed
A2:54:51 <LG_Legacy> I emailed notch
A2:54:56 <Kirbycode> I blame the fact that ops can, in fact, kick other OPs.
A2:54:56 <LG-Legacy> Mail has self-esteem issues though so they wont make him one.  And LG_Legacy and is a power hungry man
A2:54:57 <TestDummy> Then have him appoint one of you. It isn't rocket science.
A2:55:09 <LG_Legacy> I have TestDummy.
A2:55:22 <LG_Legacy> And enough Munter.
A2:55:31 <Kirbycode> Seriously, if they're on the same level as each other, why can they kick each other?
A2:55:38 <Kirbycode> Might as well give players the ability to kick each other.
A2:55:38 <LG_Legacy> *shrugs*
A2:55:50 <LG_Legacy> Heh
A2:55:53 <LG_Legacy> Blame notch
A2:55:55 <LG_Legacy> >_>

A3:10:06 <LG-Legacy> You see, he has terrible social skills therefore preventing him from becoming an op
A3:10:44 <mail2345> public key auth relies on some mathamatical thing.
A3:10:59 <Dave___> why are you talking about encryption mail?
A3:11:16 <mail2345> all I remeber is that cracking it relys on factoring two very large prime numbers. and public keys can be used for authentication.

P12:11:58 <Darkebrz> HELLO
P12:12:03 <C418> hm. you
P12:12:05 <C418> tell me
P12:12:07 <Peroggi> I could understand if they had banned me from IRC, I was actually being an asshole here
P12:12:12 <C418> do you have a dynamic IP?
P12:12:18 <Peroggi> no I do not
P12:12:24 <C418> oh well
P12:12:25 <Zachariasmith> anyone seen Allnaturals mcadmin thing?
P12:12:29 <Peroggi> errr
P12:12:32 <C418> then I understand why everyone wants you to have a permantent ban
P12:12:36 <SteGriff> Plus Zuriki deleting your server wiki page due to you apparently having been banned
P12:12:47 <LG-Legacy> Thats protected now
P12:12:54 <Peroggi> ya and that page is irrelevant >.> I think Zuriki hates me
P12:13:02 <SteGriff> Protected?
P12:13:05 <LG-Legacy> Yes.
P12:13:12 <LG-Legacy> It's now property of the Gentlemen staff
P12:13:16 <Peroggi> :D
P12:13:19 <Zuriki> You blame me for your ban.
P12:13:38 <Zuriki> When in actual fact there was a few people who wanted you banned.
P12:13:45 <SteGriff> But why delete his wiki page?
P12:13:47 <LG-Legacy> May zuriki hate you or not, meh. I do believe the wiki was too much, but the forum ban? I don't know, not going that far.
P12:13:55 <SteGriff> the server was still online, right?
P12:14:04 <Peroggi> yes it was
P12:14:13 <SteGriff> So it gets to keep its wiki page
P12:14:25 <LG-Legacy> Even if it may be down or not.
P12:14:30 <Peroggi> Plus Zuriki all the reasons you specified in my ban appeal were irrelevant to the forum
P12:14:31 <LG-Legacy> We still stand as a Team.
P12:14:43 <SteGriff> Also, LG-Legacy: I have a little issue with your 'protection' of the page, despite understanding your reasoning
P12:14:44 <Peroggi> sure I was trolling and discussing griefing here on IRC, but not at all on the forum
P12:14:48 <LG-Legacy> Ah?
P12:14:57 <LG-Legacy> Speak before yourself, freedom of your own belief and speech
P12:15:10 <SteGriff> You can't have a page on the wiki that doesn't play by the wiki's rules.
P12:15:23 <LG-Legacy> Ah?
P12:15:43 <SteGriff> You can't just say "no-one else on the wiki may edit this page". It's a WIKI
12P12:16:07 * Zachariasmith (Mibbit@71.17.2.70) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P12:16:15 <LG-Legacy> So you're saying that if you make the page for your own server, you can't protect it from anyone else except those who you choose?
P12:16:35 <LG-Legacy> And if you may
P12:16:39 <LG-Legacy> Show me the wikis rules
P12:16:42 <Peroggi> I don't mind if it's not "protected"
P12:16:46 <Darkebrz> LG-Legacy: You cant
P12:16:48 <SteGriff> I'm a gentleman server op, so it doesnt't really affect me, but the values stand: You make a page, you release it to the mercy of the wiki. It says that on the wiki page creation page
P12:16:57 <Darkebrz> The point of a wiki is that everyone can edit
P12:17:05 <LG-Legacy> Hm..
P12:17:13 <SteGriff> "Please note that all contributions to Minepedia may be edited, altered, or removed by other contributors. If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly, then do not submit it here.
P12:17:14 <SteGriff> You are also promising us that you wrote this yourself, or copied it from a public domain or similar free resource (see Minepedia:Copyrights for details). Do not submit copyrighted work without permission!"
P12:17:27 <Peroggi> a message could still be left to the effect that my ban is irrelevant to the state of the page?
P12:17:37 <SteGriff> yes
P12:17:46 <SteGriff> i agree. page deletion was out of line
P12:17:54 <SteGriff> Egos were involved, me suspects.
P12:17:59 <LG-Legacy> Then the protection/message will be removed, but a problem will occur if it is still edited.
P12:18:01 <Peroggi> that would work fine the stuff about the no one else editing the page can be taken out
P12:18:23 <Peroggi> alos Stegriff that is my opinion as well >.>
P12:18:48 <SteGriff> I personally like Zuriki, she's a clever lady, but I don't agree with the page wiping.
P12:18:55 <LG-Legacy> Aye
P12:19:01 <Real> What page wiping?
P12:19:04 <SteGriff> LG: the only reason this has come about is because of the page's deletion, right? I've edited the page a few times to tidy it up and add information
P12:19:04 <LG-Legacy> But we all end up falling in a ditch accidently
P12:19:33 <SteGriff> Wut?
P12:19:41 <LG-Legacy> And it would appear so, i wouldn't want anyone else trying to do the same
P12:19:57 <SteGriff> Trying to do what?
P12:20:03 <SteGriff> also, remember it can easily be rolledback
P12:20:04 <LG-Legacy> Trying to wipe it
P12:20:15 <LG-Legacy> I know this.
P12:20:17 <LG-Legacy> But either way.
P12:20:19 <SteGriff> No-one's gonna try that again
P12:20:24 <SteGriff> There's no point
P12:20:35 <LG-Legacy> I just think it was a hastey and bad decision is all.
P12:20:44 <Zuriki> Also, I have a distaste for people immitating others.
P12:20:52 <Peroggi> hmmm?
P12:20:53 <LG-Legacy> None the less not intentional for any harm, right?
P12:21:03 <LG-Legacy> Ah you remind me
P12:21:05 <Peroggi> what do you mean zuriki
P12:21:11 <Zuriki> LG
P12:21:15 <LG-Legacy> I'm the real
P12:21:16 <LG-Legacy> Relax
P12:21:20 <LG-Legacy> I'm waiting on the email
P12:21:21 <Peroggi> oh lol

P12:23:20 <Zuriki> Yes...
P12:23:34 <Zuriki> Not that I give two.
P12:24:12 <Zuriki> Also, the last few days here on the community have been miserably low for me.
P12:24:28 <Zuriki> I just don't feel as connected to it as I once was.
P12:24:39 <Peroggi> So you banned me and blanked my page?
P12:24:44 <SteGriff> Leave it
P12:24:50 <LG_Legacy> Aye, leave it mate.
P12:24:52 <Peroggi> mhhhhmm
P12:25:03 <Zuriki> That's completely unrelated.
P12:25:14 <LG_Legacy> As for Zuriki, what have you mean by so far away from us?
P12:25:41 <SteGriff> I can imagine
P12:25:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Peroggi is back?
P12:25:49 <SteGriff> just not feeling connected with the community
P12:25:50 <Zuriki> I just feel the overall community spirit is different.
P12:25:51 <Peroggi> I am
P12:25:52 <SteGriff> for whatever reason
P12:25:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> How'd you like the ban I got you yesterday Peroggi
P12:25:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> was it nice?

P12:26:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> this is not the place to coordinate griefing
P12:26:14 <Peroggi> Not so much and that question makes it seem to me that it was a personal reason you gave me the aformentioned ban
P12:26:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I didn't ban you
P12:26:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> C418 did
P12:26:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> and he has nothing personal
P12:26:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> I sent him IRC logs
P12:26:30 <Peroggi> I wouldn't know, I was afk
P12:26:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I pasted an excerpt of what I sent him in the forums Peroggi
P12:26:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> did you see those?

P12:27:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Perogi> I'll go grief when I can get inbetween your backups
P12:27:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Perogi> see you then
P12:27:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> <Perogi> I will grief just before an auto backup

P12:27:23 <Peroggi> as I said I was discussing server security with pl0x

P12:27:32 <Peroggi> you can ask him hes non to shook up about it and I've never been to his server
P12:27:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ruining your grief fest?
P12:27:38 <Peroggi> ask him to go through his logs, I've never been there
P12:27:41 <LG_Legacy> You're only sparking up more problems and drama by pulling up an old subject you know Allnatural? IF you want to speak with him, talk to him in a diff channel or PM.
P12:27:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> that wasn't even directed at Pl0x

P12:28:28 <LG_Legacy> Blah blah blah..
P12:28:35 <Peroggi> that was a joke as I had already admitted to him that I griefed his server

P12:29:53 <Peroggi> yes I frequently trolled IRC and I could understand an irc ban, its the forum ban that irritates me as my behaviour on the forum is perfectly acceptable :(
P12:30:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then why are you here?
P12:30:09 <Peroggi> to discuss it obviously
P12:30:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Go somewhere else to discuss it
P12:30:17 <LG_Legacy> He doesn't know bans are cleared
P12:30:22 <LG_Legacy> Or he does..

P12:30:25 <LG_Legacy> Meh
P12:30:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just because Notch hates permabans doesn't mean you should come back
P12:30:42 <Peroggi> I don't think citricsquid really cares he just said that all mod decisions are final
P12:30:47 <Peroggi> in mah ban appeal thead
P12:30:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because I showed him the logs

P12:31:06 <Peroggi> IRC logs
P12:31:16 <citricsquid> If there is a legitimate reason for it, I won't revert a moderators decision, unless you can say that it's wrong and provide evidence.

P12:34:16 <citricsquid> got a link to the topic you were banned for?
P12:34:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: Zuriki deleted the topic.  It was the Gentlemen's server I think
P12:34:48 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Heh, well I didn't think there was anything wrong with the ban, but I'd review it anyone as he's being polite.
P12:34:52 <Peroggi> she cited me being banned as a fit reason to close the server thread 
P12:34:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Peroggi: You also tried to evade the ban three times
P12:35:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> What was up with that?
P12:35:11 <Peroggi> that was to appeal it as I had no fair trail or anything of the sort
P12:35:21 <LG_Legacy> Rule #45 of Forums
P12:35:21 <citricsquid> but you were posting in other threads?

P12:36:26 <LG_Legacy> A little harsh post is found so far, but pointed towards your team.
P12:36:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> He was banned, tried to evade it, failed, and now he's begging to get back in
P12:36:37 <Peroggi> was that the post about undeadsteak LG?
P12:36:41 <citricsquid> well, I'm nto "undermining" zurikis decision, it's final, but I wouldn't personally have a problem with you being unbanned because you do seem reasonable, BUT it's entirely down to zuriki.
P12:36:55 <Peroggi> alright citricsquid thanks
P12:37:07 <PuyoDead> well lovely, I look forward to future troll attempts
P12:37:11 <LG_Legacy> Indeed, but it's not ban-worthy so meh

P12:39:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes
P12:39:24 <Peroggi> I was defending Nazism, someone has to and I've been reading Mein Kampf lately

P12:39:25 <PrinceOfFire59> thread onn nazis?
P12:39:27 <Peroggi> the topic interests me
P12:39:34 <LG_Legacy> Hm.
P12:39:39 <PuyoDead> hence, trolling
P12:39:54 <LG_Legacy> CitricSquid, i fail to find any evidence of any forum posts worthy of being banned for unless Zuriki herself has deleted the posts?
P12:39:54 <Peroggi> I was not debating with the intent of causing anyone grief Puyo
P12:39:59 <Peroggi> I was debating to get points across
P12:40:06 <Pyoko123> I STILL LIKE PLAYING GUITAR
P12:40:20 <PrinceOfFire59> GOOD
P12:40:27 <citricsquid> Zuriki removed the thread.
P12:40:39 <PrinceOfFire59> WHY ARE WE YELLING?
P12:40:40 <LG_Legacy> There was a thread that caused this?
P12:40:50 <citricsquid> yes...
P12:40:54 <Peroggi> my entire server thread has been removed? oh
P12:40:56 <Peroggi> oh my
P12:40:57 <LG_Legacy> Is it to still avail?
P12:41:07 <Zuriki> Peroggi
P12:41:11 <Pyoko123> YELLING
P12:41:11 <citricsquid> anyway, CEASE DISCUSSION. It's up to Zuriki, so if you have any problems direct them at her but her decision is final.
P12:41:13 <Zuriki> You can recover it if you want.
P12:41:24 <Peroggi> well I do want that but I'm not sure if I can :/
P12:41:31 <Zuriki> I can
P12:41:36 <Zuriki> I saved a copy of it
P12:41:40 <Peroggi> that would be great

P12:45:25 <Peroggi> mhm!
P12:45:25 <PrinceOfFire59> what did he do?
P12:45:26 <Zuriki> I banned him once.
P12:45:30 <Zuriki> I felt attacked.
P12:45:35 <SteGriff> This is a democracy

P12:45:38 <Peroggi> why did you ever feel attacked?
P12:45:47 <Zuriki> Trolling, open discussion of griefing.
P12:45:52 <Zuriki> Arranging griefing raids.
P12:45:58 <Peroggi> again this was in IRC and is no grounds to ban me on the forum
P12:45:58 <Zuriki> Sure, mostly on the IRC.
P12:46:04 <PrinceOfFire59> what did he do thats banworthy?
P12:46:12 <Zuriki> But since the IRC is an extension of the forums in a way.

P12:50:40 <Peroggi> if you were to ask pl0x I'm sure he would be none too shook up about it
P12:50:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> now that we cut him off, he wants in, so he'll suck up and go back to his usual BS
P12:50:54 <PuyoDead> you simply don't do that
P12:51:01 <Peroggi> also I would like ot raise the question as to why you didn't ban UndeadSteak despite him being a large part of the conversation that night
P12:51:13 <PrinceOfFire59> I vote yes on ban.
P12:51:15 <Zuriki> Is that to me?
P12:51:17 <PuyoDead> if it were up to me, I'd have the same done to him
P12:51:21 <Peroggi> no zuriki its not
P12:51:25 <Zuriki> Okay.
P12:51:25 <PuyoDead> he's far worse than you

P12:51:32 <PuyoDead> ... amazingly
P12:51:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Voted yes
P12:51:43 <Zuriki> Not you Peroggi
P12:51:51 <Zuriki> Others in the community.
P12:52:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Peroggi: I tried to get Undeadsteak and Bob_the_Builder banned
P12:52:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Peroggi: You were also in IRC as AlLnAtuRaIX yesterday
P12:52:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> With an I not an l
P12:52:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> impersonating my nickname
P12:52:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> that alone is grounds for a ban
P12:52:36 <Peroggi> no I wasn't all
P12:52:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> the IPS matched
P12:52:50 <Peroggi> I don't beleive you, I deny that
P12:52:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bullshit.
P12:52:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Talk to C418
P12:53:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> he saw you doing it and banned you for it (and other things)
P12:53:11 <Peroggi> I was in the channel when you were being impersonating
13P12:53:15 * SteGriff sighs
P12:53:22 <PrinceOfFire59> is the vote done?
13P12:53:24 * gear|work agrees with SteGriff
P12:53:25 <Peroggi> I 100% deny impersonating anyone
P12:53:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> you can deny it all you'd like
P12:53:38 <Peroggi> but even if this were true its still A MATTER OF THE IRC not the forum
P12:53:43 <gear|work> so just to satisfy my curiosity, how old is everyone?

P12:54:01 <citricsquid> Peroggi: If you're banned from the COMMUNITY, that includes the forum and IRC.
P12:54:01 <PuyoDead> not to interject here, but Munther was doing a lot of spoofing yesterday
P12:54:28 <Peroggi> I wasn't aware I was being banned from the entire community
P12:54:40 <PuyoDead> IRC and the forums are tied. they're the same community. hell, they're linked on the game's site
P12:54:49 <LG_Legacy> Heh

P12:55:18 <citricsquid> and now we can resume our nice super minecraft fun.
P12:55:18 <LG_Legacy> The IRC Is a Java applet, linked to another server, as the channel is hosted on the 'other' server
P12:55:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> tyvm :D
P12:55:26 <PrinceOfFire59_> so far I count three votes for banning, none against.
P12:55:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> and he's gone
P12:55:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> so it's fine
P12:55:39 <LG_Legacy> Meh
P12:55:48 <LG_Legacy> I still believe IRC and Forums are two different things.
P12:55:50 <LG_Legacy> I'm just use to it
P12:55:58 <PuyoDead> I don't see that logic
P12:56:02 <LG_Legacy> *shrugs*
P12:56:12 <PrinceOfFire59_> its unanimous
P12:56:17 <PuyoDead> not insulting you, I just don't see it
P12:56:21 <LG_Legacy> I'm not going to argue or try to reason with anyone, but i'll just say that still. Different places, different views.
P12:56:28 <citricsquid> They are "different" but it's the same community. If he causes problems within the community, why should he be allowed to interact, regardless of the platform?
P12:56:28 <LG_Legacy> Thats just how i see it.
P12:56:43 <PuyoDead> we tried to agrue this same thing in another community I'm in. it failed miserably
P12:56:55 <gear|work> i feel
P12:56:58 <LG_Legacy> Because it should be a privelege to be in one area, and doing something in a specific area he should be removed from that specific area and not the others?
P12:57:04 <gear|work> like you guys have been arguing in circles
P12:57:10 <gear|work> for the past however long
P12:57:20 <LG_Legacy> It's like
P12:57:23 <PuyoDead> they ended up keeping them seperate (as in, issues with each were not mentioned to each other) but bans went to both
10P12:57:24 * PrinceOfFire59_ is now known as PrinceOfFire59
P12:57:27 <citricsquid> LG_Legacy: If he upsets the community, why should we just ban him from one place and let him annoy in another?
P12:57:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> +1 citricsquid
P12:57:37 <SteGriff> I suggest creating a thread on the forum where this trial can be carried out orderly-style and without all this mess and shouting
P12:57:39 <citricsquid> seems counter intuiticve.
P12:57:42 <citricsquid> failspell
P12:57:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm 99% sure LG_Legacy is trolling right now
P12:57:45 <PuyoDead> heh
P12:58:01 <LG_Legacy> If he does something stupid in the forums, sure ban him. But why the IRC? If he has done nothing in the IRC, then he shouldn't be banned. This is an example not following previous events.
13P12:58:08 * SteGriff suggests creating a thread on the forum where this trial can be carried out orderly-style and without all this mess and shouting!
P12:58:19 <LG_Legacy> Alas
P12:58:23 <LG_Legacy> As to your statement/question
P12:58:26 <PrinceOfFire59> I say listen to the vote. Everyone cast theirs and I'll count.
P12:58:28 <SteGriff> This is not condusive to coming to a decision
P12:58:32 <LG_Legacy> If he does something similar into the IRC? Sure his fault
P12:58:39 <SteGriff> Everyone needs all of the evidence
P12:58:43 <Zuriki> Poll?
P12:58:48 <SteGriff> Agree
P12:58:51 <LG_Legacy> It's the actions in the specific area that count right?
P12:58:58 <LG_Legacy> And not just to affect everywhere?
P12:59:13 <SteGriff> But each party must post the defence/accusations with evidence
P12:59:14 <PrinceOfFire59> Vote with Yes or no
P12:59:22 <PuyoDead> but... it's the same community. I mean, why should you be kicked out of only one room in the house for shitting on the floor?
P12:59:24 <SteGriff> We'll do this on the forum, prince
P12:59:30 <PrinceOfFire59> Alright
P12:59:34 <SteGriff> thanks
P12:59:49 <LG_Legacy> Odd example
P1:00:01 <citricsquid> LG_Legacy: But he did try and plan griefing in here and then messed about in the forum, why would we say "well, you can't go in the forum but we'll let you in here to annoy everyone else!"?
P1:00:02 <LG_Legacy> But why should you be restricted to everything, if you done nothing in the others?
P1:00:13 <LG_Legacy> As i have said Citric
P1:00:14 <PrinceOfFire59> I like puyo's example XD
P1:00:16 <LG_Legacy> This is an example
P1:00:20 <LG_Legacy> Not following previous events
P1:00:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I like Puyo's also
P1:00:24 <Zuriki> Why are we still arguing?
P1:00:29 <Zuriki> Decision is final.
P1:00:30 <LG_Legacy> On the topic of IRC and Forums are not Connected, fully anyways.
P1:00:31 <citricsquid> Zuriki: it's the internet¬
P1:00:35 <Zuriki> Deal with it or gtfo
P1:00:42 <PuyoDead> we're not even talking about peroggi anymore, specifically
P1:00:42 <LG_Legacy> Nothing with the ban anymore zuriki
P1:00:45 <Zuriki> SRS BSNS
P1:00:47 <citricsquid> forums != IRC. forum community == IRC community.
P1:01:19 <PuyoDead> it's like two windows to the same room
P1:01:29 <LG_Legacy> They may be the same community, but still would you ban someone on the IRC if you banned em in the forums is my main question?
P1:01:37 <PuyoDead> (maybe I need to calm down on he house references)
P1:01:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> LG_Legacy: depends what the forum ban was for
P1:01:47 <PuyoDead> yes, yes I would
P1:01:52 <PrinceOfFire59> yes
P1:01:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> If they were, say, distributing hacks, then yes
P1:02:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> If they were just saying BUY VIAGRA LOL
P1:02:03 <gear|work> cant we just like
P1:02:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> but they were okay in the IRC, I guess that's fine
P1:02:10 <gear|work> give him a 3 day or something
P1:02:12 <SteGriff> This is how you ban someone in style: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=5716.0
P1:02:12 <LG_Legacy> Typical spambot, of course.
P1:02:25 <PuyoDead> hey guys! I love tacos!
P1:02:28 <LG_Legacy> I'm just trying to say
P1:02:34 <PuyoDead> ... just wanted to throw that out there
P1:02:47 <gear|work> wow puyo, we have a lot in common
P1:02:52 <gear|work> want to go on a bro date?
P1:02:55 <LG_Legacy> One place, he does something, one place he hasn't done something. Why ban him in the place he hasn't done something? Thats like banning someone you hate fro meverywhere you mod/op, ye know?
P1:03:02 <PuyoDead> ehh, my fiancee wouldn't like that
P1:03:08 <gear|work> lmao
P1:03:16 <LG_Legacy> But meh, i'm just going to drop it >_>
P1:03:25 <LG_Legacy> I can't control what the ops/mods do, their decision.
P1:03:29 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: you have a fiance? Fuck. I thought I was almost there!
P1:03:36 <PuyoDead> haha
P1:03:43 <PuyoDead> we'll just add another to the party
P1:04:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Anyone else here played Killing Floor?
P1:04:16 <PuyoDead> never heard of it
P1:04:21 <citricsquid> what is it? :D
P1:04:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, it's an old UT2004 mod, I think, that's a coop zombie shooter.
P1:04:57 <LG_Legacy> ._.
P1:04:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Recently it came out as a standalone game on Steam.
P1:05:00 <LG_Legacy> Oh shit
P1:05:05 <LG_Legacy> My water is turning orange/yellow
P1:05:14 <gear|work> wat
P1:05:20 <PuyoDead> how'd you do that?
P1:05:47 <LG_Legacy> I'm not sure
P1:05:52 <LG_Legacy> It's just..
P1:05:52 <LG_Legacy> I gotta take a pic hold on
P1:06:13 <PuyoDead> heh

P1:06:41 <Darkebrz> Yay for self advertising!
P1:06:47 <vdgmprgrmr> It's basically L4D, except it's easier to run (weaker visuals), it doesn't force 4 player teams (you can play single-player or with 5 other friends), and it's more arcadey (instead of having an objective, you just have to fight off waves of "specimens" (standard totally-wacky arcade game monsters) until the big boss comes).

P1:07:26 <gear|work> and
P1:07:28 <vdgmprgrmr> <vdgmprgrmr>Anyone else here played Killing Floor?
P1:07:29 <gear|work> all the other games
P1:07:32 <gear|work> that ive been denied
P1:07:52 <vdgmprgrmr> It's cheap too. Just 15 dollars, I think.
P1:07:55 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: Would it work over lan? :D
P1:08:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, pretty sure it works with LAN.
P1:08:16 <vdgmprgrmr> There's a LAN tab on the multiplayer menu.
P1:08:16 <citricsquid> might get it, lan party on friday D::D
P1:08:52 <vdgmprgrmr> A friend got it for me a few days ago, and it's pretty awesome.
P1:09:18 <PuyoDead> my PC is about 5 years old, so I could probably go with that
P1:09:22 <PuyoDead> minus that whole money thing
P1:09:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Totally mindless, and you could totally imagine it being in an arcade kiosk thingy.
P1:09:33 <LG_Legacy> As proof of yellow liquid spewing out of my sink, i had to turn off the faucet for this: http://i30.tinypic.com/2a8mixt.jpg

P1:09:47 <PrinceOfFire59> JSUS
P1:09:53 <PuyoDead> do you live near a watertower?
P1:09:57 <LG_Legacy> No
P1:10:00 <PuyoDead> odd
P1:10:19 <PuyoDead> usually heavy activity near one will cause the bottom of it to get stirred up and do that
P1:10:28 <vdgmprgrmr> That's pretty nasty, but I think the occasional sink-spewing-brown-chunky-materials beats it.
P1:10:31 <PuyoDead> I used to get brown water
P1:10:37 <LG_Legacy> Heh
P1:11:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Srsly looked like sink diarrhea.
P1:11:27 <SteGriff> Time to play minecraft.
P1:11:39 <LG_Legacy> I think the sinks anal rectum is expanded x2

P1:30:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, UnknownX, thanks for giving me an idea of the size of your town.
P1:30:54 <vdgmprgrmr> That narrows it down quite a bit.
P1:31:47 <UnknownX> Only if you know where to look
P1:32:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Or I could just look everywhere and find you in a decade or so.
P1:32:09 <gear|work> yea dont underestimate how huge texas is
P1:32:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Assuming you don't move.
P1:32:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Texas ain't that big.
P1:33:04 <UnknownX> its the second biggest state
P1:33:05 <PuyoDead> back to Research and Development
P1:33:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Relatively low population density, at least.
P1:33:37 <gear|work> so what do you do for fun
P1:33:39 <gear|work> unknown
P1:34:02 <UnknownX> so your trying to get my day out of me?
P1:34:13 <LG_Legacy> So tell me Unknown, how is houston?
P1:34:23 <UnknownX> I dont know
P1:34:33 <UnknownX> i haven't been there in about 4 years
P1:34:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't wanna spend decades searching for you, so just tell us how your day was.
P1:34:46 <LG_Legacy> Wrong again :P
P1:35:47 <UnknownX> then come try and find me in houston
P1:36:01 <vdgmprgrmr> You said "come".
P1:36:07 <vdgmprgrmr> So you are in/near Houston?
P1:36:21 <UnknownX> 4 hours away sound good?
P1:36:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Sounds like a very good place to start.

P4:23:48 <G14> Okay, so my MC server crashed, and I realized it was my internet, so I stared at my wireless adapter, only to realize the cable got frayed, so i tossed the extender, replaced it with a different adapter, got back online, and my server won't go online now

P4:24:27 <vdgmprgrmr> If it had better AI, and faster, more functional gameplay (I can walk around quickly and easily without tripping on things that really should just be scenery), I would probably like it a lot.

13P6:57:06 * Dave___ is bored
P6:57:08 <Drakkar> iirc
P6:57:09 <Leyart> 10 euros are nothing
13P6:57:13 * Dave___ is very very bored
P6:57:16 <Drakkar> he'll be adding some sort of server side scripting
P6:57:20 <Leyart> that's why I have already bought it
P6:57:20 <Eagle> 11650 euros are a lot
P6:57:27 <Drakkar> so you could always create your own style of games
P6:57:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> 20 euros are a lot too
P6:57:34 <ChJees> In short term
P6:57:36 <ChJees> Not long term :p
P6:57:37 <Eagle> 25 euros are also a lot.
P6:57:40 <Leyart> 20 euros are far too much
P6:57:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you think 20 euros isn't a lot, you should give me some
P6:57:48 <Leyart> for this game
P6:57:56 <Leyart> but 10 are just good enough
P6:57:57 <Dave___> minecraft is going to be flooded with custom servers before he releases lua support
P6:58:00 <Dave___> its obvious
P6:58:11 <Dave___> *looks at jte*
P6:58:24 <Thexa4> of course, this game is perfect for custom servers
P6:58:27 <Eagle> When he raises it to 25 the purchases will come to a stop.
P6:58:29 <Thexa4> he even said he liked the idea in his blog
P6:58:32 <Eagle> Then he'll lower it again
P6:58:49 <Eagle> PROPHET EAGLE.
P6:58:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> obviously notch needs to make constant updates more
P6:58:58 <Leyart> frequent
P6:59:05 <Dave___> what he really should do, is only let paid accounts connect to ipaddresses
P6:59:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> frequntttt
P6:59:28 <Dave___> its the client that no one feels like remaking
P6:59:34 <Eagle> I remember before he made us pay for it, he updated the game very VERY frequently.
P6:59:50 <Eagle> It's like when he finally started making money off of it, he stopped developing. :O
P6:59:57 <Dave___> lol
P7:00:01 <Leyart> the fact is
P7:00:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> this just proves that as sales in crease, the frequency of updates decrease
P7:00:05 <SkindianaBones> Maybe a big update is on its way...
P7:00:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> ha
P7:00:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> ha
P7:00:19 <Leyart> I haven't seen any good update since I have bought the game
P7:00:22 <Leyart> that is a shame
P7:00:42 <Eagle> Guys, the fact is
P7:00:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> i was here for the blocks update
P7:00:45 <Dave___> for the $18000 hes earned he should have lua already done
P7:00:49 <Eagle> We are all Notch's bitch
P7:00:58 <Eagle> He made the game and we can't do anything about it.
P7:00:59 <Eagle> :O
P7:00:59 <Dave___> yeah, that pretty much sums it up
P7:01:32 <Dave___> "no no no, notch, PLEASE NOT THE PADDLE, OW"
P7:01:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah i'll have to agree
P7:01:47 <Dave___> "STOP! OK OK I'LL BUY ANOTHER ACCOUNT"

P7:09:34 <Eagle> Somebody needs to make a horror game where you have unlimited flashlight batteries, but the flashlight fails occasionally.

P7:12:17 <Eagle> But what that really means is "We know that you lied."
P7:13:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> but that would mean i never intended to use it anyways

P7:46:18 <bobthe_builder> is there a way to run a server without opening a port

P7:57:54 <potato> neither do i, really
P7:57:58 <Afayir> Could someone do me a favour and try connecting to http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=d4a6a29c123ff6ba6f81c5afe707d0d4

P7:58:17 <potato> we don't need a bureaucracy to make sure the ops aren't dicks
P7:58:25 <vdgmprgrmr> It seems pretty much useless other than for people to brag about being on the MAA or having a server on the MAA.
P7:58:25 <Bob_The_Builder> same
P7:58:40 <potato> they have good intentions i'm sure
P7:58:41 <vdgmprgrmr> It's like an artificial elite class or something.
P7:58:43 <Thexa4> Afayir: doesn't work
P7:58:48 <Afayir> Damn. Why?
P7:58:52 <Afayir> Any message?
P7:58:57 <potato> Won't connect
P7:59:01 <Afayir> Hmm...
P7:59:12 <potato> make sure your port is forwarded correctly\
P7:59:29 <vdgmprgrmr> And it seems pretty easy for a person to be unrightfully banned, and if everything's all nice and automated, you may as well consider yourself banned on every MAA server ever.
P7:59:32 <Real> yeah Afayir it won't connect. failed to connect.
P7:59:43 <Bob_The_Builder> agreed with potato
P7:59:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless you do some kind of formal appeal process, which I doubt most people even know or care about anyway.

P8:00:39 <Real> From what I understand, it takes lots of verification to be officially added to the MAA ban list.
P8:00:40 <potato> good idea
P8:00:41 <Darkebrz> Akai, is possible with JTEs server
P8:01:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> maamaa

P8:02:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Because the whole thing seems stupid and unnecessary.
P8:03:01 <potato> we don't need a bureaucracy to make sure the ops aren't dicks
P8:03:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Potato said it nicely.
13P8:03:11 * mail2345 thinks MAA needs a voting system.
P8:03:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> the maa is not a democracyyyy
P8:03:26 <Real> voting for what?
P8:03:27 <potato> we don't need a democracy to make sure the ops aren't dicks
P8:03:34 <kryptn> MAA is one letter away from MPAA
P8:03:44 <vdgmprgrmr> I said above, the thing seems like an artifical "elite class".
P8:03:51 <Bob_The_Builder> HAHA! kryp
P8:04:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> i can understand if you wanna make a MSC... but
P8:04:05 <potato> we don't need an aristocracy to make sure the ops aren't dicks
P8:04:09 <vdgmprgrmr> So people can be like "I'm on the MAA mwahaha"

P8:04:44 <Real> MSC?
P8:05:09 <kryptn> I'd be that rogue op, like a teacher that eats in his room rather than the lounge
P8:05:10 <Bob_The_Builder> who is triddin?
P8:05:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> imaginary acronyms that don't actually stand for anything
P8:05:15 <Bob_The_Builder> like 2 people?
P8:05:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> aka minecraft safety committee
P8:05:30 <Bob_The_Builder> that means only 2 people can be trusted right ?
P8:05:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> we teach anti-grief tactics and general safeness of things!
P8:05:43 <kryptn> lol AnnihilatorBeta you will go through all servers and count blocks
P8:05:50 <kryptn> making sure you can't fall too far
P8:06:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> you know
P8:06:15 <potato> there is nothing anyone can do to totally prevent griefing
P8:06:16 <kryptn> If you did taht you would hate one of my servers :D
P8:06:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> i placed opcrete blocks all around the flatgrass map
P8:06:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> to prevent sealevel water from flooding the map
P8:06:45 <potato> if you have lots of ops you can do pretty well
P8:06:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> but that didn't work out, because there was a mole
P8:06:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> potato
P8:06:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> one of our ops is a spy
P8:07:04 <Real> That sucks.
P8:07:04 <Bob_The_Builder> lol
P8:07:13 <Bob_The_Builder> and your part of the MAA
P8:07:13 <potato> i routed some water to my thing but i sealed it off
P8:07:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> which explains why the map was flooded from removed opcrete barriers
P8:07:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> i know it wasn't you potato
P8:07:43 <Real> This whole rogue OP thing is pretty stupid. Griefing is, too, but we know that. I can't believe how sneaky people are just to delete some blocks on an internet game.
P8:07:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> i mean, that guy even screwed up the spawning building
P8:07:59 <Bob_The_Builder> L2ReadLogs
P8:08:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> and things happened, i dunno, it's just rumors, but it's better to be aware than ignorant... right
P8:08:25 <potato> i heard a good saying
P8:08:39 <potato> never attribute to malice what can just as well be explained by stupidity
P8:08:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> right and that's why we're here

P8:14:10 <potato> what if there is a rogue op on a MAA server
P8:14:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> sucks to be the maa then

P9:44:38 <Eagle> And then I broke him again.

P9:46:08 <Darkebrz> I broke it
P9:46:25 <AlexVMiner> Probably not Not really = Someone who kept clicking "probably not" just to see what would happen
P9:46:26 <Dave___> someone should "break" lava on a custom server and make a giant sun :D
P9:46:27 <Darkebrz> Everything dissappeared
P9:46:35 <gear1> make a volcano
P9:46:42 <Dave___> oooo that would be sick

P9:46:46 <Eagle> XD Click probaby partially a bunch of times
P9:46:50 <Dave___> but it could flood the map...
P9:46:54 <Eagle> And it guesses "Probably Partially"
P9:46:57 <gear1> with large lava pools
