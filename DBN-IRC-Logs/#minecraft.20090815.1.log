A4:41:43 <War> lol
A4:41:44 <venn177> Don't you know? Notch works for the world government of antipiracy (WGAP) and anyone who owns a PC and doesn't buy Minecraft will be killed.
A4:41:56 <War> :x
A4:42:02 <War> I just wanted a skin
A4:42:14 <venn177> You got so much more, though.
A4:42:21 <War> a whole life
A4:42:25 <venn177> And how awesome is it that your life is only worth $15?
A4:43:04 <War> Pretty sad actually
A4:43:22 <liq3> lol... This channel has the best chat ever.
A4:44:00 <venn177> War: If your life were worth more, you'd probably be dead about now.
A4:44:04 <venn177> Did you just not consider that?
A4:44:15 <War> Yea, I only had $15 usd in my paypal
A4:44:33 <venn177> See? Your life being worth less than I can find on the ground saved you.
A4:45:06 <War> woot
A4:45:22 <venn177> So who else here thinks Harley Quinn is hot?
A4:45:25 <Siiseli> I've 0 used in my paypal
A4:46:22 <venn177> I have 0 USD, and .01 EU
A4:46:40 <venn177> just so I have a balance so paypal doesn't rape me for conversion charges next time someone from the UK sends me money
A4:47:35 <r4dio> i want weapons in minecraft now :(
A4:47:41 <venn177> I want survival mode
A4:47:47 <venn177> the last few videos Notch posted were amazing
A4:47:59 <venn177> multiplayer survival mode will be badaaaaaass
A4:48:21 <citricsquid> is ipope here?
A4:48:23 <citricsquid> no? Good.
A4:48:27 <citricsquid> he's a twat.
A4:48:30 <venn177> Haha
A4:48:39 <venn177> He's on my server a lot. He's more of an idiot who doesn't know he's a twat.
A4:49:12 <venn177> Facepunch members outside of facepunch mostly fall under that category because they don't know what it's like to interact with internet goers not from facepunch.
A4:49:27 <offset> He got embarrassed when Citric found his silly posts :p
A4:49:57 <venn177> Heh

A4:52:28 <venn177> QUICK
A4:52:32 <venn177> EVERYONE SUBSCRIBE TO NOTCH
A4:52:39 <venn177> and spam his links so he gets millions of views
A4:52:44 <venn177> and he thinks he's popular
A4:53:05 <Siiseli> there's only one problem
A4:53:13 <Siiseli> he already is popular
A4:53:36 <venn177> :<
A4:53:41 <venn177> shit, I need to think my plans through.
A4:53:48 <venn177> Can someone find me Devil May Cry furry porn?
A4:53:53 <venn177> None of the usual sites I go to have it.
A4:54:20 <War> so when updates happen, we can still pick to play the way it is now, and build shit without having to resource gather, right?
A4:54:26 <venn177> yeah
A4:54:35 <venn177> What we do now is called "sandbox" mode
A4:54:45 <venn177> he's also adding "survival" and most likely "zombie survival"
A4:55:04 <War> awesome
A4:55:56 <r4dio> and then
A4:56:01 <r4dio> seagull survival
A4:56:34 <venn177> then
A4:56:37 <venn177> runescape survival
A4:56:37 <Siiseli> venn177, why the fuck would you want that
A4:56:54 <r4dio> seagull survival is better than zombie survival
A4:57:10 <venn177> Siiseli: To prove that I can survive.
A4:58:38 <venn177> So, how 'bout we throw a party?
A4:58:56 <War> oh wow, so minecraft multiplayer only got going a few months ago

A4:59:38 <venn177> Although, when something gets lavaflooded, I love the nostalgia it brings
A4:59:49 <venn177> I remember when there were 4 blocks
A4:59:57 <venn177> and the flower...plant...thing was an easter egg.
A5:00:03 <War> lol
A5:00:14 <venn177> \nostalgia
A5:00:24 <War> I made lava flood a whole level once
A5:00:44 <War> It was like dante's peak
A5:02:27 <War> <3 indie games
A5:07:12 <liq3> man
A5:07:24 <liq3> it's gonna be so awesome building these castles out of stone or ore that take ages to break into <3
A5:07:40 <venn177> Notch should make admin block breakable
A5:07:43 <venn177> but it takes 5 hours
A5:07:48 <liq3> lol...
A5:07:48 <venn177> of holding down click, without moving
A5:07:58 <venn177> if someone has that kind of patience, they deserve it.
A5:08:08 <liq3> i can see stuff like
A5:08:10 <liq3> having 3 layers of stone
A5:08:12 <liq3> as the floor.
A5:08:18 <liq3> because it'd take so fucking long to break through. xD
A5:09:25 <liq3> man.
A5:09:34 <liq3> i could see ore being useful just as a walling device, because it's so hard to break atm.
A5:10:47 <venn177> once we have weapons
A5:10:50 <venn177> real medieval wars
A5:10:53 <venn177> we already have the body armor, etc
A5:11:08 <liq3> yey.p
A5:11:09 <liq3> yep*
A5:11:15 <liq3> i'm gonna love ctf.
A5:11:24 <liq3> although, now that i know how hard ore is to break.
A5:11:32 <liq3> i'm going to have to revise my lava traps a bit. >.>
A5:11:52 <venn177> cannot wait 'til pressure plates

A5:12:11 <liq3> having blocks break when someone stands on a pressure plate. <3
A5:12:21 <liq3> having lava under the sand.
A5:12:23 <venn177> I'd also like heavier blocks that have gravity
A5:12:32 <venn177> like, a boulder
A5:12:41 <liq3> that crushes people?
A5:12:48 <venn177> that crushes people.
A5:13:15 <liq3> i hope we can drown.
A5:13:21 <liq3> it'd be nicee. <3
A5:13:29 <venn177> I hope lava and water will be finite
A5:13:34 <liq3> oh they will.
A5:13:36 <liq3> eventually...
A5:13:41 <venn177> until then I can't make lava traps

A5:14:24 <venn177> above that, have lava
A5:14:32 <liq3> uh
A5:14:34 <liq3> there's another way.
A5:14:47 <liq3> make like a hallway.
A5:14:51 <liq3> 1x2 
A5:15:02 <liq3> have lava completely surrounding it (yes, lots of digging).
A5:15:10 <liq3> then as your running thru.
A5:15:20 <liq3> make the room uh...leaves (assuming they don't burn).
A5:15:23 <liq3> or the easiest to delete.
A5:15:26 <liq3> then you delete them as you run past.
A5:15:33 <liq3> hall fills with lava, enemies can't chase you. :P
A5:15:36 <venn177> the point is
A5:15:41 <venn177> I'm talking about something that can be made now
A5:15:44 <venn177> that I don't have to trigger myself
A5:15:53 <liq3> doesn't exist.
