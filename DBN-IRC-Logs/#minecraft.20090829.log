A12:25:14 <PixelSith64> Hi Darkebrz
A12:25:18 <GhostOfTheOne> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=theone
A12:25:18 <Darkebrz> Hello
A12:25:21 <geekahedron> nice
A12:25:31 <geekahedron> but did you mean to only do one side of each arm?
A12:25:35 <PixelSith64> Hey Dark.. Whatever happened to Theme of the Week?
A12:26:02 <mail2345> shutdown, after the massive failure of the space map
A12:26:10 <PixelSith64> ah
A12:26:15 <PixelSith64> I never did get to see the results of that
A12:26:40 <geekahedron> @PixelSith64 that is
A12:26:52 <Darkebrz> I just got bored of hosting a server
A12:26:53 <PixelSith64> Hm? What do you mean?
A12:26:57 <Darkebrz> To much griefing
A12:27:15 <PixelSith64> Oh, you mean the arm
A12:27:16 <geekahedron> only the top of one arm and the bottom of the other arm have anything on them
A12:27:22 <PixelSith64> Yeah, I know
A12:27:23 <mail2345> on a related note
A12:27:29 <mail2345> i have a free server slot
A12:27:33 <PixelSith64> I'm working on that problem
A12:27:36 <PixelSith64> the problem is
A12:27:41 <PixelSith64> There are four arm faces per arm
A12:27:42 <PixelSith64> so 8
A12:27:46 <PixelSith64> But there are only four arm textures
A12:28:09 <geekahedron> eg, both arms are the same
A12:28:26 <geekahedron> and it's not inside/outside but left/right
A12:28:36 <geekahedron> right now anyway
A12:29:30 <Darkebrz> mail2345: Mine? :D

A12:53:29 <Visiiri> Hey!
A12:53:45 <Visiiri> :< I haven't talked to you in a long time. What was up?
A12:53:52 <Zuriki> In Australia

A12:54:19 <Zuriki> No.
A12:54:23 <Visiiri> :<
A12:54:36 <Zuriki> Why?
A12:54:38 <Visiiri> It's a nice place. Unfortunately, I lived there for just two weeks.
A12:54:49 <Visiiri> I'd visit grandparents.
A12:55:01 <Zuriki> I was visiting my Mum.
A12:55:02 <Visiiri> But I liked it there.
A12:55:13 <Visiiri> That's nice. Where abouts was it?
A12:55:37 <Zuriki> NSW, Forrester's Beach... I think.
A12:55:47 <liq3> anyone who wants to play wolfhunt join #betahunt

A12:56:21 <Visiiri> Wonderful place.
A12:56:33 <Zuriki> Sort of. Looks like China Town though.
A12:56:40 <Visiiri> lol
A12:56:42 <Zuriki> In that, everyone is Asian.
A12:56:56 <Visiiri> I know. I'm not a fan of large portside cities.
A12:57:03 <Visiiri> Like seattle.
A12:57:09 <Visiiri> I went there.
A12:57:23 <Visiiri> Homeless people were the most exciting thing, aside from parasailing.
A12:57:42 <Visiiri> I think I donated $57 to a war vet.

A1:02:56 <Visiiri> Hmmm...
A1:02:57 <Zuriki> Heh. When I think of cities, I think of their starting settlments of wooden houses. Then the guy with the first stone house showing off to everyone. Then they all get them and he's sad. Then the guy with the first brick house showing off to the rest of them and then they all get them and he's sad.

A2:32:11 <LG_Legacy> Tech: You can play Gmod 9 for free, but some mods aren't avail to gmod 9
A2:32:19 <gordenfreechmen> Gmod 9 seems lame
A2:32:31 <gordenfreechmen> anyways, LG_Legacy
A2:32:33 <LG_Legacy> Welcome Legacy to Steam.
A2:32:34 <LG_Legacy> Yay
A2:32:50 <gordenfreechmen> is there any way to control thrusters without using keypads
A2:32:57 <LG_Legacy> I am not sure..
A2:33:06 <LG_Legacy> I don't play with thrusters
A2:33:18 <offset> gorden, what do you want to control them with?
A2:33:31 <LG_Legacy> Alas i better go and snatch me the kermite smg pack
A2:33:34 <Visiiri> how much it cost?
A2:33:39 <LG_Legacy> I see a p90 with my name on it
A2:33:40 <LG_Legacy> Gmod?
A2:33:43 <LG_Legacy> 10 bucks
A2:33:49 <LG_Legacy> Great deal
A2:33:53 <LG_Legacy> Hours and HOURS of fun
A2:33:56 <LG_Legacy> Countless mods
A2:33:59 <LG_Legacy> :D
A2:34:01 <Visiiri> can't do it
A2:34:05 <Visiiri> unless you convince me
A2:34:08 <Visiiri> ...
A2:34:10 <Visiiri> GTA?
A2:34:13 <LG_Legacy> Wut?
A2:34:19 <offset> If you've never played a previous gmod version you're going to enjoy it for ages
A2:34:22 <LG_Legacy> Import Gta Models/Weapons if someone uploaded em
A2:34:23 <LG_Legacy> For example
A2:34:33 <Visiiri> woah.
A2:34:37 <LG_Legacy> http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=66785 Thats an example
A2:34:39 <Visiiri> Is it just for halflife 2?
A2:34:43 <gordenfreechmen> Visiiri: no
A2:34:46 <gordenfreechmen> its for any source engine game
A2:34:52 <gordenfreechmen> C-S:S, TF2, etc.
A2:35:01 <LG_Legacy> Yep, if you got a uh.. Source game, you can snag gmod for 10$
A2:35:13 <Visiiri> What does "source game" mean?
A2:35:14 <LG_Legacy> If you got a nvidia or ati, you can snag HL2: DM for free
A2:35:33 <Visiiri> Wewt
A2:35:41 <Visiiri> I have ati readeon or sumthin like taht
A2:35:46 <gordenfreechmen> I dont think that version of HL2:DM comes with the SDK

A3:44:40 <Griskard> 1024x512 for the hunting map. Only 64 high because the main idea is to kill stuff
A3:44:52 <Griskard> Now what next...
A3:47:55 <Colain> Griskard, I wanna see these RP Maps
A3:48:16 <Colain> I like RPing, I need to drink to get rid of my RP Third.

A3:48:54 <Griskard> Well its going to be for when Lua is out, and I can mod it to be RP
A3:49:39 <Griskard> RP in a more non traditional sense, Im gonna try and leave regulation up to players a bit. Clans will be given a fair bit of power outside of the "safe" areas
A3:50:10 <Griskard> Got MSN or Skype? I can send you the map files
A3:50:57 <Colain> I mean go on the,
A3:51:02 <Colain> *there

A3:51:36 <Griskard> Can you host? I can show you round what Ive got
A3:51:52 <Griskard> I find the hunting map to be the most interesting at the moment. Although Ive done jack all
A3:52:03 <Colain> Nah, I can't host.

A8:43:35 <doohan> For ludum dare
A8:43:42 <doohan> Game in 48 hours

A8:44:17 <AlexVMiner> he wouldn't stop
A8:44:28 <PD-lt> nobody told him to
A8:44:29 <AlexVMiner> spamming blocks is part of griefing

A8:46:29 <AlexVMiner> then why did you ask why he was banned?

A10:01:28 <TheKilledDeath> yes, it was my server, so I banned them
A10:01:35 <TheKilledDeath> but they don't get banned from the game?
A10:01:36 <TheKilledDeath> okay :)
A10:01:44 <citricsquid> nope, nobody will lose their account :)
A10:01:44 <AlexVMiner> hackers?
A10:01:48 <AlexVMiner> did they grief?
A10:02:07 <TheKilledDeath> they had speedhacks and were able to fly
A10:02:22 <AlexVMiner> so?
A10:02:28 <AlexVMiner> did they destroy things?
A10:02:31 <TheKilledDeath> no
A10:02:42 <Xychosis> Hey atleast they didn't ask for hacks right after logging onto the server
A10:02:54 <TheKilledDeath> :)
A10:02:54 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:03:19 <PuyoDead> the hacks are so widespread now, that it's almost impossible to find a server without people using them
A10:03:29 <TheKilledDeath> yes, mine is now clear of hackers
A10:03:34 <liq3> PuyoDead: I think itís more a problem arenít banning people for using them.
A10:03:35 <TheKilledDeath> but it's not public :)
A10:03:50 <liq3> If I was running a server Iíd warn, kick, then ban people for using hacks, whether they grief or not.
A10:04:14 <TheKilledDeath> I did so too
A10:04:34 <liq3> I wouldnít ban right away, because quite a few legit players are using speed and flying hacks.
A10:04:40 <liq3> to make things easier.
A10:05:11 <AlexVMiner> i use hacks
A10:05:24 <AlexVMiner> now i pretty use them to view levels from above
A10:05:30 <Xychosis> I personally can't wait for multiplayer survival. That's almost a 100% guarantee of weeding out the majority of people using hacks
A10:05:33 <liq3> although, honestly.
A10:05:36 <AlexVMiner> and just to have a separate window for the game
A10:05:41 <liq3> I donít see any reason to NOT use them in sandbox mode.
A10:06:36 <liq3> Really, should have ìflyingî and ìspeedî as server options. :/
A10:06:47 <TheKilledDeath> I think it's shit of my friends to abuse the server I PAY to hack
A10:06:57 <liq3> what?
10A10:07:21 * fleshBasedProcessor (chatzilla@207.160.210.187) has joined #minecraft
A10:08:11 <AlexVMiner> that makes no sense
A10:08:14 <AlexVMiner> they are just flying
A10:08:22 <AlexVMiner> not hacking it and killing it
A10:08:31 <citricsquid> I dislike the entire hacking thing
A10:08:36 <citricsquid> why can't they play as intended?
A10:08:43 <citricsquid> oh no, too much effort to walk somewhere, we'll fly!
A10:08:47 <liq3> citricsquid: because itís sandbox mode...
A10:08:53 <liq3> sandbox mode is the worst one imo, since it has no rules.
A10:08:55 <AlexVMiner> yeah
A10:09:06 <AlexVMiner> it doesn't take the fun out of building
A10:09:07 <liq3> in stuff like survival, iíd 100% against any sort of unfair advantage.
A10:09:13 <AlexVMiner> yeah
A10:09:29 <liq3> Though, I should probably mention I find Sandbox as boring as fuck anyway.
A10:09:30 <AlexVMiner> i could spend 3 hours building a house in the sky
A10:09:35 <AlexVMiner> or use hacks to spend 1 hour
A10:09:37 <citricsquid> AlexVMiner: I'm impressed by buildings in sandbox because of the effort and skill taken, if you can just fly to a position and put a block down where's the achievement? 
A10:09:40 <liq3> And iíve played it maybe 30 minutes in the past 3 weeks. :P
A10:10:15 <liq3> citric: there is no real skill to building something (unles sitís artistic, which most arentí), just time investement.
A10:10:51 <AlexVMiner> yeah, i agree
A10:11:01 <AlexVMiner> you see a sprite
A10:11:06 <liq3> and they just copy it.
A10:11:07 <AlexVMiner> "Wow, that is amazing"
A10:11:15 <AlexVMiner> then someone says
A10:11:16 <liq3> Most other things are juts basic shapes, in very basic patterns.
A10:11:19 <AlexVMiner> "They used hacks"
A10:11:27 <AlexVMiner> "BLEGH!  THAT IS STUPID!"

A10:11:58 <AlexVMiner> sprite art takes skill
A10:12:03 <liq3> No it doesnít.
A10:12:14 <AlexVMiner> you have to memorize the position of the blocks
A10:12:18 <liq3> Youíre just copying pixel for pixel.
A10:12:20 <AlexVMiner> and so on
A10:12:25 <liq3> Uh, no you donít, itís all relative.
A10:12:26 <AlexVMiner> that takes skill
A10:12:32 <citricsquid> "wow, he completed that marathon" "he went in a car!" AlexVMiner: "SO, IT'S STILL AWESOME THAT HE COMPLETED IT. METHOD DOESN'T MATTER!!"

A10:12:50 <AlexVMiner> citric, that is different
A10:12:53 <PuyoDead> it takes longer to build some pixel art correctly than it does some structures

12A10:12:57 * aab (a1ur@tsentraal.ee) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A10:13:11 <AlexVMiner> you have to use legs
A10:13:14 <PuyoDead> I can build a basic spleef arena in less time than it does to make, say, Samus
A10:13:19 <AlexVMiner> in minecraft, it doesn't matter
A10:13:50 <AlexVMiner> house, sprite art, or a huge castle that is the whole map, it all takes skill
A10:14:01 <PuyoDead> but using a flying hack to build it = failure
A10:14:01 <liq3> Uh, no it doesnít. Just takes time.
A10:14:08 <citricsquid> yes, but less skill if you're just flying there and putting blocks down.
A10:14:20 <AlexVMiner> compared to?
A10:14:21 <liq3> there is no skill.. gah.
A10:14:26 <AlexVMiner> walking and putting blocks down?
A10:14:26 <Xychosis> It's not hard to build a sprite
A10:14:38 <Xychosis> It just takes more time than building something else
A10:14:44 <AlexVMiner> just because it isn't "hard" doesn't mean it takes no skill
A10:14:47 <citricsquid> liq3: "Skill: an ability that has been acquired by training "
A10:15:01 <Xychosis> I'm not impressed by people who can build a sprite in Minecraft because it doesn't involve any creativity at all
A10:15:13 <PuyoDead> when I made Pi across a whole map, that took skill. and all it was, was a bunch of numbers
A10:15:19 <liq3> citricsquid: replace ìnoî with ìlittleî. I like to exaggerate that. :P
A10:15:21 <AlexVMiner> Skill: to do something well
A10:15:34 <Xychosis> PuyoDead: Still that's a little more creative than building a Pokemon sprite
A10:15:41 <Xychosis> or Samus
A10:15:41 <AlexVMiner> you can do sprite are well
A10:15:47 <AlexVMiner> *art
A10:16:05 <Xychosis> Building a sprite in Minecraft isn't sprite art
A10:16:17 <Snowman> building sprites in mc is boring
A10:16:19 <citricsquid> uh, yes it is
A10:16:27 <AlexVMiner> yes it is
A10:16:28 <liq3> You know what took skill? When I recreated Domo-kun. The image I was copying from was far too large to copy pixel for pixel.
A10:16:30 <Snowman> I've seen all sprites like 25 times at least
A10:16:30 <citricsquid> it's composing blocks - pixels - in a certain way to create an image
A10:16:33 <AlexVMiner> one block is one pixel
A10:16:33 <PuyoDead> http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3646/3640125562_ce445ca74c_o.jpg
A10:16:37 <PuyoDead> took 3 damn days
A10:16:47 <Snowman> Yeah the PI was awesome
A10:16:48 <AlexVMiner> liq
A10:16:51 <liq3> The ones that take almost no skill, they copy pixel for pixel, like a computer does.
A10:16:53 <Xychosis> Yeah, but you're not working with pixels in Minecraft
A10:16:56 <AlexVMiner> you just contradicted yourself
A10:16:59 <Xychosis> I make pixel art
A10:17:02 <Xychosis> I should know
A10:17:12 <AlexVMiner> a block is a pixel
A10:17:14 <AlexVMiner> pretty much
A10:17:23 <AlexVMiner> i make sprite art too
A10:17:23 <liq3> AlexVMiner: No, I used a reference image. What I did is what an normal artist does. What theyíre doing is copy pixel for pixel, exactly.
A10:17:35 <Xychosis> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel
A10:17:57 <liq3> Xychosis: a ìpixelî in minecraft is just a single block.
A10:17:59 <AlexVMiner> we don't meana literal pixel
A10:18:00 <citricsquid> Xychosis: way to be pedantic, in this context a block is a pixel
A10:18:05 <AlexVMiner> we are comparing
A10:18:08 <Xychosis> Call it block art
A10:18:12 <Xychosis> it's not pixel art
A10:18:14 <AlexVMiner> yeah
A10:18:15 <Xychosis> It never will be
A10:18:17 <AlexVMiner> everyone is gonna change
A10:18:22 <AlexVMiner> because you said so
A10:18:22 <liq3> Alex: Theyíre using 16x16 pixel sprites, which they can copy pixel for pixel.
A10:18:43 <Xychosis> If you call it something else than pixel art it would be fine
A10:18:53 <PuyoDead> you're still recreating original pixel art
A10:18:55 <AlexVMiner> we call it sprite art...
A10:19:03 <PuyoDead> as in, the original art created
A10:20:16 <liq3> AlexVMiner: The following was my reference image. Itís 296x382 pixels. My recreation in Minecraft was about 20x30 blocks. Completely different to what the people who copy pixel art is doing. http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/File:Domokunyellownbackground.jpg

A10:20:35 <citricsquid> liq3: Who says everyone has been copying pixel for pixel? :|
A10:20:39 <citricsquid> way to make a silly assumption
A10:20:41 <AlexVMiner> that...
A10:20:43 <liq3> citric: itís rather obvious.
A10:20:47 <AlexVMiner> doesn't take skill
A10:20:52 <AlexVMiner> it is, like, 3 colors
A10:20:54 <AlexVMiner> 20x30
A10:21:00 <AlexVMiner> well
A10:21:02 <AlexVMiner> it does
A10:21:05 <AlexVMiner> but not as much
A10:21:08 <Xychosis> More colors doesn't change anything
A10:21:11 <liq3> Do you have any idea how hard it is to create it that small? :P
A10:21:12 <AlexVMiner> yes
A10:21:13 <Xychosis> When building in Minecraft
A10:21:17 <liq3> a single block is ludicriously important.
A10:21:19 <AlexVMiner> yes it does
A10:21:27 <AlexVMiner> changing your colors all the time
A10:21:31 <AlexVMiner> remembering the order
A10:21:34 <AlexVMiner> compared to:
A10:21:36 <AlexVMiner> RED
A10:21:39 <AlexVMiner> BROWN
A10:21:40 <AlexVMiner> WHITE
A10:21:46 <Xychosis> You're still copying
A10:21:48 <liq3> I can see alex never draws anything.
A10:21:50 <Xychosis> except you have to switch block more often
A10:21:56 <AlexVMiner> i draw things
A10:21:57 <Xychosis> Big deal
A10:22:01 <AlexVMiner> i can show you
A10:22:18 <liq3> Then youíd understand the diff between COPYING and DRAWING.
A10:22:18 <AlexVMiner> i also work with pokemon sprites
A10:22:34 <AlexVMiner> drawing?
A10:22:35 <Xychosis> Let me guess
A10:22:37 <Xychosis> Fusions?
A10:22:40 <AlexVMiner> when did that come into this at all?
A10:22:46 <AlexVMiner> not only fusions
A10:22:53 <liq3> AlexVMiner: Itís what I did, and have been trying to explain to you for the past 5 minutes.

P1:29:29 <citricsquid> I thought the heaviest man was about 60 stone
P1:29:30 <UnknownX> It was on tv
P1:29:33 <citricsquid> not 71.5...
P1:29:39 <T-money> 1. wtf is a stone
P1:29:47 <Snowman> Like, a rock
P1:29:59 <vede> Rocks have variable sizes, you guys.
P1:30:10 <citricsquid> vede: maybe in your silly country
P1:30:14 <vede> Riight.
P1:30:15 <Tich> stone is a British mass measurement
P1:30:16 <citricsquid> here in europe every rock is the same size.
P1:30:23 <Snowman> citric, METRIC OWNS EVERYTHING
P1:30:26 <vede> I assume English stones are all approximately equal?
P1:30:33 <Snowman> EVERYTHIGN DIVIDEABLE BY 10
P1:30:36 <vede> Use metric.
P1:30:43 <vede> it r w1n
P1:30:46 <Tich> Screw base 10, I use base 8
P1:31:36 <Tim> lol in minecraft we use one block as measurement for lenght
P1:31:40 <UnknownX> There was someone who weighed about 472 lbs., 647 lbs., 812 lbs. then the last guy was like 957 lbs. (Lol i remember now that it was like 900 something)
P1:32:00 <Tich> lbs, wtf is that
P1:32:03 <UnknownX> ...
P1:32:06 <UnknownX> Pounds
P1:32:06 <Tim> yea what is that
P1:32:10 <Tim> and that
P1:32:31 <Snowman> 1 lbs = 0.5 kg
P1:32:34 <Tich> that's like using a squirrel as symbol from kilogram
P1:32:52 <Tich> lbs has nothing in comman with the word pound
P1:33:01 <Tich> :(
P1:33:21 <Tich> Maybe Americans are just upside down people
P1:33:35 <PuyoDead> The abbreviation lb comes from the Latin word libra, meaning "scales, balances"
P1:33:47 <Snowman> They can't do a handstand cause they're too fat
P1:34:03 <vede> Tim, guess what, Notch has said that one block = 1 meter.
P1:34:14 <Snowman> duh, wasnt that obvious?
P1:34:20 <Snowman> btw, they use metric in sweden
P1:34:22 <Tim> yea so?
P1:34:44 <vede> So you use blocks as measurement in Minecraft, but you're actually using metric. :o
P1:34:53 <Tim> he said that for you strange people who do not life in minecraft
P1:34:59 <Tich> I'll just work on making that horrible skin of mine on minecraft, even more horrible
P1:35:08 <UnknownX> We can life?
P1:35:18 <vede> I lifed once.
P1:35:21 <vede>  ._.
P1:35:25 <vede> Terrible experience.
P1:37:06 <Tich> I rage quit my life once before
P1:37:14 <citricsquid> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2021
P1:37:19 <UnknownX> Tim: It is technically impossible to life in minecraft
P1:37:48 <Tim> for you outlanders yes.
P1:38:17 <UnknownX> citricsquid: That seems hard
P1:39:39 <UnknownX> I can see wood being exploited
P1:39:45 <UnknownX> in survival
P1:40:29 <UnknownX> Each piece of wood = 3 pieces. Then you put down another piece and break it for 3 more pieces
P1:40:56 <Tich> Does anyone remember how todownload an uploaded skin
P1:41:06 <Tich> one uploaded on minecraft.net
P1:41:08 <vede> UnknownX, tree wood becomes three PLANKS.
P1:41:12 <Tim> on a serious note: is there still a way to direct join a server with ip & port?
P1:41:23 <UnknownX> Oh
P1:41:26 <vede> Breaking a PLANK will probably result in just a single plank.
P1:41:30 <UnknownX> How do you get wood?
P1:41:37 <vede> Trees.
P1:41:45 <UnknownX> :/
P1:41:47 <vede> You can't place tree wood.
P1:41:53 <vede> You can only place plank wood.
P1:42:01 <UnknownX> But i want to make my own tree
P1:42:06 <vede> TOO BAD
P1:42:22 <UnknownX> You cant place a leaf either :(

P1:42:55 <UnknownX> I want to make a cage for my pet pigs

P1:43:39 <mail2345> i can see how to use a leaf

P1:49:20 <vede> The goal of Survival will be to DIE in the most hilarious way possible.

P1:50:24 <Eagle> I can't think of a way that you could die hilariously in survival.
P1:50:40 <LG_Legacy> Heh..

P2:13:54 <Xychosis> If you want to kick idlers on an IRC channel then you don't use IRC much.

P2:16:32 <yoshibot> k
P2:16:34 <Drakkar> <Stephen> Beta has begun! Hooray!
P2:16:39 <Eagle> O shi
P2:16:41 <Xychosis> Well that's about time
P2:16:44 <Drakkar> (not open)
P2:16:47 <Eagle> Aw
P2:16:49 <vede> MisterX hasn't been here since the early days.
P2:16:51 <Eagle> When will it be open?
P2:16:51 <Drakkar> yet
P2:16:54 <Drakkar> I dunno
P2:16:55 <Xychosis> Doesn't matter to me if it's open or closed
P2:16:56 <Drakkar> but
P2:17:03 <Drakkar> that should give you an idea of how close it is
P2:17:07 <Xychosis> What is important is that the program itself has reached beta stage
P2:17:11 <vede> Nor has lobster, I think.
P2:17:14 <MisterX> that's the truth
P2:17:16 <Eagle> Well given how long it was in Alpha, I'd say a few years
P2:17:17 <Eagle> :/
P2:17:18 <Drakkar> I'm working on something with it now
P2:17:19 <Drakkar> :P

P2:17:34 <Drakkar> it was in alpha for a year tops

P2:17:40 <UnknownX> Try mezo for example

P2:36:14 <Foe> There are many user made stories that are worth the download
P2:36:41 <MisterX> for The Underside? I thought it was just a demo with a portion from the full version

P3:30:16 <Snowman> no, use the darken/lighten tool so you dont have massive surfaces of the same colour
P3:30:19 <Snowman> which looks bad
P3:30:31 <Quatroking> mspaint is worthless except for pixel-art
P3:30:33 <Veronika> You realize the uniform IS one color, right?
P3:30:38 <Quatroking> skins fall under pixel art
P3:30:49 <Snowman> facepalm
P3:31:07 <Quatroking> veronika: a sheet of red paper has one color, but it has different shades due to light
P3:31:07 <Veronika> Also I added noise to it, so it looks less bland now.
P3:31:25 <Snowman> Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you

P3:32:12 <Quatroking> there's a character in it with two colors

P3:33:17 <Veronika> I'm not an artist. Never said I was.
P3:33:30 <Snowman> doesnt mean you cant add shading
P3:33:49 <Quatroking> I'm an artist, and really, you do not want full surfaces of one single color
P3:33:59 <Quatroking> it looks like shit.
P3:34:24 <Eagle> MS Paint isn't that bad when you use it for something that isn't artsy.
P3:34:27 <Quatroking> then again, me and snowman are both artists
P3:34:41 <Quatroking> so it could be us hating non-shaded stuff.
P3:35:02 <Veronika> Probably is. Because while I know it doesn't look professional, it doesn't bother me at all.

P4:01:21 <mocheeze> Why
P4:01:21 <Xychosis> Depends on what kind of genre you want
P4:01:36 <mocheeze> Probably because im too fly for people like you
P4:01:36 <Darkebrz> *oh hey
P4:01:39 <Veronika> Most likely FPS or RTS, unless there is something else particularly good out.
P4:01:45 <Darkebrz> mocheeze: No, your a dick and a spammer
P4:01:50 <Darkebrz> Definitely a deserved ban
P4:01:56 <Xychosis> I haven't really seen any new good FPS games for PC
P4:02:03 <mocheeze> What makes me a dick?
P4:02:15 <Darkebrz> The flame wars you start
P4:02:19 <Darkebrz> And spamming makes you a dick
P4:02:21 <mocheeze> o rry?
P4:02:28 <Snowman> wait, is he banned?
P4:02:32 <Darkebrz> Yes, he is banned

P4:02:57 <Xychosis> It has some good gunplay and such, but it's too obvious that they designed it primarily for consoles

P5:40:05 <vede> I REFUSE to pirate from indie developers, but Notch said if you can't buy it, he's fine if you get it some other way.
P5:40:11 <Veronika> That's fucked up, dude. Notch makes his living from his development.
P5:40:18 <Visiiri> lol
P5:40:20 <Visiiri> no he doesn't
P5:40:22 <vede> He said it here.
P5:40:28 <Visiiri> He did?
P5:40:29 <Visiiri> wow
P5:40:32 <vede> Yeah.
P5:40:32 <Visiiri> fail
P5:40:44 <Visiiri> mmkay
P5:40:54 <Dilt> well, uh
13P5:41:01 * Parthon ponders
P5:41:01 <Dilt> considering multiplayer probably doesn't work unless you've paid for it
P5:41:02 <vede> He said if there's no way you can buy Minecraft, and piracy is the only feasible way to get it, go for it.
P5:41:13 <Dilt> or otherwise hacked notch's servers
P5:41:20 <vede> No DRM...
P5:41:26 <Dilt> It has the best DRM
P5:41:28 <Dilt> server-side checks
P5:41:39 <Colain> Parthon, may I play that map of yours, I can't host.
P5:41:42 <Dilt> it all depends on how authentication works
P5:42:06 <Parthon> Colain: I don't have a server running with it
P5:42:14 <Veronika> Is there a reason the cities have tree windows instead of glass...?
P5:42:25 <Colain> Damn.
P5:42:32 <Parthon> yeah, the screenshots were taken pre-glass
P5:42:40 <vede> Glass hasn't always existed...
P5:42:41 <Colain> Veronika, thats before glass came out.,
P5:42:51 <Veronika> Sorry, I'm relatively new.
P5:43:03 <Veronika> What's the generator written in?
P5:43:05 <Parthon> that's okay, I'm relatively old :P
P5:43:06 <Parthon> c++
P5:43:12 <vede> I'm old, too.
P5:43:22 <vede> Been around since 0.0.11
P5:43:37 <Parthon> pre multiplayer?
P5:43:39 <vede> We had more than four blocks.
P5:43:56 <vede> Parthon, I am vdgmprgrmr.
P5:44:01 <Parthon> aaah .. lol
P5:44:02 <Dilt> Oh!
P5:44:03 <Parthon> aloha
P5:44:04 <Dilt> that's who you are vede.
P5:44:09 <vede> Yep. :)

13P5:44:17 * citricsquid rolls his eyes in a "how could you not know?" manner.
P5:44:34 <Colain> Wow, acutally, I now have no respect for vede.

P5:44:46 <Quatroking> "chekity chek it out yo!" "what what what is it?" "lol stutter" "i got a lightsaber lol" "does it work?" "yeh look" **bzzarpg** "woah"
P5:44:46 <Dilt> i'm never around, citricsquid, i'm just hididng in the backwoods until survival is released
P5:44:49 <Colain> I remembered you griefed a server.
P5:44:57 <vede> Yeah, but it was abandoned.
P5:45:01 <Sins> Griefers suck.
P5:45:04 <citricsquid> I griefed lots lol
P5:45:04 <Sins> :D
P5:45:07 <vede> And it was the only time I'd ever done it.
P5:45:11 <Colain> NOTCH IS A GRIEFER
P5:45:15 <Colain> Ban from all servers nao!
P5:45:18 <Dilt> I've griefed so much blockland I'm bored of it now
P5:45:22 <Sins> Lol ..
P5:45:25 <Colain> ..
P5:45:26 <Sins> Man why do you grief?
P5:45:28 <Colain> dilt..
P5:45:30 <Sins> Lack of creativity?
P5:45:45 <Colain> I just stand around if I have lack of creativity
P5:45:50 <Colain> Aren't we meant to have sloped blocks?
P5:45:55 <Visiiri> no
P5:46:17 <Sins> Guys, whats this Infiminer game?
P5:46:21 <Dilt> mind you guys
P5:46:22 <Sins> Looks very similar to minecraft.
P5:46:26 <Sins> Cant get it to work tho.
P5:46:30 <Visiiri> dilt you are a twat
P5:46:34 <Dilt> i've been playing blockland since the BLM days, so I was like 12-13 or something at the time
P5:46:39 <Dilt> I don't even remember how young I was
P5:46:50 <Dilt> so that's plenty of time to grief servers
P5:46:57 <Visiiri> twat
P5:47:01 <Sins> Its not a reason to grief.
P5:47:15 <Dilt> mind you, i wasn't as sophisticated as the script-nazi-spammers
P5:47:20 <Visiiri> Twat
P5:47:35 <Sins> Still.
P5:47:40 <Sins> Not  a reason to grief.
P5:47:50 <Sins> And the nazi spammers .. go suck it.
P5:48:02 <citricsquid> Sins: Notch was inspired by Infiniminer
P5:48:08 <Sins> Go back 70 years earlier.
13P5:48:17 * Dilt shrugs
P5:48:21 <citricsquid> minecraft is an infiniminer clone, but awesomer ;)

P5:48:39 <do0han> Dilt, you mean you've grown up a little bit?
P5:48:44 <Sins> Yeah if you dont like it just leave.
P5:48:52 <Dilt> considering i'm 19 now, and i was griefing back when i was 12-13?
P5:48:56 <Dilt> yeah, i'd hope so
P5:48:58 <Sins> Destroying other peoples stuff makes you a dick.
P5:49:00 <Sins> No offense.
P5:49:04 <Animator> Don't try to do what Team Grief did, it will backfire.
P5:49:06 <Sins> *couhg *cough*
P5:49:18 <Dilt> anyway, if someone flipped me off to the point of me going mad
P5:49:24 <Dilt> i wouldn't grief, i would -exploit- and -break- things
P5:49:27 <Dilt> ddos attacks ftw
P5:49:32 <Colain> Urge... to... play... server... want... good... server...
P5:49:39 <Sins> Isnt that illehal?
P5:49:43 <Dilt> quite
P5:49:45 <Parthon> team grief?
P5:49:50 <Sins> Like, you can get sued by a print screen?
P5:50:01 <Sins> *presses print screen*.
P5:50:03 <Dilt> certainly not, a print screen doesn't hold up in court
P5:50:06 <Sins> Nah, joke.
P5:50:09 <Dilt> but
P5:50:19 <Dilt> you would probably have adequate logs
P5:50:26 <Sins> Yup.
P5:50:31 <Dilt> the issue would be that if it were that bad, it'd probably be anonymous, and ddoses are essentially proxies
P5:50:52 <Dilt> all linking evidence would be circumstancial, you wouldn't even be able to get a warrant for discovery of who owns the IP
P5:50:53 <Parthon> zombie computer will eat your cpu brains :P
P5:51:00 <Sins> Hmmm, you can still get caught though.
P5:51:10 <Sins> DDOS is the last thing a person would do
P5:51:15 <Sins> (hacking wise*
P5:51:39 <Sins> Anyways,
P5:51:43 <Sins> Lets just drop this silly convo.
P5:51:53 <Visiiri> actually
P5:51:59 <Visiiri> print screens can hold up in cort
P5:52:01 <Visiiri> err
P5:52:03 <Visiiri> court
P5:52:12 <Sins> logs too.
P5:52:14 <vede> OMFG you guys.
P5:52:15 <Sins> but eh
P5:52:20 <Sins> OMG. Seriously
P5:52:22 <Sins> lets change the topic.
13P5:52:28 * Dilt shrugs, yeah
P5:52:33 <vede> Parthon, who is now the coolest IRC member ever, just bought MC for me.
P5:52:36 <Dilt> DDoS is pretty much lowest of the low, that's script kiddy stuff
P5:52:38 <Visiiri> When you press "print screen" all computers saves a code on is
P5:52:40 <Visiiri> it
P5:52:40 <Dilt> doesn't even deserve the hacking label :P
P5:52:47 <Visiiri> and when it's edited, the code goes away.
P5:52:51 <Visiiri> Dilt, you're a twat.
P5:53:10 <Dilt> and you're rude as hell, you've been doing nothing but insulting me consistantly ever since i started talking :(
P5:53:14 <Sins> Congrats vede.
P5:53:17 <Veronika> Visiiri: WTF are you talking about? Print screens don't save any code.
P5:53:28 <Siiseli> .. :D
P5:53:34 <Dilt> also i think Visiiri is talking about 'watermarking', and print screen on computers don't do that

P6:00:20 <Sins> really wanna buy it.
P6:00:24 <Snowman> Your account gets premium, it's not like you get a client
P6:00:42 <Sins> okay i understand now
P6:00:56 <Sins> you can only pay in paypal right?
P6:01:00 <Snowman> otherwise people could pirate the game
P6:01:04 <Snowman> paypal or credit card
P6:01:37 <vede> People will be able to pirate Minecraft when it goes from applet to standalone.
P6:01:42 <Arf_at_Friends> damnit

P6:03:09 <Sins> -.-'
P6:03:12 <Sins> I know.
P6:03:18 <Veronika> It uses Paypal. It's perfectly safe.
P6:03:21 <Snowman> Tell him I said he's a retard and he needs to die in a fire
P6:03:28 <Sins> I know, but it wont go through his head.
P6:03:34 <Sins> I will tell him that.
P6:03:50 <Sins> If it was money transfer like western union or something
P6:03:57 <Sins> It would be much better.
P6:04:10 <Quatroking> Tell him that paypal prevents fraud, if you don't get your premmy paypal will give back his money
P6:04:11 <Snowman> Notch can't afford other payment methods

P9:06:09 <vede> I'm figuring: start in a ship with a bunch of randomly-generated asteroids, and when you get close to one, you can start "mining it" which turns the control from first-person view to a top-down-ish control of a little ship sprite in the asteroid, and you go around in it (similar to snake) and try to collect space crystals or somesuch.

P10:53:05 <Visiiri> i know it's something
P10:53:09 <Visiiri> i just don't remember what
P10:53:13 <Chemo> in the little aliases tab to the left?
P10:53:16 <Visiiri> yeah
P10:53:23 <Visiiri> it's not just "say" or "message"
P10:53:26 <Visiiri> How do you do it?
P10:53:32 <Chemo> its /lynch $$1 /me lynches $$1
P10:53:38 <Visiiri> OH

P10:57:14 <Visiiri> WE'RE SPEAKING OF TEAMSPEAK AND ALIASES
P10:57:18 <Chemo> man but its only like a 5 characters, unless you made it /l or something
P10:57:37 <Visiiri> "/me lynches name" or "/lynch name"
P10:57:40 <Visiiri> it's easier

P11:33:43 <Chemo> no wait
P11:33:56 <Chemo> vede: buy your grandparents a better computer
P11:34:03 <vede> I've thought about it.
P11:34:10 <Chemo> omg, best solution, relationship values increased and you get to use a decent computer while you are there
P11:34:33 <vede> They'd have it ruined within a week, though.
P11:34:54 <Chemo> help them learn to use a computer?
P11:35:15 <vede> And they'd get all freaked because they'd lose all their important files like "INTERNETFREELOTERY.exe"

P11:35:43 <Chemo> maybe they want free stuff as gifts to you :o
P11:35:49 <vede> A 4chan link.
P11:35:58 <vede> Let's click on that, eh?
P11:36:03 <vede> How 'bout no.
P11:36:03 <Chemo> its just philosoraptor
P11:36:06 <Lopo> i clicked
P11:36:20 <Chemo> vede: why so paranoid about 4chan?
P11:36:39 <Lopo> vede is a pissy little dude upset at everything 
P11:36:40 <Chemo> man i saw a good philosoraptor thread today and my favorite was "if you enjoy wasting time, is that time really wasted?"
P11:36:42 <vede> Not just 4chan, but the fact that after 4chan.org is /b/
P11:36:48 <vede>  :/
P11:36:55 <Chemo> whats wrong about /b/?
P11:37:25 <vede>  :|
P11:38:00 <vede> Are we pretending that /b/ doesn't have, among nearly all sites, the WORST reputation?
P11:38:30 <Chemo> so?
P11:38:34 <vede> Or that /b/ is not filled with strange stupid people?
P11:38:55 <Chemo> thats mean
P11:38:57 <vede> The minority who have any merit at all do not make up for the insane number of retards.
P11:39:08 <mail2345> say the same for humanity
P11:39:14 <mail2345> the only diffrence is the ratio
P11:39:18 <Chemo> vede: and?
P11:39:30 <vede> And, that's my reasoning for /b/ paranoia.
P11:39:30 <Chemo> its an image
P11:39:35 <Chemo> its not like it's going to eat you
P11:39:52 <vede> It's an image, which could be anything from a happy piece of art to tub-girl.
P11:39:59 <vede> Not a chance I'm willing to take.
P11:40:24 <PuyoDead>  /b/ is a wasteland. I wouldn't expect anything of signifigance to come from there anyway
