A2:18:21 <unknown> Fuck.
A2:18:30 <pyl> o ho ho
A2:18:43 <Syniphas> My mother's my sister
A2:18:55 <unknown> That makes no sense.
A2:19:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, it's very possible for your mother to be your sister as well.

A2:22:08 <Deiz> Actually, hm
A2:22:20 <Deiz> I think ItzMattu runs the Giant * servers.
A2:22:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Deiz, yeah, it's ItzMattu.
A2:22:29 <Deiz> He should clear out his roster of idiot admins.
A2:22:31 <unknown> vdgmprgrmr
A2:22:36 <unknown> How is that
A2:22:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeees?
A2:22:44 <unknown> Deiz, get off my nick.
13A2:22:52 * Syniphas gets off
A2:22:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait what?
A2:23:02 <vdgmprgrmr> What's going on here?
A2:23:12 <Syniphas> He hadn't registered his nick, and changed it.
A2:23:15 <Syniphas> So I'm sitting on it.
A2:23:29 <Dilt> that's being an ass, man
A2:23:37 <Syniphas> Also, "My mother's my sister!" is from GTA3
A2:23:45 <Syniphas> Other drivers will say it occasionally when you hit them.
A2:23:56 <unknown> ...What.
A2:23:58 <unknown> Rofl.
A2:24:11 <vdgmprgrmr> How do you "register a nic"?
A2:24:16 <vdgmprgrmr> *nick
A2:24:20 <Dilt> /ns help register
A2:24:34 <pyl> Deiz stop being a dick
A2:24:40 <pyl> or
A2:24:46 <pyl> continue being a dick in a more creative fashion
10A2:25:33 * Syniphas is now known as SyniFAS
A2:25:38 <pyl> Dilt: don't diss being an ass man
A2:25:48 <pyl> i've graduated to breasts myself
A2:25:51 <pyl> but a nice ass
A2:25:54 <pyl> is fine
10A2:25:58 * unknown is now known as Syniphas
A2:26:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Who is who here?
A2:26:17 <Syniphas> i'm me
10A2:26:18 * SyniFAS is now known as unknown
A2:26:21 <unknown> I'm Syniphas.
A2:26:26 <pyl> http://m.assetbar.com/uuabw065d.gif
A2:26:28 <Syniphas> The fuck you are.
A2:26:39 <Dilt> Syniphas is Syniphas, unknown is Deiz, Deiz is Deiz (two clients open)
A2:27:02 <Dilt> it WAS: Syniphas is Diez, unknown is Syniphas, Deiz is Deiz
A2:27:06 <Dilt> but he got off the nick
A2:27:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I think everyone should stop being jerks and let the nicks' normal owners have them, or I fear that I might have to make use of op powers.
A2:27:36 <unknown> Piffle
A2:27:37 <pyl> veedawg is late to the partyyy
A2:27:39 <Dilt> Op powers technically wouldn't stop him from being a dick - he'd still have the nick, just not be in the channel
A2:27:44 <Syniphas> vee-damn
A2:27:45 <Syniphas> ur laet
A2:27:47 <Syniphas> get over it
A2:27:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Get over what?
A2:28:02 <Syniphas> it
A2:28:04 <pyl> the it
A2:28:13 <unknown> If you're going to abbreviate to VD, the valid expansion is "Venereal Disease" FWIW
A2:28:14 <vdgmprgrmr> From what I can see, you're stealing people's nicks and not giving them back, and causing confusion.
A2:28:26 <Syniphas> fwiw
A2:28:27 <Dilt> 'it' is a pronoun referring to your proper handling of a situation
A2:28:27 <Syniphas> what
A2:28:28 <Dilt> :(
A2:28:53 <Syniphas> "for what i [am] worth"? in your case, nothing?
A2:28:54 <pyl> not anymoar
A2:29:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Proper handling of situation <rampant dickery> is <stop dickery>.
A2:29:10 <pyl> mmm
A2:29:11 <pyl> dickery
12A2:29:14 * Zaratustra (Zaratustra@189.32.1.30) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A2:29:20 <Deiz> Syniphas: FW[It's]Worth
A2:29:39 <Syniphas> whatever
A2:29:41 <Dilt> the answer is not <combine dickery> to make <huge dickery>
A2:29:56 <Syniphas> ISTFNWWBTLT
A2:30:04 <Syniphas> ATWPITEWUT
A2:30:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Therefore, I'm trying to stop the dickery.
A2:30:15 <pyl> apetit dejour?
A2:30:24 <Dilt> i am going to pistol whip the next person who says dickery
A2:30:31 <pyl> dickery
A2:30:39 <Syniphas> In Some Time From Now We Will Be Talking Like This
13A2:30:43 * Dilt beats pyl to death with the butt of his gun
A2:30:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Now everyone stop the jackassery and give back the nicks.
A2:30:48 <pyl> mmm
A2:30:49 <pyl> butt
A2:30:59 <pyl> vdgmprgrmr: it has been stopped quite some time ago
A2:31:03 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A2:31:08 <pyl> before you started talking about it
A2:31:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I would have expected changes in nicks.
A2:31:12 <Syniphas> And The Worst Part Is That Everyone Will Understand Themselves (make that Eachother)
A2:31:18 <pyl> there were changes in nick
A2:31:21 <Dilt> They did change nicks
A2:31:22 <pyl> before you started talking about it
A2:31:31 <Syniphas> thus we said you were late
A2:31:42 <Deiz> pyl: Is your server down, or has your page generation script broken?
A2:31:54 <pyl> Deiz: it's been moved
A2:31:55 <Syniphas> you're also late
A2:31:58 <Deiz> I see.
A2:32:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh god, see I tried to PM Deiz about the server.
A2:32:36 <pyl> how may i help you, son
A2:32:52 <Deiz> vdgmprgrmr: I see the query now
A2:33:11 <Deiz> I hate xchat's way of chucking queries to the bottom of the channel list
A2:33:38 <Syniphas> don't use xchat
A2:33:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Use Nettalk.
A2:33:50 <Syniphas> use mIRC
A2:33:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I like it.
A2:33:56 <pyl> don't use nettalk, use xchat
A2:33:57 <Syniphas> i like it
A2:33:59 <vdgmprgrmr> But you have to pay for mIRC.
A2:34:06 <Syniphas> vdgmprgrmr I didn't.
A2:34:07 <pyl> actually don't use mirc, nettalk or xchat
A2:34:08 <Deiz> Both of those being non-cross-platform
A2:34:09 <pyl> use irssi
A2:34:16 <Deiz> pyl: Don't use irssi, use weechat
A2:34:18 <Syniphas> use telnet
A2:34:23 <Deiz> More out-of-the-box functionality, less code
A2:34:24 <pyl> don't use weechat, use bitchx
A2:34:36 <pyl> don't use telnet, use epic
A2:34:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Pidgin...
A2:34:38 <Deiz> bitchx is dead, long live bitchx
A2:34:42 <pyl> don't use epic, use ircii
A2:34:54 <Syniphas> don't use ircii, use emacs
A2:35:04 <pyl> don't use emacs, use pirch

10A2:35:20 * TrueWolves was kicked by pyl (haha bye)
A2:35:23 <Deiz> My client mercifully strips colour.
A2:35:29 <pyl> that was p sweet

10A2:35:42 * TrueWolves was kicked by pyl (felt so good, i just might do it again)
10A2:36:04 * TrueWolves (masterofth@69-176-226-109.static.izoom.net) has joined #minecraft
A2:36:09 <Dilt> TrueWolves, technically
A2:36:09 <pyl> you know not to do that
A2:36:14 <Dilt> that was the reason notch added ops
A2:36:15 <pyl> so don't do that
13A2:36:25 * TrueWolves deletes the script.
A2:36:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I REALLY think some kind of temp-ban system would be way more useful than kicking.
A2:36:42 <pyl> vdgmprgrmr: less amusing though
A2:36:45 <pyl> actually
A2:36:51 <pyl> the fun thing is banning the nicck
A2:36:58 <pyl> so people have to change their nick to get in
A2:37:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, haha ur kiked ok u can com bak nao.
A2:37:01 <pyl> then you ban that nick
A2:37:01 <TrueWolves> >.>;
A2:37:07 <pyl> and rinse repeat
A2:37:11 <TrueWolves> If I'm banned I don't ban avoid.
A2:37:20 <Dilt> Advanced IRC banning techniques :D
13A2:37:26 * TrueWolves doesn't accualy think he is banned anywhere on IRC...
A2:37:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Ooh! Neither am I!
A2:37:43 <pyl> if i set a ban on someones nick it's cause i expect them to banavoid so we can all have a good time
A2:37:49 <Deiz> What? You don't ban nicks, usernames or hosts
A2:38:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Wonder if that has something to do with only being on two. One for only a few hours.
A2:38:01 <pyl> why not?
A2:38:08 <Deiz> pyl: If someone annoys you set +m and ban *!*@*
A2:38:12 <Deiz> Then you stew for a few hours
A2:38:53 <vdgmprgrmr> But how does the banNER get on if *!*@* is banned?
A2:39:03 <Deiz> Through channel services, I imagine

A2:39:13 <Deiz> To remove the *!*@*, that is
A2:39:23 <vdgmprgrmr> It seems like that kind of effect would by nigh apocalyptic for IRC.
A2:39:27 <Deiz> Piffle
A2:39:29 <Parthon> Deiz: better to set +m and +i
A2:39:30 <pyl> http://www.rumblo.com/cc/comics/cc-coolfrog.gif
A2:39:41 <Deiz> IIRC +b alone mutes and prevents future joins
A2:40:15 <Syniphas> yes
A2:40:16 <pyl> Deiz: it varies with servers
A2:40:21 <pyl> here it mutes
A2:40:23 <Deiz> *ircds
A2:40:28 <pyl> efnet, not so much
A2:40:28 <pyl> no
A2:40:30 <pyl> with servers
A2:40:32 <pyl> not ircds
A2:40:41 <Deiz> Configurable, I suppose.
A2:40:44 <pyl> yes
A2:41:07 <pyl> even varies within a net
A2:41:12 <pyl> well
A2:41:13 <pyl> some nets
A2:41:27 <Deiz> I haven't actually had to ban or kick in aaaaaages
A2:41:39 <Deiz> I'm a fan of small, invisible channels without idiots
A2:41:48 <pyl> they often die out though
A2:41:52 <Deiz> Yep
A2:42:06 <Deiz> Big channels can 'die' too, though

A2:44:04 <pyl> that was p great you guys
A2:44:32 <Deiz> I think there's something wrong.
A2:44:45 <Deiz> Playerlist on the site lists four
A2:44:49 <Deiz> Yet I only see myself
A2:45:24 <pyl> yes
A2:45:38 <pyl> minecraft-server doesn't update players.txt properlly
A2:45:41 <pyl> it sucks
A2:46:07 <pyl> but i'm too lazy to hack around it and parse the log, so until notch fixes it we'll all SUFFER like this
A2:46:09 <vdgmprgrmr> It seems your own system worked better than the current one.
A2:46:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Didn't it?
A2:46:20 <pyl> i didn't have a system
A2:46:22 <pyl> of my own
A2:46:27 <vdgmprgrmr> You didn't?
A2:46:31 <pyl> i contemplated having one
A2:46:43 <pyl> but then he made players.txt so i didn't have to
A2:46:50 <pyl> here i'm just gonna 
A2:46:57 <pyl> gonna comment that bit out

A2:53:11 <vdgmprgrmr> What didn't I save right?
A2:53:18 <Gauphastus> Are you guys trying to use the escape menu to load a map in multiplayer?
A2:53:27 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A2:53:34 <vdgmprgrmr> That is impossible.
A2:53:35 <Gauphastus> Okay. 'cause sometimes people try that.
A2:53:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it is.
A2:53:56 <Gauphastus> Had this one guy assuring me it could be done.
A2:53:59 <Gauphastus> :/
A2:54:14 <vdgmprgrmr> But we ARE saving and loading levels in MP...
A2:54:20 <Deiz> pyl: Your shit's broken
A2:54:26 <Gauphastus> I was all like "No, no. Those maps are saved on the server."
A2:54:33 <pyl> Deiz: no it's fucking not
A2:54:38 <Deiz> Not with regard to the above
A2:54:44 <Deiz> You have to relog after being opped for your script to allow a user to do things
A2:54:50 <Deiz> Because I assume permissions are set on login
A2:54:51 <pyl> yes i know
A2:54:55 <Gauphastus> Anyway.
A2:54:55 <pyl> i can't fix that
A2:55:01 <pyl> well
A2:55:01 <pyl> i won't
A2:55:03 <pyl> i refuse
A2:55:36 <pyl> people ain't gonna be oped all that often anyway
A2:59:14 <Deiz> Seamless mapchanges would rule
A3:00:18 <pyl> well it ain't doable until notch implements it
A3:00:38 <Rydia> when will notch implement bowel movements/toilet blocks
A3:00:56 <pyl> you lovely bitches just keep on complainin', though
A3:01:01 <pyl> i'm loving it
A3:01:04 <Dilt> when will notch implement punching people over TCP/IP
A3:01:12 <Rydia> also he's really late in implementing the disease simulation subsystem
A3:01:19 <Syniphas> Illegal name?
A3:01:20 <Syniphas> WTF
A3:01:38 <Gauphastus> I get that error kicking people off my server now and then.
A3:01:46 <Gauphastus> When the server thinks the player has no name at all.
A3:01:48 <Gauphastus> Weird shit.

A3:03:32 <Syniphas> you didn't save right :|
A3:03:42 <vdgmprgrmr> I saved perfectly fine.
A3:03:47 <pyl> he probably did, and then the server fucked it up
A3:03:51 <TrueWolves> huh?
A3:03:56 <pyl> i fixed it though
A3:03:56 <Syniphas> vdgmprgrmr
A3:03:58 <Syniphas> As what
A3:04:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I typed "!save lavacaves"
A3:04:08 <Syniphas> lavacaves
A3:04:10 <Syniphas> hold on 
A3:04:15 <vdgmprgrmr> And the server log output was "Level saved with name "
A3:04:19 <Deiz> Well
A3:04:26 <Deiz> The mtime of lavacaves is older than lovetunnel
A3:04:36 <vdgmprgrmr> (It was lovecaves, not lavacaves, I misread the name...)
A3:04:40 <Syniphas> See
A3:04:41 <Syniphas> SEE
A3:04:44 <Syniphas> LOVECAVES
A3:04:46 <Syniphas> I TOLD YOU
A3:04:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I type "!save lovecaves"
A3:05:06 <vdgmprgrmr> And the output was "Level saved with name "
A3:05:09 <Syniphas> It didn't save.
A3:05:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, see, it was the server.
A3:05:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Not myself.
A3:05:19 <Deiz> Let's lynch pyl

A3:44:54 <Gauphastus> Bacon.
A3:45:01 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I don't like peppers.

A11:14:38 <Tim> lol
A11:25:09 <smn> reminds me of the dorky intern that tried to tell me her html code was indeed correct and she hadn't messed it up. i told her to write an email to mozilla because THEIR BROWSER DOESN'T WORK
A11:25:10 <smn> :D
A11:27:02 <Haruhi> also i hope survival mode is basically Dwarf Fortress the FPS, only with more machinery so you don't have to spend the entire day running buckets around everywhere
A11:27:51 <wingboy> im loooking forward to zombie siege
A11:28:03 <wingboy> cutting down tree to use as wood for barricades
A11:28:14 <Haruhi> i'm also hoping he'll implement 7 depths in a block
A11:28:22 <Haruhi> like in DF
A11:28:46 <Haruhi> or at least 5 depths in a block
A11:29:07 <Haruhi> or 3.5
A11:29:17 <C418> or 1
A11:29:34 <Haruhi> considering every block in minecraft is 1/2 a DF block
A11:30:35 <Tim> did you know any browser has a IQ detection so if the IQ of the user is too low you can't play minecraft
A11:30:40 <C418> I'm ignorant at df because I always lose my patience everytime I see the interface
A11:30:47 <Tim> so if it doesn't work we can't help you
A11:31:10 <Tim> DF?
A11:31:16 <Haruhi> C418, water in DF has 7 depths in one block
A11:31:22 <Tim> dragon force?
A11:31:28 <Haruhi> 1/7 is a puddle
A11:31:37 <Haruhi> 7/7 is drowning
A11:32:11 <Haruhi> right now in minecraft water is one entire block no matter what basically
A11:33:28 <Delamore> Haruhi
A11:33:32 <Delamore> Why does it need 7 depths?
A11:33:35 <Haruhi> but for every block in DF there are 4 minecraft blocks
A11:33:37 <Delamore> Because DF has it?
A11:33:44 <Delamore> It is unneeded
A11:33:55 <Haruhi> I'm saying it should have like 2-3 depths
A11:34:01 <Delamore> Why?
A11:34:15 <Haruhi> so you can half fill things with water
A11:35:12 <Delamore> You know it would be 7 different blocks right?
A11:35:16 <Delamore> 7 completely different blocks
A11:35:23 <Haruhi> not 7
A11:35:25 <Haruhi> like 2
A11:35:49 <Delamore> 1 per depth
A11:36:08 <Delamore> Then, to add to the processing
A11:36:14 <Delamore> Instead of water checking for empty blocks
A11:36:20 <Delamore> It would also have to check for blocks of another height
A11:36:28 <Haruhi> yeah
A11:36:57 <Dilt> why it needs it?
A11:36:59 <Dilt> finite water.
A11:37:01 <Delamore> It is a waste of processing power
10A11:37:12 * Zaratustra (Zaratustra@189.32.1.30) has joined #minecraft
A11:37:15 <Dilt> if you want decent finite water, then you'll need several depths
A11:37:27 <Dilt> unless you like random blocks of water floating on top of bodies of water
A11:38:01 <Delamore> Delete excess
A11:38:14 <Dilt> wrong - you can't tell if it's excess or not
A11:38:24 <Dilt> easily, and that wouldn't really be finite water
A11:38:45 <Dilt> also, don't you like the idea of wading through waist-deep or foot-deep water?
A11:38:58 <Delamore> Yes, but I'd rather it process less
A11:38:59 <Haruhi> right now 1 block of water is waist-deep i think
A11:39:05 <Haruhi> so just 2 depths would be fine
A11:39:27 <Haruhi> 1 block of water and 1/2 block of water
A11:39:33 <Dilt> process less? do you know how much it processes now?
A11:39:45 <Delamore> Not too much actually
A11:39:46 <Dilt> and how much adding a single type of block would influence things?
A11:39:47 <Haruhi> I don't really think it'd put a dent into it
A11:40:01 <Delamore> Because you were talking about up to 7 depths
A11:40:04 <Dilt> and how much that adding finite water algorithms would harm it?
A11:40:10 <Delamore> Two depths would do nothing for those tiny bits that float around
A11:40:12 <Haruhi> I was talking about DF having 7 depths
A11:40:13 <Delamore> You'd need multiple
A11:40:28 <Dilt> And 7 depths would be just fine, not much more impact at all
A11:40:34 <Dilt> just uses up blocktypes
A11:41:03 <Dilt> your arguement, dela, that you don't want it to use up any additional processing
A11:41:09 <Dilt> suggests you don't want finite water at all
A11:41:24 <Dilt> if there's a performance hit, it would be calculating the movement of water
A11:41:45 <Dilt> which is why finite water should be the togglable 
A11:41:53 <Dilt> thus appeasing all sides

A11:42:26 <Haruhi> I don't think minecraft has constantly flowing water anyway
A11:42:44 <Dilt> it will
A11:42:44 <ZomBuster> constantly flowing?
A11:42:53 <Dilt> notice the behavior of digging into the side
A11:43:06 <Dilt> if it's finite water, you could make an 'endless' water flow
A11:43:15 <ZomBuster> yeh I would like a new water system
A11:43:17 <Dilt> water would flow in, then move, leading more water to spawn
A11:43:26 <Dilt> it would use up server processing, though, not client
A11:43:41 <ZomBuster> unless you're playing singleplayer

P1:34:03 <C418> will the prices be definitely euro? a lot of american people were complaining they would have to pay at least 14 dollars. I shrug to that
P1:34:07 <Notch> peerkoel: There's "moving" and "still" water
P1:34:17 <peerkoel> ah, ok
P1:34:25 <Notch> if water isn't able to move in a tick, it changes to still, so I don't have to do any more calculations onit
P1:34:34 <Notch> when a tile changes, all tiles around it change from still to moving
P1:34:44 <peerkoel> clever
P1:35:11 <Notch> C418: Well, yeah, it will. :-\ If I charged in dollars, I'd be at the whim om a fairly fluctuating conversion rate
P1:35:21 <C418> lovely paypal
P1:35:45 <Notch> it's a swedish game, the euro is more stable against the krona, so I use euro. But it sucks that the dollar is so low compared to the euro at the moment. :-(

P1:53:19 <wingboy> can we cut trees for wood to use as barricades?
P1:53:22 <Rosetta> yeah what kind of combat/ weapons are planned?
P1:53:31 <Rosetta> lol millions of questions
P1:53:46 <peerkoel> how do I shot web?
P1:53:54 <Syniphas> will what we currently have as multiplayer continue to be free?
P1:53:56 <wingboy> can i put bengay on my balls?
P1:54:03 <Syniphas> well, you CAN
P1:54:14 <Syniphas> you're just probably not gonna like it :)
P1:54:26 <wingboy> maybe im in to that type of thing
P1:54:29 <Zolyx> Syn: think we will, yes
P1:54:36 <Syniphas> then go ahead
P1:54:43 <Syniphas> Zolyx that'd be awesome
P1:54:54 <Zolyx> truly :]
P1:54:57 <Haggle> Only care one item at a time! That way you won't see someone digging through your castle walls and then chop up the place with a battle axe!
P1:55:08 <Haggle> CHA CHA CHAG!
P1:55:16 <wingboy> or limit weapons to zombie mode only
P1:55:24 <paul|not> CUSTOM BLOCKS GO GO GO
P1:55:48 <Haggle> Okay... I'm done I'm going to play something else...
12P1:55:51 * Haggle (Haggle@c-67-191-57-162.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: quit)
P1:56:03 <wingboy> can we have a wallpapering mode
P1:56:26 <Syniphas> can we have realtime night/day settings
P1:56:38 <Rosetta> OMGYEA Notch - for prepurchase, not only custom skin, one or two custom blocks OMG
P1:56:42 <Syniphas> on multiplayer, make that according to the server
P1:56:44 <Notch> wallpapering, probably not, it's six times as much data :-O
P1:56:51 <Notch> night/day, yes, sure
P1:56:57 <sppt> WOOT one of the nine towers is done :D
P1:57:02 <wingboy> what about like clicking the block changes it to the type you want
P1:57:03 <Notch> custom blocks is not at all easy to do
P1:57:15 <wingboy> instead of just one side
P1:57:16 <Rosetta> lol yea tbh hard to save
P1:57:26 <Dilt> as a reminder
P1:57:30 <Dilt> i very, very dislike micropayments
P1:57:38 <peerkoel> file access to my saved levels?
P1:57:40 <Notch> yeah, if 200 paying customers run through your sever and plant one unique block each..
P1:57:44 <wingboy> would be easier then deleting blocks and replacing with the ones yo want
P1:57:52 <sppt> notch, only 8 of the towers need to be finshed, starting from the 19th layer :)
P1:57:52 <Notch> Dilt: No micropayments, don't worry. I hate it too
P1:57:55 <Dilt> :D
P1:59:09 <sppt> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
P1:59:10 <Zolyx> back in a bit, switching to laptop o' doom
P1:59:11 <sppt> damnit
P1:59:16 <Notch> what sppt?
P1:59:18 <sppt> made an error in one of the towers D:
P1:59:38 <Notch> replacing blocks could be possible.. It doesn't interact well with survival mode, and I don't want to make the versions play too differently from each other
P1:59:45 <Notch> so I probably won't add it
P1:59:49 <wingboy> good point
P2:00:07 <Notch> a cloth tile is planned, with like 10 colors
P2:00:12 <wingboy> w00t
P2:00:14 <paul|not> transparent blocks would be nice
P2:00:17 <wingboy> i can make my mario
12P2:00:21 * Zolyx (Zolyx@82-32-226-59.cable.ubr09.newt.blueyonder.co.uk) Quit (Quit:  HydraIRC -> http://www.hydrairc.com <- In tests, 0x09 out of 0x0A l33t h4x0rz prefer it :))
P2:00:23 <Notch> glass and maybe ice!
P2:01:03 <wingboy> how would you make glass seeable if you know what i mean?
P2:01:22 <wingboy> cant be completly invisible since it will be abused
P2:01:29 <Lmaoboat> MAke it like water
P2:01:33 <Notch> probably the same way as leaves are..
P2:01:37 <Lmaoboat> but solid
P2:01:58 <Notch> i want to avoid doing it like water because there are strange rendering artifacts with it
P2:02:00 <wingboy> they would work well as floodgates to
P2:02:03 <Notch> like you can't see water through glass. ;)
10P2:02:03 * Mode (GrabPEELS@bas1-windsor12-1167875265.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
P2:02:34 <wingboy> i love watching people build on my server from up high
P2:02:36 <Lmaoboat> I was just about to mention how wanter becomes seethrough when placing blocks sometimes
P2:02:38 <wingboy> they are like little ants
10P2:02:45 * Massena (Massena@bl6-195-31.dsl.telepac.pt) has joined #minecraft
P2:03:05 <wingboy> and can we get a noclip
P2:03:11 <wingboy> but like u clip in gmod
10P2:03:19 * Zolyx (Zolyx@82-32-226-59.cable.ubr09.newt.blueyonder.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
P2:03:21 <Massena> yo mates
P2:03:24 <wingboy> you still bump into things but you can float around etc
P2:03:30 <Notch> no noclip. :-\
P2:03:38 <Massena> I can't seem to join multiplayer games :(
P2:03:57 <Massena> I get the red screen saying it failed to connect. Anyone knows what's up?
P2:03:59 <wingboy> not noclip but more off a fly mode
P2:04:07 <paul|not> hmmm
P2:04:09 <wingboy> you trying to join your own server?
P2:04:10 <Lmaoboat> How abot an adim "teleport to player" function?
P2:04:10 <Notch> no fly mode either, sorry
P2:04:15 <wingboy> awww
P2:04:17 <Notch> teleport to player, I can do!
P2:04:19 <sppt> notch noclip/fly mode would be nice if i want to fix the cube XD
P2:04:25 <paul|not> teleporting could be useful
P2:04:30 <paul|not> or uh a way to set beacons
P2:04:34 <doohan> Notch that's an excellent feature that I was thinking about yesterday
P2:04:35 <Massena> wingboy: nop
P2:04:35 <paul|not> so that you wan tell where someone is
P2:04:39 <Mode> So many nickalerts.
P2:04:40 <Notch> yeah, but it takes away the only challenge in creative mode. I believe in challenges
P2:04:47 <Lmaoboat> Would be easier to keep tabs on players
P2:04:50 <Notch> lol mode
P2:05:02 <sppt> oh god this layer just fails
P2:05:05 <doohan> Know what would be good too.... a water pump to undo flooding.
P2:05:14 <wingboy> gief water pumps
P2:05:14 <Notch> yes, fixing flooding is needed
P2:05:19 <Massena> It must be something with my ports, or something
P2:05:20 <Massena> also
P2:05:20 <mezo> notch is here         !!!!
P2:05:22 <Massena> I'm on a mac
P2:05:23 <Notch> I am!
P2:05:29 <Notch> Massena: What error do you get?
P2:05:36 <Massena> just the red screen saying:
P2:05:42 <Massena> Failed to Connect
P2:05:44 <Notch> wow 311 players online
P2:05:48 <Notch> that's crazy
P2:05:49 <Massena> The server is probably down.
P2:05:58 <wingboy> its a great game
P2:05:58 <Notch> it's probably a port error
P2:06:01 <Mode> I can't count the number of times I've nearly punched my monitor through the wall because one click and faulty fallbacks resulted in grand subterranean paradises becoming sunken cities.
P2:06:01 <mezo> this is the next counter strike
P2:06:02 <Massena> on all servers
P2:06:16 <Notch> most servers run on port 25565
P2:06:21 <Massena> I see
P2:06:21 <Notch> *firewall error
P2:06:24 <paul|not> Mode: this is why I build aboveground
P2:06:25 <Notch> so try opening that port
P2:06:25 <paul|not> :D
P2:06:27 <paul|not> but yeah it sucks
P2:06:34 <Notch> Mode: God, me too
P2:06:39 <Mode> Above ground is so passe.
P2:06:47 <Mode> Everyone does it.
P2:06:47 <Notch> I've started building safety barriers behind me
P2:06:50 <wingboy> below ground things always get griefed
P2:07:08 <Mode> Yeah, I do the same thing there Notch.
P2:07:17 <paul|not> yeah when I do srs builds I don't bother doing them online
P2:07:31 <wingboy> i cant wait for zombie mode
P2:07:31 <Notch> i like two player building in mp. =D
P2:07:44 <wingboy> me and my friend went cave exploring
P2:07:45 <Mode> Dig out a section, create a chokepoint and board it up, continue digging. If something floods, I only have to spend 5 minutes completely filling the area with stone, then dig it all back out.
P2:07:48 <Notch> 8+ gets a bit chaotic
P2:07:48 <wingboy> but it flooded
P2:07:55 <paul|not> yeah but I don't know enough people to play with
P2:08:06 <Notch> lol
P2:08:16 <wingboy> just ask here in irc
P2:08:19 <Mode> It's also handy because if something goes terribly wrong and the flooding is completely incorrigible, I can simply loop backa round and remember not to dig out the wood.
P2:08:37 <Notch> the old water flow code was a bit friendlier, but this one is more fun :D
P2:08:48 <wingboy> i love when lava floods happen
P2:08:49 <paul|not> it's at least nicely fast
P2:08:50 <Notch> there's a very nice "OH GOD NO WATER AAAH" feeling when it floods
P2:08:52 <paul|not> though not fun
P2:08:57 <wingboy> its hectic building so your stuff dosent die
P2:09:00 <paul|not> lol
P2:09:04 <Notch> not fun, but memorable. =)
P2:09:05 <mezo> water is currently more threatening than lava
P2:09:14 <paul|not> lava floods are always good though
P2:09:15 <Notch> which means it's like a natural enemy in the game
P2:09:17 <wingboy> lava builds more suspense though
P2:09:19 <doohan> Lava is a bit slower isn't it.
P2:09:20 <paul|not> it's pretty hard to find lava though
P2:09:22 <Notch> but yes, flooding is waaaaaay too powerful
P2:09:22 <Massena> Notch: Any idea how I could fix it on OS X 10.4?
P2:09:30 <doohan> Notch just very fast.
P2:09:31 <Mode> My main problem with the flooding is that, unlike with lava, you see the water and you're already flooded befor you can scream 'FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK'.
P2:09:33 <Notch> so pumping or sponges or something is badly needed
P2:09:35 <doohan> A single woops and it's all over.
P2:09:45 <doohan> Yeah sponge brick would be cool.
P2:09:52 <Notch> yes.. perhaps I should add the grace period before water floods
P2:10:01 <Notch> so you see the water, and you've got a random delay before it starts flooding
P2:10:03 <paul|not> some way to absorb water better than replacing EACH FRIGGIN TILE
P2:10:05 <Mode> At least with lava, you can react fast enough to plug the hole.
P2:10:06 <wingboy> but then it would seem unrealistic
P2:10:18 <doohan> Yeah sponge sounds good to me.
P2:10:23 <doohan> Just put one in the ocean :D
P2:10:24 <Lmaoboat> I remember outrnning a lava flow, nad having the time to type "run!" to someone near me
P2:10:28 <Notch> ok, a sponge that soaks up 5x5 tiles or something?
P2:10:35 <wingboy> yeah
P2:10:36 <paul|not> that
P2:10:36 <doohan> Sounds good to me notch
P2:10:37 <Mode> That would be a godsend.
P2:10:39 <Lmaoboat> In infinminer, this was
P2:10:40 <paul|not> would be great
P2:10:53 <Notch> lava floods are fun. Slow, and look good because of the higher contrast
P2:10:53 <wingboy> what about water that goes to flow in the flooded spot?
P2:11:01 <wingboy> would be akward
P2:11:10 <wingboy> since water is still infinite
P2:11:16 <Lmaoboat> Some way to have things like water falls without flooding would be nice, too
P2:11:20 <Notch> yeah, it'd be akward..
P2:11:26 <mezo> copy DF again and have damp blocks
P2:11:28 <Notch> agreed, Lmaoboat
P2:11:30 <wingboy> have to cover everything in sponges
P2:11:33 <paul|not> hmm
P2:11:38 <Mode> Another thing I think could be a great help if it's possible, is some kind of stone or ground type that appears around the edges of water underground, so you're digging along and you come across some rock that has some blue streaks, then you know that digging through that rock will result in watery fail.
P2:11:38 <mezo> so you know if there's water on the other side of a tile
P2:11:40 <paul|not> minecraft seems to like to crash my firefox
P2:11:41 <wingboy> pretty much the sam thing we do now but with less blocks
P2:11:47 <Lmaoboat> Like I suggested before, water "carving" into the ground might help
P2:12:06 <Mode> In during mezo and I have the same idea.
P2:12:47 <Notch> hmm
P2:12:49 <Notch> that's a good idea
P2:12:50 <Tim> notch seriously https://partner.steamgames.com/
P2:13:03 <Notch> it doesn't stop flood griefing, but perhaps it doesn't have to
P2:13:05 <Tim> when done you could try it
P2:13:24 <Notch> i'll give it a shot, tim. =)
P2:13:27 <Notch> it's be a dream come true
P2:13:31 <Tim> :P
P2:13:32 <Notch> *it'd
P2:13:53 <wingboy> get community support behind it and it will be easy
P2:15:54 <Notch> :D
P2:15:59 <Notch> i'd pee my pants
P2:16:02 <paul|not> man
P2:16:09 <Notch> literally. there would be urine running down my leg
P2:16:15 <paul|not> why so good at crashing FF minecraft
P2:16:16 <paul|not> :(
P2:16:18 <paul|not> it's fine while playing
P2:16:21 <wingboy> facepunch is making alot of userbase for minecraft atm
P2:16:25 <paul|not> then when I exit it UNIVERSALLY ceases to respond
P2:16:26 <ZomBuster> why this engrossing information
P2:16:30 <wingboy> i think sa has a thread
P2:16:42 <Notch> there's a couple of chans as well
P2:16:53 <sppt> ack
P2:16:57 <sppt> lost my progress again
P2:17:01 <Notch> it seems to be a hit in internet savvy communities
P2:17:04 <Notch> which is nice
P2:17:08 <C418> 4chan knows of minecraft. but just barely
P2:17:13 <sppt> had to reload because i accidentally opened up a canal, cooling the lava >_<
P2:17:14 <ZomBuster> we forum people look down on chans
P2:17:15 <wingboy> better it stays that way
P2:17:16 <Notch> well, not a "hit", but they seem to like it
P2:17:27 <paul|not> hmmm
P2:17:30 <paul|not> :(
P2:17:34 <Lmaoboat> If I had to wager, I'd say lots of the griefers come from the chans
P2:17:35 <Notch> paul|not: Crashing on exit? I get that on my mac a lot
P2:17:35 <C418> derek yu wrote an article on tigsource, and he forgot to write a word on the sentence with sound and music
P2:17:37 <paul|not> can't get a server working
P2:17:41 <C418> which is "yet"
P2:17:43 <paul|not> Notch: xp, media center
P2:17:57 <Notch> i think my shut down code is a bit broken
P2:18:01 <Tim> hah would be cool to get achievements in minecraft
P2:18:01 <Notch> the applet has to be very fast
P2:18:02 <paul|not> also if I refresh
P2:18:03 <paul|not> :(
P2:18:18 <Notch> i'll try to make it tighter
P2:18:31 <Notch> ZomBuster: Even chan people look down on chans. ;)
P2:18:38 <wingboy> i have 10 people on my server now :D
P2:18:41 <Notch> that's why I love them. They're so internet.
P2:18:45 <wingboy> and no griefing so far
P2:18:50 <Notch> nice
P2:18:51 <AlMightyBob> my java applet crashes instantly when i try and load the game :(
P2:18:59 <Notch> what error, AlMightyBob?
P2:19:08 <AlMightyBob> nothing, it just goes blank
P2:19:16 <wingboy> update your java?
P2:19:23 <AlMightyBob> done that
P2:19:24 <paul|not> yeah
P2:19:25 <paul|not> :D
P2:19:27 <paul|not> er
P2:19:28 <paul|not> :( rather
P2:19:37 <AlMightyBob> tried IE as well, didn't work
P2:19:40 <paul|not> I have DMZ enabled but can't connect to my server
P2:19:47 <Zolyx> the Zolyx Zone is up for another evening stint: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=9a2c0656f3e9ec954e432f0097f8af3f
P2:19:47 <paul|not> someone try http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a487c9f4108573241fb7e2da4a2a2a6d
P2:20:01 <wingboy> i think if enough people play this then servers wont be a problem
P2:20:02 <Tim> sure paul!
P2:20:08 <Tim> will try now
P2:20:24 <wingboy> i set up my server easily and i didnt have any idea what to do when i started
P2:20:28 <Tim> yep works
P2:20:37 <peerkoel> works fine paul|not 
P2:20:39 <paul|not> huh
P2:20:40 <AlMightyBob> if there is an error then it disappears too fast for me to see it
P2:20:44 <paul|not> well now that's weird
P2:20:50 <paul|not> I can't connect to my own server
P2:20:51 <paul|not> :(
P2:20:54 <Tim> oh hold on
P2:21:01 <peerkoel> paul|not are you portforwarding?
P2:21:07 <paul|not> well if people can connect
P2:21:11 <Lmaoboat> Do you think you could also make it so shadows shrink with hight? Sky builds tend to kill lots of grass
P2:21:14 <paul|not> I have DMZ on when I host
P2:21:18 <Zolyx> works here too paul
P2:21:18 <paul|not> means no ports are blocked
P2:21:39 <peerkoel> well I found that I cannot connect from my LAN with NAT
P2:21:43 <wingboy> my server is creeping me out badly
P2:21:49 <wingboy> everyone is just building...
P2:21:49 <Zolyx> DMZ is bad. try port triggering instead
P2:21:56 <Zolyx> that's what made mine work
P2:22:00 <ZomBuster> paul you cant connect to your own server directly
P2:22:12 <ZomBuster> you need to use your local ip
10P2:22:13 * Tim_ (chatzilla@alr-bw-2f22b.mxs.adsl.euronet.nl) has joined #minecraft
P2:22:16 <paul|not> I also can't use any commands in here
P2:22:24 <ZomBuster> like 192.168.1.134 or something
P2:22:24 <wingboy> oh wait someone built a nazi symbol
P2:22:37 <Tim_> paul http://www.mojang.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=206
P2:22:59 <ZomBuster> why does my firefox crash all the time
P2:23:01 <ZomBuster> damn
P2:23:05 <Tim_> mine too
P2:23:16 <wingboy> why do people have to build nazi symbols
P2:23:26 <ZomBuster> I have too kil the java process
P2:23:28 <Tim_> because they think it will make them look cool
P2:23:31 <peerkoel> because they are children
P2:23:53 <wingboy> at least their not griefing
12P2:23:57 * Tim (chatzilla@alr-bw-2f22b.mxs.adsl.euronet.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P2:24:01 <Zolyx> I'd call it such
10P2:24:06 * Tim_ is now known as Tim
P2:24:38 <paul|not> hokay
P2:24:40 <paul|not> server back up
P2:24:49 <sppt> ZomBuster, because it's firefox
P2:24:57 <Massena> Notch: I can't play the game online with my firewall off.
P2:24:59 <Tim> paul did you read the thread?
P2:25:02 <paul|not> yeah
P2:25:08 <Tim> does it work?
P2:25:14 <paul|not> not sure yet
P2:25:19 <paul|not> restarting firefox for the fifteenth time
P2:25:23 <Tim> else use your lan ip
P2:25:34 <Zolyx> I've given up with FF and MC, I use IE to play it instead now
P2:25:43 <Zolyx> not a single crash over the past couple days
P2:25:52 <Zolyx> it's the only thing I use IE for :\
P2:26:23 <peerkoel> firefox on linux is ok with MC
P2:26:38 <Notch> that's strange, Massena
P2:26:50 <Notch> if you could check your java console, it'd be great
P2:26:51 <Massena> Maybe it's my router that's acting up
P2:26:57 <Notch> probably, yes
P2:27:15 <Massena> nah
P2:27:20 <Massena> my router's firewall is off
P2:27:22 <Massena> so
P2:27:34 <Massena> how do I check the java console?
P2:28:09 <C418> massena? long time no read
P2:28:17 <Massena> why C418 :D
P2:28:20 <Notch> I don't know how to turn that one in macos, Massena.. check google. =)
P2:28:28 <wingboy> bleh server crashed
P2:28:29 <C418> portforward.com helps
P2:28:40 <Massena> I heard you were making the music for this game :D
P2:28:41 <Tim> wow youtube crashes alot right now
P2:28:42 <wingboy> whats up with the error where it says the game broke
P2:28:45 <Tim> google server error
P2:28:48 <C418> yeah, I actually do
P2:29:39 <Notch> wingboy: That's when there's an unexpected internal error in the client
P2:29:52 <Notch> ideally, you should never get that error, as it means it did something I didn't expect
P2:30:00 <Notch> so that's why it's got that silly error message. =)
P2:30:05 <Notch> what else does it say?
P2:30:24 <wingboy> dunno i restarted
P2:30:28 <wingboy> everyone crashed though
P2:30:37 <Notch> oh, when a server went down?
P2:30:39 <wingboy> no
P2:30:43 <Notch> :-O
P2:30:44 <wingboy> everyone got the error
P2:30:48 <wingboy> and crashd
P2:30:50 <Notch> I'd love to know what error it was
P2:30:53 <wingboy> happened twice today
P2:31:01 <wingboy> if it does it again ill write it down
P2:31:10 <Notch> thank you
P2:31:36 <wingboy> ive been playing this the last 2 days
P2:31:42 <wingboy> minecraft stole my life
P2:31:54 <wingboy> not that i had one anyway
P2:31:58 <Notch> hehe
P2:32:04 <Notch> it did the same to me
P2:32:20 <Notch> it feels so good to develop something bigger than a compo game again
P2:32:36 <peerkoel> sandbox is good gameplay
P2:32:53 <wingboy> your gonna have problems with people paying though
P2:32:54 <peerkoel> and limits bring out the creativity in people
P2:33:17 <sppt> so apparantly, my iq is 159 according to this one site
P2:33:22 <sppt> must be a crappy test.
P2:33:27 <sppt> no way that is right
P2:33:31 <Notch> wingboy: Possibly, but it's not a big deal. =)
P2:33:39 <wingboy> im gonna pay
P2:33:47 <Notch> =D
P2:33:51 <wingboy> mainly cause its cheaper prerelease and this could trn out great
P2:34:01 <sppt> notch, you're a member of mensa arent you?
P2:34:07 <Notch> I am, sppt. :D
P2:34:13 <sppt> nice
P2:34:15 <peerkoel> do you get sources with payment?
P2:34:15 <User38692> A little question: What is the size of the different levels? Because I'm trying to build a bridge across a huge level and it takes forever to reach the other side....
P2:34:21 <sppt> how high does your iq need to be to join mensa?
P2:34:21 <Notch> sources?
P2:34:25 <wingboy> notch sits next to god and chuck norris up in heaven
P2:34:27 <peerkoel> sourcecode
P2:34:32 <Notch> User38692: Huge is 512x512 meters
P2:34:42 <Notch> oh, no, peerkoel
P2:34:43 <paul|not> so 512 tiles right
P2:34:51 <Notch> but when the game has run its course, I'll release the source code in some format
P2:34:53 <User38692> And the other 2? Small and medium?
P2:35:04 <Notch> medium is 256*256, small is 128*128
P2:35:15 <peerkoel> and 64 blocks high
P2:35:24 <Notch> yes, all are 64 high at the moment
P2:35:44 <User38692> Ok, thank you! ^.^
P2:36:08 <Notch> there already are some people working on level editors. =)
P2:36:12 <Lmaoboat> o noes, the server!
P2:36:29 <wingboy> i was thinking that level editors are gonna be a bit weird
P2:36:32 <Rosetta> ya server died Lmaoboat
P2:36:36 <Cludney> BEHOLD HORSE PANTS
P2:36:37 <User38692> About 73 segments for the bridge... What did I start...
P2:36:37 <wingboy> like playing minecraft but just with noclip
10P2:36:42 * Cludney is now known as Drakkar
10P2:36:54 * ChanServ sets mode: +o Drakkar
P2:37:04 <Notch> yes. But if people are doing it outside of the game, it at least feels "unpure"
P2:37:06 <Tim> and a selection tool :v
P2:37:15 <peerkoel> luckily level files are just gzipped serialised java thingies :)
P2:37:17 <Drakkar> minecraft needs those crazy frog things from secret of mana
P2:37:31 <Notch> peerkoel: I'm probably going to make a real level format out of it and document it
P2:37:34 <Drakkar> step on them
P2:37:36 <Drakkar> and BAM
P2:37:41 <Drakkar> SENT FLYING INTO THE SKY
P2:37:41 <peerkoel> what's wrong with this? :)
P2:37:45 <Lmaoboat> Oh no! Maybe Zolyx had a "petrol" leak in his "flat" and his stove ignited it when he was making "tea"!
P2:37:48 <peerkoel> perfectly editable
P2:37:50 <Notch> it changes if I change the code
P2:37:55 <Notch> so it's not version safe
P2:38:01 <Notch> well, it IS backwards version safe
P2:38:07 <Notch> but it's not pretty
P2:38:13 <Notch> it's very easy to use =D

P2:38:26 <wingboy> i cant see why people wouldnt want to pay for this
P2:38:29 <peerkoel> a custom blocks format would be nice
P2:38:34 <sppt> what was the site of the museum again
P2:38:39 <Notch> wingboy: It's a bit expensive for americans at the moment
P2:38:52 <peerkoel> with a texture and rules on how to influence blocks around it
P2:38:55 <sppt> ah nvm
P2:38:56 <Notch> which sucks. :-( Makes it harder for me as a european to export stuff there
P2:38:58 <wingboy> but its so fun :D
P2:39:09 <wingboy> and you deserve for all the work
P2:39:14 <paul|not> lol
P2:39:20 <wingboy> and you seem like your gonna go thrugh with it
P2:39:22 <paul|not> it's like fourteen bucks
P2:39:25 <paul|not> better to buy early
P2:39:27 <wingboy> and not die the cortex command guy
P2:39:28 <paul|not> before the dollar slips anymore
P2:39:34 <paul|not> wingboy: ?
P2:39:35 <Notch> peerkoel: There's a whole host of problems with that, but it's part of the planned modding stuff
P2:39:40 <peerkoel> \o/
P2:39:52 <Lmaoboat> Yep, costs a lot on the good ol' US of A... 'Merica... Land of the Free... Eagle Liberty Apple Pie Hummerland
P2:39:56 <wingboy> the cortex command guy takes ages to update his stuff
P2:40:02 <paul|not> yes he does
P2:40:04 <wingboy> its like his dead
P2:40:08 <paul|not> but he's been working on it for seven years
P2:40:10 <paul|not> also, what
P2:40:13 <wingboy> and my spelling is bad cause im really tired
P2:40:15 <paul|not> he was at IGF
P2:40:19 <Notch> if you pardon some economic speculation: I don't think the dollar will slip much further. It's a bit silly now with how big the price differences are
P2:40:24 <paul|not> and released a build like a month ago
P2:40:35 <Notch> or perhaps it's just wishful thinking from my part
P2:40:47 <wingboy> but i bought it like a year ago
P2:40:53 <paul|not> I bought two keys
P2:40:58 <wingboy> and it hasnt seemed to have aything major
P2:41:01 <paul|not> one of them was the second one bought by anyone
P2:41:02 <paul|not> uh
P2:41:02 <Lmaoboat> The full price of minecraft is the same as a comercial DS game in the US

P2:42:27 <Notch> the exchange rate is going to cost me a lot of us sales :-(

P2:44:32 <Tim> just to make it harder :P
P2:44:39 <AlMightyBob> gmod requires a source game, that adds to the cost
P2:44:39 <Notch> :D
P2:45:13 <Notch> if I can be perfectly honest, I'm also trying to increase the value of indie games. ;)
P2:45:20 <wingboy> making peopl pay should eliminate griefers or most of them anyway

P2:46:16 <Tim> wingboy, probably 1% will survive and they will get banned easy 
P2:46:17 <Notch> hi sir!
P2:46:25 <Notch> paul|not: I read an article on that today!
P2:46:38 <paul|not> it's weird, not sure what it is
P2:46:41 <Zolyx> I have a mind to make a quick 'n' dirty server helper over the weekend
P2:46:42 <Notch> I shouldn't use automatic mipmap generation.. Not that I USE mipmaps
P2:46:44 <paul|not> I have a 9400 GT :(
P2:47:02 <Zolyx> it's tedious manually backing up the server level file every so often... needs to be automated :)
P2:47:14 <wingboy> valde made  script on forum
P2:47:20 <Zolyx> oh, great
P2:47:22 <wingboy> but you need to use python
P2:47:26 <wingboy> and i dont know how
P2:47:27 <Massena> fuck it, I can't get the console to open
P2:47:29 <Zolyx> meh. ;\
P2:48:02 <wingboy> lol paul im running on a fx5200 feel my pain :D
P2:48:02 <AlMightyBob> brb, reinstalling java
P2:48:04 <Zolyx> an EXE would be more convenient, 'cuz I'm lazy and also don't have Python

P2:48:18 <wingboy> could ask him in the thread i suppose

P2:48:21 <Massena> and enabled

P2:48:55 <Massena> there it is
P2:49:03 <Massena> a little restart of the browser did it
P2:49:04 <Notch> i need to improve performance on mac. I've got my macbook from work with me here over the weekend
P2:49:08 <Notch> tab doesn't work at all
P2:49:29 <Notch> and the weird bug where fps goes down if you generate or load a new map is still there
P2:49:33 <Notch> it makes no sense at all
P2:49:38 <Massena> also, it seems to work much better on firefox than on safari
P2:49:50 <Notch> ok, interesting
P2:50:17 <Massena> besides the fact that tab changing works in safari but not in firefox :(
P2:50:55 <Massena> just one second
P2:50:56 <Notch> i haven't tested the game enough on mac. :-(
P2:51:00 <Massena> and I'll give the console output

P2:52:37 <peerkoel> I noticed the Zip error too while trying to play it in appletviewer
P2:52:41 <Notch> hm, that zip error thing is "normal"
P2:52:50 <Notch> it's the logo for the loading screen, i've managed to mess it up
P2:52:57 <Notch> i should fix that. ;)
P2:53:00 <AlMightyBob> well that didn't work
P2:53:01 <Massena> meh
P2:53:05 <Massena> doesn't bother no one :P
P2:53:09 <peerkoel> btw, when using appletviewer, every time you click the mouse you get dropped into the game menu
P2:53:23 <Notch> you do? I don't.
P2:53:34 <Notch> wait, I haven't used appletviewer for a few versions..

P2:54:43 <Tim> it's poison not a bug..
P2:54:45 <wingboy> that must annoy the crap out of you
P2:55:05 <Notch> look for forced anti aliasing or forced anisotropic filtering in your graphics card settings, paul|not
P2:56:18 <wingboy> i cant wait for when you make zombie siege mode :D
P2:56:30 <Notch> it's after release. =)
P2:56:51 <Mode> That reminds me, the survival mode or zombie sieges, how will combat be handled?
P2:57:03 <Notch> i'm probably going to prototype it this weekend, mode
P2:57:12 <Mode> Oh ho?
P2:57:18 <Notch> the only important thing is that it should be fun
P2:57:35 <Notch> and fun over a long time as well, as there might be a lot of combat in some game modes
P2:57:40 <wingboy> limit weapons to modes that need it though
P2:57:44 <Notch> yes
P2:57:47 <Notch> no weapons in creative

P2:58:25 <wingboy> it could be the zombie roamer everyone wants
P2:58:36 <wingboy> since you can build your own city and shit
P2:58:45 <Mode> I don't know, wing. I think having a shotgun or something would help people deal with griefers in creative mode.
P2:58:56 <wingboy> only for admins though
P2:59:36 <Mode> Well, the admin can just ban people. It's the ultimate weapon.
P2:59:50 <wingboy> more fun to kill them constantly though
P2:59:56 <Rosetta> not as satisfying as blowing the head off
P3:00:14 <Rosetta> that little cube head would look loverly decapitated
P3:00:16 <paul|not> how do you save multiplayer levels
P3:00:36 <AlMightyBob> Notch, I noticed that if I delete the applet history from java then reload MC I can get a momentary glimpse of this error which I finally managed to printscreen
P3:00:38 <AlMightyBob> http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/8373/minecraft1.jpg
P3:00:57 <Mode> Though I have to admit, encountering a griefer and getting a good laugh over dropping him into a pit the descends all the way to the bottom of the map is pretty good too.
P3:01:22 <wingboy> paul you have to copy the server_level.dat
P3:01:29 <paul|not> k
P3:01:30 <wingboy> in your servers folder
P3:02:40 <AlMightyBob> if i try again then java dies without even giving that error
P3:03:30 <wingboy> its amazing to see 15 people who dont know each other working together with no griefing
P3:03:39 <wingboy> its why i love this game
P3:06:16 <Notch> AlMightyBob: That's the logo image error. I'll fix it soon. =) It shouldn't crash the game, though, so I think that's unrelated
P3:06:29 <Notch> there's way less griefing that I thought there'd be!
P3:06:38 <Notch> A single griefer can cause a lot of harm, though
P3:06:59 <wingboy> yeah
P3:07:12 <Massena> so, Notch, any more advice?
P3:07:13 <AlMightyBob> aww
P3:07:51 <Notch> could you describe again exactly what happens? does singleplayer work?
P3:08:00 <Massena> so
P3:08:02 <Massena> singleplayer works
P3:08:12 <Massena> but multiplayer doesn't work 
P3:08:20 <Notch> what happens, exactly?
P3:08:22 <Massena> all my fireworks are off
P3:08:28 <Massena> I get the red screen stating that
P3:08:34 <Massena> the server is probably down
P3:09:08 <Notch> ok, that happens if the server either doesn't reply within a certain timeout (don't remember how long), or if the server rejects the connection
P3:09:31 <Notch> i think it's almost certainly a port forwarding problem or something
P3:09:38 <Massena> the red screen appears very fast

P3:25:03 <paul|not> now I want to make a 32 pixel sphere
P3:25:04 <paul|not> :D
P3:25:23 <User38692> Is there any way to quit the game normally? If I try to close the tab FireFox crashes every time...
P3:25:49 <paul|not> uh
P3:25:52 <paul|not> it crashes firefox
P3:25:55 <paul|not> notch is working on it
P3:26:10 <Notch> it doens't crash ff here
P3:26:15 <Notch> so it doesn't affect everyone

P3:26:32 <paul|not> it seems to affect a fair few
P3:26:39 <paul|not> IE does do it well though
P3:26:48 <Notch> ok
P3:27:26 <User38692> Well, if I switch to other applications or if I have a lot of tabs open it can crash while loading, so I don't do that.... But closing the game....
P3:27:57 <peerkoel> oh, run it in appletviewer Notch, I remember an error about DisplaySomething when I closed the applet
P3:28:06 <Notch> ok
P3:28:06 <peerkoel> that might be why it crashes FF

P3:30:02 <akuryo> i still can sort of hack it

P3:35:55 <akuryo> i mean, you know it will multiply the level size by minimum 4 =)
P3:36:11 <Notch> yes, it'll be a special set of blocks with just 10 or 16 different colors
P3:36:15 <Notch> possibly cloth
P3:36:21 <akuryo> ok
P3:36:22 <mezo> who's the first guy from the left in that pixel mural?

P3:36:32 <akuryo> 256 colors

P3:37:03 <akuryo> i want special type
P3:37:07 <akuryo> like in sauerbraten xD
P3:37:10 <akuryo> like noclip
P3:37:17 <akuryo> can it be possible?
P3:37:29 <akuryo> and another request, lol, could you make the water move?
P3:37:32 <akuryo> not duplicate
P3:37:36 <akuryo> i can help you on this point if you want
P3:37:40 <akuryo> already done this kind of thing
P3:37:46 <akuryo> in 2D, but its the same
P3:38:17 <C418> haha, I think notch can do that. he had this idea with this random placement already I think
P3:38:45 <Notch> random placement?
P3:38:59 <C418> ah yeah, you know, that landscape with the look of love
P3:39:04 <doohan> Yeah water that doesn't breed would be nice.
P3:39:14 <doohan> The look.....of love.....is all....
P3:39:16 <doohan> etc
P3:39:17 <wingboy> finite wate ris the most wanted feauture right now
P3:39:22 <Notch> aye
P3:39:26 <mezo> water breeds irl
P3:39:35 <doohan> What happened to explosives?
P3:39:39 <C418> everyone wants to dry out the ocean
P3:39:57 <wingboy> ocean shouldnt be able to dry out
P3:40:03 <doohan> It wouldn't.
P3:40:04 <wingboy> need to get water from somewhere :P
P3:40:10 <doohan> It come from the edges.
P3:40:15 <doohan> Where you can't place stuff.
P3:40:29 <wingboy> will make underground caverns with lava nad water more fun to
P3:41:48 <akuryo> no
P3:41:53 <akuryo> we need a single source
P3:41:56 <akuryo> of water
P3:41:56 <akuryo> i think
P3:42:01 <akuryo> but flooding will stillbe possible =/
P3:42:04 <akuryo> no
P3:42:07 <akuryo> i dunno lol
P3:42:13 <akuryo> make water evaporate? xD
P3:42:19 <akuryo> floating cube >=D
P3:43:02 <akuryo> no really
P3:43:04 <akuryo> notch
P3:43:06 <akuryo> if you need help
P3:43:08 <akuryo> ask me
P3:43:09 <akuryo> really
P3:43:13 <akuryo> i need some programming project
P3:43:15 <akuryo> i'm bored xD
P3:43:25 <akuryo> nobody is ready to start a new C++ project
P3:43:34 <vdgmprgrmr> You could take the DF approach to water, Notch.
P3:43:42 <akuryo> yeah
P3:43:43 <vdgmprgrmr> 1-7 for each tile and such.
P3:43:44 <akuryo> exactly
P3:43:47 <akuryo> YEAH
P3:43:49 <akuryo> TOTALLY
P3:43:51 <akuryo> =)
P3:43:53 <akuryo> ma
P3:43:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And it would be way cool.
P3:43:55 <akuryo> man
P3:43:57 <akuryo> this is great
P3:43:59 <akuryo> make river
P3:44:02 <akuryo> too
P3:44:05 <akuryo> this will be the source
P3:44:10 <akuryo> but maybe hard for server
P3:44:12 <akuryo> dunno
P3:44:17 <akuryo> and make the little plant
P3:44:20 <akuryo> grow to trees
P3:44:21 <akuryo> =)
P3:44:27 <wingboy> the coding required to make blocks go to a 7th would be stupid
P3:44:27 <vdgmprgrmr> But I'd also be pretty much okay with blocky water.
P3:44:31 <wingboy> and so would the lag
P3:44:44 <akuryo> no
P3:44:47 <akuryo> not 7 level
P3:44:49 <akuryo> 2 level
P3:44:52 <akuryo> dark and clear water
P3:44:55 <akuryo> this would be nice
P3:45:05 <akuryo> not as easy to do as in df
P3:45:05 <akuryo> i presume
P3:45:16 <wingboy> all over blocks would have to be halved to
P3:45:20 <wingboy> since water floods
P3:45:25 <vdgmprgrmr> The only problem is the blocks that would end up floating on top of all the others.
P3:45:27 <wingboy> so the level size would be doubled
P3:45:37 <akuryo> yeah
P3:45:41 <akuryo> nvm about level water
P3:45:43 <akuryo> just make it move
P3:45:45 <akuryo> not duplicate
P3:45:50 <wingboy> finite water
P3:45:56 <akuryo> and can you change the size of brush to put and remove cubes
P3:46:16 <akuryo> yeah
P3:46:20 <akuryo> this would be cool too
P3:46:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Wingboy, no, you wouldn't have to change the other blocks.
P3:46:24 <wingboy> makes stuff to easy
P3:46:33 <wingboy> you would vdgm
P3:46:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Why do you say that?
P3:46:38 <wingboy> say you dig out a channel
P3:46:39 <akuryo> vdgm?
P3:46:48 <wingboy> its will be 1 block
13P3:46:58 * doohan digs out #minecraft
P3:46:59 <wingboy> if you flood it with water it wont be half
P3:47:01 <doohan> badum tsch!
P3:47:04 <wingboy> since you cant stop the toop half
P3:47:11 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
P3:47:26 <wingboy> water will stay as 1 block
P3:47:33 <wingboy> but you want it say to be half
P3:47:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Not necessarily.
P3:47:40 <wingboy> if i t floods a 1 block channel
P3:47:45 <wingboy> then it wont be half
P3:47:48 <wingboy> it will fill
P3:47:55 <akuryo> 1 stone 2 earth with grass 
P3:47:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Say I have a cup that's 3 blocks tall.
10P3:47:59 * C418 is now known as Ph418
P3:47:59 <akuryo> 3 grass
P3:48:01 <akuryo> ...etc
P3:48:07 <akuryo> what i learnt from memory hacking
P3:48:16 <vdgmprgrmr> And inside that cup is water 2.5 blocks deep.
P3:48:17 <akuryo> oh and notch
P3:48:19 <akuryo> notch
P3:48:23 <akuryo> make jump higher
P3:48:26 <akuryo> so you can jump two cubes
P3:48:29 <akuryo> not only one
P3:48:31 <akuryo> =(
P3:48:32 <doohan> Notch, are you about
P3:48:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I dig a one-block channel away from the cup, the water can be half a block tall down the channel just fine.
P3:48:44 <vdgmprgrmr> No need for halving other blocks.
P3:48:52 <akuryo> not need to halve
P3:48:54 <akuryo> forget it
P3:48:56 <wingboy> the 1 block channel is 1 block tall
P3:48:58 <akuryo> moving water first =D
P3:49:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I realize that.
P3:49:09 <wingboy> when wwater floods it it will fill up to 1 block
P3:49:14 <wingboy> not half
P3:49:14 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it won't.
P3:49:25 <vdgmprgrmr> What could possibly make you think that?
P3:49:26 <wingboy> because water floods all possible space
P3:49:34 <vdgmprgrmr> You realize that there's not blocks in a channel, right?
P3:49:39 <wingboy> yes
P3:49:42 <vdgmprgrmr> It's just empty space.
P3:49:49 <wingboy> yes
P3:50:02 <vdgmprgrmr> So we don't need to halve anything.
P3:50:20 <Syniphas> hey there vdgmprgrmr
P3:50:20 <wingboy> you would need the exact amount of water to get it to fill half
P3:50:27 <wingboy> or it would just fill up completly
P3:50:43 <vdgmprgrmr> What could possibly have led you to that conclusion?
P3:50:48 <Syniphas> where's pyl
P3:50:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Pyl is somewhere.
P3:50:56 <wingboy> because the water level is still going to stack right?
P3:51:09 <vdgmprgrmr> What do you mean the water level stacks?
P3:51:23 <wingboy> say i carve 1 block
P3:51:29 <wingboy> if i fill that with water its full
P3:51:39 <wingboy> if i carve the block next to it the water is halfed
P3:51:40 <Deiz> Notch: Are you doing to drop keyboard focus when esc is hit, or make the menu keyboard navigable?
P3:51:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay.
P3:51:55 <Ph418> that is a question of polish
P3:51:56 <Notch> i'm not sure, deiz, haven't thought about it
P3:51:58 <Notch> one of them
P3:52:05 <wingboy> if i put more water into that it would fill up
P3:52:19 <wingboy> not stay half
P3:52:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Not seeing why we need to halve any blocks other than water, here.
P3:53:39 <Notch> stairs! :D
P3:53:47 <Ph418> one month of development
P3:53:50 <Ph418> it's really scary
P3:53:57 <Ph418> suddenly everyone talks about it
P3:54:55 <akuryo> notch
P3:54:58 <akuryo> Notch
P3:55:02 <akuryo> you are sick
P3:55:09 <akuryo> you got the commercial sickness
P3:55:15 <akuryo> you saw too many people play your game
P3:55:16 <Notch> lol
P3:55:19 <Ph418> thats not what I meant
P3:55:23 <Ph418> but continue
P3:55:25 <akuryo> this is why i do
P3:55:27 <akuryo> what*
P3:55:29 <akuryo> really
P3:55:31 <akuryo> make it free
P3:55:35 <akuryo> lots of people will come
P3:55:36 <akuryo> donation too
P3:55:39 <akuryo> i'll donate
11P3:55:41 <DBN> minecraft needs a server admin command to delete all water
P3:55:41 <akuryo> i promise
P3:55:53 <akuryo> but make it stay free
P3:55:55 <akuryo> really
P3:55:57 <Notch> i don't like begware
P3:56:03 <akuryo> begware?
P3:56:08 <akuryo> so remove donation...
P3:56:10 <vdgmprgrmr> That's a nice term...
P3:56:10 <akuryo> freeware is ok
P3:56:16 <akuryo> not at all
P3:56:20 <akuryo> this is not a beg work
P3:56:25 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't see the problem with Notch charging for his game.
P3:56:28 <Ph418> but no money is boring. capitalistic world!
P3:56:41 <akuryo> anyway i'll pay with hacked credit card so i don't care
P3:56:43 <Ph418> I want money too! but I... think... I have to earn it myself
P3:56:47 <akuryo> i do this for the image you give of yourself
P3:57:04 <akuryo> and for all players like me
P3:57:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I think you might be the only one seeing that image...
P3:57:18 <akuryo> no
P3:57:21 <akuryo> looool no
P3:57:23 <akuryo> i was on a server
P3:57:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Or at least one of very few.
P3:57:28 <akuryo> there was like 15 guys
P3:57:30 <akuryo> talking about notch
P3:57:34 <akuryo> saying...
P3:57:37 <akuryo> not good of him
10P3:57:38 * Wootsicle (quadmarine@ip72-221-124-96.ri.ri.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
P3:57:39 <akuryo> really
P3:57:43 <Wootsicle> Question
P3:57:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay.
P3:57:53 <Deiz> Talk's cheap.
P3:57:53 <akuryo> and this is verywhere
P3:57:56 <Deiz> vdgmprgrmr is an idiot
P3:58:00 <Deiz> Does that make him an idiot?
P3:58:01 <wingboy> i got like 16 people on my server ill ask how many people will be buying it
P3:58:01 <Wootsicle> Are there plans to enable single player maps to be hosted on servers?
P3:58:02 <Deiz> I think not.
P3:58:03 <Notch> lol
P3:58:15 <Wootsicle> Notch
P3:58:27 <Notch> Wootsicle: Yes! =D
P3:58:32 <Wootsicle> Any time soon?
P3:58:35 <Wootsicle> This would be amazing
P3:58:36 <vdgmprgrmr> If they're talking crap about Notch because he would like to make a bit of money from all the work he's done, then they're dicks.
P3:58:36 <Wootsicle> :D
P3:58:37 <Notch> well, perhaps
P3:58:57 <vdgmprgrmr> And what was that all for, Deiz?
P3:59:02 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: To be fair, I can be.. uhm.. let's call it stubborn.
P3:59:03 <Parthon> I'm not going to buy it .. it should be free .. software wants to be free! No money for Notch!!!
P3:59:04 <Wootsicle> What method are you going to use? Are you going to allow us to download our maps as files?
P3:59:11 <Notch> so I've probably upset a few people over the years
P3:59:18 <Parthon> (jk btw :P)
P3:59:20 <wingboy> 2 people said they would buy
P3:59:22 <wingboy> the rest said no
P3:59:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Only two, wingboy?
P3:59:34 <wingboy> ye lol
P3:59:36 <doohan> Ahhh notch!
P3:59:39 <akuryo> notch
P3:59:42 <akuryo> make it free
P3:59:43 <Notch> out of 16? That's apretty nice conversion rate
P3:59:45 <akuryo> more people will play
P3:59:47 <doohan> You know all the griefers you get?
P3:59:56 <Notch> yes, doohan?
P3:59:57 <wingboy> notch should make peopl pay
P3:59:58 <doohan> What would you say about a player ranking system?
P4:00:09 <doohan> So people that are greifers can be voted down
P4:00:17 <Notch> I say it can be abused. :-\
P4:00:18 <wingboy> it would be abused
P4:00:18 <doohan> Or something that counts how many kick bans a player has?
P4:00:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Doohan, player ranking is bad.
P4:00:21 <Ph418> well, the good thing is, the soundtrack will be probably free because I have no idea how to sell it
P4:00:26 <doohan> What about kick ban counting?
P4:00:26 <Parthon> it would be abused, unless it was secure
P4:00:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Because logical people who try to stop griefing and preserve order tend to get bashed on a lot.
P4:00:40 <wingboy> get notch to give you some of his profits :P
P4:00:43 <doohan> So if you have 10 kick bans you are labeled a tit.
P4:00:47 <akuryo> lol
P4:00:49 <Ph418> ah, I'm not a dick
P4:01:07 <akuryo> yuou can always make a new account
P4:01:17 <wingboy> are the sounds the same on that video that was made?
P4:01:19 <doohan> Yeah but it'll happen again after a few kick bans
P4:01:22 <Deiz> Notch: What do you think of modelling pressure to some extent, instead of allowing water and lava to always spread horizontally without losing height?
P4:01:31 <doohan> Making new email accounts all hte time to greif will get old.
P4:01:36 <Parthon> he's thought about it
10P4:01:36 * matias (matias@cnpcnova11.uio.no) has joined #minecraft
P4:01:51 <Ph418> yeah, the game will probably sound like that
P4:02:02 <Notch> Ph418: I'm not a dick either. =) We should discuss details very closely before I put anything in the game, though
P4:02:07 <doohan> And other server operators will know a tit when they join
P4:02:20 <doohan> Rather than sometime after they've flooded everything
P4:02:23 <wingboy> you dont have that stupid sound when removing blocks though?
P4:02:27 <Notch> Deiz: I decided against water pressure for a bunch of reasons (two).
P4:02:30 <wingboy> that will annoy the hell out of me
P4:02:37 <wingboy> other sounds are great though
P4:02:44 <Wootsicle> Maybe you could add an OP command to pause water flowing
P4:02:48 <Super-Dot> Notch: I've been thinking about the trees
P4:02:50 <Wootsicle> and resume when they want
P4:02:55 <Ph418> you mean the pitching?
P4:02:59 <Wootsicle> I think that would work well
P4:03:03 <wingboy> whenever a blocks removed
P4:03:07 <Super-Dot> When you climb trees, it doesn't feel like you're climbing a tree
P4:03:08 <wingboy> i just hate that sound
P4:03:10 <Ph418> I thought of various ways to make the destruction and adding sound less annoying
P4:03:18 <Super-Dot> And I think that's because there aren't any branches
P4:03:21 <Ph418> I think it will make you not noticing it anymore
P4:03:25 <wingboy> or make an potion to have it enabled or not
P4:03:30 <wingboy> option*
P4:03:41 <wingboy> problem solved both ways
P4:03:46 <Super-Dot> So I mocked up a branchy tree thing
P4:03:47 <Super-Dot> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=SuperDot&id=0
P4:04:00 <Super-Dot> It's about the same size as current trees

P4:04:09 <Parthon> Notch: too much CPU and hard to render?
P4:04:18 <Super-Dot> The branches-only version is on the left, branches and leaves on the right
P4:04:44 <akuryo> leaves are good but
P4:04:52 <Notch> no. 1) It's complex (both to develop and to understand ingame). 2) It disallows air pockets in pools
P4:04:55 <akuryo> you should get through them
P4:05:11 <Notch> that's pretty neat, Super-Dot
P4:05:19 <Parthon> aaah .. cool
P4:05:25 <Super-Dot> The branches-only version feels a lot more like a tree than do the current trees
P4:05:25 <sppt> yum.. kwak bier :D
P4:05:28 <Super-Dot> When you climb it
P4:05:29 <Parthon> I'm doing air pressure too, so fun :D
P4:05:31 <akuryo> i afree
11P4:05:37 <DBN> it'd be nice if a single drop of water wasn't able to flood an entire cave
P4:05:44 <akuryo> yeah
P4:05:45 <akuryo> water move
P4:05:47 <akuryo> not duplicate
P4:05:51 <wingboy> again with the infinite water :D
P4:05:52 <akuryo> when will this be out?
P4:05:54 <akuryo> can i help?
P4:05:56 <Notch> agreed, DBN
P4:05:58 <Super-Dot> And the tree branches can be generated pretty easily
P4:06:04 <Wootsicle> Notch, add an invisible/glass block :D
P4:06:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Or both.
P4:06:13 <akuryo> clip
P4:06:16 <akuryo> and noclip
P4:06:17 <Wootsicle> I would make underwater tunnels of happiness
P4:06:20 <wingboy> notch is like god in our small minecraft world
P4:06:25 <vdgmprgrmr> noclip isn't necessary.
P4:06:29 <Parthon> even if you could turn water to ice, then remove it all, that would be fine
P4:06:31 <akuryo> its fun
P4:06:32 <wingboy> asketh and thou shall recieve
P4:06:39 <Super-Dot> It would work best if you could walk through leaves
P4:06:41 <Parthon> it's not the way the water moves, it's that it's so hard to work with
11P4:06:42 <DBN> +1 to glass block
P4:06:48 <akuryo> +1
P4:06:52 <Super-Dot> Since when you climb a tree IRL, you climb the branches, not the leaves
P4:06:59 <akuryo> lol
P4:07:01 <akuryo> yeah
P4:07:27 <Parthon> would leaves then be a crumble block?
P4:07:32 <akuryo> yeah
P4:07:33 <Wootsicle> This isn't real life, this is Minecraft
P4:07:34 <Wootsicle> xD
P4:07:35 <akuryo> like the plant
P4:07:44 <wingboy> my server still hasnt been griefed :D
P4:07:46 <Parthon> this .. is .. minecraft!
P4:07:46 <Super-Dot> Not crumble, it would just float there
P4:07:51 <wingboy> and 5 more people to be most populated
P4:07:51 <akuryo> griefed?
P4:07:53 <akuryo> what that mean
P4:07:56 <Deiz> Notch: Do you have either a list of features you want to implement soon, or a general design document?
P4:07:58 <Ph418> messed up
P4:07:58 <Super-Dot> Or maybe crumble if it's not touching a wood block
P4:07:59 <wingboy> people flooding etc
P4:08:11 <akuryo> ah
P4:08:11 <akuryo> yeah

P4:08:33 <Ph418> oof, my pc is being slow
P4:08:35 <Notch> there is no design document

P4:08:49 <Notch> there's a goal and a few "visions"
P4:08:57 <Notch> but the only important thing is to keep it FUN
P4:09:03 <Wootsicle> Glass blocks are fun ^_^
P4:09:04 <Notch> everything else is secondary
P4:09:07 <Notch> yes, they are. =)
P4:09:15 <Wootsicle> So are pitfall blocks
P4:09:23 <Wootsicle> Ahaha, ohh, that'd be hilarious
P4:09:33 <Wootsicle> It'd be like Animal Crossing in Multiplayer

P4:11:50 <Parthon> I think it might be harder to chunk
P4:12:15 <Notch> it works ok for me, even on 32 player multiplayer creative mode with water flooding
P4:12:20 <Notch> well, fps goes down a bit with large floods. ;)
P4:12:25 <Parthon> yah :P
P4:12:29 <Notch> but it WORKS, amazingly
P4:12:31 <Parthon> how bigs a chunk size?
P4:12:33 <doohan> Notch what do you think of at least labeling bad players?
P4:12:38 <Notch> 16^3 at the moment, i think
P4:12:44 <doohan> For a temporary period?
P4:12:48 <Notch> doohan: I don't like the idea of player ranking..
P4:12:52 <doohan> NOt ranking
P4:12:53 <Parthon> nice

P4:12:59 <Deiz> Labelling's worthless right now due to the ease of creating accounts.

P4:13:17 <akuryo> yeah
P4:13:26 <akuryo> avol
P4:13:28 <akuryo> your question?
P4:13:33 <Parthon> hehe .. I was thinking "the map changes too fast, I may as well keep the buffer"
P4:13:35 <Awol10> I figured out the server_level spec to a point. I manage to find all the blocks and block types. I'm assuming your are using a 3d array in code is that correct?

P4:13:59 <akuryo> hexa
P4:14:01 <akuryo> every cube
P4:14:03 <Parthon> but creating a list from a buffer won't take much longer
P4:14:08 <akuryo> is situaded in 10000 hexa memory block under
P4:14:09 <Notch> Parthon: For 64*64, you can probably keep the list
P4:14:19 <Awol10> ok in java when you make an array what size are the array size variables? Do you know?
P4:14:35 <Parthon> yeah, then I'd have to upkeep the list though :S
P4:14:36 <Notch> Lukeybatman: Kinda, yes. Working on some paypal nonsense
P4:14:37 <akuryo> take a cube
P4:14:43 <akuryo> if it's place is 2A854AD
P4:14:43 <Parthon> or regenerate every frame
P4:14:47 <Parthon> I'm better off chunking it
P4:14:50 <Lukeybatman> Notch, I would like you to look at some minigames that my "Company" made for Minecraft.
P4:14:53 <akuryo> then the cube under will be 2A754AD
P4:15:27 <Notch> Awol10: The server_level.dat is a gzipped java objectoutputstream
P4:15:41 <Notch> it contains a byte[], some start location data, and a List<Entity>
P4:15:53 <Deiz> Notch: Mind explaining your method of enforcing IP bans? I was banned on connecting to a server the other day, and now despite a SOCKS proxy into another system with a different account, the ban's still in effect. Does the client phone home to the master server to verify 'true' IP?

P4:17:19 <Lukeybatman> ... We created a different thing, its a challenge thing. Pyl and myself like it better

P4:17:56 <Notch> Awol10: haha, I know the feeling. =)
P4:18:04 <Awol10> just trying to figure out if should be looking for an integer or a short for the map size

P4:25:21 <Notch> Deiz: Good question.. What do you prefer?
P4:25:43 <Deiz> I'm a fan of the former, but then again I'm also not one to mind the occasional bug.
P4:26:00 <wingboy> give bets to the people who pay

P4:27:03 <Notch> yeah
P4:27:25 <wingboy> people who pay should be allowed betas and testing while everyone else has to waits til its stable

P4:31:43 <Lukeybatman> Joat!
P4:31:52 <Deiz> Sure you can.
P4:32:04 <Deiz> If they can't, they've misconfigured their network.
P4:32:07 <Joat> Esper.net seems to be a popular server nowadays. Maybe I should have put my chat on this server too.
P4:32:20 <Awol10> if you can't connect to your own external IP you have some routing issues to fix
P4:32:41 <Notch> 309 players online :-O
P4:32:51 <Joat> That is to say, not two chatrooms on two servers, but... Gah, never mind.
P4:32:55 <Joat> I'm rambling.
P4:33:03 <Joat> And you're Lukey.
P4:33:07 <Lukeybatman> Notch, of course there will be that many. This game is awesome. How long would coloured blocks take?
P4:33:15 <Super-Dot> Minecraft loads a lot more reliably for me now
11P4:33:16 <DBN> Awol10 do you actually know about this or are you just guessing
P4:33:45 <Notch> Lukeybatman: This weekend, probably
P4:33:46 <Awol10> about routing? I know it. 
P4:33:47 <Super-Dot> Good job on that, Notch d(â¢_â¢)b
P4:33:56 <Notch> :D
P4:34:05 <Awol10> when you ping an ip is needs to go someplace
P4:34:08 <Lukeybatman> Great Notch! Cam
11P4:34:10 <DBN> i've read that some routers are simply incapable of doing it

P4:34:24 <Gauphastus> Hellote.
P4:34:26 <Awol10> if your computer can't go to a live place then something is wrong doesn't matter if its your own address
P4:34:36 <Lukeybatman> There's been a discussion on the server I've gone on about op-only indistructo blocks.
P4:34:40 <Lmaoboat> Is it possible to make water not floow if not connected  to a source block?
P4:34:41 <Awol10> then those routers are broken and should be replaced
11P4:35:00 <DBN> yea, the routers should be fixed, not minecraft
P4:35:03 <Lmaoboat> So you can unflood by simply resealing the wall?
P4:35:04 <wingboy> my server is building a giant sand wall, they a re 50% done
P4:35:06 <Joat> I suppose it makes sense it would be that quick to make colored blocks. Adding CONTENT is probably much easier than modifying the engine.
P4:35:19 <Joat> By the way, I have a suggestion: A compass.
P4:35:32 <wingboy> and a indicator to which z level you are on
P4:35:34 <Awol10> yes a compass would be great!
P4:35:36 <Gauphastus> Yes, my people are clamoring for a compass.
P4:35:44 <Joat> Simple, yet it would be very helpful. Especially if someone needs to use less-than-satisfactory rendering distance.
P4:35:46 <Gauphastus> When they give directions, it's always so confused.
P4:35:53 <ZomBuster> just build giant letters on each direction
P4:36:00 <Awol10> a admin command to teleport to player would be nice too

P4:36:08 <Deiz> Notch: To get back to what I think about pressure, I think it shouldn't allow water to flow up (into air pockets), but stop it from expanding horizontally above the ground. Assuming infinite water, if you have a two-block-wide waterfall, with a pit next to it with a 'drain' block, the water would flow down the side of the pit, hit the bottom, and start filling from there.
P4:36:10 <Joat> Maybe even coordinates.
11P4:36:12 <DBN> i had to disable name verification so i could connect to the server on my LAN
P4:36:23 <Deiz> As opposed to expanding horizontally and hitting the far side before it hits the bottom.
P4:36:48 <Joat> Yes, coordinates would also do well.
P4:37:16 <wingboy> i like the idea of a drain block, it should come in different colours so if somone floods the tunnel nothing will happen :D
P4:37:33 <ZomBuster> yeh I though about that too
P4:37:51 <ZomBuster> but an entire tunnel made of drain would be boring
P4:37:53 <Awol10> or a sponge block it would suck up a layer of water :)
P4:37:55 <wingboy> finite water would be needed first though
P4:38:03 <Lmaoboat> We lost a lot of good mobs to flooding today
P4:38:06 <Lukeybatman> Notch: I don't surpose you would mind if we continued to make these "minigames"?
P4:38:13 <Notch> not at all, Lukeybatman =)
P4:38:18 <ZomBuster> minigames?
P4:38:37 <Joat> Aye.
P4:38:43 <Joat> Link, link...
P4:38:48 <Joat> Or Zelda.
P4:38:57 <Notch> BADUM TISH
P4:39:11 <Joat> http://www.vonent.com/games/mc.htm
P4:39:16 <Lmaoboat> Notch, have you tried making it so water only fills an area if connected to athe source?
P4:39:43 <Deiz> Determining the 'source' would be difficult, I think.
P4:39:46 <Notch> no, I haven't.
P4:39:50 <Notch> and yeah, what Deiz said
P4:40:14 <Joat> We need to have the link the MC Party in a public area. Heck, even on our (Colain and I) site it's not shown publically yet.
P4:40:46 <Joat> We need to fix that. A link on the Minecraft site or blog would also be appreciated, but I know the chances are low that such would happen...
P4:41:00 <Joat> Especially at this early development phase.
P4:41:02 <Gauphastus> Why not ask for some solutions to the fluid issue on TIG or even Bay12?
P4:41:34 <Joat> I wonder... While the water spreads, maybe the water level (the depth of the water within the tile space) could lower.
P4:41:48 <Joat> That would require a depth variable in each tile, though.
P4:42:08 <Deiz> Joat: Finite water would bring that along.
10P4:42:28 * Awol10 (Awol@206.173.165.111) has left #minecraft
P4:42:36 <Joat> Yes, a sort of water distribution...
P4:42:55 <Deiz> I think having semi-realistic flow would be cool.
P4:43:07 <Deiz> Accidentally hit a small reservoir, it drains into the cave
P4:43:14 <Joat> Hey, I just thought of something! Treasure hunt mode! Where treasures are hidden in the world and a sort of warmer-colder system is used to find them.
P4:43:14 <Deiz> And meanders its way down  to the lowest point
P4:44:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Joat, that is an awesome idea.
P4:45:15 <Lmaoboat> That's infinininer
P4:45:30 <Lmaoboat> bleh
P4:45:30 <Lukeybatman> I like it too Joat.

P4:48:08 <Joat> By the way... That brown stuff, that IS ore, right?
P4:48:25 <Lukeybatman> No, its crap, totally.
P4:49:00 <Joat> It's a floorwax and a dessert topping.
11P4:49:27 <DBN> perhaps check if a body of water is connected to the edges of the map which generate water. if so, it acts in the old way. otherwise it cannot duplicate, only move downward
P4:49:35 <Deiz> Notch: I was also thinking about light propagation, you could have ten light levels, and non-illuminated tiles would have the light of the surrounding tile -1, such that the mouth of a cave would gradually dim. Deep tunnels would be nearly pitch black, and there'd be a lamp material.
P4:50:15 <Notch> hmm
P4:50:19 <Joat> Ooh, another idea! Maybe you can have weather and times of day, where the sky changes and maybe things fall from the sky. Rain, snow, sleet, domesticated animals...
P4:50:31 <Joat> AKA cats and dogs.
P4:50:42 <Deiz> Speaking of falling, sand/gravel should actually fall
P4:50:44 <Notch> when a tile gets lit, it'd check all neighboring tiles then.. and then those in turn could check their neibors if they changed
P4:50:56 <Deiz> Yeah.
P4:51:02 <Notch> could work very well!
P4:51:35 <Notch> it could also get very slow. ;)
P4:51:42 <Notch> 10 levels deep 3d fill is.. a lot
P4:51:57 <Deiz> So knock it down to 5 or something
P4:51:58 <Notch> that's for each tile that lights up when you remove a ceiling
P4:52:01 <Deiz> Or 3
P4:52:11 <Notch> 3 would probably work
P4:52:23 <Notch> great suggestion, deiz. =)
10P4:52:39 * wingboy (wingfag@cpc1-ashf1-0-0-cust236.asfd.cable.ntl.com) has joined #minecraft
P4:53:08 <Notch> hmm, it could still be fairly expensive, especially at level load
P4:53:10 <Joat> And the weather and times of day? Would that work well?
P4:53:18 <Lukeybatman> Come-on guys, lets not swamp him with suggestions.
P4:53:30 <Notch> it could definitely work well, Joat.
P4:53:43 <Lukeybatman> Not all at once, I mean.
P4:53:46 <Joat> I doubt he minds the swamp of suggestions.
P4:54:02 <Deiz> Notch: You could calculate it for the surface only on load.
P4:54:19 <Deiz> Which would be light work, since most of the surface is illuminated.
P4:54:41 <Joat> I wonder if some sort of adventure mode could work somehow. That's a bit iffy, though. It could compromise the feel of the game if done wrong.
11P4:55:05 <DBN> what do you think about my water suggestion
P4:55:11 <Notch> not true! If there's a deep shaft, I have to check for gaps into the sides of the shaft
P4:55:22 <Deiz> Ah, yes.
P4:55:43 <Notch> and I have to do that every time a ceiling tile gets added or removed, heh
P4:55:52 <Notch> but I think it could work
P4:55:57 <Notch> it'd also give free "shadows"
P4:56:05 <Notch> well, light would bend around corners
P4:56:09 <Notch> but it wouldn't pass through walls
P4:56:27 <Lukeybatman> Notch, for Pyl's server, he created a !save, !load and !new function which allows us to save and load more then one map. I think you should talk to Pyl about it.
P4:56:39 <Joat> If you're going to do the thing with more detailed shadows, you might put an off switch on that feature.
P4:56:43 <Notch> awesome, Lukeybatman =D
P4:57:03 <Deiz> Corner spill is fine, I think.

P5:01:08 <Gauphastus> :D
P5:01:11 <Gauphastus> 4:1D
P5:01:15 <Joat> You already have nine blocks for nine keys. You have the 0 key... Where do you go from there, hm?
P5:01:22 <Misterangry> 13lol
P5:01:23 <Joat> What will be the shortcut keys?
P5:01:32 <Deiz> Ctrl, Mod, Shift + Numbers
P5:01:39 <Joat> That could do.
P5:01:40 <Misterangry> 13those using NNS, and the default theme will not see this
P5:01:48 <Deiz> That said, I think standalone coloured blocks are bad
P5:01:50 <Gauphastus> I was thinking of some interface expansion thing.
P5:01:54 <C418> stop this color crap
P5:02:05 <Deiz> If you must have colour, it'd be a 'paint' system
P5:02:09 <Lukeybatman> I love the lecture by steven hawking: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AG5RPOCjA Take a look!
P5:02:11 <Deiz> You'd be able to tint a block any colour
P5:02:14 <Lukeybatman> Its awesome...
P5:03:02 <sppt> Misterangry, we need to play l4d still
P5:03:03 <sppt> lool
P5:03:07 <Deiz> And tinting wouldn't require extra materials, nor extra textures
P5:03:16 <Syniphas> something I wonder is how I got banned fro a single line of colored message
P5:03:23 <Syniphas> and now there are colors everywhere
P5:03:29 <Joat> Thought it would make the save files larger.
P5:03:37 <Joat> Colors are disallowed?
P5:03:54 <Misterangry> lol
P5:04:06 <Syniphas> From my ban, I would say yes.
P5:04:31 <Joat> {Draco: And the one thing that makes my text stand out...}
P5:04:34 <Deiz> Joat: Eh, save files only become an issue when they grow by orders of magnitude.
P5:04:56 <Deiz> Adding half a dozen materials and adding a colour bit to each block might increase size by a good bit, though.
P5:05:36 <Lukeybatman> I think mine is fine now...
P5:05:39 <Lukeybatman> There we go.
P5:05:47 <Notch> Deiz: It's mp as well!
P5:06:07 <Joat> Oh! When generating a new map, maybe the player should be able to decide on a type of world to make.
P5:06:08 <Lukeybatman> I want Pyl to come on. *Sigh* Also, I am curious, whats survival mode going to be like?
P5:06:09 <C418> ah

P5:09:46 <Deiz> Notch: I'd like more powerful editing tools; bulk select, copy, delete, rotate, flip. But I think they might go against the spirit of the game.
P5:09:47 <C418> I was talking about the sound mockup video
P5:10:06 <C418> the more complexity you add, the more you get an rpg mod for garrys mod
P5:10:10 <C418> and thats awful
P5:10:19 <Deiz> OTOH, the ability to replace blocks in-place would be useful, and not terribly advanced

P5:33:33 <Deiz> The router maintains the connection, and is usually used as the default gateway for all systems behind it
P5:34:07 <Deiz> With DSL it's fairly easy to get one IP per machine, but most people do use their router for authentication
P5:34:16 <sppt> even with ADSL?
P5:34:22 <fivedollar> i'll be back if i cant find a good answer ;)
P5:34:36 <Deiz> Yeah, I have four systems, with a unique IP each.
P5:34:47 <sppt> how o.o
P5:34:55 <sppt> my isp has only given me a single static ip address
P5:34:58 <wingboy> someone posted solution in forums i think fivedolllar
P5:35:01 <Deiz> Ah, so.
P5:35:20 <Deiz> My ISP assigns me a new dynamic IP every time I bring the PPPoE link up.
P5:35:27 <wingboy> w00t i has the most popular server now :D
P5:35:33 <Deiz> And lets me have as many concurrent links as I want.
P5:35:34 <wingboy> i feel proud
P5:36:15 <sppt> ah, i've got PPPoA
P5:36:49 <sppt> i'm trying to get around an undeserved ip ban in a certain java game... proxies dont even work even though they should >_<
P5:37:07 <Deiz> You need a VPN.
P5:37:13 <sppt> and then ssh tunnel?
P5:37:17 <sppt> been there, done that
P5:37:19 <sppt> didnt work
P5:37:30 <Deiz> Not just for the browser, though.
P5:37:37 <Deiz> Java's connecting on a different port.
P5:37:43 <sppt> ah well, i've contacted the dev, he said they're discussing lifting the ip ban
P5:37:50 <sppt> Deiz, i had it set up thru the java cp
P5:37:55 <Deiz> Odd.
P5:38:15 <sppt> indeed
P5:38:21 <sppt> unless they found a way around the proxy
P5:38:25 <sppt> which i find unlikely
P5:38:41 <sppt> i know who might be able to help, but i dont think he will
P5:38:47 <Deiz> Well, it's kind of hard to tell without a TCP dump
P5:39:09 <Deiz> But a number of sites (Hulu, etc) will contact you on various ports to verify location
P5:39:23 <Deiz> So the only surefire way to sneak in is with an all-encompassing VPN.
P5:39:35 <Deiz> I'm also a fan of using my neighbour's WEP-"secured" WLAN.
P5:39:40 <sppt> lol
P5:39:53 <sppt> havent got a wlan card/dongle though ;)
P5:40:06 <sppt> and i think pretty much every wlan net here is secured
P5:40:28 <sppt> i tried it on my wii in dec 06, there were some APs, but they were all secured
P5:40:44 <Deiz> WEP vs WPA is critical, though.
P5:40:49 <Deiz> WEP can be cracked in seconds.
P5:42:35 <Deiz> Notch: Here's an idea
P5:42:51 <Deiz> For votekicking, allow multiple users per IP to vote
P5:42:58 <Deiz> But only count the first vote.
P5:43:15 <Deiz> And don't include the others in the average for the total
P5:44:16 <wingboy> admining servers is hard
P5:44:32 <wingboy> its like looking after primary school children
P5:44:37 <Syniphas> yep
P5:44:41 <wingboy> except their not children and they are monkeys with bricks
P5:45:32 <Deiz> They are children, mostly.
P5:45:38 <Deiz> Children with fetal alcohol syndrome.
P5:46:30 <wingboy> they finished the giant sand wall
P5:46:38 <Deiz> wingboy: Which server is yours?
P5:46:42 <wingboy> now the whole flatgrass map has the tallest wall
P5:46:46 <wingboy> facepunch unofficial 2
P5:47:05 <wingboy> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=b6028de8240d11a1cf81f426521bd85c
P5:47:51 <Joat> Ooh! Passwords for servers.
P5:48:17 <wingboy> i just stand here and ban any griefers
11P5:48:29 <DBN> yea passwords would be good
P5:48:53 <wingboy> server started great but a few griefers came in
P5:49:13 <Deiz> Joat: Among other things, yes.
P5:49:23 <Deiz> Minecraft sucks from an admin standpoint at the moment
P5:49:32 <wingboy> yes totally
P5:49:36 <paul|not> yeah
P5:49:41 <paul|not> keeping them private helps

P5:49:54 <wingboy> i like mine public so normal people can play
P5:50:04 <wingboy> insted of people off the forum
11P5:50:13 <DBN> it has no security at all
P5:50:26 <Deiz> Minecraft should ideally be able to change maps, set password, set private/public without restarting.
P5:50:45 <wingboy> bleh its getting late now, people are leaving
P5:50:56 <Deiz> Also, it's been my experience that IRC plugins are useful for game server administration
P5:51:20 <Deiz> Which would actually be quite simple, since Minecraft likes writing things to text files
11P5:51:20 <DBN> a friend of mine made a packet spoofing app that wipes out the entire map

P5:51:46 <doohan> I still thinking ig you get kicked n time you should be labeled
P5:51:52 <Deiz> DBN: That's far too easy because the server is overly trusting.
11P5:52:00 <DBN> yes
P5:52:03 <Deiz> Ideally it'd do a sanity check, "Can he do that from where he is?"
11P5:52:18 <DBN> it kicks players if they change a block too far away
P5:52:22 <doohan> if*
11P5:52:34 <DBN> but if the client ignores the kick packet then the connection isn't closed
P5:52:38 <peerkoel> you could just cron cp the server_level.dat to backups
P5:53:00 <Deiz> peerkoel: And, at present, disconnect everyone if you need to load it at some point
P5:53:26 <peerkoel> sure but everyone who's playing can hit F5, right?
P5:53:49 <Deiz> I suppose.
P5:53:52 <Deiz> I suspect good admin functionality will come in time
P5:54:03 <peerkoel> I was just going to say ... :)
P5:54:07 <Deiz> Given that multiplayer is  nearly the same as singleplayer right now
P5:54:08 <peerkoel> alpha and all

P8:07:01 <dropshock> I just think its over priced :/
P8:07:08 <wingboy> mow a lawn

P8:07:53 <wingboy> ill probaly buy it tommorow

P8:07:57 <wingboy> its 2 am here
P8:08:02 <Imapanda> 15$ approx.

P8:10:11 <vdgmprgrmr> 30 USD?
P8:10:20 <dropshock> i used a converter
P8:10:22 <vdgmprgrmr> How the hell did you come to that number?
P8:10:24 <dropshock> thats what it says :o
P8:10:24 <david21> told you guys from day one HE WILL OVER PRICE IT
P8:10:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Right now it's exactl 12.48 USD.

P8:11:05 <dropshock> well as i said
P8:11:10 <david21> CAN ANY ONE HOST A SERVER FOR ME
P8:11:12 <AlMightyBob> that seems perfectly reasonable to me
P8:11:13 <dropshock> the converter im using must be messd up :o
P8:11:19 <Deiz> Er, no
P8:11:22 <david21> IL GIVE YOU THE MAP THAT I WANT YOU TO HOST
P8:11:29 <Deiz> 9.95 Eur = $13.94 USD
P8:11:31 <david21> ITS GOT A CERTEN flat like QUALTY TO IT
P8:11:35 <vdgmprgrmr> David, SHUT UP
P8:11:42 <Deiz> According to XE, which tends to be the most accurate
P8:11:42 <dropshock> actaully im talking about when the pre ordering is over
P8:11:57 <Deiz> 20 Eur = $28.03
P8:11:57 <dropshock> 20 uro = almost 30 usd
P8:12:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I used Google, so I dunno which might be right.
P8:12:02 <Deiz> Which isn't cheap, no.
P8:12:03 <dropshock> exactly
P8:12:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I'd be perfectly willing to pay 30 USD for MC.
P8:12:34 <dropshock> well im abit short on cash lately
P8:12:44 <dropshock> i dont have that kind of money for a game
P8:12:48 <vdgmprgrmr> So am I but that's not quite enough for me to stay away from it.
P8:13:07 <dropshock> yeah im so addicted to minecraft too :c
P8:14:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, if we get zombie siege, random dungeons, and the classic FPS competitive modes like Notch says, then I don't know how big a number would be too much, but it's pretty damn high.
P8:14:28 <C418> what you have now will always stay free. nobody is going to throw a price tag over it. everything else that will be added, that could cost maybe
P8:14:29 <vdgmprgrmr> (And you do hope to have more classic FPS modes that CTF, right Notch?)

P8:18:19 <C418> that is only logical and should be used

P8:24:34 <vdgmprgrmr> My dad thinks the game is cheesy, refuses to provide me with funding.
P8:24:34 <Notch> agreed, Deiz
P8:24:36 <sppt> you need to fill in your bank account number at a site, put your bank card in a reader, enter your pin, then a code magically appears, and you have to enter that code on the website
P8:24:38 <dropshock> i just hope i can get it by then
P8:24:45 <sppt> works like a charm i'd say
P8:24:51 <dropshock> if i dont ill have to wait for ever to get it if its going to be 30 usd
P8:24:52 <Notch> he's got a point. ;) But cheesy is good!
P8:25:10 <Imapanda> Notch, is it true that it's only the additions you will pay for and what we have now will remain free?
P8:25:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, Notch, if I buy now, what would I be able to do that I can't already do?
P8:25:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Is the question.

P8:26:20 <C418> portforward.com will help you
P8:26:27 <david21> it dont help me for crap
P8:26:29 <Imapanda> Someone told me what we have now will remain free and only the additions to the game is what we have to pay for. :S

P8:26:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I know, but still.
P8:26:48 <Notch> yeah, what you got now will be free until the game is released
P8:26:51 <dropshock> on that subject we should probably get a thing up on portforward .com for MC
P8:26:54 <Imapanda> alright
P8:26:55 <Deiz> Notch: What do you record on registration? I suspect many people have duplicate accounts.
P8:27:05 <Deiz> I have, uh, four or five because I was testing the IP ban.

P8:39:42 <Jesse> because the what you get section makes it seem like that

P8:39:46 <vdgmprgrmr> What solution was it?
P8:39:50 <david21> what enabled

P8:42:04 <Deiz> Notch: When do you plan to go standalone? I get the occasional crash that takes out Firefox, but due to running within the browser I doubt I could get useful backtraces.
P8:42:07 <Evil-Ville> You get custom skins or something
P8:42:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Jesse, this weekend, custom skins.
P8:42:18 <Lukeybatman> its 10 Euro for EVERYTHING if you buy now I believe.
P8:42:29 <david21> im working on it hey
P8:42:31 <Lukeybatman> Not quite sure though.
P8:42:32 <Bubbbles100> I just bought it ^^
P8:42:33 <vdgmprgrmr> It's 10 Euro in ADVANCE for everything now.
P8:42:42 <vdgmprgrmr> So you don't actually get anything yet.
P8:42:47 <Lukeybatman> Thats what I mean...
P8:43:04 <Jesse> Thats the thing, it mentions custom skins, but it also mentions survival mode. It just seems kind of misleading, like if I were to purchase I would get the listed features.
P8:43:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, it is.
P8:43:25 <Evil-Ville> Well, you will
P8:43:29 <vdgmprgrmr> It might just be because it's supposed to be coming very soon.
P8:43:35 <vdgmprgrmr> How soon is Survival coming, Notch?
P8:43:48 <Jesse> Maybe he should update it saying these are features that are PLANNED, not features you get when you purchase.
P8:44:03 <C418> or will be featured
P8:44:05 <C418> exceptions are
P8:44:06 <Jesse> yeah

13P8:44:09 * TrueWolves needs to fix his card to buy...
P8:44:23 <Bubbbles100> a small thing that could be nice is some little thingy saying premium account
P8:44:30 <Bubbbles100> :P
P8:44:45 <Jesse> Hey maybe when you purchase, you could also get some extra save slots in your account?
P8:44:46 <Bubbbles100> just to make sure that its gone though on the right account
P8:44:49 <Jesse> I think that would be pretty nice./
P8:45:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I think Jesse has a good idea.
P8:45:22 <Bubbbles100> I agree

P9:01:14 <Notch> If I do become rich, I'm going to MAKE MORE GAMES!!
P9:01:19 <El_Joe> wait how much is that in non-monopoly money
P9:01:23 <El_Joe> you know, the $
P9:01:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Dat' da spirit!
P9:01:38 <Notch> haha, I don't know, El_Joe.
P9:01:44 <Jesse> like 150 dollars
P9:01:45 <Notch> It's about 1000 swedish kronor
P9:01:48 <Jesse> i think
P9:02:03 <Notch> which is about 1/24'th of what I get in salary after taxes
P9:02:06 <Notch> if that says anything
P9:02:14 <El_Joe> ho shit $30
P9:02:14 <dropshock> you silly people and your euros
P9:02:18 <El_Joe> american dollar is worthless
P9:02:24 <Notch> it's a very nice dinner for two
P9:02:33 <Notch> or a VEEEERY nice dinner for one. :D
P9:03:00 <Deiz> Or a year's supply of canned corn
P9:03:15 <Rosetta> or 10 minecrafts
P9:03:34 <Rosetta> ...hmm
P9:03:37 <dropshock> shillings are where its at
P9:03:43 <Notch> lol Rosetta
P9:03:48 <Notch> yeah, it's about 10 minecrafts
P9:04:03 <Jesse> will it stay 10$ until full release, or will it get progressively more expensive up to 20 dollars.
P9:04:14 <Notch> it'll get more expensive at beta
P9:04:18 <Deiz> Probably between 9.5 and 9.8 Minecrafts
P9:04:20 <Deiz> Due to Paypal

P9:04:44 <dropshock> good job
P9:04:46 <vdgmprgrmr> If they HAVE it, it's fine.
P9:04:56 <El_Joe> how long is the sale gonna last?
P9:04:58 <El_Joe> http://i43.tinypic.com/xcr7sz.png
P9:04:59 <Deiz> I dump things out of Paypal ASAP
P9:04:59 <vdgmprgrmr> You avoid the killing if they owe you and don't have it.
P9:05:03 <Notch> at least two weeks, El_Joe
P9:05:06 <El_Joe> thanks
P9:05:16 <Deiz> That way they can't decide you're a scammer and freeze your funds for 6 months
P9:06:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, two weeks?
P9:06:31 <vdgmprgrmr> That seems way less then I would have expected, seeing how it's still just 0.17 right now.
P9:06:32 <El_Joe> http://i41.tinypic.com/21r9ys.png someone built this in our server :\

P9:07:05 <vdgmprgrmr> That's possibly among the most creatively built castles I've ever seen, Joe.
P9:07:08 <Notch> it's even less, 0.0.17. Beta will be 0.1.0. Release will be 1.0.0
P9:07:09 <Jesse> wait until custom textures come, then block-hitlers will be running about.
P9:07:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Seems like a huge jump from beta to release.
P9:07:46 <Notch> yes, beta time will probably be longer than alpha time is
P9:07:52 <Deiz> Version numbers mean little
P9:08:01 <Deiz> I suggest making release v1029.6
P9:08:04 <dropshock> notch do you accept chickens and goats for payments
P9:08:11 <Notch> very little in my case. I just increase the lowest number whenever I make a new release. ;)
P9:08:27 <Notch> goats, yes
P9:08:30 <Notch> I'm afraid of chicken
P9:08:32 <Notch> s
P9:08:40 <dropshock> THEN NO DEAL
P9:08:54 <vdgmprgrmr> What about small children or cats?

P9:11:36 <Deiz> Gauphastus: Which server?
P9:11:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Just call them nubs and kick is what I would do.
P9:11:43 <Gauphastus> Oh, mine. It's not public.
P9:12:07 <Gauphastus> I'm giving this one guy, who is usually the troublemaker in these situations, one last chance.
P9:12:14 <Gauphastus> He mouths off again, he gone, yo.
P9:12:21 <Gauphastus> Anyways, yeah.
P9:12:30 <Gauphastus> It's just funny being in this position.
P9:12:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Troo dat, homeboy. You tell-um.
P9:12:44 <Gauphastus> No matter how benevolent you try to be, you have to eventually get in there and mediate.
P9:13:16 <Gauphastus> Man, people make a lot of space invaders lately.
P9:13:43 <Deiz> It's because most people are drooling morons.
P9:14:25 <Deiz> Minecraft should have tiered accounts. If you're vetted by a few people you can play on the servers with less idiots.

P9:18:21 <Deiz> Stick to pyramids.

P9:21:34 <Deiz> It's Java, so yes.

P9:22:03 <Deiz> Notch: Speaking of which, Minecraft totally doesn't work with Java 5.
P9:22:16 <david21> i portforwared but its not working

P10:38:48 <vdgmprgrmr> OH GOD!
P10:39:33 <Daidoji> well, 7600 registered and 20 purchases is a little whack. maybe in like a month or two when it's 30,000 registered and 4000 purchases
P10:39:48 <Daidoji> but he just put it up today right?
P10:40:02 <Daidoji> I don't know I forgot to pay my phone bill so I was without internet for 3 days. woop.
P10:40:32 <Gauphastus> Yeah, it was just put up a couple hours ago.
P10:40:50 <Gauphastus> I hope he doesn't get bought out or something lame.
P10:41:05 <Gauphastus> Stay indie, put this thing on Steam or something.
P10:41:19 <Gauphastus> If Steam is in fact as good as believed.
P10:41:25 <Gauphastus> I need water. Berb.
P10:43:18 <david21> DUDE I WAS FIXING THE MOUNTAN DUMBASS

P10:47:13 <El_Joe> good plane or no?
P10:47:23 <vdgmprgrmr> have you seen Pyl's plane?
P10:47:43 <vdgmprgrmr> (It's crashing into one of two very similar-looking towers...)
P10:47:50 <El_Joe> no!
P10:47:59 <El_Joe> link? or images?

P10:52:33 <Daidoji> steam is pretty awesome.
P10:52:40 <Daidoji> anyone who hates steam probably has dialup.
P10:52:53 <Daidoji> or some preconcieved notion of owning a game without a cd.
P10:53:22 <El_Joe> I love steam, it so grand
P10:53:47 <Daidoji> there were a lot of naysayers back in the early days of steam, but that was fairly warrented cause it was buggy as fuck.
P10:53:58 <Daidoji> but when it worked, it worked great.
P10:54:29 <Daidoji> I still have a pre-alpha build of steam I got from ~adrian finol~
P10:54:58 <Daidoji> back then all steam was a friends list and you could chat with other steam users in any half-life engine game. it ruled.
P10:55:16 <Daidoji> but then they removed that feature from the main steam thing for like...2  years I guess?
P10:55:22 <Daidoji> and then finally finished that.
P10:56:38 <Daidoji> also it had a pretty neat "join friend" and it would join them on whatever server they were and would load the game and connect in one go.
P10:56:56 <El_Joe> they still have that :\
P10:57:14 <Daidoji> yeah that was the whole reason I liked it

P11:05:31 <Gauphastus> Oh, don't get me wrong. I've got steam.
P11:05:41 <Gauphastus> I mean if it's good for indie guys trying to distribute their stuff.

P11:08:05 <Kira> what does connection lost: illegal name mean?
P11:08:08 <Gauphastus> Wow. He says once sales start dying after awhile, he might release the game open source under a public domain license.
P11:08:14 <Gauphastus> It's a weird error.
P11:08:26 <Gauphastus> Illegal name usually meaning that there is no name at all.
P11:08:43 <Kira> it happens when I try to join my own server
P11:11:06 <Kira> oh I see what's happening, somehow it's setting my name as my local ip for some reason
P11:13:20 <Gauphastus> Oh, so you can play now?
P11:13:36 <Gauphastus> If so, then great.
P11:14:56 <Kira> I just didn't turn off the verify names
P11:15:35 <Kira> now my question is how do I load a saved level?

P11:21:51 <Kira> is there any way to put a saved level up onto a server? or download a saved level?
P11:21:54 <Gauphastus> Sorry I answered so late. :P
P11:21:57 <Gauphastus> Nope.
P11:22:01 <Gauphastus> Not yet anyway.
