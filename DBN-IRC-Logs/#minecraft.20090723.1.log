A12:00:51 <Pl0x> D:
A12:00:59 <Pl0x> Undead
A12:01:01 <Pl0x> you coming?
A12:01:08 <Undeadsteak> im there!
A12:01:21 <Pl0x> Oh
A12:01:26 <Perogi> where is the skin file? like where do I go to change the skin?
A12:01:33 <Darkebrz> Perogi
A12:01:38 <Darkebrz> You have to upload it
A12:01:44 <Perogi> o I see
A12:01:51 <Darkebrz> Your a buyer?
A12:01:56 <Perogi> just a minute ago
A12:02:02 <Darkebrz> Great
A12:02:06 <Perogi> where do I upload it, sorry if its a stupid question I havn't looked yet XD
A12:02:15 <Darkebrz> Arent you a griefer?
A12:02:47 <Perogi> only sometimes
A12:02:50 <Darkebrz> I would rather not tell you
A12:03:02 <Perogi> I found it in prefrences anyway
A12:03:10 <Perogi> its not as if I'm some evil inhuman beast you know :O
A12:03:12 <Darkebrz> Yes you did
A12:03:18 <Darkebrz> Your still a dick
A12:03:29 <Perogi> beg your parden sir but you do not know me
A12:03:40 <Darkebrz> I know how you portray yourself online
A12:03:42 <Perogi> you are assuming the entirety of my personality follows the single facet I have showed to you
A12:03:49 <Perogi> I portray myself many ways online
A12:04:33 <Darkebrz> If one of them is as a griefer than you dont deserve to buy the game
A12:05:27 <Perogi> well fortunately Notch cares more about money than the personality of his customers 
A12:05:45 <Darkebrz> Of course he does
A12:06:04 <Darkebrz> Still, he would much rather have a player who contributes than a griefer
A12:06:29 <Perogi> I contribute significantly more than I grief if you would care to know
A12:06:46 <Darkebrz> Yet you still grief
A12:06:48 <PuyoDead> griefing nullifies all "contributions"
A12:06:55 <Darkebrz> It does
A12:07:10 <Pl0x> heh
A12:07:12 <Darkebrz> No matter what you do, griefing ruins the fun of others
A12:07:17 <Undeadsteak> Cools tory bro
A12:07:21 <Bob_The_Builder> "well fortunately Notch cares more about money than the personality of his customers "  HAHAH GOLD!
A12:07:43 <Perogi> that is a very arrogant and short sighted attitude sir and to me at least it appears you have been fed propaganda
A12:07:53 <Undeadsteak> and "GAME RUINERS" have never been a reasoon someone doesnt buy a game
A12:07:54 <Undeadsteak> fyi
A12:08:12 <Darkebrz> The havn't
A12:08:17 <Perogi> and if you will argue that you have not eaten up this alarmist griefing scare propaganda
A12:08:20 <Perogi> as you just did

A12:08:31 <Darkebrz> Eaten up this propaganda?
A12:08:35 <Perogi> then I say you must be one ignorant and unworthy human being ot have conjured up that opinion all by yourself
A12:08:53 <Perogi> no I'm not plox I'm trying to do skin shit
A12:08:58 <Darkebrz> My hatred of griefers comes from much of my stuff being destroyed
A12:09:04 <Pl0x> ahh, k
A12:09:18 <Perogi> ah so you are just full of hate
A12:09:26 <Bob_The_Builder> plox and <}AlLnAtuRalX   are banning our ip (and apparently ISP's) from the whois information here in IRC

A12:11:47 <Darkebrz> And what was this claim Perogi? I was busy with something else
A12:12:01 <Perogi> still it appears to me there is more than just hate lurking inside your skull due ot the way you generalize people under this category
A12:12:09 <Perogi> which you so hate
A12:12:20 <Darkebrz> Generalize griefers?

A12:13:36 <Perogi> LOL
A12:13:37 <Bob_The_Builder> talking to plox is nearly more fun than griefing
A12:13:43 <Perogi> I agree
A12:13:44 <Undeadsteak> WAIT TOO BAD THE ISPS CARE MOAR ABOUT MONEY THAN THEIR CUSTOMERS BEHAVIORS
A12:13:44 <Darkebrz> You don't even care that you are griefing

A12:28:25 <Darkebrz> At the same time?
A12:28:28 <Perogi> wc3 roleplayting is so fail
A12:28:30 <Undeadsteak> he has the "Roleplay" server

A12:29:33 <moujave> lol
A12:30:03 <Undeadsteak> I take is back Saer, your a snob. You come on our server yesterday and claim that you had "converted" our server, which you didn't do.
A12:30:07 <Undeadsteak> You don't do anything at all in the server, and later leave. You come back today, and as I'm building my house you tear down the logs as I make them.
A12:30:12 <Undeadsteak> I tell you to stop and tell you I'm building the house. You then say that I'm building the house wrong, say I don't have enough resources and go on to say that nobody in this game has enough resources to build and that we're all wrong.
A12:30:15 <Undeadsteak> You say this and have no idea how our server works. You then go on to say that you are an architect, and therefore you know everything about minecraft roleplaying. I call you out on this, and then you say that I am supposed to go from across the map, and bring over MINUSCULE amounts of wood each time to build my house. Why would I do this? It would take an hour to build one floor!
A12:30:19 <Undeadsteak> Throughout this whole time, you did absolutely nothing on the server, and never contributed anything. You just came on and acted like you knew everything. I hope no other server ever has to be ruled under your presence.
A12:30:19 <Undeadsteak> Chicken Face: Old frontier is no longer a roleplay. The new server, NewFrontier, is private, and can be accessed from our thread post in Server Discussion.
A12:30:24 <Undeadsteak> ^ Darekbz.
A12:30:27 <Undeadsteak> Cool post bro.

A3:08:54 <Meizlizard> When you start a browser for the first time, you get a black screen on minecraft, right?
A3:09:40 <Meizlizard> I've found that if you refresh from that black screen you'll get that error, where the keyboard basically won't work.
A3:09:56 <Meizlizard> The trick is to wait at the black screen.
A3:10:03 <Meizlizard> Which can take a while/

A6:55:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Otherwise, they really do keep quite a few people out.
A6:55:52 <citricsquid> The problem is; the real griefers who aren't just bored people will use hacks, rendering them useless. They turn away real players and don't protect against actual griefers.
A6:56:18 <vdgmprgrmr> They'll keep out the minor griefers.
A6:56:23 <liq3> Pfft.
A6:56:24 <vdgmprgrmr> And that's good.
A6:56:30 <liq3> You forget we have like 10 non-griefers to every griefer.
A6:56:38 <liq3> Any damage they do can be easily repaired.
A6:56:48 <liq3> We gotta watch out for people using hacks that can delete blocks at like 10 per second. :/
A6:56:54 <citricsquid> The only real protection against griefers are good ops.
A6:56:58 <liq3> exactly.
A6:57:16 <vdgmprgrmr> There are still minor griefers, though, no matter how you look at it.
A6:57:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Just because they might be a minority doesn't mean they don't exist.
A6:57:29 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: That's the point tho, they're MINOR griefers.
A6:57:33 <liq3> You can just repair their damage.
A6:57:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Nor does it mean they don't actually affect anything.
A6:57:47 <liq3> Spawn prisons aren't worth it.
A6:57:49 <vdgmprgrmr> What if people don't want to have to repair their level constantly?
A6:57:53 <citricsquid> private/.
A6:57:59 <liq3> ...Fine I'll prove this with an example.
A6:58:06 <liq3> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=50521b358194bb93a3f7c3a51797aa66
A6:58:19 <liq3> Redshift's Ocean build. No spawn prison, there's so much stuff on the damn map it lags me.
A6:58:31 <liq3> Not to mention the map takse like 10x as long as normal maps to download.
A6:58:37 <vdgmprgrmr> People act like private servers are some kind of saviour, but for some reason, hey not everyone wants to make a server that NO ONE can get into unless they link it.
A6:58:37 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: I go to a server as an honest player, I get stuck in a spawn prison so I quit because I don't want to wait. I go to a server as a griefer, I hack my way out of the box and grief. They don't protect against anything.
A6:58:43 <vdgmprgrmr> liq3, I frequent that server.
A6:58:48 <liq3> That's my point.
A6:58:54 <liq3> It's probably the best server atm, because it has the BEST ops.
A6:59:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Just a few days ago, my ENTIRE play session was used repairing things.
A6:59:05 <liq3> Lulz.
A6:59:28 <vdgmprgrmr> The ops, including me, stopped caring about griefers because everything was already too griefed to give two shits about.
A6:59:28 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: Life sucks, but right now there is no way to stop griefers besides using private servers or having good administration. So complaining about public is pointless.
A7:00:14 <Adura> Backup and restore often.
A7:00:32 <vdgmprgrmr> And the ops on Redshift's server, with the exception of manchild, are actually pretty good ops.
A7:00:48 <liq3> I mean, if I knew how servers worked, I could make a hack to delete entire servers. Be glad I haven't figured out how (not that'd use it, but if I can do it, others can do).
A7:00:56 <liq3> I'd use it*
A7:01:00 <liq3> NOT use it... lol.
A7:01:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, you could make a hack to delete entire maps, so... obviously we should stop caring about things that aren't map-deletion hacks?
A7:01:42 <liq3> ...You still don't get it...
A7:01:48 <liq3> Minor griefing is minor.
A7:01:51 <liq3> It's easily repaired. :/
A7:02:07 <liq3> The real stuff to worry about is grief raids and hacking griefing.
A7:02:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, until you get so much MINOR griefing that all the minor adds up to what Redshift's server was like a few days ago.
A7:02:23 <liq3> ...
A7:02:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Those griefers weren't hacking or anything.
A7:02:31 <vdgmprgrmr> They weren't organized.
A7:02:35 <liq3> God this is like trying to convince a Christian God isn't real.
A7:02:50 <vdgmprgrmr> liq3, you've said that a few times here before.
A7:02:55 <vdgmprgrmr> It's pretty annoying.
12A7:03:04 * Cue (cueball61@cpc2-alde4-2-0-cust382.6-2.cable.virginmedia.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A7:03:13 <Cueball> yeah liq3, calling me a christian hey?
A7:03:15 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: It basicaly means "Oh god i'm arguing with someone who fails at basic logic *headdesk*"
A7:03:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I know, and it's pretty annoying.
A7:03:31 <liq3> It's supposed to be.
A7:03:38 <Adura> Careful, vdgmprgrmr intentionally annoys.
A7:03:44 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'd say, if anyone, you're the one who tends to fail at logic.
A7:03:48 <UnknownX> liq3 i found that offensive
A7:03:52 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't intentionally annoy.
A7:03:57 <liq3> UnknownX: lol.
A7:04:13 <liq3> Cueball: No. You're a Christian?
A7:04:14 <citricsquid> bottom line: Spawn prisons only serve to annoy legitimate users, if someone wants to grief they will use hacks. The only prevention is good moderation, not blocking all legit players by default.
A7:04:20 <Adura> See, he's trying to annoy me now by disagreeing with me.
A7:04:27 <Cueball> you called me a christian in redshifts server
A7:04:29 <Cueball> remember?
A7:04:32 <liq3> I did?
A7:04:35 <vdgmprgrmr> If someone who doesn't use hacks wants to grief...
A7:04:44 <vdgmprgrmr> There are people like that, you know.
A7:04:46 <Cueball> about the water elevator..
A7:05:00 <liq3> Oh.
A7:05:01 <liq3> That.
A7:05:04 <liq3> lol.
A7:05:07 <UnknownX> You just compared Christians with people who have no logic.
A7:05:08 <liq3> I completely forgot xD
A7:05:18 <liq3> Because Christian logic is terrible?
A7:05:22 <Adura> Christians don't need logic, they have faith.
A7:05:26 <liq3> lol Adura.
A7:05:26 <liq3> xD
A7:05:48 <Cueball> you're saying my logic is terrible
A7:05:49 <Cueball> nice.
A7:05:54 <liq3> I did?
A7:05:57 <liq3> I seriously don't remember.
A7:06:17 <Cueball> ok
A7:06:19 <vdgmprgrmr> <Cueball>you called me a christian in redshifts server
A7:06:31 <vdgmprgrmr> <liq3>vdgmprgrmr: It basicaly means "Oh god i'm arguing with someone who fails at basic logic *headdesk*"
A7:06:39 <Cueball> yeah
A7:06:40 <Cueball> i saw it too
A7:06:53 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: I can't remember a single Christian who was logical, ever.
A7:06:54 <vdgmprgrmr> You even admitted to remembering it...
A7:07:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said there were any.
A7:07:07 <liq3> And I used to BE Christian, so I was around tons.
A7:07:13 <liq3> Thus why I use them as comparision.
A7:07:35 <UnknownX> thus why you need to be around more
A7:07:41 <liq3> Also, I've argued with a few Christians... Once again why I compare people to them.
10A7:07:51 * TrueWolves|gone is now known as TrueWolves
A7:07:54 <liq3> It's like arguing with someone really really stupid. :/
A7:08:05 <liq3> lol probably because it is. >.
A7:08:06 <TrueWolves> I have met logical christians before
A7:08:17 <liq3> TrueWolves: Maybe by your standards...
A7:08:19 <TrueWolves> There not common, but they are there
10A7:08:31 * tripel (adam_boden@c-76-28-185-127.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A7:08:35 <liq3> TrueWolves: The problem is, if they are logical, they will realise Christianity is wrong.
A7:08:35 <vdgmprgrmr> They're logical until they have to make an argument for God's existence.
A7:08:37 <TrueWolves> Liq3, I have somewhat highish standards for logical
A7:08:40 <UnknownX> so if i argued with someone in europe i could say that everyone in europe wasnt logical?
A7:08:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Then the logic falls to pieces.
A7:08:59 <liq3> UnknownX: Eh?
A7:09:27 <liq3> Hahaahha see UnknownX just failed at logic.
A7:09:34 <liq3> I said "Christians". That means 2+. 
A7:09:43 <liq3> lol.
A7:09:59 <UnknownX> you said a FEW
A7:10:07 <liq3> ?
A7:10:14 <liq3> Because I avoid arguing with Christians about God...
A7:10:24 <vdgmprgrmr> So if I argued with two people in Europe, I could make a safe assumption that everyone in Europe is like those two people? (The nitpicking, it's seriously annoying.)
A7:10:27 <TrueWolves> Eh, the 4 logical christians I've met have preaty much have the same argument on god's existentince "We can't prove god is real or not, I beleave in him do to the large amount of chance that brought out are evolution, he may not exist, but he just may"
A7:10:40 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: No, but you could safely assume at least 2 people are illogical.
A7:10:46 <TrueWolves> non of the 4 were "hard core" christians though
A7:11:02 <liq3> TrueWolves: They are agnostic then, and not true christians.
A7:11:12 <vdgmprgrmr> So, by assuming that ALL Christians fail at logic, you must have spoken to EVERY Christian, yes?
A7:11:27 <TrueWolves> liq3, the world is not black and white ~.^
A7:11:35 <liq3> TrueWolves: Dur.
A7:11:48 <Zuriki> I can say that any Christian that uses God as a scapegoat is an idiot.
A7:12:00 <liq3> lol I'm like a video game. Incredibly simple looking on the outside, ludicrisously complicated inside. <3
A7:12:06 <TrueWolves> Using "All" is saying it's a black and white subject
A7:12:16 <liq3> TrueWolves: I said all? Oh yeh I did.
A7:12:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Sounds like... a person?
A7:12:27 <TrueWolves> XD
A7:12:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I think "human" would make a better analogy than a video game.
A7:12:33 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: most people are incredibly simple, and predictable.
A7:12:46 <TrueWolves> Nearly All and I wouldn't be arguing with ya =P
A7:13:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Video games are definitively predictable.
A7:13:44 <TrueWolves> "If the average person is stupid, 50% of the population is stupider
A7:13:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Has something to do with the nature of computers.
A7:13:55 <TrueWolves> err more stupid*

A7:15:29 <liq3> "There are only 2 things that are infinite. The universe, and human stupidity. I'm not sure about the former." - Einstien.

A7:16:01 <liq3> hrm
A7:16:01 <TrueWolves> To bad they disproved his "Nothing goes faster then light" theroy
A7:16:03 <liq3> not totally sure it was him.
A7:16:17 <liq3> yeh it was lol.
A7:16:21 <citricsquid> notchs' bank balance increases faster than light.
A7:16:31 <TrueWolves> They used eletricmagnetics to make radiowaves faster then light
A7:16:37 <TrueWolves> Citric, that was awesome
A7:17:00 <liq3> lol Citric, thanks for posting that song in the thread the other day. It's awesome. :P
A7:17:29 <TrueWolves> I wish the minecraft music didn't lag on my computer, I kind of like it
A7:17:33 <TrueWolves> calming
A7:17:38 <liq3> Eh, I disabled minecraft sound.
A7:17:42 <liq3> It's quite terrible atm. :/
A7:17:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I hate the music.
A7:17:51 <liq3> And I prefer my own music.
A7:18:10 <citricsquid> just download the music?
A7:18:15 <liq3> the footsteps like, need to be way quieter.
A7:18:35 <liq3> yeh, the music is probably in the .jar, or hosted on a url somewhere.
A7:18:37 <vdgmprgrmr> The sound is sort of okay, but the grass/cloth sounds just sound like someone crumpling a candy wrapper or something.
A7:18:46 <citricsquid> liq3: You can find it easily
A7:18:47 <liq3> lol it probably is. :P
A7:18:54 <liq3> citric: i know xD
A7:18:58 <citricsquid> dunno if I can though, notch might not want it distributed :O
A7:19:05 <vdgmprgrmr> And cloth should probably not sound anything like grass...
A7:19:26 <liq3> haha i should stick my own music in there <3
A7:19:41 <vdgmprgrmr>  O_O
A7:19:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I never thought of doing that...
A7:20:07 <TrueWolves> Server's with there own music
A7:20:12 <vdgmprgrmr> But... I dunno if it's actually in the .jar.
A7:20:33 <Cueball> yeah notch would have heaps of cash from minecraft by now
A7:20:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch said that the game downloads sounds from a server when it loads.
A7:20:43 <Cueball> 1000 x 25 AUD
A7:20:46 <citricsquid> the music is hosted externally
A7:20:49 <Cueball> thats 25000!
A7:20:52 <Cueball> oh wow
A7:20:54 <citricsquid> and loaded through the .jar from minecraft.net

A7:31:27 <LG_Legacy> Cause i would hope so
A7:31:46 <citricsquid> wat

A7:32:08 <citricsquid> okay, steam game collection.

A7:34:35 <d0ohan> And they have good deals all the time.
A7:34:41 <citricsquid> Played bioshock for 5 mins after a weekend deal, never played it since.
A7:34:53 <d0ohan> Same with unreal 3
A7:35:12 <LG_Legacy> Played bioshock demo, deemed interesting.
A7:35:12 <UnknownX> i played The Ship and loved it for some reason :/
A7:35:27 <d0ohan> I played bioshock on the xbox. Though it was boring and over hyped.
A7:35:39 <d0ohan> Thought*
A7:35:48 <citricsquid> it seemed fun but I didn't really get into it so I gave up.
A7:35:50 <LG_Legacy> Same deal, but still. I have a preference for power overwhelming (No reference to any blizzard there.)
A7:36:03 <UnknownX> probably because it allowed you to get a fire ax and kill people with it while others tried to find out who the killer was

A7:55:45 <bjzaba> Macs can run .exe through bootcamp, paralells or wine

A8:05:39 <JTE> I like how in Second Life, which also uses Havoc physics, a weld at least acts like a weld and not a rubber band.
A8:05:59 <Zuriki> I think the only reason people noticed HL2 uses physics is cause they repeated the bloody see-saw "puzzle"
A8:06:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Apparently Oblivion used Havok, and Oblivion had non-wonky physics.

A8:06:39 <Zuriki> Oblivion's physics sucked more that HL2s imo
A8:06:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Oblivion allowed you to move a plate, and the stuff on the plate would move naturally with it.
A8:07:07 <Zuriki> Also things would jump alot
A8:07:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Not really.
A8:07:17 <Zuriki> I bumped into a table and all the plates jumped up
A8:07:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, that was weird, but it didn't really affect much.
A8:07:37 <UnknownX> some tables dont move
A8:07:38 <liq3> Zuriki: I think that was not due to Havok, but bad coding on the Oblivion's devs part.
A8:07:55 <Zuriki> Ok, Ragdolls intersected a lot
A8:07:59 <Zuriki> A LOT
A8:08:08 <liq3> I mean, havok is just a physics API. Nothing else.
A8:08:14 <vdgmprgrmr> That's pretty common in most games, actually.
A8:08:21 <liq3> It's all it's important settings are set by the game devs, not the people who make Havok.

A8:13:07 <UnknownX> i blame the internet for lying to us
A8:13:08 <testvan> yes
A8:13:12 <vdgmprgrmr> KInda like Halo players.
A8:13:15 <testvan> everything ever is a WOW ripoff
A8:13:16 <bjzaba1> 95% of statistics are made up
A8:13:25 <LG_Legacy> Interesting, they first announced WoW in 2001 while Diablo II Got released in 2000
A8:13:31 <LG_Legacy> I might be wrong.
A8:13:36 <Zuriki> That was more likely a true statistic
A8:13:50 <testvan> that timeframe sounds correct
A8:13:55 <Zuriki> DOOM IS A HALO RIP OFF
A8:14:03 <Awol10> lol
A8:14:04 <vdgmprgrmr> I watched a youtube video for Red Faction 2, and the description was "Me playing Red Faction 2, it's bascialy like halo but they made it for the ps2"

A8:31:44 <liq3> citricsquid: And? I still love using it as a reason to tell people to stop eating meat. <3
A8:31:54 <testvan> eat more cows so there are less of them to fart
A8:31:56 <Snowman> MEAT IS AWESOME
A8:31:56 <vdgmprgrmr> If I kill a deer, and eat the deer, I'm not really doing anything to help global warming all that much.
A8:32:07 <bjzaba> vdgmprgrmr: and remember methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than co2
A8:32:11 <vdgmprgrmr> If the act of eating meat causes global warming, it'd be impossible for it to stop.
A8:32:22 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: I'm talking massed produced meat. If you go hunt wildlife, fine. 
A8:32:38 <testvan> i only eat potatoes and sugart
A8:32:42 <citricsquid> Global warming exists without humans BUT we do increase the rate at which it happens.

A8:34:34 <bjzaba> vegies dont
A8:34:37 <Snowman> We do, cause you have to eat more vegetables to get the same amount of energy you would get from meat
A8:34:53 <liq3> Yes, vegetables. We're talking wheat though, not vegies.
A8:34:54 <bjzaba> think about it
A8:35:09 <liq3> Also vegies use up less resources then meat anyway.
A8:35:10 <bjzaba> the cow gets energy from the grass
A8:35:27 <bjzaba> and there's energy lost there - like heat etc

A8:36:10 <Snowman> yeah but we have to eat more plants though
A8:36:15 <testvan> you are avoiding the issue that vegies suck compared to meat
A8:36:27 <bjzaba> vegies are nice
A8:36:29 <vdgmprgrmr> We also have fruits.
A8:36:32 <Snowman> in 1 cow theres more energy than in 1 quare meter of grass
A8:36:42 <Snowman> square
A8:36:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And sweet fruits are definitely the most bestest food in the whole world.
A8:36:54 <bjzaba> but western countries eat considerably more meat than the rest of the world
A8:36:54 <offset> how much grass does the cow need to grow though?
A8:36:56 <offset> :)
A8:37:01 <liq3> "To produce one pound of meat requires, on average, about 5000 gallons of water. Compare that to 25 gallons for a pound of wheat. To produce their daily food, a vegetarian needs 300 gallons of water per day, while a typical meat-eater needs 4000 gallons. It takes energy to transport all that water too, and this means more greenhouse gas emissions."

A8:45:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, not religious in the slightest.
A8:45:47 <liq3> bjzaba: There are ones not so related to personal development you might find interesting.
A8:46:14 <liq3> Like his raw food and polyphasic sleep experiments.
A8:46:39 <bjzaba1> ok - we've cover global warming, meat eating, the creation of the universe (by notch of course), so now its only logical that we must include religion

A8:48:15 <Malcovent> schools are, too populated.
A8:48:17 <liq3> Intentionally making kids stupid, that is.
A8:48:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I think school should be less structured, but still there.
A8:48:22 <Malcovent> teaching a class of 30 is as useless as bouncing bricks.
A8:48:24 <Najkankenko> educational system sucks
A8:48:25 <citricsquid> school = good idea, poorly executed.
A8:48:28 <bjzaba1> the moon landing was faked
A8:48:34 <bjzaba1> theres life on mars
A8:48:37 <Najkankenko> each guy should learn what likes him the most
A8:48:42 <Najkankenko> since a first time
A8:48:45 <liq3> citric: Actually, it's executed wonderfully. It's the best brainwashing facility it hundreds of years.
A8:48:48 <Malcovent> the classes need to be kept under 19-15 even if it means excluding lower students.
A8:48:49 <vdgmprgrmr> All good knowledge comes from personal interest.
A8:48:53 <citricsquid> liq3: stehe
A8:48:54 <bjzaba1> doctors are actually killing their patients
A8:48:55 <Najkankenko> apart from basics of all other subjects, but not any further
A8:49:17 <bjzaba1> vaccines kill people
A8:49:25 <citricsquid> Najkankenko: That would be brilliant; a few years spent learning basic English and maths and all the skills you need for life then let to progress onto what you want to learn.
A8:49:26 <Malcovent> god hates you all! etc.
A8:49:27 <bjzaba1> we're all going to die from swine flu
A8:49:28 <Najkankenko> it's stupid to make someone learn something that doesn't interest to a person
A8:49:29 <liq3> Malcovent: Also, classes should be a lot longer. At least 3-4 hours.
A8:49:36 <citricsquid> I know stuff now that I'll never need and stuff I want to know that I don't.
A8:49:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Schools should be a place that encourages kids to learn for themselves in an educational environment, not a place that forces them to learn what they're told to.
A8:49:41 <Malcovent> not without repeated breaks
A8:49:47 <liq3> Malcovent: Maybe.
A8:49:49 <Malcovent> 3-4 hour classes, you will learn so little in the last 2 hours
A8:49:51 <bjzaba1> god will smite us all for our wickedness
A8:49:52 <liq3> Or just let kids have breaks when they want.
A8:50:01 <Malcovent> proven, your mind will basically absorb an hour or two of information
A8:50:04 <offset> sounds good, doesn't work
A8:50:06 <Malcovent> then essentially flick off for long term
A8:50:07 <Najkankenko> citric, in rome, people learnt to do its work since they were kid
A8:50:09 <offset> they end up learning nothing
A8:50:14 <Najkankenko> so they became masters by the time
A8:50:21 <bjzaba1> the kids are all gonna die horrible deaths
A8:50:26 <liq3> Malcovent: Yeh, I code. I find after a while my brain just dies and I need a break.
A8:50:30 <bjzaba1> ...
A8:50:31 <Malcovent> but public schools are... 
A8:50:39 <Malcovent> they put a thousand or so people into a school
A8:50:43 <Malcovent> pack them into classes of 30-40
A8:50:48 <bjzaba1> sorry - just trying out being alarmist for once
A8:50:51 <Malcovent> then get suprised when theres fights and massive amounts of interruptions?
A8:51:07 <Malcovent> packing a bunch of raging hormones into a class
A8:51:09 <Malcovent> for an hour or so on end
A8:51:15 <Malcovent> not a formula for learning
A8:51:16 <vdgmprgrmr> The modern school system seems to consist of kids being "processed" instead of kids being actually educated.
A8:51:19 <Cueball> so
A8:51:23 <Cueball> ive been thinking
A8:51:24 <liq3> Malcovent: Imo school should be totally optional, as well as every class.
A8:51:30 <bjzaba1> lol
A8:51:32 <Malcovent> well, most schoolsa re now more interested about grades, not learning.
A8:51:34 <Cueball> we should have a way to moniter players without following them
A8:51:42 <citricsquid> School should be compulsory, the choice of learning shouldn't be.
A8:51:44 <Malcovent> if they can cram everything into your head that you just need for a exam, which is set usually around a certain topic of the subject
A8:51:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Admin invisibility.
A8:51:49 <Malcovent> they're happy, they make money.
A8:51:50 <Cueball> such as being invisible
A8:51:52 <Cueball> tor spccing
A8:51:58 <Cueball> or*
A8:52:03 <Cueball> spectating
A8:52:13 <liq3> Cueball: A little window popping up showing their view would be nice. :D
A8:52:20 <Najkankenko> you know whats wrong in the educational system?
A8:52:20 <Cueball> NO
A8:52:21 <Cueball> NO
A8:52:21 <Cueball> NO
A8:52:26 <Cueball> yeah that would be good
A8:52:31 <Najkankenko> you learn for years, things that you will NEVER, EVER need
A8:52:53 <Najkankenko> all you do is to pack information in your brain for the exams, and then forget it
A8:52:59 <Wurtex>  depends on what you wanna do with your life
A8:52:59 <liq3> Man.
A8:53:03 <liq3> I wonder why you guys all hate school.
A8:53:04 <Najkankenko> until you get to study what you like
A8:53:06 <Malcovent> precisely
A8:53:11 <liq3> But this other forum I made a thread all defended it. :/
A8:53:12 <Najkankenko> I LOVE programming
A8:53:17 <Najkankenko> but I can't do that in school
A8:53:19 <bjzaba1> we should all be dumb and uneducated - marks don't help in the slightest. They only make dumb people feel crap. If we get rid of school, dumb idiots will feel less stupid. Therefore I believe school should be abolished.
A8:53:31 <Najkankenko> I have to do it at home
A8:53:45 <liq3> bjzaba: That sounds like someone being sarcastic in a failed attempt at arguing for school.

A8:54:20 <Malcovent> problem with school systems
A8:54:27 <Malcovent> the person who usually runs the overall system
A8:54:29 <Najkankenko> so each one should learn on their own, you think?
A8:54:34 <liq3> Najkankenko: I wanted to learn programming in a school envirnment, so I tried TAFE/Uni (college for you ameracians). I had to put up with 1 year of shit before I ever got CLOSE to the good stuff.
A8:54:34 <Malcovent> is some 60 year old man, who's education
A8:54:38 <Malcovent> involved a chalkboard and a cane.
A8:54:40 <Najkankenko> or each one should only learn what they like the most?
A8:54:43 <Malcovent> they know NOTHING about modern schooling
A8:54:45 <Najkankenko> apart from the basics, of course
A8:55:07 <Snowman> Lol you can choose to get IT here on high school
A8:55:13 <vdgmprgrmr> malcovent is right.
A8:55:20 <Najkankenko> should we get back to rome times?
A8:55:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Schools seem to assume that the educational methods of yesteryear will work today.
A8:55:31 <Najkankenko> and let the children learn since they are kids what they like doing?
A8:55:35 <liq3> Snowman: That was the problem. Dude, they were teaching BASIC MATH at uni. And even worse, they wouldn't let you skip it.
A8:55:42 <Snowman> lol
A8:55:56 <Najkankenko> we're doing algebra at school
A8:55:58 <liq3> Complete bullshit. I ended up going "fuck this shit wasting my time" and dropped out.
A8:56:05 <Malcovent> Najkankenko that sounds good x_x
A8:56:05 <vdgmprgrmr> The best way to teach is to teach in a way that involves already-familiar concepts to children, but we're prohibiting all forms of modern technology in the classroom.
A8:56:07 <Najkankenko> something I bet I'll never use once again apart to pass the exam
A8:56:12 <bjzaba1> what's everyone got against age? For some things - like english, history and maths, age and a long life of learning is useful.
A8:56:16 <Malcovent> aslong as they are at a age when they can actually say what they want to do other than "FIREMAN!"
A8:56:33 <liq3> bjzaba: What do you mean about age?
A8:56:36 <bjzaba1> bleh - that came out wrong

A8:57:09 <bjzaba1> I mean - today's culture says age is bad - we should all aim to be young.
A8:57:15 <bjzaba1> That's true
A8:57:21 <liq3> bjzaba: Yes, that's a problem.
A8:57:31 <bjzaba1> In modern society one has to be flexible.
A8:57:31 <liq3> I think it's mostly because old people usually sotp learning.

A8:57:40 <liq3> After a while they don't know anything useful.

A8:59:11 <LG_Legacy> Probably
A8:59:31 <Najkankenko> I learnt english because all the games I play are in english
A8:59:40 <Najkankenko> so to understand them, I have to know english....

A8:59:47 <LG_Legacy> Theres a thought]

A9:00:03 <Snowman> lg_legacy: totally agree

A9:00:15 <Najkankenko> In english classes... we're learning: present simple
A9:00:19 <Najkankenko> oh, god damn it!
A9:00:19 <Snowman> I learnt the biggest part of my english from it
A9:00:19 <bjzaba1> :P

A9:00:33 <liq3> lol.
A9:00:34 <Najkankenko> rofl
A9:00:37 <Wurtex> but you had to get the basics at school right? so for me learning at school is needed to improve in directions i like to get better at things

A9:01:09 <Malcovent> WoW Is something you should always experience if you play Mmo's =P
A9:01:10 <vdgmprgrmr> What I hate about English classes is that we've got all this ancient literature forced down our throats.
A9:01:16 <Malcovent> but not necessary something you should nerd out on
A9:01:23 <liq3> Wurtex: Parents can easily teach kids the basics.
A9:01:34 <bjzaba1> I was glad to get out of school. Couldn't wait to get away from all the idiots who messed up in class.
A9:01:38 <Najkankenko> I know that if I install that I'll probably get addicted to it
A9:01:43 <Najkankenko> so I better don't even try it :P
A9:01:45 <liq3> bjzaba: You finish year 12?
A9:01:45 <Malcovent> what i love is the hypocrisy in english, 
A9:01:55 <Malcovent> they refuse to accept slang, making a new word is absolutely against everything
A9:01:59 <Wurtex> yeah sure.. but german parents got better things to do then teach their children english.. for example
A9:02:09 <Malcovent> and yet you will spend what, 6 years? learning about shakespeare
A9:02:16 <Najkankenko> haha
A9:02:17 <liq3> Wurtex: If they don't have time to teach their kids english, they shouldn't be parents.
A9:02:20 <vdgmprgrmr> I had a debate with my English teacher this year.
A9:02:23 <Malcovent> english practically worships the man, and yet he made up his own words
A9:02:32 <liq3> Well, not english, but writing mainly.
A9:02:35 <liq3> and reading. :/
A9:02:38 <bjzaba1> Malcovent: I've always wondered what linguists think about english classes
A9:02:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I asked why we had to read things in Old English.
A9:02:38 <Najkankenko> english is easy in the end
A9:02:44 <LG_Legacy> citricsquid
A9:02:52 <Najkankenko> after you got the syntax
A9:03:02 <vdgmprgrmr> If we were reading for the story, we could read something more modern, and it would be easier for us to understand.
A9:03:15 <vdgmprgrmr> If we were reading it for the language, it was pointless, because the language is dead.
A9:03:15 <LG_Legacy> Zuriki
A9:03:40 <Wurtex> of course parents teach the kids writing and reading.even talking.. but i would not blame my parents for anything if they dont tech my other langueges then their own
A9:03:53 <Najkankenko> I can speak in 3 languages
A9:03:53 <Wurtex> teach me*
A9:04:00 <Najkankenko> the local, spanish, and english
A9:04:02 <Malcovent> agreed, if there was one way i could improve english
A9:04:06 <Malcovent> id stop the worship of shakespeare
A9:04:06 <bjzaba1> Malcovent: I think english classes are usesful, because the keep the syntax in check - standardised. if everyone started speaking their own versions, people wouldn't understand each other.
A9:04:09 <liq3> Wurtex: neither would I. Thing is, even a little kid could teach THEMSELVES another language if they had say, an audio learning set.

A9:04:58 <Wurtex> but it wont do so.. sometimes you have to tell kids what to do because they like to play games all day.. and that does not teach you english.. at least normal games dont
A9:05:01 <liq3> Malcovent: Feminist?
A9:05:11 <Malcovent> slightly, favoured girls, would bitch more at boys.

A9:05:26 <Wurtex> to stay dump`? :D
A9:05:27 <Malcovent> which she repeated about twelve times during a year.
A9:05:29 <Najkankenko> haha
A9:05:33 <UnknownX> my teacher was fat and nobody liked her because she made us do random projects that were impossible to finish
A9:05:41 <Malcovent> indeed, but she seemed to believe boys were what was wrong with the world.

A9:05:50 <citricsquid> The problem with school is that it hasn't evolved, it's the same as how it was 20 years ago.

A9:05:57 <liq3> DVT?

A9:06:40 <Malcovent> schools and religion, anyone have some deeply religious primary school here?
A9:06:41 <citricsquid> but yes, basically.
A9:06:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Malcovent: Yeah.
A9:06:59 <citricsquid> I could learn so much without school now and schools don't seem to understand that.
A9:07:03 <Malcovent> pretty disgusting if you look back on them
A9:07:08 <liq3> bjzaba: wot? How would playing video games give you that?

A9:07:32 <Malcovent> the kind that made you do pressups for swearing/blaspheming

A9:21:59 <Darkebrz> Though $2,000,000 is still ridiculous, it was McDonalds fault

A9:22:36 <LG_Legacy> It would be ridiculous if it wasn't hot.

A10:00:34 <Ausfriend> if yours is the only computer

A10:03:05 <Ausfriend> yes
A10:03:06 <LG_Legacy> For a minute
A10:03:11 <Ausfriend> you'll have to manually configure it

A10:03:59 <Darkebrz> I do not

A10:09:13 <Ausfriend> smash it open with a hammer and drink the mechanical fluids

A10:09:39 <Ausfriend> you cant

A10:11:19 <Darkebrz> I'm not using wireless

A10:11:25 <PuyoDead> what

A11:40:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Just most of them.
A11:40:49 <vdgmprgrmr> There's two people that don't want to kill you!
A11:41:22 <ZomBuster> seriously it get incredible stupid at the end
A11:41:29 <vdgmprgrmr> The game was actually extremely fun before fire lost ground in the war for reality.
A11:41:56 <ZomBuster> "hey please kill faction leader x" "no wait dont kill me kill faction leader y" "oh dear please kill faction leader z and then kill me"
A11:41:59 <vdgmprgrmr> The whole everyone-wants-you-dead thing is a bit weird, but I really am just playing it for gunfights.
A11:42:21 <vdgmprgrmr> And there are LOTS of gunfights.
A11:42:27 <ZomBuster> yeh shooting is fun
A11:42:32 <ZomBuster> blowing shit up

A11:42:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I have it cranked up to the hardest difficulty level possible.
A11:43:06 <ZomBuster> later on I just used 2 grenade launcher and the rpg.
A11:43:21 <vdgmprgrmr> So I actually have to be all tactical and stuff.
A11:43:23 <ZomBuster> KABLOOIE
A11:43:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I prefer standard guns to explosives, myself.
A11:44:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Another thing I noticed is that it's really, really weak on the blood.
A11:45:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, I don't like super gory mess type things, but when I put a high-powered sniper round into a guy's face up against a wall, the wall should look a bit nasty.

A11:47:21 <LG_Legacy> Wicked
A11:47:38 <vdgmprgrmr> But there's not even any blood-spatter AT ALL
A11:47:57 <vdgmprgrmr> There's a small blood-sprite thing in the air where you hit them, but that's the extent of all the gore in the game.
A11:48:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless, maybe, there's SUPPOSED to be blood-spatter on walls, but they don't exist for me for some reason.
A11:48:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Like fire.

A11:53:02 <LG_Legacy> It's alright

A11:54:34 <LG_Legacy> I can only imagine grenades
A11:54:47 <PuyoDead> the multiplayer demo was a blast
A11:55:00 <PuyoDead> all weapons did the same "bodily harm" damage
A11:55:12 <PuyoDead> so you could throw a knife at someone, and take off their leg

A11:58:49 <LG_Legacy> Don't think it would be

A11:59:33 <JTE> How would be the best way to make a blacklist of griefers which will be strong against false entries?
A11:59:53 <PuyoDead> that's a good question
P12:00:03 <LG_Legacy> By making a website with registered users can input it, but only trusted users can add them onto the list.
P12:00:14 <LG_Legacy> These trusted users are Server Admins
P12:00:19 <LG_Legacy> And are verified by proof in-game.

P12:01:53 <Adura> I'd wait for more dev by Notch before feeling a blacklist distribution is needed.
P12:02:05 <LG_Legacy> True but some people don't want to wait
P12:02:09 <Adura> Eheh.

P1:26:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I want to play games. Especially freeware type games.
P1:27:05 <vdgmprgrmr> That I can just download and put on an SD card and play or some-such.
P1:27:08 <PuyoDead> if you're going for "freeware", you might want to look into homebrew for both
P1:27:20 <PuyoDead> which I can answer pretty much any question on that matter
P1:27:22 <Zuriki> Or piracy.
P1:27:30 <Zuriki> Piracy is good.
P1:27:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Piracy works too.
P1:27:32 <Zuriki> :D
P1:27:35 <PuyoDead> same difference when it comes to them
P1:27:59 <Zuriki> If you get the old PSP Fat you can pirate easy
P1:28:06 <Zuriki> Slim, you have to be careful.
P1:28:09 <PuyoDead> psp slim is just as easy
P1:28:14 <Zuriki> And Brite, you're screwed.
P1:28:17 <Zuriki> Yeah but
P1:28:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, I already know some games I'd like to play on the DS (POWDER, for example).
P1:28:23 <PuyoDead> but, you do have to watch out for specific motherboard models
P1:28:35 <Zuriki> Thats what I was talking about

P1:28:54 <vdgmprgrmr> PSP seems all computery and less just-freakin-works.

P1:29:11 <Zuriki> Oh
P1:29:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I really want something that just-freakin-works.
P1:29:36 <Zuriki> Go DS then you lazy ass mofo
P1:29:46 <vdgmprgrmr>  :'(
P1:29:55 <PuyoDead> you'll have to buy a flash cart for DS. for PSP, you'll need someone with an already hacked PSP, or order a specific battery
P1:30:07 <Zuriki> Or just get a really old model
P1:30:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Getting sick of having to pander to the intricacies of my standard computer.

P1:34:18 <PuyoDead> after final fantasy just became the same damn game over and over, I just figure it's the same game, and pretty much just a "mod"
P1:34:56 <Zuriki> When did it start repeating itself at 7 or 11
P1:35:15 <Dilt> When did those blocklanders find minecraft?
P1:35:15 <PuyoDead> well, the story has been much the same since 5 or 6
P1:35:31 <PuyoDead> 10 was the only one to be any different
P1:35:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I know people who are super die-hard FF fans.
P1:35:39 <PuyoDead> and that's only because it told the story in reverse "{

P1:35:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said if they were sad or not.

P1:36:50 <PuyoDead> more of the same, if you like it
P1:37:03 <vdgmprgrmr> I've started to think maybe they're all huge FF fans JUST BECAUSE they're all huge FF fans.
P1:37:08 <Zuriki> I'll never play a Final Fantasy game for the one thing that it's based on.
P1:37:10 <PuyoDead> exactly
P1:37:11 <Zuriki> The combat system.

P1:37:58 <PuyoDead> 12 tried to change it up... but was just clumsy as hell

P1:46:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I sometimes fantasize about what the gaming would be like in a communist utopia.
P1:46:13 <LG_Legacy> ... o_O
P1:46:20 <PuyoDead> that's an odd fantasy
P1:46:26 <LG_Legacy> You would have Bully, the game.

P1:46:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Note, "utopia"
P1:47:07 <vdgmprgrmr> That is, communism as intended, not as retarded dictators make it.
P1:47:12 <PuyoDead> sadly, it's usually the big name companies that put out the most trite, boring crap
P1:47:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Either way, if game developers didn't have to worry about income being affected by making creative, new games.
P1:48:28 <PuyoDead> yea, with publishers like EA breathing down the neck of developers, forcing them to do everything in an exact way, in an exact time... things might be more creative
P1:48:50 <TrueWolves> Thus the gems do pop up from time to time, just not often
P1:49:16 <PuyoDead> err, there's supposed to be a "if they didn't" of some form in there

P1:56:04 <JTE> Respond to XaFar, Darkebrz. He's watching the server for me while I work on Rurl.
P1:56:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I torrented it.
P1:56:27 <vdgmprgrmr> It's just an iso, with a cracked exe with it.
P1:56:53 <Darkebrz> Hm
P1:58:48 <JTE> I pirated FarCry, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Ghost Recon, and others that one labor day weekend when Ubisoft gave it all away for free THEMSELVES.
P1:59:20 <Darkebrz> Wait
P1:59:21 <JTE> ... The catch was they embedded McDonalds ads into them, but I hacked that out by simply replacing a single DLL file with a blank one. That simple.
P1:59:31 <Darkebrz> You pirated the free copys?
P1:59:35 <vdgmprgrmr> lulz
13P1:59:36 * JTE nods.
P1:59:45 <Darkebrz> I pirated Far Cry
P1:59:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I pirated Far Cry 1 as well.
P1:59:56 <Darkebrz> But everything said it was free
P1:59:59 <vdgmprgrmr> But it kind of sucked.
P2:00:00 <Darkebrz> So I thought it was
P2:00:04 <Darkebrz> Far Cry is hard
P2:00:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is why it sucked.
P2:00:19 <JTE> It was free. Just with McDonalds ads.
P2:00:25 <vdgmprgrmr> It was, like, realistic combat, with unrealistic numbers of enemies.
P2:00:26 <TrueWolves> Mario the Lost levels is hard as hell
P2:00:34 <TrueWolves> ahhh....
P2:00:56 <JTE> I don't do stealthy games. :(
P2:01:33 <]SteGriff> Citricsquid?
P2:01:39 <vdgmprgrmr> I tend to dislike games that focus ONLY on stealth.
P2:01:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Or any single gameplay mechanic, really.
P2:02:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Just shooting or just sneaking or just staring at numbers representing attributes gets boring.

P2:57:31 <Setveen> Is citricsquid here right now?
P2:57:41 <Quatroking> No, but I am
P2:57:41 <Azjherben> becuase OME is alot easier than in game working
P2:57:49 <Quatroking> I'm his older brother
P2:57:53 <ZomBuster> you do cut away the complicated stuff so people don't have to worry about that
P2:58:15 <Azjherben> but, tree(10,10,32) is alot easier than making a peice of wood and going up a layer etc.
