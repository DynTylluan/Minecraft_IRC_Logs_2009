A12:14:45 <Darkebrz> Lol
A12:14:45 <kryptn> lol
A12:14:57 <vede> Ubuntu screensavers are made of freaking win.
A12:14:58 <Darkebrz> There was something allnaturalx wanted me to download as soon as I got Ubuntu D:
A12:15:06 <vede> Oh yeah.
A12:15:13 <vede> ubuntu-restricted-packages.
A12:15:17 <Darkebrz> What is that?
10A12:15:33 * Dudebro (chatzilla@adsl-68-94-0-49.dsl.rcsntx.swbell.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:15:33 <vede> It's basically everything that can't be packaged with Ubuntu for copyright reasons.
12A12:15:44 * Dudebro (chatzilla@adsl-68-94-0-49.dsl.rcsntx.swbell.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

A12:15:48 <kryptn> Ah
A12:15:52 <kryptn> yeah
A12:15:58 <kryptn> couple of those are pretty neat
A12:16:03 <vede> So...
A12:16:18 <vede> Go to the terminal and type "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-packages"
A12:16:19 <Darkebrz> I like this :)
A12:16:22 <vede> I think.
A12:17:03 <Darkebrz> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
A12:17:03 <Darkebrz> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
A12:17:15 <vede>  O_o
A12:17:28 <vede> Uh...
A12:17:44 <vede> Try again?
A12:17:45 <Darkebrz> I tried it again, and..
A12:17:53 <Darkebrz> Reading package lists... Done
A12:17:53 <Darkebrz> Building dependency tree       
A12:17:53 <Darkebrz> Reading state information... Done
A12:17:53 <Darkebrz> E: Couldn't find package unbuntu-restricted-packages
A12:17:58 <vede> Hm.
A12:18:03 <vede> Yeah, that makes more sense.
A12:18:08 <vede> Uh, dude.
A12:18:14 <kryptn> sudo apt-get update
A12:18:14 <vede> It's ubuntu, not unbuntu
A12:18:25 <vede> :/
A12:18:29 <kryptn> lol
A12:18:37 <Darkebrz> Lol
A12:19:09 <Darkebrz> It was restricted extras :)
A12:20:44 <Darkebrz> I actually like downloading stuff in Ubuntu a lot more than in windows >_>
A12:20:51 <Darkebrz> Sooo much simpler

A12:24:25 <vede> [00:19] <vede> Hey kryptn, you're an ubuntu-user right?
A12:24:26 <vede> [00:20] <vede> I need to figure out how to get PulseAudio working right...
A12:24:28 <vede> [00:20] <vede> And I dare not try to get help in the massive clusterfuck that is #ubuntu

A12:25:00 <kryptn> well, sorry to say, but i dont do too much with the audio in ubuntu
A12:25:05 <vede> Damn.
A12:25:21 <kryptn> the speakers in my eee are generally crappy and not worth working with
A12:25:24 <vede> I need to get Skype working, but it won't pick up my headset.
A12:25:36 <kryptn> huh.. hmm..
A12:25:46 <kryptn> there.. there should be a setting somewhere..
A12:25:47 <kryptn> hold on
A12:25:59 <kryptn> have you checked http://ubuntuforums.org
A12:26:03 <vede> Yes.
A12:26:13 <kryptn> haha
A12:26:19 <vede> I have PulseAudio, and it actually recognizes my headset.
A12:26:34 <vede> Like, I can talk into it and PulseAudio will report that it hears me.
A12:26:40 <vede> But Skype won't pick it up.
A12:26:54 <vede> And I can't figure out how to put my sound output onto my headset.
A12:27:51 <Darkebrz> D:
A12:27:56 <Darkebrz> Minecraft wont run
A12:28:05 <Darkebrz> But I believe java is installed...

A12:28:09 <Darkebrz> No
A12:28:20 <Darkebrz> Doesnt show the window
A12:28:33 <Darkebrz> Oh

A12:30:11 <Darkebrz> Looks like black screen
A12:30:16 <vede> Yeah, just wait for it.
A12:30:28 <vede> It'll start up eventually.
A12:30:41 <vede> I wound up exiting, thinking it wasn't gonna load, but...
A12:30:56 <vede> After it happened a few times, I just left it.
A12:30:58 <vede> And it started.
A12:31:06 <Darkebrz> Stiiiiilllll blaaack
A12:31:33 <Darkebrz> How long do you want me to wait? >_<
A12:31:37 <vede> If it seriously takes, like, a LONG TIME that is VERY LONG, you might try refreshing.
A12:32:04 <Darkebrz> I just did refresh
A12:32:20 <Darkebrz> Time to download some games!
A12:32:40 <vede> It's possible that you'll need to reboot, after all those updates.
A12:32:42 <vede> And...
A12:32:49 <vede> you downloaded your video drivers, correct?
A12:33:03 <Darkebrz> Errr
A12:33:05 <Darkebrz> How do I do that?
A12:33:13 <vede> That thing at the top right.

A12:36:18 <Darkebrz> They both rejoined/left
A12:36:20 <vede> I had a ping timeout.

A12:39:59 <ZarroTsu> I'd like to ask; how do you host a minecraft server correctly? I can get it up and running for MYSELF correctly, but others can;t seem to join from the external URL link
A12:40:11 <mail2345|afk> err
A12:40:15 <mail2345|afk> port foward
A12:40:16 <ZarroTsu> port 25565 is open, both on router and firewalls
A12:40:31 <kryptn> is it forwarded to your local ip?
A12:40:36 <ZarroTsu> yes
10A12:40:37 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:40:56 <kryptn> can you join from the ext. url?
A12:41:12 <ZarroTsu> no
A12:41:20 <ZarroTsu> only the 127.0.0.1
A12:41:25 <kryptn> ah.
A12:41:34 <ZarroTsu> I'll double check the port
A12:41:37 <kryptn> hmm..
A12:41:39 <Darkebrz> Well
A12:41:44 <Darkebrz> Im gonna install Chromium
A12:41:46 <kryptn> yeah i've got not much of an idea
A12:41:51 <TestDummy> That's probably because some routers don't like connections back onto themseles through forwarded ports.
A12:41:53 <kryptn> Darkebrz, you can get it from google!
A12:42:21 <kryptn> official google chrome from google for linux!
A12:42:31 <Darkebrz> I can?
A12:42:38 <kryptn> Yeah
A12:42:42 <kryptn> chrome.google.com
A12:42:52 <kryptn> it'll say that it's still in development*
A12:43:01 <kryptn> and at the bottom there's a link to the dev-release
A12:43:04 <TestDummy> What from Google isn't?
A12:43:12 <ZarroTsu> hm, had DG open, not IPv4
A12:43:17 <ZarroTsu> that might help a tad
13A12:43:22 * ZarroTsu swaps
A12:43:22 <kryptn> that leads you to a .deb download
A12:43:24 <kryptn> :)
A12:43:29 <kryptn> And it works fine for me
A12:44:02 <Darkebrz> kryptn, It sure doesnt seem like that
A12:44:36 <Darkebrz> It wants me to enter my email then get notified when its released >_>
A12:45:23 <kryptn> One second
A12:45:28 <kryptn> i gotta pull out my netbook
A12:45:51 <TestDummy> http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=unstable_i386_deb
A12:45:54 <TestDummy> You're welcome.
A12:45:59 <TestDummy> Oh wait.
A12:46:05 <kryptn> Nor not
A12:46:08 <kryptn> lol
A12:46:08 <TestDummy> Wait, never mind.
A12:46:12 <kryptn> that's it
A12:46:17 <TestDummy> That is the link to the DEB, after you accept a EULA.
A12:47:35 <mail2345|afk> http://www.minecraft.net/survivaltest/index.jsp?user=mail2345&id=0 anyone here managed to clean up the lava on this level?
A12:47:54 <TheOne> No I died
A12:48:12 <mail2345|afk> how much land did you reclaim
A12:48:14 <mail2345|afk> and how?
A12:48:45 <TheOne> None, dug down to get more blocks, came back up and fell in the lava...
A12:52:09 <Darkebrz> ...
A12:52:14 <Darkebrz> I think I need sound drivers

A12:55:11 <TestDummy> So, you go from needing a Chrome DEB to sound drivers? :|

A12:58:17 <Colain> Water survival?

A1:08:12 <TestDummy> Darkebrz: So, did you manage to install the DEB I linked to or is nobody in here still not trusting me?
A1:08:39 <TestDummy> I mean, so far anything Linux-related I've said has to do with misguided shell pranks.

A1:11:12 <Visiiri> Ohok
A1:11:13 <mail2345> setup a telnet server
A1:11:14 <TestDummy> I haven't since 2004.
A1:11:19 <TestDummy> I'd be of no help to you.
A1:11:20 <mail2345> set the root password to root
A1:11:27 <Visiiri> Well, thanks anyway.
A1:11:27 <mail2345> :D
A1:11:28 <TestDummy> All I know is that mIRC has an autoperform list.

A1:12:10 <mail2345> just wait for the script kiddies
A1:12:14 <mail2345> they are a knocking
A1:12:35 <yoshibot> heh
A1:12:53 <mail2345> your box should be screwed over in <30mins
A1:12:55 <yoshibot> maybe compile a backdoor of your own into the server's kernel so you can watch them do it?
A1:13:02 <mail2345> yep
A1:13:07 <mail2345> of course windwos is worse
A1:13:18 <mail2345> 5mins for unpatched xp sp0
A1:13:24 <yoshibot> Run it in a VM. :3
A1:13:38 <TestDummy> I had to deal with a pre-SP1 XP box last week.
A1:13:47 <TheOne> well its allready 1 hour into a new day and I feel like crap...
A1:13:49 <TestDummy> You can't update it directly to SP3, it's too old.
A1:13:56 <yoshibot> SP1->SP3?
10A1:14:07 * vede (vede@wsip-174-79-145-80.tu.ok.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
A1:14:33 <TestDummy> SP2-SP3 in my case.
A1:14:58 <TestDummy> I had much better luck finding the SP2 download off their site than SP1. Somebody I talked to still insisted they provide it, however.
A1:15:40 <mail2345> time to try to reclaim more land
A1:15:56 <yoshibot> in what, mail2345?
A1:16:02 <mail2345> fff

A2:07:47 <Griskard> Good prison though
A2:07:56 <citricsquid> my first thought what "what the fuck, an exploding penis?"
A2:07:56 <Griskard> You cant steal blocks
A2:08:07 <]Kratospie> He made survial almost completly from scratch
A2:08:14 <Griskard> Your penis is green Citric?

A2:08:27 <vede> My first thought was "OH MY GOD YES THIS IS SO AWESOME"
A2:08:34 <Griskard> http://minecraft.net/survivaltest/?user=ZomBuster&id=1
A2:08:37 <vede> My second was "Oh, well, this sucks..."
A2:08:49 <vede> :/
A2:08:54 <Colain> I thought it was gay at first, but now, I think its awesome.
A2:08:56 <Griskard> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2435
A2:08:57 <Colain> I have no idea why.
A2:09:17 <vede> The first version was so easy you may as well have just played Sandbox really slowly.
A2:09:20 <Jesse> I know he's been working hard, but at the rate he was updating and adding new stuff before, I expected more.
A2:09:32 <Jesse> It's a lot more fun now though.
A2:09:33 <citricsquid> Jesse: The entire base is done though
A2:09:39 <vede> The new version is BETTER, but still really easy, and has some MAJOR design flaws, like randomly dying enemies.
A2:09:39 <citricsquid> so now the extra updates will take less time.
A2:09:46 <Colain> True, he could've given us more. We should semi-complain.
A2:09:50 <Griskard> The exploding penises annoy me
A2:10:08 <Griskard> I build a massive base, and forking boom
A2:10:12 <Griskard> Gone
A2:10:13 <Colain> 10 Euro for that amount of stuff in like a month is kinda a rip-off, when you think of Gmod.
A2:10:32 <]Kratospie> he sort of explaned the dying enimes, lonleyness
A2:10:33 <Jesse> I hate that they spawn in my base. What's the point of spending time making walls, and then i walk around and KABOOM exploding cock obliterates my corridor.
A2:10:53 <vede> I'd say you can only judge whether the price was a rip-off when the project stops beind developed.
A2:11:22 <Griskard> Yeah Jesse
A2:11:29 <Griskard> But that will all be fixed I guess
A2:11:45 <vede> I love the creepers.
A2:11:54 <]Kratospie> Creepers are awesome
A2:11:56 <Jesse> They're cool, but not when they spawn in my base.
A2:12:00 <Colain> I can imagine like 20 people saying "Notch, we love you and all but please, fucking please, make more shit for minecraft" 
A2:12:04 <vede> They're ALWAYS cool.
A2:12:09 <Colain> I wonder what his reaction would be...
A2:12:20 <]Kratospie> i want light blocks, that all i want
A2:12:21 <Colain> Creepers aren't cool on an omen map :(
A2:12:23 <vede> His reaction would be "I'm trying."
A2:12:37 <vede> I'd bet every single one of my fifty cents on it.
A2:12:43 <citricsquid> guys
A2:12:44 <citricsquid> guys
A2:12:44 <]Kratospie> i want light blocks, that all i want
A2:12:47 <TrueWolves> Creepers is what make my omen map 10 times better, though it's made to be so
A2:12:51 <Jesse> I hope development speeds up again, if we start getting very frequent updates again, it'll be awesome
A2:12:55 <Colain> I say compain.
A2:12:58 <citricsquid> Jesse: It will
A2:13:05 <citricsquid> he's built the entire base for survival now
A2:13:11 <citricsquid> the next parts are minimal work in comparison
A2:13:16 <citricsquid> so we'll get stuff lots faster now :D
A2:13:21 <vede> I figure we'll have more frequent Survival updates when he returns from Indonesia.
A2:13:33 <citricsquid> the entire base is done, he's just got to build upon it.
A2:13:38 <Jesse> yeah, citricsquid, I realize he had to program alll the functions for survival just to get it functional, he couldn't really release it in chunks.
A2:13:41 <vede> I mean, he managed to COMPLETELY overhaul skeletons and make combat actually FUN in just a day.
A2:13:52 <citricsquid> shooty skeletons are win
A2:14:08 <]Kratospie> I hope he adds the signs to sandbox
A2:14:09 <vede> Skeletons are the best enemies in the whole game right now.
A2:14:12 <Colain> True/
A2:14:19 <kryptn> Until you run out of arrows
A2:14:21 <kryptn> then i lose.
A2:14:22 <citricsquid> ]Kratospie: They will be, but OP only IIRC.
A2:14:22 <kryptn> lol
A2:14:24 <vede> Are you kidding?
A2:14:32 <vede> Skeletons are MORE fun if you're low on arrows.
A2:14:33 <kryptn> Not really.
A2:14:38 <Colain> I remember fighting my first arrow skeles, didn't get hurt, but it was fun.
A2:14:43 <vede> Since you gotta go from cover to cover to get close enough to take one out.
A2:14:43 <citricsquid> you have to dance around to survive :D
A2:14:47 <]Kratospie> Anyone have any block ideas?
A2:15:11 <vede> Yep, I do.
A2:15:24 <vede> Coalpile, iron bars.
A2:15:34 <]Kratospie> Light
A2:15:48 <]Kratospie> proper elevators
A2:15:54 <TrueWolves> My block ideas...
A2:15:54 <vede> Proper elevators?
A2:15:55 <Jesse>  I captured a shitload of them in a pit in the ground, and i thought for sure they would've disappeared after like 10 minutes. I opened up the door to the jail, and they all swarmed out. I was gunned down in a hail of like a billion arrows. 
A2:15:58 <Griskard> Sqids
A2:15:58 <vede> I say stick with stairs.
A2:16:41 <vede> I think my coolest skelly experience was the time I was lost in a cave, and I entered a room (for the fifth time or so) and suddenly a wall blew up and a team of skeletons swarmed in.
A2:16:52 <]Kratospie> ok then, make stairs that dont require constant jumping

A2:17:36 <TrueWolves> 3 kinds of crystal like blocks, 4 more kinds of stone (marble, and such), all mostly for flavor, wooden slopes/stairs, stone slopes/stairs (saddly each of those if 8) that right there is 23 blocks, then admin glass, and admin sponge, when limited water comes in, anti water force blocks to act like the current sponges
A2:17:43 <TrueWolves> 26 blocks in total
A2:17:46 <vede> I think stairs should stay as they already are.
A2:17:54 <TrueWolves> 16 of those really just 2
A2:17:55 <citricsquid> I was in a cave, everything was quiet and then a crepper popped up, no big deal, I started killing it while walking backwards to escape, didn't see a hole and went straight through it, ended up between 3 skeletons and got totally raped.
A2:18:07 <citricsquid> that was win
A2:18:18 <vede> I think we don't really need slope blocks.
A2:18:20 <]Kratospie> admin glass and light, thats all i want
A2:18:25 <Jesse> I constantly get knocked into my lavapit by monsters.
A2:18:28 <citricsquid> Yeah, the fun is in building our own stairs
A2:18:30 <Jesse> Sneaky bastards.
A2:18:51 <vede> Everything should stay as either blocks or sprites.
A2:18:57 <Colain> Green Smaradge is fun
A2:19:18 <]Kratospie> yeah, like the light block could be a lightbulb, like the flowers and stuff
A2:19:18 <Jesse> It would be cool if we could make our own little sprites, sort of like the flowers.
A2:19:23 <Jesse> And place them.
A2:19:37 <]Kratospie> you can...with tile editing
A2:19:44 <Jesse> No one else can see them though.
A2:19:48 <]Kratospie> yeah
10A2:20:03 * ]Kratospie is now known as Kratospie
A2:20:10 <vede> I've done some private mod servers.
A2:20:25 <vede> One for SMB, another so me and a friend could make a medieval tileset.
A2:21:43 <Kratospie> if a light block comes out, should it shine straight down, or shine in a large area
A2:22:18 <Jesse> It would be annoying to have to cover your entire ceiling with them just to have a well lite room.
A2:22:24 <Kratospie> yeah
A2:22:26 <Jesse> *lit
A2:22:29 <Kratospie> thats what i was thinking
A2:22:34 <Griskard> In the current manner it shines  directly down
A2:22:36 <Griskard> But yeah
A2:22:42 <Kratospie> i would hope it would act like a real lightbulb
A2:23:29 <Jesse> a lightbulb would seem pretty out of place in minecraft imo
A2:23:31 <Kratospie> then that giant shadow my spleef arena created could be filed
A2:23:40 <TrueWolves> I can't wait for pets
A2:23:44 <TrueWolves> You know it's going to happen
A2:24:05 <Colain> No I don't.
A2:24:09 <Kratospie> minecrafts some sort of modernday-medivel mix
A2:24:19 <Jesse> How is it a modern day mix?
A2:24:25 <Kratospie> glass?
A2:24:37 <Kratospie> people make citys
A2:24:42 <TrueWolves> it's mostly medivel, we just biuld citys and sometimes spaceships with midevil parts =D
A2:25:03 <Kratospie> still, a lightbulb or torch block would be amazing
A2:25:07 <Colain> Or robots.
A2:25:12 <Colain> I've seen robots.
A2:25:39 <Kratospie> that way people who make buildings in the sky wouldnt leave giant dead grass spaces
A2:25:51 <Kratospie> and caves would be easier to light up
A2:25:55 <Colain> Hell, in the archive theres a town, it is called the market, for sales.

A8:24:36 <Evil-Ville> Oh no parents monitoring their children
A8:24:43 <Evil-Ville> That's the absolute worst
A8:24:48 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: So?
A8:25:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  That's censorship citricsquid... Come on, think about if your parents only let you access appropriate sites
A8:25:30 <citricsquid> lmfao
A8:25:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Where would you be now?
A8:25:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> in #neopetz no doubt
A8:25:41 <doohan> haha
A8:25:50 <citricsquid> neopets is awesome
A8:25:59 <TrueWolves> That site has some very fun minigames
A8:26:04 <citricsquid> So openDNS are awful for allowing a company to use their technology to make parental filters?
A8:26:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> *sigh*
A8:26:14 <citricsquid> nothing wrong with parental filters :|
A8:26:18 <TrueWolves> to bad I only go there once every 6 months and the pets I have starve a lot
A8:26:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Actually there is, but whatever
A8:26:27 <Evil-Ville> AlLnAtuRalX is an angsty teenager though
A8:26:33 <citricsquid> Evil-Ville: tru dat
A8:26:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Evil-Ville is a pre-teen
A8:26:39 <TrueWolves> I should pay someone money in the game to look after them, it makes me feel bad, even if it's a kid game and there just data
A8:26:49 <citricsquid> TrueWolves: data has feelings too
A8:26:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll do it for $20/month
A8:26:57 <TrueWolves> =/
A8:26:58 <Quatroking> I learned binary today
A8:27:02 <doohan> 1?
A8:27:13 <TrueWolves> I would at best pay you the points I get for taking there damn survays
A8:27:17 <Evil-Ville> Parents can monitor what their children can see on the internet as much as they want for all I care
A8:27:23 <TrueWolves> I agree
A8:27:37 <doohan> It's a waste of money
A8:27:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> So your parents would approve of your beasty habits Evil-Ville ?
A8:27:49 <Evil-Ville> beasty habits?
A8:27:49 <doohan> No filter or proxy has ever held me back
A8:27:52 <Quatroking> 101010 is 42
A8:27:54 <Quatroking> yay
A8:27:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hmmm, http://img.4chan.org/
A8:27:55 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: that's not what he said
A8:28:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> I wonder what that is?
A8:28:05 <TrueWolves> Think of it this way
A8:28:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> let's chec---OH MY GOD
A8:28:13 <citricsquid> He said it's fine for parents to monitor their kids activities, nothing more.
13A8:28:19 * Quatroking slaps allnaturalx
A8:28:25 <Quatroking> there's nothing wrong with 4chan you asshole
A8:28:29 <doohan> Can I kick him?
A8:28:33 <Quatroking> do it
A8:28:34 <doohan> No I really shouldn't.
A8:28:38 <doohan> I'm on a diet.
A8:28:48 <TrueWolves> If your parents want to watch you, they should be able to, if said kid is smart enough to bypass it, he's smart enough to not have to be watched, as long as he remains unlazy enough to do so, which means me all for it, =P
A8:29:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> TrueWolves, it's not a filter it's a monitoring system
A8:29:17 <Evil-Ville> So what?
A8:29:18 <doohan> Usually they go hand in hand though AlLnAtuRalX
A8:29:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> And good like bypassing custom DNS without admin access, especially if it's ONT HE ROUTER
A8:29:28 <Evil-Ville> They could monitor it by looking behind the child's back
A8:29:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which is also bad
A8:29:40 <Evil-Ville> No it's not
A8:29:54 <TrueWolves> Sometimes it's a good idea =/
A8:30:09 <TrueWolves> If your using your parent's computer, you don't have privacy
A8:30:22 <TrueWolves> Thats why this is my computer, and I pitch in with the internet (a tiny bit)
A8:30:26 <Evil-Ville> Do you think it's fine to let 10 year olds browse ogrish or whatever
A8:30:30 <TrueWolves> so I have all the privacy I want.
A8:30:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Evil-Ville, yes.
A8:30:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A8:30:49 <Evil-Ville> Then you're a retard I am sorry
A8:30:57 <citricsquid> Evil-Ville: I agree :)
A8:31:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Evil-Ville, letting your parents see what you're accessing and what you're saying seems like an odd position to take for your age
A8:31:19 <doohan> I used to read sites about doing fun stuff with computers
A8:31:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> I agree citricsquid might not care, because his parents probably wouldn't
A8:31:31 <doohan> Most of that stuff was banned at the school by default
A8:31:34 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: he's not really 12 :|
A8:31:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> But it's odd for you
A8:31:36 <Evil-Ville> Yes my delicate age of 19 years old
A8:31:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Orly?  I thought he said he was before citricsquid 
A8:31:49 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: being unable to detect sillyiness on the internet.
A8:31:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn.  time to check the logs
A8:31:55 <citricsquid> I did
A8:31:56 <citricsquid> as a joke
A8:31:56 <citricsquid> :|
A8:32:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, before that
A8:32:04 <Evil-Ville> I could have said it as a joke also
A8:32:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Twice as in
A8:32:10 <citricsquid> I've said it multiple times
A8:32:14 <citricsquid> I said it weeks back also :D
A8:32:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
A8:32:24 <citricsquid> and Evil-Ville has said he's 19 multiple times.
A8:32:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well maybe he was on my ignore list
A8:32:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> or he never talks when I'm on
A8:33:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> BTW, citricsquid, someone linked me this a few mins ago, I think it's funny: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2397
A8:33:46 <Evil-Ville> Also my parents did monitor what I did on the computer back when I was 12
A8:33:55 <Evil-Ville> Because the computer was in the living room
A8:34:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> You see, mine didn't, and I'm not crazy.  Am I?
A8:34:03 <citricsquid> I was also in the same situation.
A8:34:03 <Evil-Ville> It never bothered me
A8:34:12 <citricsquid> It did me good, I'm more careful when watching porn now.
A8:34:57 <citricsquid> My brother uses the PC in the front room, why we would my parents let him go unsupervised?
A8:35:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, I for one had my own computer that I stopped my parents from throwing out and stole.  Windows 95 with a 15 inch CRT monitor.
A8:35:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, then again, you live in the UK, so you're used to police-state scenarios
A8:35:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Those surveillance cameras are fine, right?
A8:35:43 <citricsquid> LOL
A8:36:00 <citricsquid> I bet you wear a tinfoil hat, don't you?
A8:36:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ha, not quite
A8:36:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's aluminum foil

A8:39:28 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX is the one who wanted to be deleted from the forum
A8:39:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sorry to break it to you
A8:39:32 <citricsquid> because I gave pink names to mods
A8:39:48 <TrueWolves> I'm not even going to argue over that anymore, that was a poor coralation.

A8:40:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Maybe inside citricsquid's tentacles
A8:41:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, citricsquid, I left the forums because they were retarded.  I left *server administration* because of that.  IT was the only section I posted in/read anymore
A8:42:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> And I think, reading through it today with that link someone sent me, it's very funny how the clueless people left there argue over completely false and baseless points that are like saying "He has a tumor.  Let's scalpel his vertebrae with a spinal tap."
A8:42:48 <Evil-Ville> Did the pink color threaten your masculinity?
A8:42:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I actually find it very funny now-a-days, just like 4chan

A9:05:16 <Iguana> I changed Vista into that Windows 98 or 2000 or whatever theme.
A9:05:20 <Iguana> I prefer it this way. :P
A9:05:23 <citricsquid> w7, with a bit of configuring does it perfectly.
A9:05:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> I installed Ubuntu at a senior home near me where I volunteer
A9:05:36 <PuyoDead> I don't see how vista's extra aesthetic effects are any different than compiz
A9:05:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> They were thanking me for days
A9:05:51 <Marach> yay :)
A9:05:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Compiz is better.. .with its plugins, hundreds of effects
A9:06:00 <offset> PuyoDead, 3d CUBE!
A9:06:01 <PuyoDead> yea, but... are they needed?
A9:06:01 <citricsquid> uh, how is linux easier than windows?
A9:06:04 <offset> so effective!
A9:06:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, no
A9:06:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, for old people, ti is
A9:06:13 <citricsquid> :|
A9:06:16 <offset> uhh...
A9:06:22 <PuyoDead> exactly. they are both nice looking and all, but not needed
A9:06:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> for just websurfing.  No malware, no hassle, no reinstalling O/S, easy updates
A9:06:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you're used to Windows, you won't like it
A9:06:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's harder for powerusers to convert than casual users
A9:06:43 <citricsquid> I like linux
A9:06:49 <citricsquid> but it isn't suitable as a desktop IMO
A9:06:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're gravely mistaken
A9:07:05 <citricsquid> if I could use linux without having to constantly fuck with it, I would.
A9:07:05 <PuyoDead> I have a bad habit of breaking every linux install I try
A9:07:07 <Evil-Ville> Don't say that citricsquid 2010 is going to be year of linux desktop

A9:08:16 <Evil-Ville> Linux might be easier for old people if you're talking about those really simple distros meant for netbooks
A9:08:22 <PuyoDead> granted, ubuntu has been better for me with each release (except the last one), but I still manage to get my hands in it too much and break it over time
A9:08:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> No Evil-Ville standard Ubuntu
A9:08:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> All they do is press the firefox and go online
A9:08:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> press the solitare and play
A9:08:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> and press the power button and shutdown
A9:08:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's all
A9:08:53 <offset> Give them limited user access, it's pretty bulletproof 
A9:09:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> You should always have limited access in any kind of OS
A9:09:13 <PuyoDead> that and the fact that it auto-updates much more gracefully than windows helps
A9:09:26 <offset> Sure, but who actually does that as a desktop solution
A9:09:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup
A9:09:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> I do
A9:09:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why do I need to run admin?
A9:09:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> When I really need an admin command, I can su or use sudo
A9:09:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> But for 99% of apps giving them admin is reckless and idiotic
A9:10:14 <Evil-Ville> I am a reckless idiot >8-)
A9:10:23 <citricsquid> granted linux would be fine if you were ONLY using it, but who has their own network admin? 99% of home users could never understand how to administrate linux properly.
A9:10:26 <offset> well yeah, for linux giving them admin would be silly
A9:10:26 <PuyoDead> likewise
A9:10:32 <PuyoDead> hence why I break it every time
A9:10:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> For Windows too offset :P

A10:00:53 <doohan> nah the server
A10:00:59 <citricsquid> Visiiri: Don't think so

A10:01:16 <Visiiri> I found a good method
A10:01:17 <Evil-Ville> Just leave the game running for a few days and enemies will kill themselves for you
A10:01:22 <Visiiri> the pigs respawn in one place

A10:02:02 <Visiiri> Alright
A10:02:08 <Visiiri> final score is 10280
A10:02:09 <citricsquid> That was totally useless. I know what I meant though.
A10:02:20 <citricsquid> Visiiri: 10,280? or 100,280?
A10:02:29 <Visiiri> oh shit
A10:02:35 <Visiiri> wrong # of 0s

A10:18:49 <Iguana> I thought you already knew...
A10:18:55 <Iguana> I told Darkebrz like last week. XD

A10:19:46 <citricsquid> coulda told me :'(

A10:21:35 <Iguana> I don't think you were awake.
A10:21:42 <Iguana> It was around 10:00pm EST.
A10:21:49 <Iguana> So it's 3am in the UK?
A10:22:10 <Iguana> So, you bringing down the banhamer?
A10:22:40 <PuyoDead> he never talked to me about coming back
A10:22:53 <PuyoDead> which he was told to do if he wanted to come back

A10:23:47 <PuyoDead> it was the message that displayed if he ever tried to visit the forums
A10:24:12 <citricsquid> Marach: more than I hate annoying people
A10:24:37 <PuyoDead> if he would have asked about coming back, I wouldn't have liked it, but it would have been allowed. this now is essentially a ban evade
A10:24:50 <Iguana> Yeah.
A10:24:58 <citricsquid> what a complete pillock
A10:25:09 <Iguana> I don't know what that is, but...I agree.

A10:29:19 <AlexVMiner> lol why?
A10:29:44 <citricsquid> because it tastes like marizpan
A10:30:37 <Iguana> Marzipan?
A10:30:42 <PuyoDead> it does?
A10:30:45 <Iguana> Now I'm thinking of Homestarrunner.
A10:30:46 <Iguana> ...
A10:30:48 <citricsquid> yes and you lie if you deny it
A10:30:59 <PuyoDead> I've only had marzipan about twice ever

A10:31:22 <citricsquid> He knows the truth
A10:31:26 <PuyoDead> but dr. peper is essentially spiced prune juice
A10:31:27 <citricsquid> have it, marzipan is amazing
A10:32:33 <citricsquid> if I was going to die and could have one last meal it would be marzipan
A10:32:44 <citricsquid> but if I could have a drink also I'd have dr pepper and steak for eating.
