A5:35:00 <Azothoras> Heya! Since forum is down, i guess this is the best place to go with the question.... Is it possible to fix the "org.lwjgl.LWJGLException: Pixel format not accelerated" java error i get when i try to start the game somehow?
A5:35:23 <citricsquid> Azothoras: That's a problem with your graphics card not supporting it; got the latest drivers?
A5:35:44 <Azothoras> Yeah, already tried that
A5:35:52 <citricsquid> Is your card onboard?
A5:36:23 <Azothoras> Yeah. Good it's just the graphic card though, then.
A5:37:10 <Azothoras> Since it's just a spare i'm using while getting a new motherboard, so it won't be a problem for me later on
A5:37:19 <citricsquid> yay :)
A5:38:00 <Azothoras> Right now i'm able to play it though... But i have to use a client that i use from my computer and not my browser to run it =/
A5:38:37 <Azothoras> Only when i run it directly from my browser, the error is given, so it's kind of weird why it would only work from there

A7:46:05 <Chrstfer> any file can be bound with an executable
A7:46:14 <lailai> It can't run by itself.
A7:46:18 <doohan> It's just a funky heuristic.
A7:46:18 <lailai> It can't be malware.

A9:58:52 <Quatroking> I'm currently playing with 7 clients at once, on one server
A9:58:58 <08Notch> wow, haha =D
A9:59:01 <Marach> lol
A9:59:01 <08Notch> how's the framerate?
A9:59:05 <Quatroking> is that supposed to be possible?
A9:59:17 <Viter> Is it possible to change game modes and how? (when you release that survival beta) ? Beacus i love sandbox and i don't want the health bar etc
A9:59:20 <citricsquid> Quatroking: I did it with 4, different browsers :P You using custom clients or browsers?
A9:59:22 <Quatroking> All clients besides my main are on the lowest render, and my main has a framerate of 120
A9:59:22 <08Notch> well, the default server is supposed to have a max connection from one ip thing
A9:59:37 <08Notch> yes, Viter. I don't know exactly how yet
A9:59:37 <Quatroking> citricsquid: firefox, multiple tabs?
A9:59:42 <Viter> Oh great
A9:59:47 <citricsquid> Quatroking: that works? awesome.
A9:59:50 <Quatroking> well i'm on that world of minecraft thingie
A9:59:52 <Viter> So there's no timer for destroying blocks in sandbox?
A9:59:57 <08Notch> correct, viter
A9:59:57 <Dudebro> No
A10:00:00 <Dudebro> THere is not
A10:00:01 <Viter> Great
A10:00:17 <Viter> Now i have a request :P... It would be nice to a a black block to build with
A10:00:26 <Viter> I always end up needing black
A10:00:27 <Quatroking> the clone clients all have a framerate of 80
A10:00:32 <Marach> i have a question - you said about plans about the expansion pack
A10:00:32 <Quatroking> ah, I love my GTX280
A10:00:34 <Dudebro> Black cloth.
A10:00:42 <Marach> free for paid users
A10:01:12 <Viter> so is there a reason why there's no black
A10:01:22 <Quatroking> "free for paid users" doesn't make sense
A10:01:27 <Quatroking> we paid so its not free.
A10:01:28 <Marach> will users that upgrade AFTER releasing pack will still get it for free?
A10:01:34 <citricsquid> Quatroking: Yes, paid users don't pay for anything extra.
A10:01:49 <Quatroking> all we got is a 50% discount of the final price
A10:02:02 <Quatroking> technically, what we get now is the product we paid for
A10:02:05 <citricsquid> Imagine it as DLC, except free DLC! There you go.
A10:02:08 <08Notch> everyone who purchased or ever purchases the game will get all expansions for free
A10:02:15 <Marach> ok
A10:02:15 <Dudebro> Like the TF2 updates.
A10:02:19 <08Notch> yes
A10:02:29 <Dudebro> Thank you

A10:03:43 <Morgranth> o hey marach, the server is back up if u didnt notice
A10:04:02 <Marach> that means when creating a block above or destroying any block near

A10:06:23 <Quatroking> the nuke is 5 times as big as the one from hiroshima
A10:06:29 <PuyoDead> that's one error down, 15 more to go!
A10:06:29 <Quatroking> how could that NOT hit new york
A10:06:51 <Quatroking> and if it didn't hit new york, where's the major flood?
A10:07:17 <doohan> Quatroking, relax. It's just a game.

A10:18:12 <Quatroking> fuck
A10:18:27 <C418> yes, but still
A10:18:29 <Quatroking> Notch, I just found a major bug
A10:18:29 <Quatroking> I think
A10:18:40 <08Notch> He's right, Veronika. I enjoy the pixling too much. :D
A10:18:46 <08Notch> but I'd gladly accept tile type ideas.

A10:19:52 <C418> your next door stalker, usually
A10:20:15 <PuyoDead> anyway
A10:20:18 <citricsquid> Quatroking: So, what's the bug?
A10:20:26 <Not_Famous> I have a payment question.
A10:20:41 <PuyoDead> I should probably find a way to phase that out of my pet peeves, since so many people use "anyways"
A10:21:01 <citricsquid> Not_Famous: What's the question? :)
A10:21:13 <Quatroking> stupid internet is acting up again

A10:21:49 <Not_Famous> I can't use any of my credit cards or my paypal.... is there another way I could pay?
A10:22:02 <C418> only paypal at the moment
A10:22:11 <citricsquid> Not_Famous: What error do you get with Paypal?
A10:22:14 <PuyoDead> can't say I've seen it, but I also can't say I've studied every dictionary

A10:29:05 <Quatroking> Notch: so that option will be implented on 1 september?
A10:29:05 <Quatroking> That would be pretty new, considering Minecraft is an indie
A10:29:07 <Quatroking> I haven't seen any indie games yet with an option for 3D glasses
A10:29:07 <Quatroking> add it add it
A10:29:19 <ChJees> Notch, why not offer them in your shop :P?
A10:29:25 <08Notch> hehe
A10:29:25 <ChJees> For a extra fee
A10:29:31 <Quatroking> official Minecraft 3D glasses
A10:29:37 <ChJees> Original Price + Profit
A10:29:40 <08Notch> that would be pretty neat. :D
A10:29:51 <Quatroking> only one buck, excluding shipping
A10:29:54 <Quatroking> Well
A10:30:08 <Quatroking> find a way to make those, then sell 'em on etsy
A10:30:12 <PuyoDead> I want to get some basic red/blue 3d glasses, since trackmania supports them, too

A10:39:29 <PuyoDead> hmm, looking back at it now, Notch, I think I like the build = left click, break = right click idea
A10:40:28 <Dudebro> Can we make it toggleable?
A10:40:56 <PuyoDead> it makes much more sense for survival, too
A10:41:17 <PuyoDead> considering there are items to use and interact with and such
A10:41:33 <ChJees> LMB = Action\Build?
A10:41:42 <Dudebro> But I can hardly right click...
A10:41:50 <PuyoDead> huh?
A10:41:59 <Dudebro> Macintrash...
A10:42:04 <08Notch> oh yeah..
A10:42:14 <PuyoDead> oh, I'm sorry

A10:42:42 <Dudebro> I can't destroy that rapidly anyway in survival

A10:43:02 <Quatroking> There
A10:43:12 <Quatroking> I just rewired the antenna
A10:43:16 <Morgranth> could just make blocks require 3  clibks before they get destroyed, isntead of seconds?
A10:43:20 <Evil-Ville> Why not just use E for interacting with stuff like buttons
A10:43:28 <Evil-Ville> That's what most games do
A10:43:30 <Dudebro> E works
A10:43:45 <08Notch> how would you attack an enemy?
A10:43:55 <Not_Famous> fling words at them
A10:44:00 <Dudebro> clicking, i guess
A10:44:02 <Quatroking> run up to it and hit the key I use for my blade
A10:44:09 <citricsquid> "You're a big gay!" "Nooooooo" -35hp
A10:44:17 <Not_Famous> exactly
A10:44:23 <08Notch> another key just for attacking?
A10:44:41 <Evil-Ville> It would be left click when you have sword selected in your inventory
A10:44:44 <PuyoDead> I'd want a mouse key for attacking, definitely
A10:44:45 <Evil-Ville> maybe?
A10:44:53 <ChJees> Use, Action (Attack, Build, etc), Defensive Action
A10:44:54 <ChJees> :P
A10:44:56 <Quatroking> make it a configurable button
A10:45:08 <citricsquid> a key that auto switches to attack; so like *press E* *mouse*, rather than scrolling through to select weapon.
A10:45:39 <ChJees> A system like in Rune?
A10:45:47 <08Notch> citricsquid: That could work
A10:45:51 <08Notch> ChJees: How does it work in Rune?
A10:45:59 <Quatroking> Notch: will we be using pickaxes to mine our stuff
A10:46:15 <ChJees> Sheathe\Unsheath, Use, Attack Stuff, Use Shield
A10:46:16 <08Notch> it's quite possible there will be pickaxes to speed up mining, yes
A10:46:18 <Veronika> Just use the right mouse to switch through the actions. Build, Destroy, Attack. With keyboard shortcuts.
A10:46:19 <ChJees> I think it was like that :P
A10:46:20 <Quatroking> woohoo
A10:46:28 <Quatroking> and how do we mine by default?

P1:53:52 <fleshBasedProcessor> I still haven't finished Return of the King. I hate to say it, but I think LotR is actually a little overrated
P1:54:20 <bombadil> so the books that spawned the entire fantasy genre are overrated?
P1:54:48 <bombadil> i suggest you pick up a copy of The Silmarillion

P1:55:27 <bombadil> i'm 24
P1:55:36 <fleshBasedProcessor> I think they are good, and I love that the world is so in depth, but it just hasn't managed to pull me into the world and make me care for it.
P1:55:40 <bombadil> LOTR = written in the 1940s
P1:56:13 <bombadil> your arguments lack logic

P2:03:44 <fleshBasedProcessor> This cat on me is my anchor. I need to be doing things right now.

P3:00:11 <Not_Famous> I don't mind the controls right now as they are
P3:00:19 <Eagle> I would welcome the changes
P3:00:24 <PuyoDead> I'd never even thought of it before, but having to right click to change between modes is a bit cumbersome
P3:00:35 <liq3> Not_Famous: I don't think anyone is bothered by the current controls, just the new way would be a lot better.
P3:00:48 <Eagle> A lot of the time when I right click to switch between modes it's register it as me clicking it twice for some reason.
P3:00:52 <liq3> Yeh, now that Notch has pointed it out, I am bothered by them. :P
P3:01:02 <PuyoDead> yea, they work fine right now, but it really would make more sense to have the two different modes on each button
P3:01:30 <liq3> personally I'd prefer if he added a "use" button, like most FPS games.

P3:15:32 <Super-Dot> Notch, when we turn on Anaglyph Mode, our characters will automatically gain http://notch.tumblr.com/post/162097136/i-just-realized-theres-room-in-the-player-texture style 3D glasses, right?
P3:15:37 <Wirtualnosc> I'm polish, so don't except... you know what :P
P3:15:55 <Wirtualnosc> I'm waiting for Notch's opinion.
P3:16:07 <PuyoDead> you'll probably have to wait until tomorrow
P3:16:15 <Wirtualnosc> Hm? Why?
P3:16:26 <Quatroking> super-dot: that would be pretty sweet
P3:16:28 <08Notch> I'm here now.
P3:16:32 <PuyoDead> holy!
P3:16:35 <Wirtualnosc> Lol.
13P3:16:37 * PuyoDead faints
P3:16:37 <Eagle> Hello Notch.
P3:16:39 <08Notch> a special tool for breaking blocks is probably best, but there are two downsides:
P3:16:41 <KatamariManatee> I'm getting a laptop soon. Hoping it plays Minecraft...
P3:16:46 <08Notch> 1) It takes up an inventory slot even in survival mode
P3:16:48 <Super-Dot> Hey cool, it's Notch
P3:16:49 <08Notch> 2) What do you do if you lose it?
P3:16:54 <Eagle> XD
P3:16:59 <fydo> Notch: what do you think of 3D Dot Game Heroes?
P3:17:02 <Quatroking> Notch: 2: use your hands
P3:17:05 <08Notch> it lookes insanely awesome
P3:17:09 <fydo> :)
P3:17:10 <08Notch> *looked
P3:17:25 <Wirtualnosc> hmmm, then maybe make some objects undroppable?
P3:17:30 <liq3> Gasp, you guys just reminded of an FPS! *finds game...*
P3:17:46 <Eagle> How about just having a slot out of the inventory that you can't access with the pick in it?
P3:17:50 <PuyoDead> if they're undroppable, there's no reason for them to be an object in the first place
P3:17:50 <KatamariManatee> It feels like looking at 3d dot game heroes in motion would make me sick...
P3:17:54 <Eagle> And later if you upgrade it or whatever it shows that
P3:18:01 <Quatroking> Notch: just make all the controls configurable, if there's one thing annoying its wanting to change the controls and not being able to
P3:18:08 <Eagle> Or having special picks that do different things
P3:18:08 <fydo> it actually looks very close to what i was thinking before, Minecraft with shaders :)
P3:18:13 <Eagle> Like a pick inventory :P
P3:19:22 <KatamariManatee> If there is picks, you should start out with a rusty one
P3:19:33 <KatamariManatee> And then you get a regular one
P3:19:38 <fydo> or a broken one
P3:19:44 <Eagle> Make it so you can craft different picks
P3:19:50 <KatamariManatee> And maybe include a jackhammer
P3:19:51 <fydo> pickcraft!
P3:19:52 <Eagle> Oh god please don't make it so your pick can break
P3:19:54 <Wirtualnosc> But I think undroppable object would be good idea (i mean body parts, like hands... You can't drop fist in real life... Only in skulltag :P) For example, kicking can be used as basic attack.
P3:20:28 <KatamariManatee> A jackhammer would break things fast... but only blocks underneath you
P3:20:37 <Eagle> Make each different pick do something different
P3:20:50 <Eagle> Like what Katamari said with the jackhammer.
P3:20:59 <KatamariManatee> Gold pick can delete a 3 by 3 block
P3:21:15 <KatamariManatee> As in, 9 blocks at once
P3:21:20 <Quatroking> but takes a lot of time to charge
P3:21:28 <KatamariManatee> Exactly.
P3:21:28 <Quatroking> to balance it
P3:21:37 <PuyoDead> what is this, harvest moon?
P3:21:39 <Eagle> Dynamite takes a long time to actually delete blocks, but when it does it carves a large hole
P3:21:50 <Quatroking> puyodead: I was thinking about that, heh
P3:21:55 <Wirtualnosc> But I think my idea about body parts is good.
P3:21:55 <fydo> PuyoDead: wait until we start talking about livestock!
P3:22:02 <liq3> Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome game! https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&proj=1470

P3:22:23 <Snowman> gold is a soft metal
P3:22:28 <Eagle> Gold would break
P3:22:30 <Dudebro> Animal Crossing.
P3:22:31 <Neopi> Hi notch!
P3:22:32 <Real> hey Notch did you get my note yesterday about the placement of the in-game chat text?
P3:22:34 <Eagle> It's a super soft metal
P3:22:35 <KatamariManatee> Its for looks only!
P3:22:43 <Snowman> smack gold on a rock and it bends
P3:22:44 <KatamariManatee> You've seen plenty of gold things in games
P3:22:44 <Eagle> It's gold plated :O
P3:22:59 <KatamariManatee> And you know what? They don't break. And you don't care
P3:23:06 <Neopi> Notch i have but one question? Will you be entering ludem dare 15
P3:23:14 <KatamariManatee> NOBODY CARES IF GOLD CAN BREAK OR NOT
P3:23:19 <Snowman> They DO break, try left clicking on them :p
P3:23:21 <Wirtualnosc> I care.
P3:23:38 <Eagle> XD Snowman
P3:23:52 <Neopi> nice man
P3:23:52 <KatamariManatee> Why? Games don't really need to use physics all the time
P3:24:01 <Wirtualnosc> Better make bombs which can break 7x7x7 area.
P3:24:07 <KatamariManatee> You never complain about Super mario bros
P3:24:08 <Eagle> I don't want Gold being an uber metal
P3:24:13 <Eagle> I'd rather just have it be a valuable
P3:24:14 <Snowman> Oh by the way, do you know the melting point of Gold is 1337¬∞K

P3:24:35 <Eagle> I see gold being only good for making nice looking things
P3:24:38 <Eagle> not practical ones
P3:24:47 <Wirtualnosc> For example, gold storage.
P3:24:51 <Neopi> i agree
P3:25:03 <Wirtualnosc> or as currency
P3:25:08 <Quatroking> currency
P3:25:10 <Wirtualnosc> on custom servers
P3:25:11 <KatamariManatee> Okay, how about a platinum pick?
P3:25:12 <Eagle> I was thinking that
P3:25:19 <Eagle> That would work :O
P3:25:35 <Wirtualnosc> or at some kind of RTS mod?
P3:25:38 <KatamariManatee> Or an iron pick?
P3:25:41 <AlexVMiner> peroggi's mods on the gentleman's server suck
P3:25:52 <Eagle> An obsidian pick would probably work very well
P3:25:53 <Snowman> I want an Uranium pickaxe
P3:26:02 <Eagle> I don't know if obsidian is a soft or hard mineral though
P3:26:09 <Snowman> disregard that, I want an Snow pickaxe :D
P3:26:11 <fydo> Magic pick
P3:26:18 <Snowman> eagle, obsidian is like glass
P3:26:19 <KatamariManatee> How about a particle destroyer?
P3:26:22 <Wirtualnosc> Laser Resource Extractor - best breaker tool in the game. What do you think?
P3:26:29 <Eagle> But it's /very/ sharp
P3:26:32 <Eagle> very
P3:26:33 <Snowman> use that as a pick, 1 smack and it's broken
P3:26:48 <Eagle> as in it can be 1 molecule thick at a point
P3:26:58 <AlexVMiner> what are you guys talking about?
P3:26:59 <Neopi> i would have the crane fo r the ultimate miner
P3:27:03 <fydo> AlexVMiner: mining
P3:27:09 <AlexVMiner> BANHAMMER
P3:27:11 <AlexVMiner> for mining
P3:27:12 <KatamariManatee> How about a diamond pick? it's the hardest substance known to man
P3:27:16 <Snowman> Mining with gold pickaxes >.>
P3:27:16 <AlexVMiner> very powerful
P3:27:23 <Dudebro> A DRAGONFORCE PICK
P3:27:24 <Wirtualnosc> Granite is harder, i think
P3:27:30 <Wirtualnosc> so granite pickaxe
P3:27:30 <AlexVMiner> what about a nose pick
P3:27:31 <Snowman> lol no wir
P3:27:33 <KatamariManatee> Guitar pick?
P3:27:35 <Eagle> If obsidian wasn't glass is would probably destroy rocks in like one swing
P3:27:36 <Wirtualnosc> titanium pickaxe
P3:27:38 <Eagle> *it
P3:27:39 <Dudebro> HARDEST METAL IN THE UNIVERSER
P3:27:40 <fydo> KatamariManatee: hahaha, yes
P3:27:42 <Wirtualnosc> laser pickaxe
P3:27:43 <Dudebro> *universe
P3:27:53 <Snowman> HOW ABOUT MINING WITH NUKES MKAY?
P3:27:58 <Eagle> I would do it
P3:28:01 <KatamariManatee> NO NUKES
P3:28:06 <Wirtualnosc> I said, laser resource extractor is the best.
P3:28:07 <KatamariManatee> ONLY PICKS
P3:28:08 <Neopi> a crane could mine 5 lock at a time or more!
P3:28:20 <AlexVMiner> or mining with a wipe-the-map-of-all-blocks pick?
P3:28:28 <Snowman> I'll make a pickaxe out of Notch, all rocks would break instantly because of its awesomeness
P3:28:37 <Eagle> Nukes destroy everything on the map. And it hurts you 3 hearts. :P
P3:28:41 <Eagle> Only 3
P3:28:42 <Wirtualnosc> AlexVMiner - nuclear bomb? :O
P3:28:43 <Eagle> For irony
P3:28:49 <Dudebro> FALLOUT 3
P3:28:50 <AlexVMiner> no
P3:28:51 <killer2329> a nuke would just kill everything
P3:28:56 <AlexVMiner> my pick wont hurt you
P3:29:00 <AlexVMiner> only the land
P3:29:00 <Snowman> How about we don't use nukes
P3:29:00 <Wirtualnosc> nuke = end of the game.
P3:29:01 <AlexVMiner> >:D
P3:29:05 <Neopi> No notch as a pick ake you have him lifting it and destroying it with his moddiness
P3:29:10 <Eagle> Nuke is the end game.
P3:29:10 <AlexVMiner> 3 hearts?
P3:29:16 <Eagle> It's your goal in minecraft
P3:29:18 <KatamariManatee> Notch mob destroys every person in it's path
P3:29:18 <Eagle> destroy all life
P3:29:19 <Snowman> I want a beard pickaxe.
P3:29:23 <Quatroking> if there's ever a nuke, it should be a one-use weapon
P3:29:24 <AlexVMiner> you only get 30% hurt when a nuke hits you?
P3:29:28 <Dudebro> Beard camera.
P3:29:34 <Wirtualnosc> ok lets make lists of pickaxes:
P3:29:36 <Snowman> lol no, that one sucks
P3:29:39 <Quatroking> causing a 20x20 crater
P3:29:39 <Eagle> AlexVMiner: <Eagle> For irony
P3:29:41 <Wirtualnosc> granite pickaxe,

P3:29:58 <Wirtualnosc> laser resource extractor (lol wut?)
P3:30:03 <Wirtualnosc> anything else?
P3:30:10 <Quatroking> you forgot uranium

P3:30:19 <Wirtualnosc> uranium pickaxe,

P3:30:21 <killer2329> stone copper iron steel no new blocks required for materials
P3:30:23 <Eagle> to start with
P3:30:23 <Wirtualnosc> particle destroyer,
P3:30:24 <Dudebro> I think it should be a magic pickaxe instead of the laser one.
P3:30:26 <AlexVMiner> wipe-the-map-of-all-blocks pickaxe
P3:30:28 <Wirtualnosc> rusty pickaxe (first pickaxe)
P3:30:34 <Snowman> how about keeping it simple: Woode (lol), Rock, Bronze, Iron, Steel, Granite

P3:38:50 <Wirtualnosc> who is for uranium pickaxe?

P3:39:00 <AlexVMiner> puyo, is that the thing i peed on?

P3:39:22 <Wirtualnosc> so who is for uranium pickaxe?
P3:39:25 <PuyoDead> there's a formula?
P3:39:26 <AlexVMiner> is nutella a chocolate spread?
P3:39:31 <Snowman> There is a formula for the perfect sandwhich
