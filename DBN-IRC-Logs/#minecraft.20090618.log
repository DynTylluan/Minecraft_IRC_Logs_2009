A12:56:46 <Cameron_Pease> Is it possible to edit a map to not be as wide?
A12:57:27 <paul|not> yes
A12:57:31 <paul|not> but don't ask me to do it
A12:58:13 <Parthon> yes, but hammer foot cheesecake

A12:58:55 <Cameron_Pease> Any possible way I could do this without spending a few hours?
A12:59:58 <Parthon> what do you mean "Not as wide"?

A1:02:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, actually, the way one would do it would probably take only a minute or two, but it's about knowing how to do it that's the main challenge.

A1:15:31 <Parthon> I NEED TO STOP THIS! :P
A1:16:57 <Syndlig> Parthon, you are master generator of stuffs.
A1:17:07 <Syndlig> I request a mapgen for Huge size maps :D
A1:17:55 <Parthon> that's my next step, once I figure out how to change the size on the fly
A1:18:06 <Parthon> a program that resizes maps
A1:18:47 <Syndlig> Well not resizes.
A1:18:59 <Syndlig> Unless you mean it generates them at the bigger size with the same algorithms.
A1:19:10 <Syndlig> 'Cause simply resizing the map would make it look weird and stretched.
A1:19:20 <Syndlig> Though caves would be awesome to walk through doublewide :D
A1:19:28 <paul|not> lol
A1:19:32 <paul|not> double map size
A1:19:52 <Syndlig> You know you want it
A1:20:06 <Syndlig> Survival Mode will not be Survival Mode if you can see the other side of the map at max rendering.  :|

A1:20:21 <Parthon> Syndlig: can't regenerate the map :(
A1:20:28 <Parthon> I was thinking of copy/pasting it sideways
A1:20:55 <Syndlig> Huge maps are great because after you've finished building your village you've only explored maybe 5-10% of the map.
A1:21:18 <Syndlig> Hopefully underground gets more interesting.
A1:21:27 <Syndlig> I can only wander through so many tunnel caves.
A1:21:36 <Drakkar> so parthon
A1:21:40 <Drakkar> hows space awesome
A1:21:41 <Drakkar> ;D?
A1:21:45 <Parthon> stalls :P
A1:21:50 <TrueWolves> Will it be possable to copypasta?
A1:21:52 <Parthon> too much mc work :P
A1:22:09 <TrueWolves> I have a huge ship thats over 10000square cubes, and I don't want to have to rebiuld it once in a while
A1:22:25 <Drakkar> pfffffff
A1:22:25 <Drakkar> xD
A1:24:18 <Parthon> city.awesome += 1;
A1:24:20 <Syndlig> Parthon you should start a server with your ruined city map :)
A1:25:27 <Parthon> yah
A1:27:21 <Syndlig> LOVE needs to open beta sooner
A1:28:05 <paul|not> yeah love should be cool
A1:28:08 <paul|not> better be
A1:28:18 <Syndlig> His latest blog he said the words "open beta"
A1:28:53 <Syndlig> Which is gonna tank him if he doesn't act quick, 200ppl/server at $100/mo/server = lots of cost :(

A7:41:06 <wingboy> please :P
A7:41:10 <wingboy> i suck at this stuff
A7:41:28 <Parthon> first: go edit: select block..: 
A7:41:32 <Parthon> and input start as 13f
A7:41:39 <Parthon> and length as 400000
A7:41:44 <Parthon> ie: 400,000 with a comma
A7:41:54 <Parthon> this is if it's a regular sized map

A7:43:14 <wingboy> k ive done all that
A7:43:20 <Parthon> 400,000 in hex
A7:43:33 <ZomBuster> oh of course :P
A7:43:33 <Parthon> so you should have a new document with all the level values in
A7:43:51 <wingboy> looks like it
A7:43:53 <Parthon> in the new document, go replace
A7:43:59 <Parthon> search: replace
A7:44:11 <Parthon> change from text to hex values
A7:44:15 <Parthon> and replace 08 with 10
A7:44:18 <Parthon> I mean
A7:44:23 <Parthon> replace 08 with 0a
A7:44:35 <Parthon> and replace 09 with 0a
A7:44:57 <Parthon> that will turn all the water to lava
A7:45:33 <Jessicatz> it also turns you undead

A7:58:10 <wingboy> i used paste write
A7:58:12 <Parthon> you need to select cell 13f, then go edit: paste write
A7:58:13 <Parthon> aaah
A7:58:23 <Parthon> hmmm
A7:58:39 <wingboy> all that needs to be replaced is all the water with lava so i dont know why it dies
A7:58:50 <Parthon> because something that isn't water is being replaced
A7:58:57 <Parthon> something in the header or footer data
A7:59:03 <wingboy> al that is on the map is water, a bottom layer of dirt and a platform

A8:04:28 <LKA> so. sup guys.
A8:04:31 <Zuriki> I looked around and said... I see...
A8:04:44 <Parthon> laaaaavaaaaaaaa
A8:05:10 <LKA> minecraft sparked an interest in lava with one of my friends
A8:05:21 <LKA> due to the massive lava internet we have running under our level
A8:05:33 <Parthon> lava internet?
A8:05:43 <LKA> its a network of lava that's so hilariously large/deep
A8:05:48 <LKA> we just call it a lava internet now
A8:05:50 <Parthon> aaaaah
A8:05:54 <LKA> it spans across like, the entire level
A8:05:56 <Quatroking> so
A8:06:01 <Parthon> I was thinking "it's because it's full of pipes" :P
A8:06:02 <Quatroking> where is 4chan in your internet.
A8:06:16 <Parthon> Zuriki: I brought up the proper level
A8:06:18 <LKA> 4chan is that massive underground water lake preventing us from continuing it
A8:06:25 <Quatroking> actually
A8:06:28 <Quatroking> that lava
A8:06:43 <Quatroking> your lava itnernet is the internet after 4chan kicked in
A8:06:48 <Zuriki> Imma sewer troll
A8:06:48 <Quatroking> *internet
A8:06:51 <LKA> we tried deleting this hilariously large cave of water
A8:07:01 <Quatroking> that's hilarious
A8:07:16 <LKA> and gave up after about like half an hour and we only got like.. maybe
A8:07:19 <LKA> uh.. RANDOM FRACTIONTIME
A8:07:19 <wingboy> thanks parthon :D
A8:07:26 <LKA> like maybe 1/15th of it deleted
A8:07:34 <wingboy> i was trying to use th map editor posted on forum
A8:07:39 <wingboy> didnt work well
A8:07:43 <Parthon> nah, it doesn't
A8:07:48 <Quatroking> to be honest its shit
A8:08:06 <LKA> can the map editor work for viewing maps at least so you can figure out what things look like from the side

A10:13:13 <Awol10> please most people in this world don't see a swastika as anything else than the symbol for Nazi Germany. Yes I know its was used long before them but many cultures but lets face it the world is full of idiots and I rather not deal with them

A10:16:17 <Ylle> I don't
A10:16:21 <Radek> the swastika is due to a 4chan raid inb4 rule one and two
A10:16:39 <Ylle> And who actually thinks they do it other for the whole "lol i trol u" deal
A10:16:42 <Quatroking> Swastika's are funny
A10:16:45 <citricsquid> They're probably not, but it's useles sgetting upset over it. It's a symbol from the past, dwelling on the past never works.
A10:16:57 <Ylle> rule 1 and 2 is only for people who joined after 2004
A10:17:06 <Radek> lol
A10:17:15 <PuyoDead> they just do it for shock value, but forget that there really isn't any shock value involved
A10:17:21 <citricsquid> I joined 4chan in 1997!

A10:17:41 <Quatroking> when it wasn't full of newfags
A10:17:46 <Awol10> its been so overdone its no longer shocking. Its more shocking to not find it really

A10:18:27 <Quatroking> dawg
A10:18:33 <PuyoDead> some kid was on a server last night making giant unly swastikas, along with sieg heil, and was actually saying, "hey guys! look what I did!!"
A10:18:34 <Ylle> I remember when 4chan ran on phpbb
A10:18:52 <Ylle> never
A10:19:08 <PuyoDead> after we deleted his crap, he took a chucnk out of a tower, and put a sloppy "9/11" in the sky

A10:20:07 <Ylle> Nobody is shocked
A10:20:20 <Ylle> All that happens is that someone is slightly annoyed. :V
A10:20:28 <PuyoDead> it was actually funny at how bad he was at it
A10:20:35 <Ylle> Oooh gr8 trollan there you go girl 10/10

A10:22:39 <PuyoDead> oh yea! and he had a cohort, who was just as amusing

A10:57:28 <Deiz> I'd also suggest building in an update-checker to future server versions. There are probably servers running the original binary because they don't know about new ones.
A10:57:33 <Ylle> what he means is that I like it alot despite lasers and techno music with so deep bass I upset the neighbouring country.

A11:14:04 <Notch> never!
A11:14:04 <LKA> and next update is glass and sponge, right?

A11:14:33 <Syndlig> Oh, question.  How is sponge going to work, exactly?
A11:14:42 <Ylle> Syndlig: Well yeah that'd be sweet, but if they're gon' be any bigger, I suppose making buildable /teleport points for non-ops would be cool (not that I request it, simply making up ideas)
A11:14:46 <Syndlig> Liquid's infinite, would seem like sponge has no use.
A11:14:50 <Gauphastus> I hope it works in conjunction with finite water.
A11:14:54 <Gauphastus> Yes, exactly.
A11:14:55 <postlogic> Infinite sponge.
A11:14:55 <PuyoDead> oh, Notch, this is kind of a fun thing, but... the /say command can be used to mimic server messages. as in, "/say Player has left the game" "/say Player has been banned!"
A11:14:58 <Notch> i don't know yet, Syndlig.. my experiments so far has pretty much sucked. ;)
A11:15:03 <Syndlig> Har.
A11:15:28 <PuyoDead> I find it pretty fun, but... I figure it should be brought up
A11:15:31 <Deiz> Notch: Also, why did you write netcode that trusted the client, when you'll have to rewrite it later for less trust?
A11:15:39 <postlogic> My server console looks like IRC now
A11:15:40 <Parthon> Notch: it's all your fault :D
A11:15:44 <citricsquid> my brother was doing "/say citricsquid mined 100 gold!" and it tricked me and most players :D
A11:15:49 <PuyoDead> haha
A11:15:54 <Quatroking> PuyoDead: /say Quatroking is terrorizing cyberspace!

A11:16:36 <Deiz> Did you just want to get MP out the door?
A11:16:50 <Notch> yes, but I wanted to release MP asap so I could fix crash bugs and stuff like that
A11:17:07 <PuyoDead> and it seemed to atract more players
A11:17:13 <Notch> it sure did!
A11:17:14 <Deiz> Non-trusting netcode will be haaaard
A11:17:23 <Ylle> Well getting mp out early sure makes it easy to spot problems with mp early I guess
A11:17:23 <Deiz> As most servers are on shitty residential connections at this point

A11:23:11 <Deiz> Notch: My concern isn't the difficulty of non-trust, it's keeping the game playable. 10-player serverside movement on pitiful residential upstream = Crap

A11:23:27 <LKA> more like register your name and ghost it <3
A11:23:29 <Deiz> I suppose you could balance it
A11:23:34 <Deiz> And do sync checks
A11:23:37 <Notch> player movement scales linearely with player count, and it's VERY cheap
A11:23:41 <Ylle> okay okay using my bank while somewhat under the influence
A11:23:44 <Quatroking> Notch would you like it if you'd have porn maps on Minecraft

A11:24:57 <Quatroking> Why do all good programmers always come from lands like sweden
A11:25:23 <liq3> Maybe those places are smarter then then the rest of the world? o.O
A11:25:29 <LKA> it's because people in places like America are too busy circlejerking the fact they can code instead of actually coding
A11:25:30 <LKA> ;_;

A11:26:15 <Quatroking> then why do they have tv shows like this: http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/weird_japanese_tv.gif
A11:26:20 <Deiz> Notch: Anyhow, my concern is that I've seen some laggy games, likely due to the user saturating their upstream with torrents or such
A11:26:27 <LKA> photoshop
A11:26:29 <LKA> that's why
A11:26:37 <Ylle> that's their problem really.
A11:26:37 <Deiz> And with wholly serverside movement you'd jerk around
A11:26:59 <Deiz> Maybe there'll be more 'proper' servers in future
A11:27:03 <citricsquid> Deiz: It'd be good if we could have an identifier as to whether or not a server is dedicated, obviously users can lie but most won't.
A11:27:11 <LKA> why would you be torrenting and running a server at the same time
A11:27:11 <Ylle> Yeah I really like how the multi is done right now.

A11:27:43 <Deiz> citricsquid: The server browser could have pings, as well as a packet loss stats
A11:27:52 <Deiz> Saturation = High PL
A11:28:00 <Quatroking> I torrent while having my server
A11:28:06 <Quatroking> I just steal the neighbour's wifi
A11:28:07 <citricsquid> Deiz: Does ping really matter in this game? I play on servers from all over the world and notice very little lag.
A11:28:15 <Deiz> citricsquid: Movement is clientside
A11:28:22 <Deiz> If it were serverside you'd have a persistent delay
A11:28:39 <liq3> Ping would be useful to know if the servers lagging, since it'd shoot up for everyone.
A11:28:44 <Deiz> With lots of lag you can already observe block lag
A11:28:52 <Deiz> Place a block, and eventually it'll disappear/reappear
A11:28:59 <Deiz> Because the server sends the packet back to you
A11:29:03 <Deiz> So you're definitely in sync
A11:29:05 <liq3> The normal 100-300 ping of everyone will easily shoot up to 600+ if the server starts lagging.
A11:29:21 <Quatroking> 100 to 300?
A11:29:23 <Quatroking> the fuck?
A11:29:26 <Deiz> ms.
A11:29:33 <Deiz> That's not unreasonabler
A11:29:34 <Deiz> -r
A11:29:38 <Quatroking> when I play Gmod I usually have a ping of 50 or something
A11:29:48 <Notch> Deiz: Yes, latency is a bit of a problem, agreed. But the verification won't add to latency. =)
A11:29:51 <citricsquid> Anything over 50 is awful for FPS
A11:30:03 <AlMightyBob> Notch, any word on my crashing?
A11:30:04 <liq3> Quatroking: I'm sure we have people from all over playing this, not just Americans. I mean I'm Australian. :p
A11:30:16 <Quatroking> I'm from The Netherlands :P
A11:30:23 <Deiz> Notch: You'd want to just verify the client isn't cheating by checking X/Y rate or something, as opposed to moving most movement serverside?
A11:30:31 <Notch> no AlMightyBob, sorry
A11:30:46 <Notch> no, I'll do the moment server side with client side prediction
A11:30:50 <AlMightyBob> aww
A11:30:52 <Ylle> naaah citricsquid I say 150ish is okay, but that's dangerously close to bad
A11:30:59 <Deiz> Ah, I see.
A11:31:07 <Zuriki> NOTCH
A11:31:07 <citricsquid> ylle: Not for fps! You can barely hit a thing with anything over 50 :(
A11:31:34 <Ylle> Then again the only fps I usually play is tf2
A11:31:36 <liq3> citricsquid: What? 100 ping is fine for fps. Anything more becomes a problem.
A11:31:54 <Ylle> and yes I get headshots as sniper with 150 ping hurr :V
A11:31:55 <citricsquid> liq: Really? I've had times when I've averaged 75 and been unable to play properly. 
A11:32:10 <liq3> What games do you play?
A11:32:14 <Ylle> I think it is more of an issue with the netcode than the ping.
A11:32:26 <Ylle> some games are real dang picky with ping
A11:32:26 <liq3> Yeh, e.g. Wc3 has terrible netcode. :/
A11:32:40 <citricsquid> liq: I guess it does depend on the game, I used to play rifle only call of duty so accuracy had to be dead on, things like TF2 aren't as accurate :3
A11:32:55 <Ylle> yea I guess.

A11:51:58 <liq3> Oh ok. Yeh, still years after FF.

P1:10:24 <Syniphas> orientated?

P1:11:21 <doohan> graphs.

P1:13:18 <Syniphas> what?
P1:13:19 <citricsquid> OOP scares me
P1:13:21 <Notch> user count over time, purchases over time, users online, servers online

P1:13:37 <Syniphas> things like that?
P1:13:38 <liq3> It's the reason I can open and read from files in python with 2 lines. >.>
P1:13:55 <Deiz> Notch: You should keep separate playercounts.
P1:13:57 <liq3> Syniphas: Kind of.
P1:14:03 <Syniphas> type menu
P1:14:03 <Notch> game launches will be applet client only, though
P1:14:03 <Syniphas>     id as integer
P1:14:03 <Syniphas>     label as string
P1:14:03 <Syniphas>     x as integer
P1:14:03 <Syniphas>     y as integer
P1:14:03 <Deiz> Cumulative, private, public
P1:14:04 <Syniphas>     count as integer
P1:14:04 <Syniphas>     chd(5) as integer
P1:14:06 <Syniphas> end type
P1:14:21 <Syniphas> this is what I'm doing, basically
P1:14:29 <liq3> Syniphas: Close, but current OOP is more advanced.
P1:14:37 <Syniphas> okay, whatever.
P1:14:38 <citricsquid> Notch: Will you ever be allowing users to query servers for info, or having a page? Like, serverinfo.jsp?server=4855dkdkfkljsfjl4858743539875 and then it returns total players online + server uptime? :)
P1:15:04 <Notch> that's a good idea. =)

P1:15:21 <Deiz> Letting users query = bad
P1:15:28 <Deiz> Sending it on heartbeat = good
P1:16:14 <liq3> Deiz: Why is letting using query a bad idea?
P1:17:40 <Zuriki> Spam requests
P1:17:44 <Zuriki> Causing lag
P1:17:50 <Deiz> That'd have to be a lot of requests
P1:17:56 <Deiz> I see it as more of a redundancy
P1:18:04 <Zuriki> Meh
P1:18:09 <Syniphas> Ok, how about this
P1:18:12 <Deiz> The only advantage instant requests have is the heartbeats could be up to 59s out of date.
P1:18:12 <Syniphas> fuck menus
P1:18:17 <Syniphas> I'm going back to buttons
P1:18:30 <Zuriki> o.o
P1:18:34 <Zuriki> I'll go again :D
P1:19:08 <Deiz> Notch: An advantage to sending it on heartbeat is that you can do various value-added stuff with the data
P1:19:21 <Deiz> Like keep a db of user:server and allow searches through it
P1:19:25 <Deiz> To find people you like playing with

P1:20:57 <Notch> aren't heartbeats at 40 seconds now?
P1:21:07 <Deiz> I'm not sure
P1:21:14 <Deiz> Speaking of heartbeats
P1:21:31 <Deiz> They should be at certain times
P1:21:39 <Notch> ?
P1:21:44 <Deiz> Err, level saves
P1:21:56 <Notch> again: ?
P1:21:57 <Deiz> Say, :10, so that a level backup could be safely done at :15
P1:22:08 <Deiz> Right now level saves are every minute after the server starts
P1:22:27 <Notch> ah, I see
P1:22:28 <Zuriki> Citric
P1:22:30 <Deiz> Syncing heartbeats is bad, because the master server would get blasted for one second every minute
P1:22:32 <Zuriki> Was that you?
P1:22:42 <Notch> I could print "level saved" AFTER the level has been saved
P1:22:49 <Notch> that way, you can trigger on that message on stdout
P1:22:55 <citricsquid> Notch: that would be awesome :D
P1:23:17 <Notch> should i get rid of the message before saving? it's pretty useless
P1:23:21 <Deiz> Yes.
P1:23:24 <Deiz> Notch: Also, why do you write every minute?
P1:23:25 <MoDx|RWC|> ye
P1:23:29 <Deiz> I dunno the headers
P1:23:36 <Notch> Deiz: How rarely do you want it to save? ;)
P1:23:40 <Deiz> Is there time since map launch embedded or something?
P1:23:43 <peerkoel> the heartbeat info can go too
P1:23:51 <Deiz> I think it shouldn't save if there are no chunk updates
P1:23:52 <MoDx|RWC|> we want to choose :D
P1:23:57 <Snowman> ughh this skin is gonna be hard :/
P1:24:03 <peerkoel> joins, parts, chunk updates, those are interesting
P1:24:11 <Deiz> But as I said, I don't know what you keep in the headers of the map data
P1:24:11 <peerkoel> perhaps the chatter

P1:36:09 <Rosetta> If you want to flood without crashing server you need to use a small map :D 32x32

P1:36:55 <MoDx|RWC|> I tried
P1:36:57 <Syndlig> Says who
P1:37:06 <MoDx|RWC|> Less is possible too, but you haveinvisible blocks
P1:37:13 <Quatroking> I wished Minecraft supported bigger skins
P1:37:18 <Quatroking> So I had more to work with
P1:37:23 <Quatroking> instead of tiny 8x8 :(

P1:38:36 <Quatroking> Notch, any chance there will be support for bigger skins in the future?
P1:38:45 <MoDx|RWC|> Parthon: Got anythig new ? :D
P1:39:00 <Quatroking> everything bigger than 8x8 is awesome
P1:39:04 <Parthon> not since the maze generator
P1:39:06 <MoDx|RWC|> 9x9
P1:39:11 <MoDx|RWC|> okay
P1:39:18 <Syndlig> Parthon:  Indeed.
P1:39:19 <Quatroking> at least I can make the necktie better in 9x9
P1:39:21 <Syndlig> No destroying, no creating.
P1:39:24 <Syndlig> Just jumping and walking.
P1:39:25 <MoDx|RWC|> 32x32 would be nice skin res
P1:39:27 <Quatroking> as well as the question mark
P1:39:30 <Quatroking> fuck yeah
P1:39:35 <Quatroking> even 16x16 would be sweet
P1:39:38 <MoDx|RWC|> yea

P1:40:00 <Parthon> yeah
P1:40:18 <Quatroking> Would it be hard to make Minecraft support more than one skin resolution?

P1:42:18 <MoDx|RWC|> for epic building
P1:42:28 <Rosetta> Quatroking: It wouldn't be hard but Notch has previously said no to larger skins due to file size
P1:42:48 <Quatroking> what
P1:42:50 <Rosetta> (At least that is what I think he said)
P1:42:56 <Quatroking> Filesizes?
P1:42:56 <Quatroking> wtf?
P1:43:07 <MoDx|RWC|> 16x16 isnt big
P1:43:11 <MoDx|RWC|> :D
P1:43:12 <citricsquid> I don't see the problem with these size skins, they're fine.
P1:43:27 <citricsquid> it's not like the game is about graphics...
P1:43:36 <MoDx|RWC|> oh yeah, forgot
P1:43:38 <Rosetta> I have seen some really creative skins
P1:43:40 <Quatroking> if he's concerned about filesizes he needs to get a better host
P1:43:41 <MoDx|RWC|> i just played gta4 :D

P1:43:53 <Parthon> Syndlig: there's one I can't make

P1:48:13 <Deiz> liq3: Quite

P1:48:22 <citricsquid> so that's potentially 100 players a day
P1:48:24 <Quatroking> a day
P1:48:32 <Deiz> citricsquid: It would take 5.5 years to get 100,000 users
P1:48:36 <Deiz> Even at the generous figure of 50/day
P1:48:40 <citricsquid> Deiz: It could happen ;)
P1:48:51 <Deiz> You employ caching at two levels, ideally
P1:48:53 <Quatroking> you understand he earns 500 euro's a day then?
P1:48:55 <citricsquid> but yeah, when the full game is released I think purchases will rocket up.
P1:49:10 <Deiz> Client stores most recent 100 skins
P1:49:12 <liq3> Yeh, 100,000 users = Notch made a million Euros.
P1:49:17 <Deiz> Server stores the same amount
P1:49:20 <Deiz> And serves it to clients
P1:49:21 <liq3> Or more, considering the price is going to double.
P1:49:22 <citricsquid> okay okay, you win, I fail :(
P1:49:36 <Deiz> liq3: 2 million if they came after release
P1:49:39 <liq3> Deiz: At 10kb you could easily store the most recont 1000 skins.
P1:49:43 <Deiz> Indeed.
P1:49:48 <liq3> It'd be 10mb.
P1:49:48 <liq3> lol
P1:49:49 <aeiowu> it won't be a linear rate though

P4:08:17 <LilRobot> BUT...She's hot..
P4:08:23 <vdgmprgrmr> And then prgrmr requires your left hand to just stay near the R, while your right hand can go P, then your left does RGR and your right does M and your left finishes it with the R.
P4:08:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Very simple...
P4:08:44 <modx> I know how to write
P4:08:49 <LilRobot> Ike: You are dead to me, kyle!!!

P4:09:11 <modx> vdgmrpgmr
P4:09:13 <fydo> modx: try using a keyboard if you're going for speed. I find handwriting recognition software to be too slow

P6:52:40 <Zuriki> He said he was working on it over Survival now
P6:52:51 <zid> They've never been blocked
P6:53:08 <Zuriki> How do you know what he's doing behind the scenes pervert
P6:53:11 <zid> Perhaps you should revise it to say "Bots will be blocked in the future"
P6:53:17 <zid> because that's in PRESENT tense
P6:53:19 <zid> not FUTURE tense
P6:53:37 <Zuriki> Are still because he's working on it in present

P7:06:30 <modx> I can sleep the 6 hours
P7:06:40 <Zuriki> I wish you'd stop calling it incorrect information.
P7:06:47 <modx> Then come back and see that there's no update yet
P7:06:49 <zid> AlLnAtuRalX: He just had a fit because he did it accidently and he's on a little power trip about being a moderator, thinking he shouldn't be held accountable.
P7:06:55 <Zuriki> The information was correct just poorly communicated.
P7:06:58 <modx> So I can be happy to see it released
P7:07:09 <Zuriki> And I never did that either.
P7:07:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> zid: I understand.  I have dealt with people like that before (been admin'ing forums for years)
P7:07:14 <Spazzo> What's going on here?
P7:07:23 <Spazzo> All I'm hearing is massive drama
P7:07:51 <citricsquid> mods are people who delete spam, they're not better than anyone else. Surely if he posts incorrect info you correct him and all is fine? Have I missed something? :(
P7:07:53 <Spazzo> Anyone care to give me some background?
P7:08:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Spazzo read my comment a few up
P7:08:10 <Spazzo> Mods delete spam and moderate a message board, unless that has changed here
P7:08:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> and then zid's reply to me
P7:08:13 <Zuriki> Zid is blowing everything out of proportion he calls me a blatent liar because I miscommunicated some information regarding filler bots.
P7:08:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> blatant*
P7:08:32 <Spazzo> They watch over the users and lock topics of no purpose or that are degenerating into chaos
P7:08:43 <Spazzo> There shouldn't be this sort of feud between moderators.
P7:08:50 <Spazzo> One should simply accept the mistake they made.
P7:09:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Agreed.  Accept it and make an edit acknowledging, and you're done
P7:09:16 <Spazzo> I don't see the big deal here
P7:09:21 <citricsquid> link to the post?
P7:09:27 <Zuriki> It's edited there is no problem remaining.
P7:09:57 <Zuriki> I see no need to acknowledge there was ever and error if the problem was rectified and the original OP never read it.
P7:09:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zuriki you don't edit it to be correct
P7:10:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> you put an edit under it stating you were wrong

P9:00:21 <Tiralmo> google cave story. download it. play it. beat it.
P9:00:23 <Tiralmo> Go.
P9:00:23 <Droqen> D: YOU DON'T KNOW
P9:00:27 <Droqen> Thanks Tiralmo
P9:00:36 <PuyoDead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Story
P9:00:38 <PuyoDead> be enlightened
P9:00:39 <vdgmprgrmr> I couldn't stand Cave Story...
P9:00:42 <Droqen> No don't read it
P9:00:46 <Droqen> You're crazy D: play it first
P9:00:54 <PuyoDead> how can you not like cave story?
P9:00:59 <Parthon> is that that game about that guy that does that stuff?
P9:01:00 <PuyoDead> I mean, what about it is not good?
P9:01:08 <Droqen> Yeah, there's stuff done by that guy
P9:01:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I didn't like having to do stuff over so often.
P9:01:32 <PuyoDead> the few times of backtracking, you mean?
P9:01:40 <PuyoDead> must hate castlevania games
P9:01:49 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I mean, "Woops, I died, let's do that same shit. Again.
P9:02:02 <Droqen> ... you must not like many single-player games
P9:02:10 <Parthon> wait .. what?!?

P9:02:14 <PuyoDead> I'm not sure how that's any different from any other video game ever created
P9:02:15 <Quatroking> does anyone play
P9:02:17 <Quatroking> uh
P9:02:17 <Droqen> That's every game, ever
P9:02:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I love single player games.
P9:02:27 <Quatroking> microsoft excel?
P9:02:38 <Quatroking> best game ever
P9:02:40 <Droqen> I'm not sure if roguelikes are the exception or the even worse side of whoops I died let's do that again
P9:02:59 <Quatroking> the sequel, powerpoint, lacked action tho
P9:03:00 <Tiralmo> I'm a big fan of The Fool's Errand.
P9:03:04 <Quatroking> too much in-depth story shit
P9:03:05 <SleepingElly_v2> Tastes, some people like terrible games.
P9:03:08 <vdgmprgrmr> But Cave Story's gameplay was not enough for me to like playing the same level over again. (Note that I mean playing the level with the same goal, backtracking is fine.)
P9:03:09 <SleepingElly_v2> I dig sonic riders.
P9:03:13 <Tiralmo> I just wish the sequel qould come out already >_>
P9:03:27 <SleepingElly_v2> And sonic riders is a terrible terrible game.
P9:03:41 <PuyoDead> I understand your complaint, that is annoying (Zelda Phantom Hourglass anyone?)
P9:03:46 <PuyoDead> but I don't really see that in Cave Story
P9:03:49 <Droqen> xD SleepingElly: that's... awesome
P9:03:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I did.
P9:03:54 <SleepingElly_v2> So while a game might be good, yeah tastes.
P9:03:56 <PuyoDead> at least, not any more than any other similar game
P9:03:57 <Quatroking> Did anyone ever finished a game of
P9:03:57 <SleepingElly_v2> I mean hell
P9:03:58 <Quatroking> patience
P9:04:05 <SleepingElly_v2> there's a ton of people who LOVE I wanna be the guy
P9:04:06 <Droqen> I didn't really see it in Phantom Hourglass x3
P9:04:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, even just having to play the same level twice was annoying in it.
P9:04:13 <Quatroking> I finished it, the ending sucked ass
P9:04:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it was also samey.
P9:04:29 <PuyoDead> phantom hourglass is the very definition of your complaint
P9:04:31 <Droqen> Anyone here like Spelunky?
P9:04:39 <SleepingElly_v2> Yeah I got to jungle once
P9:04:41 <SleepingElly_v2> but I died there
P9:04:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I constantly just wanted to see what was next in the game, not see what I had already done.
P9:04:49 <Droqen> xD That's pretty funny
P9:05:02 <SleepingElly_v2> I blow at spelunky heh
P9:05:04 <SleepingElly_v2> Die die die
P9:05:12 <SleepingElly_v2> but I need to get further down
P9:05:14 <paul|not> I have beaten spelunky 6 times
P9:05:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I was terrible at Spelunky for a while, and I hated it.
P9:05:15 <paul|not> wheeeee
P9:05:15 <Droqen> Recently I've just started to beat Spelunky. Took a lot of playing but somehow it's way easier now o_o
P9:05:17 <PuyoDead> ehh, to each his own
P9:05:26 <Droqen> I've beat it thrice only though
P9:05:33 <paul|not> Droqen: once you start winning you do get better at it
P9:05:36 <Droqen> paul|not are you grif
P9:05:38 <vdgmprgrmr> But eventually I decided that I just DIDN'T FUCKING CARE about it as a game.
P9:05:38 <paul|not> lot of luck involved though
P9:05:38 <SleepingElly_v2> Also
P9:05:39 <paul|not> and yes
P9:05:41 <Droqen> D:
P9:05:44 <Droqen> Madness
P9:05:48 <paul|not> ---why
P9:05:48 <Quatroking> I like to play Half-life 2..
P9:05:49 <Droqen> Are you... THAT grif
P9:05:55 <SleepingElly_v2> I don't like the Banjo kazooie/tooie games outside of cutscenes and graphics.
P9:05:56 <paul|not> which grif from where
P9:05:57 <Parthon> spelunkey is awesome
P9:06:03 <Tiralmo> I'm still bad at spelunky. I want all the treasures, not to live x.x
P9:06:08 <Droqen> Parthon I will gnaw on your bones until you spell things right 3:
P9:06:15 <Quatroking> Conker's Bad Fur Day was fucking awesome
P9:06:16 <paul|not> my high score is like 860,000
P9:06:17 <paul|not> wheeeee
P9:06:19 <vdgmprgrmr> And so I played it like it was nothing but meaningless challenge, and suddenly I could beat it every five plays.
P9:06:26 <SleepingElly_v2> Conker hahaha
P9:06:28 <Droqen> grif from... datarealms forum. if not there are way too many grifs.
P9:06:31 <paul|not> yes
P9:06:33 <paul|not> I am that grif
P9:06:41 <Droqen> Okay
P9:06:56 <paul|not> do you have an account there
P9:07:06 <SleepingElly_v2> eh
P9:07:13 <SleepingElly_v2> there's one game however
P9:07:13 <Droqen> vdgmprgrmr can I call you vdg? - also that is strange. Do you enjoy it while you play..?
P9:07:18 <SleepingElly_v2> alot of people like
P9:07:20 <vdgmprgrmr> I really think the roguelike gameplay theme mixed with the mechanics of ANYTHING ELSE would kind of suck.
P9:07:24 <zid> Droqen: tab complete ftl?
P9:07:27 <vdgmprgrmr> I generally am just VD.
P9:07:30 <SleepingElly_v2> Transport tycoon deluxe <<;
P9:07:37 <Droqen> Yeah, I do have an account there - although I don't do much on the forum
P9:07:39 <zid> vdgmprgrmr: venereal disease?
P9:07:40 <SleepingElly_v2> That game is dangerous
P9:07:44 <Droqen> zid: What do you mean?
P9:07:50 <Quatroking> TTD is awesome
P9:07:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And I liked it the first few times (after I figured out how to play it.
P9:07:57 <SleepingElly_v2> I once had a three day TTD session on a hueg map.
P9:08:00 <vdgmprgrmr> NOT VENEREAL DISEASE
P9:08:03 <vdgmprgrmr> >.<
P9:08:05 <Quatroking> and OpenTTD is even better :D
P9:08:10 <Droqen> vd: xD
P9:08:48 <SleepingElly_v2> It's so fun
P9:08:52 <SleepingElly_v2> but I don't get why
P9:09:01 <SleepingElly_v2> Also railroads >>> everything
P9:09:05 <Droqen> I loved ccw for a while...
P9:09:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, having a roguelike, where death is easy, mixed with gameplay and graphics that make recklessness fun, is bad, because the game is, like, conflicting with itself.
P9:09:16 <Quatroking> railroads suck
P9:09:18 <Tiralmo> I still spend way too much time on old games with friends - Civ II, AoE II, HOMM3, Starcraft
P9:09:18 <Quatroking> MAGLEV WOO
P9:09:25 <paul|not> vdgmprgrmr: and yet it works
P9:09:26 <SleepingElly_v2> oh right hahaha

P9:09:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Not for me.
P9:09:35 <paul|not> spelunky?
P9:09:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I hated it.
P9:09:37 <Quatroking> 400 kph trains muthafucka!
P9:09:38 <Droqen> vd: I love to die in spelunky
P9:09:44 <SleepingElly_v2> Homm3 is so great
P9:09:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I really just wanted to play it.
P9:10:03 <Droqen> xD You hated it but... wanted to play it? What?
P9:10:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I hated because I couldn't play it.
P9:10:18 <vdgmprgrmr> (In a way that was fun.)
P9:10:25 <SleepingElly_v2> The problem with spelunky
P9:10:26 <Quatroking> having trains go past 2 farms then delivering the stuff at a factory, to have the processed goods getting picked up by an other train on the same rail is just great
P9:10:41 <SleepingElly_v2> is the curve of learning
P9:10:48 <SleepingElly_v2> it starts out reaaaal slow
P9:10:49 <paul|not> that's what makes it good
P9:10:49 <Droqen> vd: x3 so then what happened after the first few times after figuring out how to play it?
P9:10:50 <vdgmprgrmr> It was like, there was so much cool stuff to do, but pretty much all of the cool stuff you could do ended with you dying.
P9:10:50 <SleepingElly_v2> real boring
P9:10:54 <SleepingElly_v2> then it goes WHOOOOOOSH
P9:10:57 <paul|not> any roguelike is like that elly
P9:11:06 <SleepingElly_v2> yeah I know.
P9:11:07 <Droqen> Yeah :D I don't know, I think the best part is not ruining it for yourself
P9:11:18 <paul|not> areas 2 and 3 are much harder than 1 yeah
P9:11:18 <Tiralmo> Nah, most start out with WHOOOSH
P9:11:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I prefer Rogue.
P9:11:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Over all other roguelikes.
P9:11:26 <SleepingElly_v2> Also when I think of roguelike, I think of nethack, and when I think of nethack
P9:11:26 <paul|not> personally 2 > 3 in difficulty as well
P9:11:27 <Droqen> There are a lot of games that you have to gauge your spoiler-seeking
P9:11:30 <SleepingElly_v2> I think of ZZT
P9:11:34 <SleepingElly_v2> Boom.
P9:11:35 <Droqen> ZZT?
P9:11:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Because there's none of this "You play it, you suck, it's not fun, and then it becomes fun."
P9:11:57 <vdgmprgrmr> The gameplay of Rogue was pretty much consistent throughout the whole game.
P9:11:58 <SleepingElly_v2> http://www.textmodegames.com/download/screens/zzt.gif
P9:12:03 <SleepingElly_v2> dankest ever.
P9:12:11 <SleepingElly_v2> you could make your own levels and stuff
P9:12:27 <SleepingElly_v2> you could even program stuff, heh.
P9:12:56 <Parthon> I hate my skills .. they suck
P9:12:58 <Droqen> I think the main draw to me for roguelikes is the random stuff
P9:12:58 <SleepingElly_v2> Reminds me of kroz
P9:13:10 <Droqen> and yet I like making levels in games D:
P9:13:12 <Quatroking> You know what's funny
P9:13:15 <Tiralmo> I downloaded dwarf fortress recently and it ramps up quite a bit :(
P9:13:20 <Droqen> df <3
P9:13:25 <vdgmprgrmr> That's my main draw to roguelikes as well.
P9:13:25 <Quatroking> reading XKCD always makes me feel intelligent
P9:13:26 <Tiralmo> Just getting started is complicated enough
P9:13:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I have a serious fetish for procedural generation.
P9:13:42 <Droqen> Yeesss vd :3
P9:13:43 <SleepingElly_v2> Who doesn't?
P9:13:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I seriously think that's the only reason I played Spelunky so long.

P9:49:06 <Droqen> Yeah, I did lift the colours
P9:49:15 <Parthon> that's a nasty sprite to replicate
P9:49:32 <Droqen> Hehe. There's a very slightly better one, when she's standing
P9:49:44 <Rydia> also i'm pretty sure she has blue pants under her green dress thing
P9:50:02 <Droqen> Rydia: Thanks. And yeah, I'm just... not sure whether to give her just blue shoe bits or what x3
P9:51:31 <Rydia> http://kiipo.deviantart.com/art/500-Poly-Misery-91666845 there is also this to look at
P9:52:09 <Rydia> i guess she does have green pants
P9:52:16 <Rydia> the sprite is really vague
P9:52:36 <Droqen> Well, that's just one person's interpretation
P9:53:01 <Parthon> OH .. MY .. GOD!
P9:53:07 <Droqen> ?
P9:53:21 <Parthon> this is going to be one giant maze
P9:53:24 <Rydia> misery is the best
P9:53:26 <Droqen> xD What is?
P9:53:29 <Droqen> Misery is awesome :3
P9:53:36 <Rydia> she is underappreciated
P9:53:46 <Droqen> I could make someone easier for the moment, like Dr. Booster
P9:53:57 <Droqen> No hair :D
P9:54:05 <paul|not> Droqen: look at THIS terrible skin: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Grif
P9:54:20 <Parthon> generation complete: 568 rooms 569 tunnels
P9:54:30 <Droqen> D: what's with the black lines
P9:54:44 <Droqen> But it's not bad x3 Some weird black bits - outlines?
P9:54:53 <paul|not> yeah I need to fix it
P9:55:29 <Parthon> paul|not: http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Parthon ?
P9:55:47 <Rydia> i'm gonna make a haruhi skin
P9:56:10 <fydo> that is pretty awesome
P9:56:11 <Rydia> what's the price in dollars
P9:56:13 <Droqen> http://www.bardinelli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quote-modified1.gif
P9:56:16 <LilRobot> 14.54 I think
P9:56:21 <Droqen> Rydia: $16 canadian, I don't know us
P9:56:24 <Rydia> i'm 4 bucks short
P9:56:27 <LilRobot> 14.54 US
P9:56:46 <paul|not> YOU KNOW WHAT PARTHON
P9:56:49 <paul|not> ROBOTS DON'T HAVE HAIR.
P9:56:56 <Evil-Ville> You should be able to scrape together 4 bucks somehow
P9:57:08 <Parthon> quote has hair though
P9:57:09 <Rydia> only have $10 on my debit
P9:57:20 <Tiralmo> Panhandle for a day.
P9:57:26 <Droqen> Does anything know xD
P9:57:29 <Parthon> terminator had hair
P9:57:32 <Droqen> Oops
P9:57:35 <Parthon> data has hair
P9:57:36 <Rydia> and i can't put anything on it
P9:57:41 <Droqen> I think there are more robots with hair than without
P9:57:41 <paul|not> somewhat better
P9:57:53 <Droqen> Rydia do you have another card or one you can borrow from someone?
P9:57:54 <paul|not> refresh
P9:57:58 <Parthon> dick cheney has hair ..
P9:58:03 <Parthon> how can you say robots don't have hair
P9:58:10 <Rydia> nope
P9:58:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Any ideas in here when Notch usually wakes up?
P9:58:34 <Droqen> Needs hair D: I think it looks better with hair, even not-wonderful hair (i think the hair's pretty good)
P9:58:41 <Droqen> LilRobot says 1-2 hours?
P9:58:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> And the update is going to be released then?
P9:58:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm contemplating staying up
