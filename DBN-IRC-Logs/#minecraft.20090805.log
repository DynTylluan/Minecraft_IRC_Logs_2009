A2:07:19 <asiekierka> Cuz I've split my game into 3 files
A2:07:21 <asiekierka> MUCH clearner.
A2:07:22 <asiekierka> cleaner*
A2:07:29 <Mourne> hi, um, where can i get a program to backup my server map?
A2:07:34 <mail2345> hello asiekierka. I don't have enough ops to risk starting up my serv
A2:07:40 <mail2345> and you can use
A2:07:44 <Maveric> how often do you want it backed up, Mourne?
A2:07:47 <mail2345> lots of programs
A2:07:54 <mail2345> check server administation
A2:08:01 <Mourne> Well, not really sure, 5 min i guess?
A2:08:01 <Maveric> and what os?
A2:08:06 <Mourne> XP
A2:08:13 <Maveric> eh, can't help ya then :P
A2:08:17 <mail2345> really, python and perl are cross platform
A2:08:22 <mail2345> get cMss
A2:08:30 <asiekierka> heh, fpc is also crossplatform
A2:08:34 <mail2345> setup the backup plugin in the source code.
A2:08:37 <Mourne> i did, but i can't figure out how that works
A2:08:46 <asiekierka> Now I need to figure out some way of map compression
A2:08:59 <Mourne> how do i get the cMss to work?
A2:09:00 <asiekierka> 10kb for a 40x30x1 map!
A2:09:17 <mail2345> wait
A2:09:18 <gear1> :|
A2:09:20 <mail2345> as in it's not wroking
A2:09:28 <mail2345> or it can't backup?
A2:09:30 <Maveric> eh, dwarf fortress is getting confusing
A2:09:40 <mail2345> I also assume your not an idiot and installed python 2.6
A2:09:47 <Mourne> i can't figure out how to get cMss to work
A2:09:57 <Maveric> *grumbles*
A2:10:05 <Maveric> I had to install 2.6 for just one ap :(
A2:10:33 <Mourne> where do i put the cMss.py file?
A2:10:43 <Maveric> same directory as the serer files
A2:10:43 <Mourne> or is that openable?
A2:10:44 <asiekierka> Well, I'll leave map compression to later
A2:10:50 <asiekierka> though 255 255x255 maps are like 100mb
A2:11:03 <asiekierka> (you can have more than 1 map in a single file and have them linked!)
A2:11:30 <mail2345> same dir
A2:11:41 <Mourne> does it  say anything when you type !backup ???
A2:11:54 <mail2345> python is very useful, btw
A2:12:01 <mail2345> especially if you want to learn programming
A2:12:50 <Mourne> when you type !backup with cMss, does anything pop up?
A2:13:46 <Mourne> help anyone?
A2:14:31 <mail2345> ugh
A2:14:36 <mail2345> what error message did you get
A2:14:41 <mail2345> when you ran the file
A2:15:01 <Mourne> no error message
A2:15:07 <Mourne> just closed
A2:15:14 <Maveric> Can anyone here lend a hand with dwarf fortress?
A2:15:33 <gear1> that game get annoying
A2:15:36 <mail2345> your path variables are set right?
A2:15:52 <Mourne> i'm not sure

A2:16:17 <mail2345> and type in python
A2:16:53 <asiekierka> I can't believe my SDL/FPC game is progressing

A5:08:53 <Schwerpunk> More than I could do, that's for sure.
A5:11:01 <iPope> The system could be set up in about 2 hours, 1 hour for networking, 1 hour for effects and maybe 2 hours bug fixing and polishing
A5:11:15 <iPope> so 6 hours, sounds right

A5:11:41 <Zaldos> hello
A5:11:49 <doohan> Are you saying you could write minecraft in 6 hours?
A5:11:58 <doohan> Or the stuff notch did yesterday would take about 6 hours.
A5:11:58 <Zaldos> on speed
A5:14:14 <iPope> stuff yesterday
A5:15:36 <Schwerpunk> Well then, we should all mine Minecraft clones.
A5:15:41 <Schwerpunk> If it's so easy.
A5:16:01 <Schwerpunk> I think I'll make mine in space.
A5:16:20 <iPope> :/
A5:16:32 <Schwerpunk> The only question is do I make it an expanding or contracting universe...  These things are possible in games, you see.
A5:16:53 <iPope> I didn't say it was easy, yoyr firgetting notch is a very experianced programmer
A5:16:56 <Schwerpunk> I think I'll make it a contracting universe, so everything goes backwards in time.
A5:16:58 <iPope> your*
A5:17:00 <peerkoel> it might be possible to code it all in 6 hours, but drawing up specs takes a lot longer
A5:17:48 <Schwerpunk> Alright, I won't argue that Notch is awesome.  That is a losing battle.
A5:18:00 <iPope> well I was only talking about coding
A5:18:31 <Schwerpunk> I just admire the guy's determination.  He has to be his own boss, and all that.  Can't be easy, staying strict with yourself.
A5:18:57 <iPope> Your fans and money motivate you
A5:19:07 <peerkoel> that's certainly true
A5:19:13 <Schwerpunk> Mmmmoney.
A5:20:03 <peerkoel> I wonder how much Mmmmoney motivates Notch
A5:20:11 <Schwerpunk> I think his practice of being on IRC while he codes is probably a good idea.  Keeps him focused.
A5:20:31 <Schwerpunk> Probably money to buy new computers, since he's a geek.
A5:20:40 <peerkoel> I get distracted too often with IRC + code :D
A5:20:47 <Schwerpunk> Laptops in every room...
A5:21:06 <peerkoel> wireless keyboard and plasma screens in every room
A5:21:12 <Zaldos> lol
A5:21:33 <Schwerpunk> Projector above his bed.
A5:21:41 <Schwerpunk> So he can code in his sleep.
A5:22:14 <Schwerpunk> God help us all if they ever invent a device that lets you work in your sleep.
A5:22:19 <Zaldos> does anyone here program?
13A5:22:24 * peerkoel does
A5:22:42 <Zaldos> what language?
13A5:22:54 * iPope also programs
A5:23:07 <peerkoel> mostly scripting stuff, but I also know C/C++ and Java basics
A5:23:18 <peerkoel> I've done Delphi in a dark past
A5:23:19 <iPope> i know python and um..
A5:23:23 <iPope> uhh
A5:23:56 <Zaldos> .
A5:23:59 <peerkoel> if you've written in a few languages you should be able to write in most languages
A5:24:15 <Zaldos> is there any good place for learning c#
A5:24:16 <peerkoel> lisp and brainfuck are examples of languages that do not apply to that logic
A5:24:36 <Schwerpunk> Lat1n is a good base language.
A5:24:41 <Zaldos> my mum tried lisp but too confusing
A5:24:48 <Schwerpunk> Kind of leads in naturally to most others.
A5:24:56 <iPope> COOK gives you a good base for learning C++
A5:25:12 <Zaldos> any places for c#?
A5:25:36 <peerkoel> the net is flooded with C# tutorials and reference info?

A10:48:11 <Mitchcm34> Minecraft !
A10:48:15 <Visiiri> That's because your firewall is still closed, i believe.
A10:48:25 <Viter> I have my anti virus turned off
A10:48:27 <Viter> My firewall
A10:48:36 <Mitchcm34> You gotta mess with your router firewall
A10:48:39 <Mitchcm34> You know how to?
A10:48:56 <Viter> Uhm
A10:48:57 <Visiiri> lol

A10:51:00 <Viter> Like what?
A10:51:00 <Visiiri> Or did you use a software?
A10:51:05 <Viter> I type in 192.168.2.1

P3:54:13 <shozk> considering theres 43,000 registered members
P3:54:25 <ChJees> o_O
P3:54:28 <shozk> that $ should go up a bit when he acually releses something
P3:55:08 <shozk> and only 33% of the people registered have bought it so far

P3:55:44 <shozk> lol
P3:55:45 <shozk> wait
P3:55:50 <Quatroking> its not even near 10%
P3:55:51 <shozk> that can't be right
P3:56:22 <osici> it's more like 3%
P3:56:27 <Quatroking> merely 2.951687% is a premmy
P3:56:31 <shozk> 43,000 / 1200?
P3:56:37 <osici> guess again
P3:56:49 <shozk> that's hella small
P3:56:49 <shozk> right
P3:56:55 <ZomBuster> not really
P3:56:56 <shozk> yeah i suck at math these days
P3:57:13 <ChJees> A whole 2,9%
P3:57:29 <Quatroking> 100 / 43094 = 0.002321

P4:19:15 <Animator> TheKrogMonster.
P4:19:22 <AlexVMiner> and he was a buyer?
P4:19:28 <Animator> Yup.
P4:19:33 <AlexVMiner> he is not good, ip ban always ;D
P4:19:37 <Animator> He even seemed like a nice guy.
P4:19:52 <AlexVMiner> :/
P4:19:54 <Animator> He came by yesterday and I kicked him until he changed his skin.
P4:20:08 <SMP> you kicked him because he had a naked skin?
P4:20:09 <Animator> The we talked and I offered him a skin made by me.
P4:20:12 <ZomBuster> wow kicking peopl because of their skin.. lame
P4:20:18 <SMP> that is pretty silly
P4:20:22 <Animator> Fuck you, this is a kids game.
P4:20:30 <AlexVMiner> lol, kids game
P4:20:31 <SMP> uh no
P4:20:32 <Animator> He was wearing a goddamn naked skin.
P4:20:35 <vede> I'd kick people for ridiculous skins as well.
P4:20:38 <AlexVMiner> while mostly people 18+ play
P4:20:49 <Animator> And people were getting offended by it.
P4:20:52 <ZomBuster> lol 20x30 pixels is realistic nudity
P4:21:01 <AlexVMiner> no
P4:21:08 <AlexVMiner> 64x32
P4:21:09 <SMP> people getting offended by a naked body is silly
P4:21:11 <gear1> soooo
P4:21:12 <gear1> sup
P4:21:22 <vede> It's not the naked part that's offensive.
P4:21:26 <AlexVMiner> was it a fat guy naked?
P4:21:29 <SMP> then what is
P4:21:34 <Animator> No, it was a girls.
P4:21:40 <vede> It's the obvious immaturity on the part of the user.
P4:21:41 <AlexVMiner> O.O
P4:21:42 <gear1> i dont see the problem
P4:21:45 <gear1> boobs A+
P4:21:50 <|404notfound> 64x32 is the size of the whole skin unwrapped

P4:22:37 <SMP> its just a skin, unless they're ACTING immature, then theres no beef
P4:22:50 <vede> Using skin would be acting immature...
P4:23:06 <Animator> You can never dicipher the intention of someone, but judging that this is the internet, it's a 9/10 chance.
P4:23:14 <SMP> technically i guess, but I wouldnt see it that way
P4:23:23 <Animator> Well I do. And I run the server.
P4:23:32 <Animator> SO be quiet and let me continue the story.
P4:23:36 <vede> I assume people that plaster penises everywhere aren't immature either? It's just a penis, eh?
P4:23:39 <SMP> yes m'lord
P4:24:04 <Animator> Anyway, I kicked the guy and told him he's perfectly welcome if he changed his skin.
P4:24:08 <|404notfound> PLAY SECRETLY NOW MY LORD
P4:24:11 <Animator> He did, into the spy from TF2.
P4:24:27 <Animator> It was nice, we talked, and he seemed like a nice guy.

P4:24:42 <Ferretypie> You... trusted a spy?
P4:24:52 <SMP> LOL
P4:24:53 <vede> That's blatant and stupid.

P4:25:32 <ZomBuster> orly
P4:25:40 <Animator> I gave him ops before I left, since the server was going to be alone.
P4:25:46 <SMP> that was smart
P4:25:53 <Animator> Shut up, I didn't know.
P4:25:59 <SMP> lol
P4:26:12 <Animator> You'd probably do the same if you were in my circumstance.
P4:26:25 <Eagle> What was his name?
P4:26:26 <SMP> not gonna say anything
P4:26:31 <AlexVMiner> i am watching you, Animator
P4:26:33 <AlexVMiner> on the game
P4:26:51 <Animator> Anyway, I come by the next day (today) and I find out I'm banned.
P4:26:55 <Ferretypie> Well thats not creepy or anything
P4:27:03 <Animator> And there's 2 people in the server.
P4:27:06 <Eagle> Animator what was his name. :P
P4:27:12 <Animator> TheKrogMonster.
P4:27:17 <AlexVMiner> he already said
P4:27:22 <Eagle> Oh, never heard of him.
P4:27:42 <Animator> Which means bad stuff is going down.
P4:27:49 <Ferretypie> Well..uh..
P4:27:52 <Ferretypie> If its your server
P4:27:59 <Ferretypie> You know you CAN change the settings
P4:28:00 <Ferretypie> Right?
P4:28:09 <Animator> It's not really my server. It's Zach's.
P4:28:18 <Animator> And it's hosted by Mail.
P4:28:23 <Ferretypie> Ah..
P4:28:36 <Animator> I'm the guy who watches over constantly, which makes me a right hand man.
P4:28:43 <SMP> so just tell mail to fix it
P4:28:48 <Animator> He's not here.
P4:28:54 <AlexVMiner> i'm gonna make a pb&j
P4:28:54 <Animator> And it's already fixed.
P4:28:56 <AlexVMiner> brb
P4:29:25 <Animator> Anyway, I contact UnknownX and tell him to get in the server.

P4:30:43 <Animator> And I also tell him to look at TheKrogMonster's skin. Sure enough, he was naked again.
P4:30:50 <Ferretypie> Oh no!
P4:30:52 <Animator> And the puzzle pieces all fell into place.
P4:31:03 <Ferretypie> He was a naturist!
P4:31:15 <Animator> Ha, very funny, no.
P4:31:21 <Ferretypie> ;]
P4:31:45 <Animator> Anyway, I tell Agent what happens, he unbans me and I come on the server.
P4:31:53 <AlexVMiner> :D
P4:31:58 <Animator> And I planned to lecture TheKrogMonster.
P4:32:01 <AlexVMiner> AND ANIMATOR SAVES THE DAY
P4:32:06 <AlexVMiner> :D
P4:32:08 <Animator> But I said 'Fuck it' and I I.P. ban him.
P4:32:08 <SMP> lecturing always works on griefers and trolls
P4:32:32 <AlexVMiner> did you deop him?
P4:32:40 <AlexVMiner> lol
P4:32:47 <Animator> Of course.
P4:32:55 <Animator> AgentKayper did that, actually.
P4:33:01 <Ferretypie> I think the worst thing, is when they're griefing something you took ages doing
P4:33:09 <Ferretypie> And you mispell their name
P4:33:17 <Animator> He tried interrogation and it didn't work. Krog was AFK.
P4:33:29 <Animator> Well, you could just get it from the list.
P4:33:30 <AlexVMiner> just click their name
P4:33:31 <AlexVMiner> lol
P4:33:41 <Animator> What AlexVMiner said.
P4:33:57 <Animator> And after I I.P. banned him, it was the greatest feeling in the world.
P4:33:59 <AlexVMiner> but sometimes i misclick and kick the wrong people
P4:34:07 <AlexVMiner> i never banned the wrong person, though

P4:42:37 <Darkebrz> Soo
P4:42:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> From the comments:
P4:42:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ubuntu didnt use a proprietary driver for RT2500-powered chipsets. Ralink released their driver under GPL right from the beginning and Serial Monkey and his team continued working on it. So the driver Ubuntu used up until recently has been what is now the legacy rt2500 driver.
P4:42:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> To unify support for all ralink chipsets and provide a single, correct interface, the team started working on a new version of driver, which Ubuntu uses in version 7.10. This driver is fully compatible with wpa_supplicant and NetworkManager.
P4:42:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> The driver in Ubuntu 7.10 _IS_ functional. The only problem is that the version of driver used in Ubuntu 7.10 cant connect to wireless networks with hidden SSID, and the throughput is limited to some 100kB/s, otherwise the driver is perfectly functional.
P4:42:45 <Darkebrz> Any word from citricsquid?
P4:42:59 <Flyboy> Can I change height restrictions in omen?

P5:02:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> any server ops needed for anything, anyone?
P5:02:18 <Darkebrz> *something
P5:02:21 <vede> I think the Zone should have been less crowded, and the game should have focused heavily on NPC interaction, both between NPCs, and between the player and NPCs.
P5:02:50 <Zuka> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=81ae0ae9b78918edc39d5619bcb56d0a
P5:03:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> NPC interaction like they did in Mass Effect?

P5:03:12 <vede> I dunno, haven't played Mass Effect.
P5:03:24 <vede> But from what I hear, Mass Effect is very scripted.
P5:03:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> Yeah
P5:03:41 <vede> I would have hoped for an indepth non-scripted NPC interaction ability.
P5:03:43 <Menen> Forums still down?
P5:03:45 <Menen> :o
P5:03:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> but the NPC interaction is pretty good, but people get tired of it sometimes
P5:04:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> brb
P5:04:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> did I put 2 but's in one sentence? shame
P5:04:20 <vede> I know that GSC could have done it. Their AI programmers were top-notch.
P5:04:22 <Zuriki> I like Mass Effect

P5:05:23 <phil> okay
P5:05:26 <phil> that's better
P5:05:35 <vede> Another problem with STALKER is that you didn't rely enough on your bolts. Had it been closer to Roadside Picnic, you would have relied on your bolts for your life almost everywhere.

P5:06:42 <AgentKaypar> uh, is it just me, or were bolts not integrated into the stealth part at all?
P5:06:52 <vede> The stealth was pretty weak.
P5:07:09 <AgentKaypar> Instinctively, I'd throw a bolt to distract a guard, to no effect
P5:07:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> I wasn't aware there was very much stealth involved in the game

P5:08:30 <Darkebrz> We really need server labels
P5:08:39 <Darkebrz> Like a little [FL] tag for flatgrass
P5:08:46 <Zuka> can someone tell me how to fly real quick? i need to delete something :/
P5:08:47 <Zuriki> FG

P6:12:12 <AlexVMiner> Phun = lame
P6:12:16 <AlexVMiner> jk, never played
P6:12:33 <Conundrumer> well, that's true

P6:13:24 <vede> The amount you can hold in OE cake doesn't seem limited with rigid things, but it is with everything else.

P6:18:29 <vede> It has strings and rigid bodies and such.

P6:18:52 <Conundrumer> it has strings?
P6:19:12 <vede> Yeah.
P6:19:13 <mooogle> i love oe-cake :3
P6:19:16 <vede> And elastic strings.
P6:19:30 <mooogle> i like using the motion sensor with my computer
P6:19:37 <Conundrumer> what about pistons?
P6:19:46 <vede> And heaters and coolers, and rigid bodies that stay in one place and can rotate.
P6:20:01 <vede> And water can become steam.
P6:20:05 <vede> And steam can move things.
P6:20:16 <vede> So I guess one might be able to theoretically make a steam engine.
P6:20:27 <Conundrumer> are there any motors?
P6:20:38 <vede> No.
P6:20:52 <Darkebrz> Conundrumer, OE-Cake is particle based
P6:20:54 <vede> You'd have to supply it with water.
P6:21:05 <vede> But you can make an object that constantly creates water.
P6:21:11 <Conundrumer> or hinges?

P6:21:34 <Darkebrz> So obviously you cant attach hinges to a liquid
P6:21:37 <vede> OE-Cake has rigid bodies and such, too...
P6:21:41 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P6:21:46 <Conundrumer> someone meantioned rigid bodi
P6:21:46 <Darkebrz> But the physics on those are horrid
P6:21:47 <Conundrumer> yea
P6:21:55 <vede> But they work.
P6:22:00 <vede> And they're way fun.
P6:22:04 <Conundrumer> impractical, i gues
P6:22:13 <Darkebrz> And they are just there for messing around with the liquids :P
P6:22:38 <Conundrumer> i guess you didn't watch the video
P6:22:43 <vede> So you can make solid things with liquid things.
P6:22:48 <PuyoDead> hmm, wonder how steam pressure would work

P7:36:31 <liq3> Hanke: no, the desire to get more items has been psychologically proven to be well, manipulation. Anyone with half a brain knows they're playing on your emotions, the game itself has no real content.
P7:36:34 <Hanke> neither do i
P7:36:51 <Hanke> i don't care liq3
P7:37:00 <Hanke> since if i enjoy the game because of that

P8:15:46 <Animator> I was never that much into Anime.

P8:15:51 <Quatroking> umm
P8:15:57 <Quatroking> I'm pretty sure I'm missing some
P8:16:00 <Adura> Fedders Lloyd Corporation Limited
P8:16:16 <Quatroking> Clannad the movie..
P8:16:22 <Animator> I know four of those, out of that list.
P8:16:33 <Animator> And I've only watched 2 of what I just said.
P8:16:43 <Quatroking> My Neighbour totoro, ponyo on the cliffs by sea, kiki's delivery service
P8:16:45 <Animator> Oh wait, 5. Can't leave out Gurren Lagann.
P8:16:53 <PuyoDead> I see a disturbing lack of Miyakazi there
P8:16:54 <Animator> But it's still 2.
P8:17:00 <Quatroking> Hmm
P8:17:00 <Visiiri> Ohia
P8:17:00 <PuyoDead> ok, there it goes
P8:17:03 <Visiiri> I'm back.
P8:17:05 <Visiiri> Again.
P8:17:11 <Quatroking> Oh you mean Studio Ghibli?
P8:17:20 <PuyoDead> no, Miyazaki
P8:17:30 <Visiiri> >.<
P8:17:37 <Quatroking> same thing damnit.
P8:17:39 <PuyoDead> I refer to directors, not studios
P8:17:50 <PuyoDead> directors/writers
P8:17:54 <Quatroking> I don't consider Spirited Away a ghibli anyways
P8:18:07 <PuyoDead> yea, not all Ghibli stuff is Miyazaki
P8:18:23 <Quatroking> Spirited Away is still a great movie tho
P8:18:29 <PuyoDead> yea, I love that one
P8:18:32 <Quatroking> Howl's moving castle, not to forget
P8:18:37 <Quatroking> oh, and I watched steamboy
P8:18:40 <PuyoDead> Nausicaa is my favorite of his, though
P8:19:15 <Quatroking> Anyways, for your information, I've got Totoro's freaking tree in my bedroom

13P8:22:54 * Quatroking goes all Lucy on PuyoDead
P8:23:07 <PuyoDead> english dub would be a compliment for this
P8:23:22 <PuyoDead> this is the cover: http://powet.tv/powetblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/warriors_of_the_wind_cover.jpg
P8:23:30 <Quatroking> english dubs are evil, except for ghost in the shell
P8:23:54 <Quatroking> Ghost in the Shell has almost the same voices
P8:24:11 <liq3> Puyodead: lol wtf @ cover.
P8:24:13 <Quatroking> oh, and I watched The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, season 1
P8:24:17 <PuyoDead> yea, it's amazing
P8:24:19 <liq3> It looks like one of those old novel covers.
P8:24:37 <PuyoDead> it's probably the worst english localization in history
P8:24:41 <Quatroking> sonuvabitch
P8:24:47 <Quatroking> hmm
P8:24:50 <PuyoDead> and why none of his films even came out here until recently
P8:25:20 <Quatroking> Now that Ponyo came out in cinema here in The Netherlands, they're releasing all the other ghibli's on DVD here
P8:25:25 <Quatroking> I'm in fucking heaven
P8:25:43 <PuyoDead> Princess Mononoke opened the gates back up here
P8:25:48 <Quatroking> they all contain the original voices!!!
P8:26:59 <PuyoDead> I'd strongly suggest reading the whole Nausicaa series
P8:27:32 <Quatroking> I'd strongly suggest not watching any disney dubs
P8:27:53 <Quatroking> they even add new voices to Totoro and the Catbus D:
P8:28:16 <PuyoDead> actually, the dubs are pretty much on par with many other dubs. as in, not as good obviously, but good enough to not detract from the story
P8:28:46 <PuyoDead> and the reason being, Miyakazi -made- Disney leave his stuff totally untouched after the warriors of the wind embarrasment
P8:29:52 <Quatroking> disney is gay
P8:29:55 <Quatroking> fact
P8:30:09 <PuyoDead> Disney hasn't had an original thought since they first started
P8:30:19 <Quatroking> exactly.
P8:30:34 <Quatroking> just look at this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOIrXGd51jE
P8:30:45 <PuyoDead> if it wasn't for Pixar holding them up, their animation presence would be dead
P8:30:50 <Quatroking> THEY'RE FUCKING LAZY
P8:31:00 <PuyoDead> and even then, they almost screwed that up
P8:31:00 <Quatroking> Pixar is pretty good
P8:31:12 <Quatroking> I loved... uh
P8:31:16 <Quatroking> that robot.
P8:31:57 <PuyoDead> wall-e was brilliant

P9:27:37 <UnknownX> $2,499??!?!?
P9:27:46 <UnknownX> I'd rather buy a computer
P9:27:51 <mooogle> you can pirate anything
P9:27:58 <mooogle> do you really think people pay for that stuff?
P9:28:05 <Maulrus> actully
P9:28:10 <Maulrus> is you have a kid in school
P9:28:16 <mooogle> well besides that
P9:28:17 <Maulrus> any age, k-12
P9:28:20 <Maulrus> you can get it for 1000
P9:28:24 <Maulrus> which is an amazing deal
P9:28:31 <mooogle> oh i thought you meant if your in college
P9:28:48 <mooogle> because if your using it for a business you need a license for it
P9:28:51 <Maulrus> or if you're a teacher
P9:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes
P9:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Many people do... Business, design pros, etc
P9:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Otherwise Adobe wouldn't sell them in the first place
P9:28:56 <mooogle> thats really the only time i would ever need to buy it
P9:29:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, legally you need one no matter what :P
P9:29:17 <Maulrus> my dad got 1500 off by copying my school idea and sending it to this retailer
P9:29:18 <PuyoDead> only professions purchase it, since they pretty much need to
P9:29:21 <Maulrus> *id
P9:29:32 <PuyoDead> it's not targeted to "consumer" level
P9:29:50 <citricsquid> most people pirate regardless of price
P9:29:59 <citricsquid> it's so high so they can make back on profesisonal purchasers
P9:30:04 <citricsquid> like schools and design companies
P9:30:09 <citricsquid> who have to purchase it.
P9:30:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-g7Ie0nr2k
P9:30:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> FUCK THIS
P9:30:27 <PuyoDead> yea, they've hit that weird point where we HAVE to pirate it to use it, yet they make money off the people that HAVE to buy it to use it
P9:30:45 <PuyoDead> there's a lot of things I pirate that I end up buying, though
P9:31:04 <citricsquid> i buy if i can and the price is reasonable.
P9:31:12 <citricsquid> I buy most games.
P9:31:14 <TrueWolves> Same
P9:31:19 <citricsquid> don't think I've ever pirated a game actually.
P9:31:28 <citricsquid> oh, far cry 2. Thank fuck I pirated it, shit game.
P9:31:47 <vede> Far Cry 2 was awesome.
P9:32:06 <PuyoDead> oh good lord... I don't even know how many games I've downloaded
P9:32:23 <citricsquid> im not much of a gamer though.
P9:33:03 <vede> All you people were like "myeh myeh myeh there's so many gunfights myeh myeh myeh"
P9:33:14 <PuyoDead> whoa... /roms is 94 GB
P9:33:27 <vede>  O_o
P9:33:55 <PuyoDead> that's just the stuff I keep on here that isn't on the HDD
P9:34:25 <PuyoDead> yet I have thousands of dollars worth of video games and consoles all over the place here
P9:34:27 <vede> I used to be really anti-piracy and anti-emulators/roms and such.
P9:34:46 <vede> Now I pirate at least 80% of the games I play.
P9:35:03 <PuyoDead> if it's a game I know I want, I'll buy it
P9:35:03 <vede> But I never really started using emulators/roms again.
P9:35:28 <PuyoDead> otherwise, I'll download things I'm interested in, and if I enjoy it, I buy it
P9:35:30 <citricsquid> haha, parents come back friday, I need to fix the carpet that I set on fire.
P9:35:47 <PuyoDead> that, err... that would be a fine idea
P9:36:04 <PuyoDead> not sure how you're going to "fix" that :P
P9:36:09 <citricsquid> I have a plan
P9:36:16 <citricsquid> involving stealing carpet from elsewhere
P9:36:18 <citricsquid> and replacing it.
P9:36:43 <vede> If it's a game I know I want, then I decide whether to buy or pirate it based on the developer and how much money I have.
P9:36:44 <PuyoDead> we've got some extra sand/tan colored carpet here
P9:37:03 <vede> If it's made by Valve, or if it's indie, I'll either buy it or not play it.

P9:37:24 <Darkebrz> Hmm
P9:37:35 <Darkebrz> Citricsquid, how do you plan to get the money?
P9:37:45 <citricsquid2> I don't /like/ pirating, but I can't justify $50 on a game I'll play for 10 minutes.
P9:37:47 <vede> Prostitution, prolly.
P9:37:54 <PuyoDead> exactly
P9:38:14 <citricsquid2> Darkebrz: been lubing up!
P9:38:38 <vede> In my mind, I can hardly justify paying for a game that doesn't theoretically have nearly-infinite gameplay possibility.
P9:38:51 <vede> Like procedurally generated levels.
P9:39:07 <PuyoDead> personally, I've never quite liked the idea of all games being the same price
P9:39:14 <citricsquid2> If it works out <$1 per hour played, I'll buy a game. For example I'd have no problem paying $50 for minecraft as I've played at least 80 hours on it.

P10:06:53 <LKA> UnknownX: what
P10:06:55 <Quatroking> blue neon is sooooo cliche

P10:07:40 <LKA> Why
P10:07:55 <Quatroking> liq3: is red neon really uncommon or something?
P10:08:03 <LKA> I might go pick up the ROM sometime in a bit though, to dick around on it with cheats
P10:08:08 <Quatroking> Black case with red neon is the perfect combination, right
P10:08:11 <LKA> I play it legit so much ;_;
P10:08:15 <liq3> I'm wondering where the red neon is coming from.

P10:08:39 <liq3> The common thing is for the computer to NOT emit neon light.
P10:08:46 <PuyoDead> UnknownX: I did!
P10:08:50 <UnknownX> Because if you did i would have to find you, brutally stab you, cut your limbs off, throw you into a lake, and throw your computer in the lake on top of you

P10:40:40 <citricsquid> Eagle: You can't modify backend though
P10:40:49 <citricsquid> css and html != enough customization

P10:41:32 <citricsquid> not that modified, but the plan is for lots more. More than could be done with a free host.
P10:41:41 <Eagle> Invisionfree has forums and subforums which should be enough for Minecraft forums. :P

P10:41:53 <citricsquid> MEDALS.
P10:41:57 <Eagle> CSS
P10:42:24 <Eagle> I've seen medals, currency, board rearrangement, etc done with css.
P10:42:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> and another medal
P10:42:57 <citricsquid> eagle: css is just styling a page, proper medal system that I have planned would require a database.
P10:43:05 <Eagle> I've seriously seen it.
P10:43:59 <citricsquid> admin would have to manually do it for every user, just with css =\
P10:44:04 <|404notfound> if you mean actually tracking stuff like medals, I'm pretty sure that's impossible
P10:44:15 <citricsquid> |404notfound: correct, physically impossible.
P10:45:00 <Eagle> I used to run a currency/prize system on an invisionfree forum that I used to have.
P10:45:11 <|404notfound> you can make graphics with CSS by having a <div> per pixel, or some other obtuse roundabout method like that, but ultimately CSS is just for layout stuff
P10:48:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> that sounds complicated
