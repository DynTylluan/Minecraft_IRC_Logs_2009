A12:00:06 <paul|not> that will always work daid
A12:00:10 <paul|not> right port?
A12:00:12 <liq3> yeh it does
A12:00:17 <liq3> It just worked for me right thehn.
A12:00:25 <paul|not> also, are you one the same computer or a different one in the same network
A12:00:29 <Daidoji> yes
A12:00:37 <paul|not> ---
A12:00:39 <paul|not> that helps tons
A12:00:40 <Xerux> is name verification on?
A12:00:45 <Daidoji> it's the same computer
A12:00:54 <paul|not> then turn off verify names?
A12:01:07 <Daidoji> what the hell does that even mean
A12:01:38 <Xerux> it checks to see that someone isn't faking their name
A12:01:59 <Daidoji> and what does that have to do with..
A12:02:33 <PuyoDead> oh boy...
A12:02:54 <Xerux> somehow that keeps the server host from joining. (we are talking about names-verify right?)
A12:03:17 <paul|not> it verifies all names and IPs with md5's
A12:03:26 <paul|not> which prevents the host from joining locally
A12:03:54 <Daidoji> "You can't connect to the server via this url any more!"
A12:03:56 <Daidoji> I get that
A12:04:06 <paul|not> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
A12:04:07 <paul|not> yeah?
A12:04:55 <Daidoji> well that just crashes.
A12:05:08 <Daidoji> what the shit is going on. I didn't have these problems before.
A12:05:40 <PuyoDead> there's a known problem right now, most people are crashing. we just have to wait until notch wakes up and gets to it
A12:07:56 <Xerux> can someone check if there's another update or if I just somehow lost the cached packages. (no one get your hopes up, it's probably my end)
A12:08:33 <PuyoDead> nothin'
A12:08:57 <Xerux> odd, guess I did lose them.
A12:08:58 <liq3> Xerux: Did you leave out the www?
A12:09:02 <Evil-Ville> This server called "Creativity Unbound (Moderated)" is filled with insane people

A12:30:04 <Jesse> When was this update?
A12:30:11 <Xerux> today
A12:30:33 <Jesse> Did it add anything new besides the freezing?

A12:32:47 <vdgmprgrmr> At least it's just fuckin' Minecraft for you guys.
A12:33:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I've had to reboot ten times today because my computer's been randomly freezing up.
A12:33:26 <Genisi> minecraft kart 64
A12:33:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Minekart 64.
A12:33:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Minecrart 64.
A12:34:07 <vdgmprgrmr>  :/
A12:34:27 <Xerux> you guys are making me want to play mario kart 64.
A12:34:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is so 1997.
A12:37:01 <vdgmprgrmr> My computer's freezing and all mah filez are getting corrupted.
A12:37:11 <Jesse> uh oh
A12:37:15 <vdgmprgrmr> It's been, like, five days since I reinstalled.
A12:37:21 <Jesse> your os?
A12:37:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
A12:37:30 <Xerux> what os?
A12:37:30 <Jesse> sounds like a hardware problem then
A12:37:40 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm thinking it is.
A12:37:43 <Jesse> your hardrive could be going
A12:37:46 <Xerux> I've had a similar problem before.
A12:37:47 <Jesse> thats what it sounds like to me
A12:37:52 <vdgmprgrmr> But my hard drive is perfectly okay.
10A12:38:09 * flak (1@80.255.188.254) has joined #minecraft
A12:38:11 <vdgmprgrmr> It's been working fine.

A12:38:34 <Jesse> Maybe the operating system is installing wrong in that case.
A12:38:35 <Ebonblade> Stupid Question but I need to know: Has anyone released a map editor yet?
A12:38:39 <Xerux> It was due to a tin memory stick in a gold slot.(doesn't apply today, but oxide built up causing a bad connection) could be you've got a bad stick.
A12:38:59 <Xerux> my relatives computer was doing the same stuff and that was it
A12:39:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I installed XP 64-bit (instead of normal XP) on a computer with a processor and RAM sticks that came out of a computer that got fried.
12A12:39:36 * Jesse (Jesse@206.168.41.254) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A12:39:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I think Xerux's idea has merit, since one of the four sticks that came out of it WAS actually bad.
A12:40:20 <vdgmprgrmr> But I don't really see how that could cause my hard drive to screw up.
A12:40:29 <vdgmprgrmr> (Of course, I'm not a hardware guy.)
A12:40:40 <Xerux> memtest didn't find the bad stick on relative's computer, but there was only two sticks so trial and error found it.
A12:40:40 <Evil-Ville> hard drives suck, they screw up all by themselves
A12:41:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Trust me I know, Evil-Ville, I had to deal with one that was way past screwing up for about three years.
A12:41:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Reinstalling fucking Windows every week.
A12:41:20 <Xerux> neither do I, my old computer's bad memory was screwing up write addresses, making files overwrite parts of each other.
A12:41:36 <Xerux> it could destroy windows 98 in 10 minutes
A12:42:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I finally got a new one and was able to *beat the living crap* out of the old hard drive with multiple instruments of destruction.
A12:43:19 <Evil-Ville> I can't wait for SSDs to become the standard
A12:43:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, those will be happy days.
A12:44:42 <Xerux> don't they have a fairly low write limit or are ssds different than the stuff usb keys use?
A12:45:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, the same, but you can find normal-sized SSDs out there.
A12:45:22 <vdgmprgrmr> They're just hella expensive, if I remember right.
A12:46:24 <Evil-Ville> Xerux: Reaching that write limit is going to take much longer than it will take for average HDD to fail
A12:46:32 <Evil-Ville> Atleast with new SSDs
A12:47:49 <Evil-Ville> 160GB SSD costs around 600 euros here heh
A12:51:14 <Xerux> evil-ville: ah, I never really thought about how the increased size would affect that.
A12:53:44 <Xerux> anyone know what happened to the giant pyramid and castle server? (I know the pyramid kept getting destroyed)
A12:54:14 <m0bus> has anyone seen party-cat's server?
A12:54:57 <m0bus> vdg, its not just minecraft
A12:55:04 <m0bus> its maya and photoshop for me too
A12:57:03 <Evil-Ville> What's up with the ocean build server that doesn't even have ocean?
A12:58:04 <m0bus> ocean build server isnt the REAL ocean build server
A12:58:19 <m0bus> someone ripped that one off of redshift
A12:58:52 <Dilt> man, I love this old blockland drama
A12:58:59 <Dilt> someone saves the map, re-hosts it on another server
A12:59:02 <Dilt> claims it as their own

A2:34:08 <Evil-Ville> I don't see anything wrong with the rules
A2:37:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh come on.
A2:37:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, the Spleef I made had about the same exact rules as you guys have.
A2:37:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Except the arena was a square and had corners boxing-ring style.
A2:38:12 <vdgmprgrmr> (It even had the two-layer floor, but that wasn't my suggestion.)
A2:51:44 <liq3> Evil-Ville: It's possible to force a draw, or draw the game out forever.
A2:54:58 <liq3> Zomg, I just thought up epic way to play Spleef.
A2:55:05 <liq3> Although kinda requires solid skybox...
A2:55:27 <liq3> It's basically normal Spleef, except there's no roof, and you are allowed to build, and the walls go up to the skybox!. :D
A2:55:44 <liq3> I'd love laughing at silly people who think building giant towers will win.

A4:14:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Prolly because Minecraft is currently having trouble with memory.
A4:14:51 <Redshift> poobably
A4:15:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Normal maps are causing people to crash, so a 384^3 map would be horrifying.
A4:15:17 <Bobo> yeah mines running le crap
A4:15:26 <Bobo> is it seriously because of mac users?
A4:15:34 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it happens to everyone.
A4:15:34 <Bobo> there should be zero support for them
A4:15:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Oooh, I get what you're saying.
A4:16:01 <Bobo> if you buy a mac, you shouldnt expect to be able to run games anyway
A4:16:02 <Bobo> lol
A4:16:04 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't know what sparked its creation...
A4:18:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Whoa...
A4:18:39 <vdgmprgrmr> With Rosetta's MCTool, you can set the spawn point to be far above the normal upper map limit.

A4:41:03 <mib_zjjphcvo> cant move cus spawn is in an admin crated blockade

A4:42:52 <vdgmprgrmr> mib, they're not powerHUNGRY if they already have as much power as they can have.

A4:46:51 <Redshift> you get pushed the the next best place above it
A4:47:01 <Redshift> easy way to get on top of towers

A5:54:12 <Bobo> the fact is
A5:54:16 <Bobo> if someone has a girls name
A5:54:19 <Bobo> they're probably a guy

A5:57:13 <Bobo> ah
A5:57:14 <Bobo> yeah same

A5:57:19 <Zuriki> Grave of Fireflies for example

A5:57:30 <Bobo> but they're not really anime
A5:57:32 <Zuriki> Indeed.
A5:57:33 <Bobo> they're just japanese films
A5:57:35 <Zuriki> Same people though.
A5:57:40 <Bobo> anime is like
A5:57:44 <Bobo> a powerpoint slideshow of fail
A5:57:53 <Zuriki> Not really.
A5:58:09 <Bobo> oh really?
A5:58:16 <Bobo> i actually think its a powerpoint slideshow
A5:58:19 <Zuriki> It's more of a subtle porn slideshow.
A5:58:19 <Bobo> for real
A5:58:27 <Kira> it's not the anime that's the problem, it's the people who watch it
A5:58:38 <Bobo> kira: agreed
A5:58:44 <Bobo> i think thats the only reason i have a hatred for anime
A5:58:44 <Zuriki> No, it comes hand in hand.
A5:58:47 <Bobo> the fans
A5:58:55 <Bobo> they only talk about it
A5:58:57 <Bobo> nothing else

A6:00:45 <Stargoat> let's not talk in generalities here. Most anime is shit, but there's some good stuff.
A6:00:49 <Bobo> prove me wrong, are you a girl
A6:00:54 <Zuriki> *blasting off aaggggggaaaaaiiiiinnnnnn*
A6:01:03 <Bobo> lol, i quite liked pokemon
A6:01:10 <Bobo> i think thats just because i love the games
A6:01:13 <Zuriki> -.-#
A6:01:14 <Evil-Ville> Most everything is shit
A6:01:33 <Kira> most of it is horrible, and almost all of the popular anime is completely crap
A6:02:09 <Stargoat> Evil-Ville: no, 80% of everything is shit.
A6:02:10 <Zuriki> *kira is cleverly hiding the fact that -it- is a girl*
A6:02:24 <Evil-Ville> 80% is most
A6:02:35 <Stargoat> Anyway, I think Cowboy Bebop, Trigun (maybe...) and Neon Genesis are worth watching.
A6:02:49 <Kira> evangelion is horrible, it really is
A6:02:54 <Stargoat> woah, really?
A6:03:00 <Stargoat> how do you figure that?
A6:03:12 <Zuriki> Anyone ever done homebrew programming for a console?
A6:03:18 <Kira> it's nothing but unneccesary drama
A6:03:42 <Stargoat> nah man
A6:03:48 <Stargoat> it's about the human psyche
A6:03:48 <Evil-Ville> evangelion is alright
A6:03:51 <Zuriki> Am I the only person who doesn't watch a ton of anime and still thinks it's shit.
A6:04:42 <Zuriki> I have the old hags theme tune in my head (Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask)
A6:04:59 <Stargoat> Majora's Mask is the best 3d zelda.
A6:05:01 <Stargoat> Discuss.
A6:05:19 <Zuriki> Ocarina of Time = Best 3D Zelda for Gameplay
A6:05:19 <Kira> it's about the human psyche of an psychotic emo 14 year old boy
A6:05:37 <Zuriki> Majora's Mask = Best 3D Zelda for Atmosphere and Storyline
A6:05:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Wind Waker = best Zelda game fo evah
A6:05:40 <Stargoat> hmm
A6:05:41 <Kira> and I don't think anybody really cares to know that
A6:06:04 <Stargoat> probably, Zuriki. I did find the temples (minus the stone temple, which was one of the best ever) a little lacking
A6:06:06 <Zuriki> Wind Waker = Boring and repetative with the same sea scenery for hours
A6:06:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I loved it.
A6:06:23 <Evil-Ville> I agree vdgmprgrmr
A6:06:25 <Evil-Ville> Sailing is the best
A6:06:32 <vdgmprgrmr> The sailing was awesome/.
A6:06:35 <Zuriki> I didn't like the art style either.
A6:06:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I liked everything about that game...
A6:06:57 <Zuriki> Which is something they've diverted from for console zelda's which I am thankful.
A6:07:26 <Zuriki> Twilight Princess=  Anyone actually play this?
A6:07:27 <vdgmprgrmr> And yet it still does not hold a place among my Best Games in the Universe...
A6:07:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Twilight Princess sucked.
A6:07:39 <Stargoat> I played TP
A6:07:42 <Stargoat> it's nothing special
A6:07:44 <Stargoat> very textbook
A6:07:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course, I didn't like most of the Zelda games.
A6:07:48 <Kira> the DS ones were the worst
A6:07:55 <Zuriki> I never bought it in the end. I was going to get it on GC.
A6:07:57 <Stargoat> incidently, it's by the same designer as behind MM
A6:08:06 <Kira> or one, but the second one looks to be just as horrible
A6:08:08 <Stargoat> which is very interesting, because one is awesome, and one is not.
A6:08:11 <vdgmprgrmr> OOT, Majora's Mask I especially hated, any of the Gameboy games.
A6:08:19 <Evil-Ville> Ocarina of Time is the worst zelda game
A6:08:22 <Stargoat> hooooooooly shti
A6:08:33 <Kira> the gameboy games were the best, especially link's awakening
A6:08:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Shti?
A6:08:42 <Stargoat> how could you hate MM, vdgmprgrmr? it's so.... rich, full of life
A6:08:46 <Kira> that's the best one out of the entire series
A6:08:47 <Stargoat> shit*
A6:08:47 <vdgmprgrmr> The Gameboy games sucked very lots of things.
A6:08:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I didn't like it.
A6:08:56 <Zuriki> OoT holds the crown as the best game ever, it got the most awards and an average rating across the boards of 98%
A6:09:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Means nothing, Zuriki.
A6:09:12 <Stargoat> each to their own, I guess, but let it be known that you are, in fact, crazy
A6:09:20 <Zuriki> How can you say that.
A6:09:30 <Zuriki> They give awards for a reason.
A6:09:37 <Stargoat> OoT is alright. Most people hold it higher because of that silly nostalgia thing
A6:09:43 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Are you being sarcastic?
A6:09:50 <Zuriki> No.
A6:09:53 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Okay.
A6:09:59 <Stargoat> :|
A6:10:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you should probably know that it's impossible to objectively rate how fun games are.
A6:10:21 <Kira> no it's not
A6:10:27 <Kira> minecraft
A6:10:28 <Zuriki> I don't know. I replayed the game on PC and I had quiet a bit of fun.
A6:10:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Kira, that's an exception that proves the rule.
A6:10:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Or something like that.
A6:11:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Either way, MM was not fun for me.
A6:11:29 <vdgmprgrmr> It felt so random.
A6:11:40 <Zuriki> Up to where I got (not very far) it was quiet atmospheric, but I never completed it.
A6:11:57 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, there was nothing that made sense at all.

A6:12:18 <Zuriki> He was in an alternate dimension.
A6:12:50 <vdgmprgrmr> You end up a deku, in a weird underground forest cave thing, come out into a clocktower, meet a guy who carries masks all around and can pull pipe organs out of hammerspace, learn to travel through time, and the fucking moon is falling.
A6:12:52 <vdgmprgrmr> W
A6:12:53 <vdgmprgrmr> T
A6:12:54 <vdgmprgrmr> F
A6:13:08 <vdgmprgrmr> The game felt, I assume, like some sort of acid trip.
A6:13:16 <Stargoat> :p
A6:13:16 <Zuriki> Alternate dimension.
A6:13:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Well then alternate dimension =/= fun
A6:13:30 <vdgmprgrmr> For me.
A6:13:40 <Stargoat> how much of MM did you play, vdgmprgrmr?
A6:13:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I played enough to realize I didn't want to play any more.
A6:14:12 <Stargoat> good job
A6:14:21 <Zuriki> *steps outside of the clock tower* I don't like this game.
A6:14:42 <vdgmprgrmr> No, the "I don't like this game" happened around the "meets the weird mask dude" stage.
10A6:14:52 * Shoeburger (chatzilla@203-59-119-142.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined #minecraft
A6:14:57 <Stargoat> oh, so he didn't even leave the clocktower
A6:15:00 <Zuriki> So before you step outside.
A6:15:01 <vdgmprgrmr> But my friend insisted "no no it gets bettahh!"
A6:15:03 <Zuriki> :P
A6:15:06 <vdgmprgrmr> So I kept fucking playing.
A6:15:10 <vdgmprgrmr> It was like torture.
A6:15:18 <Stargoat> I thought the intro was fucking amazing, incidently
10A6:15:24 * Shoeburger is now known as TrandomKaggus
A6:15:30 <Stargoat> ofcourse you're going to hate it if you hate it from the start
A6:15:41 <vdgmprgrmr> I got to the point where, like, you looking through a giant telescope at the weird dude causes a piece of the moon to fall off.
A6:15:50 <Zuriki> Moon tear
A6:15:57 <vdgmprgrmr> It was absurd.
A6:15:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I hated it.
A6:16:04 <Stargoat> there's a little thing called "confirmation bias"
A6:16:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I didn't go into it not liking it!
A6:16:25 <vdgmprgrmr> (And I know what confirmation bias is.)
A6:16:30 <vdgmprgrmr> I wanted to like it!
A6:16:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Everyone said it was SOOOO good.
A6:16:41 <Kira> how about we talk about good games? like Cubivore
A6:16:42 <Zuriki> For the most part you went in already hating it.
A6:17:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I STARTED THE GAME with a good impression of it.
A6:17:11 <Zuriki> Up to mask salesman
A6:17:21 <Zuriki> Which is basically the REAL start of the game.
A6:17:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I even thought the whole masks-turning-you-into-stuff was a somewhat cool idea, if it was done properly.
A6:17:40 <vdgmprgrmr> But then it was all like "woop-dee-doo-pass-the-joint".
A6:17:53 <Stargoat> you seem to have a pretty big anti-drugs thing going on here
A6:17:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Not necessarily.
A6:18:05 <Zuriki> Meh, I have programming to be getting on with.
A6:18:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Just not a good thing for a game to seem like it's on drugs.
A6:19:01 <Stargoat> I guess you shouldn't play Killer 7

A6:19:09 <Stargoat> (incidently, one of the best games I've ever played)
A6:19:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I've heard of Killer 7.
A6:19:35 <vdgmprgrmr> But I don't really know about it.
A6:19:55 <flak> i like weird games
A6:19:57 <Stargoat> don't worry, you won't like it
A6:20:00 <vdgmprgrmr> But from what I hear, it's a console game, and I don't really have a console to play it on anymore.
A6:20:07 <flak> McGee's Alice, for example
A6:20:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I've moved almost exclusively to PC.
A6:20:29 <Stargoat> why bother making Alice In Wonderland more tripped-out? It's already off the charts.
A6:20:41 <Stargoat> (I haven't actually played McGee's Alice, incidently)
A6:21:12 <flak> http://schneef.com/gallery/data/media/6/Alice_American_McGee_s.jpg
A6:21:27 <Stargoat> I believe there's some good progress going into PS2 emulation
A6:21:43 <Stargoat> dunno if Killer7 works well, however
A6:22:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I think the game with the oddest premise I've ever actually liked was...
A6:22:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno...
A6:22:27 <Kira> Alice was great
A6:22:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Most of the games I like are pretty down-to-earth.
A6:22:47 <citricsquid> minecraft crashed :'(
A6:22:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Citricsquid, it's happening.
A6:23:01 <vdgmprgrmr> To everyone.
A6:23:14 <citricsquid> oh =(
A6:23:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Except meeeeee because I play on da small maps, and they seem to work fine.
A6:23:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And even on Normal maps it doesn't crash that often.
A6:25:09 <Zuriki> Well, I have an issue. Regarding destructable 2D terrains. How should I allow an enemy to reach the player over a drop. Should they take a build with them and build bridges or have a unique ability to jump over short gaps and climb walls.
A6:25:36 <Zuriki> Or destory sections of the map and make a path to the player.

A6:26:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, my four favoritest games: "Chernobyl explodes again, weird stuff" "Government conspiracy" "aliens attack" "dungeons of doom"
A6:26:48 <Zuriki> STALKER
A6:26:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, STALKER.
A6:26:54 <Zuriki> First one.
A6:26:56 <Stargoat> STALKER, Deus Ex, ...XCOM?
A6:27:00 <Stargoat> not sure about the last?
A6:27:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Iji.
A6:27:03 <Stargoat> ah
A6:27:06 <vdgmprgrmr> The last is Rogue.
A6:27:10 <Stargoat> oh, right
A6:27:19 <Stargoat> ADOM is my RL of choice
A6:27:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Stalker's probably the oddest of the bunch...
A6:27:25 <Stargoat> STALKER is a great game, by the way
A6:27:32 <vdgmprgrmr> STALKER changed my life...
A6:27:36 <Stargoat> hah
A6:27:38 <Stargoat> woah
A6:27:44 <Stargoat> it was good, but I wouldn't say that good...
A6:28:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I loved it more than any man should love a video game...
A6:28:11 <Zuriki> o_O
A6:28:18 <Zuriki> Bye
A6:28:21 <Stargoat> it was merely a game that didn't suck a fucking bunch among everything else released in the past 5 years
A6:28:29 <Stargoat> was I right about Deus Ex?
A6:29:00 <Zuriki> Well, I have an issue. Regarding destructable 2D terrains. How should I allow an enemy to reach the player over a drop. Should they take a build with them and build bridges or have a unique ability to jump over short gaps and climb walls. Or destory sections of the map and make a path to the player.
A6:29:09 <Zuriki> Reposting and hoping for a reply.
A6:29:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I read the novel it was based on. Read other novels by the same author. Watched a movie based on the novel it was based on (which sucked). Started learning to speak Russian. Became fascinated with Russian culture/history.
A6:29:12 <Stargoat> Zuriki: What's the context>
A6:29:22 <vdgmprgrmr> And yeah, Deus Ex was right.
A6:29:22 <Zuriki> A game I'm making.
A6:29:33 <Stargoat> okay, but without knowing what the game is about...
A6:29:41 <vdgmprgrmr> I say they build stuff.
A6:29:44 <Zuriki> It's an RTS of sorts.
A6:29:48 <Stargoat> okay
A6:29:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Definitely build stuff then.
A6:29:56 <Zuriki> And it's 2D and the map is made up of tiles.
A6:29:57 <Stargoat> an RTS, yeah, building stuff sounds good
A6:30:23 <Zuriki> I gave examples.
A6:30:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you can use the enemy's past actions against them strategically and all that.
A6:30:31 <Stargoat> destroying sections of terrain could be interesting
A6:30:42 <Stargoat> especially if the ebemy player can weigh up the most efficient route
A6:30:46 <Zuriki> Considering most of the game is spent doing that.
A6:30:49 <Zuriki> :P
A6:30:53 <Stargoat> (costs more to build bridge, takes longer to cut through?)
A6:31:07 <Stargoat> enemy*
A6:31:20 <Zuriki> Maybe...
A6:31:45 <Zuriki> You don't technically *buy* bridges. You build them from gathered resources.
A6:31:56 <Stargoat> oh
A6:32:45 <Zuriki> That being said, I need to add ladders to this game too...
A6:32:56 <Zuriki> Otherwise you might end up being trapped underground.
A6:33:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, STALKER is the reason I started actually reading up on what communism was, instead of just going along with the stereotypical communist=evil thing I hear around here.
A6:33:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Mmm that sentence is heavy on the "actually".
A6:33:56 <Zuriki> I'm starved. Going to eat.
A6:34:02 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A6:34:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm sleep-deprived.

A8:27:48 <citricsquid> yeah
A8:27:49 <Siiseli> it does.
A8:27:52 <citricsquid> the game doesn't though :P
A8:27:56 <Snowman> >.>
A8:28:00 <Snowman> it makes it black?
A8:28:02 <Siiseli> someone has this cool mario skin

A8:28:22 <Zuriki> Hung
A8:28:28 <Siiseli> it's.. transparent?
A8:28:37 <Snowman> but the game doesnt support it?
A8:28:40 <postlogic> Haha, allowing transparency for skins in the game would let griefers go invisible.
A8:28:40 <Siiseli> or if you mean like when you open it up in paint or something
A8:28:47 <Snowman> PAINT EWW
A8:28:51 <Siiseli> oh right that's what you meant
A8:28:57 <Siiseli> postlogic is right
A8:29:11 <Snowman> w/e ill make it transparant and look at it
A8:29:28 <Bobo> THAT STATEMENT CONTRADICTS ITSELF

A8:30:28 <Siiseli> mmkay
A8:30:44 <Siiseli> wait, how did you make this transparent png
A8:30:58 <Siiseli> did you just save it or use a png exporter
A8:31:49 <Snowman> i made it transparant in photoshop
A8:31:53 <Snowman> then saved as png
A8:32:13 <Siiseli> yeah you need to use png exporter
A8:32:22 <Siiseli> I think
A8:32:29 <Snowman> well in image viewer its transparant
A8:32:35 <Siiseli> oic
A8:33:16 <Siiseli> maybe photoshop can do it automagically now
A8:33:37 <Snowman> well i used GIMP not photoshop
A8:33:56 <kingnerd> I can confirm that transparent produces white if anyone cares... I tried it a while back
A8:34:28 <Siiseli> okay

A9:02:08 <citricsquid> putty is awesome =D

A9:02:13 <Siiseli> citricsquid, agreed upon.

A9:02:15 <citricsquid> Zuriki: Sure.
A9:02:25 <kingnerd> I love the Windows going on in this channel
A9:02:29 <kingnerd> I love watching windows users
A9:02:31 <Zuriki> I can just use co.cc or something.
A9:02:35 <Siiseli> kingnerd, how so
A9:02:47 <kingnerd> It's funny how you guys have to download external programs, bother with these things
A9:02:54 <Siiseli> then Quatroking just connect.
13A9:02:55 * kingnerd chuckles.
A9:03:01 <Siiseli> kingnerd, indeed
A9:03:05 <Zuriki> Natural...
A9:03:05 <Siiseli> that's why I asked if he had something better
A9:03:13 <Siiseli> if he had linux then this would be so much better :D
A9:03:14 <Quatroking> downloading...
A9:03:16 <Zuriki> I'm a multi OS person myself.
A9:03:16 <citricsquid> allnatural: I hope you enjoy having to piss around with wine to use windows programs =D
A9:03:20 <Quatroking> How do you guys like the new wiki layout btw?
A9:03:24 <kingnerd> citricsquid, Why would I use windows programs?
A9:03:33 <kingnerd> The only one I use is PS and that runs fine in WINE with no tweaking
A9:03:36 <Quatroking> I spend quite a while on it yesterday
A9:03:40 <Siiseli> both operating systems have their ups and downs
A9:03:47 <Siiseli> with linux, you can do STUFF
A9:03:51 <Siiseli> with windows
A9:03:52 <citricsquid> Windows is "out of the box", linux is better if you have the time.
A9:03:53 <Siiseli> you have software
A9:03:58 <kingnerd> With windows, you have games
A9:04:03 <Siiseli> no need to fuck about with wine
A9:04:10 <Siiseli> kingnerd, not a big plus for me
A9:04:19 <Zuriki> Aha, reminds me of the spoof I'm a mac advert
A9:04:19 <Siiseli> I don't play much
A9:04:22 <Quatroking> I used to use Ubuntu a lot, but then I became too lazy to keep rebooting to play a few games in windows
A9:04:25 <kingnerd> I don't understand why everyone says software == WINE... Linux has alternatives for almost every windows program
A9:04:28 <Siiseli> but I need a windows becouse I like deving on one
A9:04:41 <citricsquid> Kingnerd: Alternatives suck cock, pidgin is awful.
A9:04:44 <kingnerd> VIm + XTerm = sex
A9:04:45 <Siiseli> kingnerd, with software I refer to both games and programs
A9:04:48 <kingnerd> citricsquid, as opposed to?
A9:04:52 <citricsquid> msn?
A9:05:00 <Zuriki> citricsquid, thank you for saying pidgin sucks.
A9:05:02 <kingnerd> You can't connect to all protocols with MSN
A9:05:10 <Zuriki> Trillian
A9:05:12 <Quatroking> kopete is win
A9:05:12 <Siiseli> but but but
A9:05:16 <Siiseli> msn is prettier!!1one
A9:05:17 <kingnerd> Trillian Zuriki>?
A9:05:18 <citricsquid> I'd rather use MSN + a few other programs than pidgin, it's painful to use.
A9:05:19 <Zuriki> Trillian is better than pidgin even.
A9:05:20 <Siiseli> it must be betetr.
A9:05:22 <kingnerd> Last time I checked, trillian was awful
A9:05:23 <Zuriki> All protocols.
A9:05:25 <fydo> the new MSN is terrible
A9:05:32 <Quatroking> Trillian is unstable as shit lately
A9:05:33 <fydo> I use pidgin, even in windows
A9:05:33 <Siiseli> it is
A9:05:36 <Zuriki> It looks nice though. :P
A9:05:46 <Zuriki> That was MSN
A9:05:46 <Siiseli> I think the new msn looks awful
A9:05:51 <Siiseli> godawful
A9:05:56 <fydo> Siiseli: yep
A9:05:57 <Zuriki> Personal preference I gues.
A9:05:57 <Siiseli> previous versions, not as much
A9:06:00 <Siiseli> indeed
A9:06:04 <Quatroking> so yeah, I got PuTTY. what now?

A9:12:12 <Siiseli> it was a fun class.
A9:12:15 <kingnerd> hello.jpg :D
A9:12:18 <Quatroking> should throw some www.thatsnotsexy.com on him
A9:12:22 <Siiseli> yes, how incredibly humorous, would you not agree
A9:12:26 <kingnerd> Oooh nice, a picture, welcoming me to Lin AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
A9:12:32 <citricsquid> Siiseli: We had windows at school, my fun was limited to "ctrl + f" then replacing the letter "o" with "cock", saving it, closing it, reopening and watching them cry. Impossible to automatically revert =D
A9:12:53 <kingnerd> Why don't they replace cock with o?
A9:13:00 <citricsquid> cock has an o in it

A9:13:12 <Siiseli> we tried to open up firefox and open up a site from the ssh connection

A9:16:17 <Quatroking> don't be smart and act like your smart.
A9:16:22 <Zuriki> I had a swf that made a fullscreen bluescreen error
A9:16:22 <Quatroking> that was our main rule
A9:16:32 <Siiseli> and someone made this little program that locks your computer 
A9:16:36 <Siiseli> it has 2 hidden processes

A9:21:27 <Quatroking> discovering that the school's teaching programs use txt's and simple wave files
A9:22:08 <Siiseli> ha
A9:22:08 <Quatroking> So we once changed a story from something really regular to "peter cut his dick off and ran into a cliff full of naked clones of bill cosby"

A9:23:14 <Quatroking> my school had one big shared drive that only had remove restrictions

A9:45:16 <Rroff> so get registering then maybe he could
A9:45:34 <kingnerd> 5460 a month could be decent though
A9:45:40 <Rroff> indeed
A9:45:54 <citricsquid> I reckon he'll hit 10k euro before beta
A9:45:56 <kingnerd> But it's more like 4.7 k or so with server fees and Paypal fees
A9:46:01 <Quatroking> this is from two weeks
A9:46:02 <Rroff> yup
A9:46:22 <Quatroking> he'll reach the 10K in no time
A9:46:35 <Rroff> I think with a few more features and a bit of viral networking he'd prolly hit 10x the amount
A9:47:31 <citricsquid> the game will easily net 100k if he goes the full way with it
A9:47:37 <citricsquid> even more if it gets on steam =D

A9:48:58 <citricsquid> okay, it has faggots, but everything online has faggots. The service is great.
A9:48:59 <kingnerd> If they just let me buy the games and not have that whole community BS, and if it ran natively on Linux, I'd think about it
A9:49:00 <Evil-Ville> It's the best service of its kind
A9:49:00 <Rroff> just a little flawed in implementation

A9:50:30 <Rroff> it does annoy me tho with some stuff on steam, you got the steam authentication and then 2 levels of DRM :(
A9:50:49 <Rroff> and they wonder why people pirate games
A9:50:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> it is a kind of drm sort of
A9:50:55 <citricsquid> buy game, download game, login to steam, launch game, play game. it's easy.
A9:51:35 <citricsquid> Steam is so much better than some of the retail DRM, only allowing 3 installs etc.

A11:12:44 <Quatroking> Hey there Notch
A11:12:52 <Quatroking> We got another great idea for you to implent
A11:13:04 <Quatroking> a /bring command that teleports players to your location
A11:13:07 <akuryo> ‚Ç¨}‚Ç¨
A11:13:38 <akuryo> sooo
A11:13:41 <akuryo> parthon
A11:13:44 <Parthon> akuryo: not much I need help with :P
A11:13:46 <akuryo> can i help you?
A11:13:49 <akuryo> erm
A11:13:52 <akuryo> but i need a project =C
A11:13:54 <Parthon> it's almost finished
A11:13:56 <akuryo> i'm working on something
A11:13:58 <akuryo> yeah but
A11:14:02 <akuryo> i'm talking about this generator
A11:14:05 <akuryo> let's make other =D
A11:14:14 <akuryo> what about a better trees generator?
A11:14:22 <Quatroking> By the way Notch, major Wiki layout overhaul :D
A11:14:35 <akuryo> oh
A11:14:38 <akuryo> better idea
A11:14:45 <akuryo> no =/
A11:14:47 <akuryo> yes =)
A11:14:56 <akuryo> picture to map generator
A11:15:11 <akuryo> wait
A11:15:16 <akuryo> a map is 256 high?
11A11:15:31 <DBN> 64 high
A11:15:31 <akuryo> 32 bit color too is 256^3
A11:15:35 <akuryo> oh =C
A11:15:39 <akuryo> yeah, not a problem
A11:15:49 <akuryo> you take the color
A11:15:57 <akuryo> r + g + b /3
A11:16:02 <akuryo> you divide it by 4
A11:16:07 <akuryo> and with this
A11:16:16 <akuryo> you can have a great generator
A11:16:55 <Quatroking> Guys how does this look: http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Template:Buildingblocks
A11:16:56 <PuyoDead> you need a limiter on your Enter key
A11:17:11 <08Notch> client 0.0.21a_01 is up, fixing the hang bug
A11:17:16 <PuyoDead> woo!
A11:17:19 <08Notch> if it doesn't, let me know with loud voices
A11:17:31 <PuyoDead> will do
A11:17:50 <Evil-Ville> That was fast
A11:18:22 <Parthon> dagnamit
A11:18:26 <Parthon> too many skybridge errors
A11:19:26 <Fishlips> Horah new patch
A11:19:29 <Fishlips> cheers notch
A11:19:30 <08Notch> Evil-Ville: I spent some time at work thinking about what could be wrong
A11:19:55 <akuryo> are you sure?
A11:19:57 <paul|not> Notch: just a client update, right? Servers are still .20?
A11:19:58 <akuryo> there is a new patch?
A11:20:15 <Evil-Ville> By the way, if you connect to a server you are banned on the game hangs too
A11:20:16 <08Notch> yeah, this is just clientside
A11:20:17 <akuryo> QUATRO
A11:20:22 <Quatroking> yeah
A11:20:23 <akuryo> GLASS IS STRANGE
A11:20:26 <akuryo> omgomgomg
A11:20:31 <Quatroking> I didn't make the icon
A11:20:33 <akuryo> and cloth and gold is too small
A11:20:33 <Quatroking> shut up
A11:20:34 <08Notch> oh, ok, thank you
A11:20:37 <akuryo> what?
A11:20:45 <Quatroking> I didn't make those icon's
A11:20:52 <akuryo> ok
A11:20:53 <Quatroking> I only made the two little icons on the frontpage
A11:20:55 <akuryo> so "shut up" ?
A11:21:01 <Quatroking> lol
A11:21:08 <Quatroking> EVEN MORE LAYOUT OVERHAUL
A11:21:09 <Quatroking> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Block
A11:21:09 <Fishlips> Notch i also found something i thought worth noting, when i delete one block the block update says 2 - 4 blocks updated even though id be on my own
A11:21:11 <Quatroking> ZOMG ZOMG
A11:21:35 <Quatroking> air is considered a block
A11:21:36 <akuryo> fishlips
A11:21:39 <akuryo> no
A11:21:41 <akuryo> actually
A11:21:45 <akuryo> after mem hacking a little
A11:21:55 <akuryo> i found that the chunk have sort of...
A11:21:57 <akuryo> strange number
A11:22:02 <akuryo> a chunk of earth alone
A11:22:13 <08Notch> Fishlips: That's normal. Each chunk has two layers, one for water, one for normal terrain
A11:22:16 <akuryo> is not the same as a chunk of earth surrounded by earth
A11:22:33 <akuryo> so actually do not refer to chunk update
A11:22:38 <PuyoDead> it just crashed on me again :P may just be a coincidence
A11:22:42 <akuryo> no
A11:22:44 <08Notch> if you change one tile, all neighboring tiles have to be updated as well, so if you're on a border, you can get 6 chunk updates from a single delete.
A11:22:52 <Fishlips> Ah okey thanks Notch and akuryo
A11:22:54 <akuryo> because the freezes are not due to out of map aiming
A11:23:04 <Quatroking> Notch have you seen the new layout I made for the wiki?
A11:23:11 <akuryo> notch.
A11:23:15 <akuryo> i stayed on a server
A11:23:19 <akuryo> fixing the bottom
A11:23:21 <08Notch> not yet, Quatroking
A11:23:22 <akuryo> jumping around
A11:23:26 <akuryo> i frozed
A11:23:27 <Quatroking> it will blow your brain!
A11:23:33 <akuryo> i was not aiming out of the map
A11:23:57 <PuyoDead> just did with me too, but I'm going back to see if it happens again
A11:24:10 <08Notch> so it still hangs? :-O
A11:24:10 <akuryo> it will
A11:24:14 <akuryo> yeah notch
A11:24:20 <akuryo> it's not about aiming out of the map
A11:24:23 <akuryo> i'm sure of that now
A11:25:53 <akuryo> notch
A11:25:55 <Zuriki> I think it's the software render change.
A11:26:00 <akuryo> you'll very soon do a new update
A11:26:03 <Zuriki> Rather than the old OpenGL thing.
A11:26:03 <akuryo> so pleeeeease
A11:26:08 <akuryo> can you put a key
A11:26:11 <akuryo> to switch keyboard?
A11:26:17 <akuryo> just a rapid thing
A11:26:28 <Zuriki> I forgot what it's called...
A11:26:33 <akuryo> because it's horrible for me and my french friends
A11:26:41 <Quatroking> omg azerty
A11:26:53 <akuryo> yeah
A11:26:56 <Evil-Ville> Hasn't hanged for me yet
A11:27:06 <08Notch> is the hang only in mp?
A11:27:07 <Quatroking> get a qwerty, you frenchie :P
A11:27:07 <Evil-Ville> It used to hang every 5 seconds before the patch
A11:27:18 <Zuriki> Sp and MP Notch
A11:27:23 <Zuriki> I get it in SP
A11:27:24 <08Notch> good, thanks
A11:27:28 <08Notch> still?
A11:27:31 <akuryo> yeqh
A11:27:32 <akuryo> notch
A11:27:36 <akuryo> its different
A11:27:40 <akuryo> in function of people
A11:27:43 <akuryo> remind of that
A11:27:47 <akuryo> it happend to mean every minutes
A11:28:04 <akuryo> but my friend had it only every 5 or 10 minutes
A11:28:10 <akuryo> i'll do experimentations
A11:28:54 <akuryo> please notch, can you think about what i said? like button F11 for keyboard switching =(
A11:28:58 <akuryo> i need it, really =C
A11:29:03 <08Notch> no, akuryo, not yet
A11:29:07 <akuryo> mah =/
A11:29:37 <Evil-Ville> keyboard switching?

A11:30:19 <akuryo> you'll understand my pain
A11:30:33 <mezo> turn your keyboard sideways
A11:30:38 <Fishlips> why do you have an azerty keyboard?
A11:30:39 <akuryo> no...
A11:30:40 <ZomBuster> you can still use arrow keys
A11:30:42 <akuryo> it doesn't work this way
A11:30:44 <akuryo> yeah

A11:30:55 <akuryo> actually

A11:30:58 <akuryo> i can switch my keyboard
A11:31:03 <Quatroking> get a gamepad and hole that in one hand?
A11:31:04 <akuryo> with alt + shift
A11:31:09 <akuryo> and you know what happends?
A11:31:11 <Quatroking> hold*
A11:31:13 <akuryo> i have to WRITE the other way
A11:31:26 <akuryo> with aqwz m , and all punctuation changed
A11:31:38 <akuryo> so my brain needed to adapt!
A11:31:49 <akuryo> and he did actually. so when i'm back on msn, talking with my friends
A11:31:51 <mezo> every game needs key bindings, surely minecraft will have them too
A11:31:53 <akuryo> i4; zriting this zqy
A11:31:55 <Parthon> ZomBuster: hey
A11:31:56 <mezo> guess it's just not top priority right now
A11:31:58 <akuryo> ^ you see?
A11:31:59 <08Notch> it will, mezo
A11:32:01 <Evil-Ville> easiest way to fix it would be to have multiple bindings for move up and move left at the same time
A11:32:02 <akuryo> i think this is
A11:32:12 <Evil-Ville> Like both Z and W move you forwards
A11:32:14 <ZomBuster> You got your city thingie updated with glass blocks etc?
A11:32:23 <Evil-Ville> Both Q and A move you left
A11:32:29 <Parthon> oh .. my .. god
A11:32:32 <Parthon> what have I done?!?
A11:32:36 <akuryo> friends
A11:32:40 <Evil-Ville> That way you can have both azerty and qwerty support easily
A11:32:46 <akuryo> no

A11:49:17 <Parthon> oh .. hmm .. it didn't save the full crash log .. time to do it again :D
A11:50:13 <akuryo> how much is 20 is hexadecimal?
A11:50:18 <akuryo> 32 ?
A11:50:22 <akuryo> yeah i think so
A11:50:24 <LilRobot> Let's see..configuration..ok, let's set up the properties..
A11:51:08 <LilRobot> Server is up as "LilRObot's Lava Survival"
A11:51:15 <akuryo> link?
A11:51:19 <akuryo> easyer =D
A11:51:21 <Deiz> Notch: You need internal testing.
A11:51:32 <paul|not> akuryo: 20 in hex is two times 16
A11:51:37 <akuryo> yeah
A11:51:38 <08Notch> ?
A11:51:40 <akuryo> alias 32
A11:51:42 <akuryo> =)
10A11:51:45 * Spazzo is now known as AwaySpazzo
A11:51:47 <akuryo> but thank you xD
A11:51:48 <akuryo> you need intestinal terning
A11:52:00 <paul|not> you need a colonoscopy wait what
A11:52:00 <Deiz> As in, testing.minecraft.net, where people can play a pre-release version on a test server, to check for bugs
A11:52:05 <akuryo> lol
A11:52:26 <08Notch> yeah, it's going to work like that possibly from beta and on
A11:52:26 <Deiz> You'd leave a client in testing for a while before releasing it
A11:52:42 <08Notch> but thanks for telling me. =)
A11:52:45 <08Notch> you're absolutely right
A11:52:56 <akuryo> yeah
A11:53:05 <08Notch> i don't mean to sound dismissive and say "it's going to work like that"
A11:53:30 <citricsquid> It'd be pretty cool if below it there was a form that auto grabbed the users information (browser etc, easy PHP) and allowed bug reports through there, then others looking can "+1" if they also experience it.
A11:53:34 <akuryo> by the way
A11:53:36 <akuryo> notch
A11:53:41 <akuryo> do you know what you name means in french?

A11:54:40 <ZomBuster> I think its from notchin up
A11:54:51 <akuryo> notchin up?
A11:55:00 <akuryo> notch in french means to have sex =D but the romantical way
A11:55:07 <LilRobot> Lava rising. Wheee. http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8d8c236a882fe1420ed8e382b7f4801b
A11:55:09 <akuryo> like "j'aimerais pouvoir notcher avec toi" =D
A11:55:16 <ZomBuster> I didn't knew that
A11:55:20 <akuryo> this means "i woud like to have sex with you"
A11:55:24 <akuryo> but...
A11:55:31 <akuryo> it's said romanticaly you see =)
A11:55:31 <ZomBuster> like.. to make love
A11:55:36 <akuryo> you
A11:55:40 <akuryo> this way >_<
A11:55:44 <paul|not> but notch in english is just a generic noun
A11:55:53 <akuryo> lol, pretty fun
A11:55:59 <paul|not> no sexual meanin' whatsoever
A11:56:03 <akuryo> you'll be seen strangely if you come here xD
A11:56:26 <akuryo> like if i came by you as "penis" for name
A11:56:29 <akuryo> but doesn't work this way
A11:56:35 <akuryo> since penis also work in france xD
A11:56:49 <akuryo> but vagina could be a nice french name =)

A11:59:45 <ZomBuster> there was a bugfix?

P12:04:58 <08Notch> i've refunded the unprocessed e-check payment though
P12:05:02 <08Notch> and there's one returned
P12:05:09 <akuryo> notch
P12:05:12 <akuryo> i need to pay with CC
P12:06:09 <Parthon> Notch: would you know why java cpu usage goes to a billion% when the client is disconnected?
P12:06:24 <08Notch> probably a very tight inner loop. =D
P12:06:41 <Deiz> Notch: Why was FPS limiting only in for one release?
P12:06:43 <Parthon> probably :P
P12:06:58 <08Notch> because it caused massive problems, like some peoples computers running 50-100% too fast
P12:07:02 <08Notch> the entire system clock
P12:07:08 <Deiz> Inferior OSes, I say.
P12:07:20 <08Notch> agreed. But still, it's the most common one. =)
P12:07:46 <postlogic> Yay! Game bought =D
P12:07:53 <Parthon> that's odd, fps limiting should stop computers running too fast :P not cause it
P12:08:51 <postlogic> Notch: Does it automatically bind to my username, or do I have to get some mail?
P12:09:16 <08Notch> it should automatically bind to your username
P12:09:20 <postlogic> Ooh, it did :D
P12:09:21 <Rroff> I know its a bit fugly but can't you just do .sleep(10); in the main thread? (I have little java experience)
P12:09:37 <08Notch> yes, rrof, but then everyone's fps goes down, even people with 20 fps
P12:09:51 <08Notch> there are more advanced solutions
P12:09:53 <Miclee> Any admins for the Reddit server here?
P12:09:57 <Parthon> .sleep(1) ? :P
P12:09:58 <Rroff> or delta time
P12:10:02 <LilRobot> Notch: The latest one hasn't been canceled, correct?
P12:10:05 <08Notch> that's the problem!
P12:10:09 <08Notch> LilRobot: Correct
P12:10:12 <LilRobot> Thanks you :3
P12:10:26 <08Notch> Parthon, Rroff: There's a bug in java where sleep with non mod 10 times causes time slipping
P12:10:32 <08Notch> so I can sleep for 10, but not for 11
P12:10:36 <Rroff> ah I c
P12:10:39 <Parthon> aaah
P12:10:56 <LilRobot> Notch: Will you eventually make 3rd person for Minecraft?
P12:11:00 <Parthon> yeah, that's a bug with the java lib not using high resolution timers and relying on the OS to be nice
10P12:11:11 * Taszlan (Taszlan@aaev148.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl) has joined #minecraft
P12:11:21 <Rroff> can you not do a starttime=timer at the start of main and then subtract from that just before the sleep
P12:11:22 <PuyoDead> heh, reddit server appears to be on lockdown
P12:11:23 <flak> maybe, use keys '+' and '-' to change sleep time
P12:11:28 <08Notch> LilRobot: It's very possible
P12:11:31 <Rroff> and if its over 10 then skip the sleep
P12:11:43 <08Notch> that leads to possibly uneven framerate
P12:11:47 <Parthon> yah
P12:11:51 <08Notch> even framerate is more important than high framerate
P12:12:08 <Rroff> that would stop is slowing down tho on PCs that can't manage 100
P12:12:11 <Taszlan> Any ops from Reddit here?
P12:12:12 <Rroff> and cap everyone else to 100
P12:12:48 <08Notch> i could do something like measure the average fps over 10 seconds, then add the sleep for people with 100+ fps or something
P12:13:05 <postlogic> There are so many timing methods it hurts.
P12:13:19 <Parthon> it's because all the OS's do it so badly
P12:13:48 <Rroff> theres only 2 main methods of doing timing and one not very good way, assuming the underlying code isn't buggyt
P12:13:51 <Rroff> *buggy
P12:13:57 <Parthon> if every OD had a stable millisecond based, microsecond accurate timing system, the problem would be solved :P
P12:14:13 <Parthon> OS*
P12:14:37 <LilRobot> Notch: There are some bugs with Minecraft, last night I happened to have gotten the BSOD from it :o
P12:14:38 <postlogic> http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Timers
P12:15:01 <Rroff> I don't really see the problem with what I said, tho, might take a little tweaking to remove any noticeable frame time differential
P12:15:04 <08Notch> that crash is probably from your drivers
P12:15:05 <Rroff> but it should be possible
P12:15:15 <08Notch> OR from your graphics card getting too how..
P12:15:16 <08Notch> heh
P12:15:18 <08Notch> *hot

P12:16:33 <Parthon> Rroff: it's not that, it's that the sleep time is a "suggestion" .. it can't be guaranteed to be 10ms :(
P12:16:44 <Parthon> it might be as much as 20, or as low as 1
P12:17:03 <Parthon> so those with 100fps would get uneven framerates

P1:40:42 <ez> although, why is sponge under decorations?
P1:41:04 <ez> and the rainbow and gold blocks are smaller than the rest..
P1:41:21 <ez> oh decorations is the bush
P1:42:14 <ez> should say bush? or plants? I dont think it's very clear that is referring to many different blocks, since the other ones aren't
P1:43:02 <ez> water and lava old btw, but no use in changing now I guess, since it might be changes again soon :)

P1:45:44 <Quatroking> You there
P1:45:44 <citricsquid> I think sponge should be in its own section under "Function" blocks, in case we get some more in the future, it's not a building block, but it does have a reason and function other than pretty, so it makes sense for it to be in a category.
P1:46:03 <Quatroking> DILT
P1:46:14 <Dilt> were you the one who messed with those things?
P1:46:18 <Dilt> and failed at it?

P1:46:56 <Quatroking> You're lucky I was so lazy to make an entire new layout instead of reverting

P1:47:56 <Quatroking> oh you better do

P1:56:45 <Rroff> I've never managed to get more than 40MByte/s on my gig-e box even when pulling files from multiple gig-e connections
P1:56:56 <citricsquid> It's on 100mbit, how the...
P1:56:59 <citricsquid> must be on same network then
P1:57:05 <Rroff> depends
P1:57:26 <Rroff> do you have a bandwidth limit per month?
P1:57:33 <citricsquid> about 3tb
P1:57:38 <Rroff> my host used to put all the boxes on gig-e
P1:57:39 <citricsquid> on shared 100mbit
P1:57:47 <postlogic> Rroff: You can have as fast a network as you want, you still have hdd limitations.
P1:57:56 <Rroff> heh
P1:58:01 <Rroff> dual SAS drives
P1:58:09 <Rroff> I think min benchmarked speed was 140Mb/s
P1:58:10 <Quatroking> I need to get a new hdd
P1:58:12 <postlogic> Oh.
P1:58:14 <postlogic> Well never mind :D
P1:58:16 <Quatroking> only got about 50 GB left on this one
P1:58:22 <Rroff> thats the first suggestion everyone makes
P1:58:29 <Rroff> I think the internet just can't really handle gig-e
P1:58:30 <postlogic> You never know.
P1:58:47 <Rroff> tho
P1:59:01 <Rroff> I've never managed more than that when pulling off boxes in the same DC
P1:59:21 <Rroff> maybe their internal network doesn't have more spare bandwidth than that
P2:00:53 <Rroff> gay my host seems to have run out of core 2 boxes

P2:02:38 <Rroff> it kinda takes the piss when they want £40/m extra to add another 2gig of RAM
P2:02:47 <Rroff> I could buy it for that even ECC stuff let alone per month
P2:03:00 <Rroff> its usually better to cancel and reorder what you need than upgrade
P2:03:02 <Miclee> You pay per month for ram?
P2:03:08 <citricsquid> aye, I'd go with a host that charges more upfront if they allowed upfront upgrades.
P2:03:35 <Rroff> Miclee if you want to upgrade after ordering
P2:03:42 <citricsquid> I have a P4 with 512MB ram =D
P2:03:44 <Rroff> they try to get you to pay per month for stuff and a bit over the odds
P2:03:51 <Miclee> I just upgrade my computer on my own. :P
P2:03:55 <Rroff> which is kinda weird coz they are really good in other ways
P2:04:29 <Miclee> Anyone have a flatgrass map(huge or normal) for singleplayer?
P2:04:36 <Rroff> when I cancelled a box they refunded me a part month when they could have taken the lot
P2:05:11 <citricsquid> I have a intel dual core w/ 2GB ram (I could get more for the price I pay, but I like the company and switching sucks) and a P4 with 512MB ram :P

P2:06:21 <Rroff> had a P4 with 512Mb RAM but I held onto it for ages coz when I got it they had gig-e unlimited for the price of 100Mbit unlimited on special offer :P

P3:42:35 <citricsquid> Every server and every time you play, or does it happen when you do specific things?

P3:42:51 <McMissile> and my Java is up to date as well
P3:43:05 <Cue> FF or IE?
P3:43:11 <kingnerd> Man, ever since Notch switched to CPU picking...

P4:23:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Then when it's all done, you mash them all up into a single map.

P4:40:44 <ZomBuster> damn im stupid
P4:41:05 <flak> you can subdivide sphere ad infinitum

P5:30:10 <Quatroking> i could throw my grades up and go to university instead but I don't want to
P5:30:16 <Quatroking> ICT management is just fucking awesome
P5:30:35 <citricsquid> Rroff: I failed my GCSE's - yay for not doing any work - so I ended up in college doing IT, I literally learnt nothing in 6 months so I quit. God awful place. Education sucks, it's never about learning :(
P5:30:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn it foreigners, with their college vs. university
P5:31:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I read it as the same thing
P5:31:05 <citricsquid> college here is different to uni :D
P5:31:09 <citricsquid> anyone can attend college

P5:31:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> I see
P5:31:27 <Trashman> alL
P5:31:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> well, totally different school system, among other things
P5:31:33 <Trashman> it is different in USA also
P5:31:34 <Quatroking> I can go to an university instead of college but my grades aren't good enough for that
P5:31:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Trashman, the difference is less defined though
P5:31:58 <Trashman> university is a term for a school of higher education that has profesors that do researhc
P5:31:58 <citricsquid> High school > Sixthform > Uni is the "proper" method, but you can go college after highschool which can get you into uni. The "intelligent" people normally do sixthform, but you can do sixthform courses at college.
P5:32:08 <flak> we have some kind of colleges too

P5:35:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> good job
P5:35:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> So?  I spent at least 13 hours a week for the last year, studying shit that I forget the next week and that won't be useful to me at all... But I still managed to finish high school in my first year, and I don't regret the work

P5:37:33 <citricsquid> I quit college after finding out that all the work I did for a project - awesome PHP - was worthless because they couldn't handle it.

P5:39:01 <citricsquid> If you're at college/uni for qualifications, of course, but I was there to learn, nothing else.
P5:39:08 <Rroff> well in my case they were hunting me out in study hours to get help with the prep for their next programming lecture
P5:39:15 <Rroff> I prolly should have got them to hire me instead lol

P6:22:31 <Maulrus> we don't take credit for inventing it on the wiki even
P6:22:32 <mezo> otherwise it doesnt belong there
P6:22:34 <notjotham> what's spleef
P6:22:38 <Maulrus> we said that vdg invented it first
P6:22:42 <Snowman> fffu i need citricsquid
P6:22:43 <fydo> notjotham: it's a game that I invented
P6:22:45 <Maulrus> and we just reinvented it and named it
P6:22:53 <fydo> notjotham: these guys are all trying to take the credit
P6:22:58 <notjotham> that's typical
P6:23:01 <mezo> doesn't say that anywhere
P6:23:02 <Maulrus> we don't take credit for inventing the game, though we did reinvent it SEPERATELY
P6:23:03 <Snowman> I MAID ID!
P6:23:04 <Maulrus> we just spreaded it
P6:23:08 <citricsquid> "On 22 June, it was remade by Greenslimy, Pentaclam, and Maulrus. Its name is a pun on the term grief, and was changed just to differentiate it from actual griefing. "
P6:23:19 <mezo> you should just take everyone's name off there unless you can cite a source
P6:23:21 <mezo> that's how wikis work
P6:23:23 <citricsquid> If you disagree, correct it, it's a wiki!
P6:23:34 <mezo> that would just result in a back and forth war
P6:23:36 <Maulrus> mezo, someone changed it
P6:23:39 <mezo> i'd rather explain the probem instead
P6:23:39 <Snowman> "On 22 June, someone took a shit."
P6:23:39 <vdgmprgrmr> That's how wikipedia works, Minecraft wiki can have different rules.
P6:23:47 <Maulrus> earlier it cited vdg
P6:24:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> wikipedia is funny
P6:24:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Especially since things are a lot harder to keep track of in something as narrow as this, whereas wikipedia has things far more reliable, since it deals in, generally, broader strokes.
P6:24:22 <citricsquid> If you don't like it then change it, if it gets changed back then use the discussion section and settle your differences, does it really matter?
P6:25:01 <Syndlig> Don't you know, citric?
P6:25:01 <Maulrus> ugh someone changed IT
P6:25:03 <mezo> i'm not gonna be the one to change it
P6:25:03 <Syndlig> This is the internet.
P6:25:04 <Maulrus> it
P6:25:06 <Syndlig> It's srs bsns.
P6:25:08 <citricsquid> SRS BSN
P6:25:09 <Maulrus> I'll change it back
P6:25:10 <vdgmprgrmr> And actually, we could cite it, because quite a few people that played in my arena.
P6:25:22 <mezo> but there's a bunch of people who are going to get shafted if we start pointing at who created the game
P6:25:26 <Maulrus> look we don't claim to have invented it first
P6:25:28 <mezo> because their names arent anywhere so far

P6:25:32 <Syndlig> Dude
P6:25:33 <Syndlig> Here.
P6:25:35 <mezo> just saying the wiki should reflect that
P6:25:35 <Syndlig> I'll make it better.
P6:25:40 <Maulrus> it should
P6:25:45 <Maulrus> I don't know who edited it
P6:25:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Deiz did, I think mezo did, Testvan did, Syniphas did.
P6:25:57 <Maulrus> there should be a section for everyone who invented it, but we just thought it was vdg's
P6:26:09 <Maulrus> but we ARE the ones who spreaded it
P6:26:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Indeed indeed.
P6:26:29 <mezo> i didnt edit anything
P6:26:46 <mezo> i remember being at the earliest spleef game though, with testvan too
P6:26:49 <mezo> forget who made the arena
10P6:26:49 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
P6:26:59 <citricsquid> just edit it to include your names? 
P6:27:04 <mezo> why should we
P6:27:10 <mezo> better just to take all names down
P6:27:17 <citricsquid> do that then.
P6:27:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, you even built a giant staircase up to the arena, mezo
P6:27:49 <Rroff> if anyones interested I wrote a simple perl script to check if the minecraft server process is responding (if its running)
P6:27:51 <Rroff> http://pastebin.com/m733caf0e
P6:27:59 <mezo> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Spleef
P6:28:01 <Rroff> just spec IP and PORT on the command line
P6:28:01 <mezo> there
P6:28:05 <mezo> since you insisted i be the one to change it
P6:28:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't think removing names is necessary...
P6:28:58 <mezo> lol @ new description
P6:29:38 <notjotham> that's cool
P6:29:48 <vdgmprgrmr> If you'd like, we could do it the wikipedia way.
P6:29:56 <Dilt> geez
P6:29:57 <Syndlig> That origin is the best origin.
P6:30:00 <Dilt> who banned me from the wiki?
P6:30:10 <Maulrus> I think putting in all names is better
P6:30:17 <notjotham> yeah the origin is cool
P6:30:18 <Maulrus> spleef ruins lives
P6:30:22 <vdgmprgrmr> That is, note that there may be debate on how it started, and name those who claim to have started it.
P6:30:22 <mezo> keep current origin
P6:30:24 <mezo> imo
P6:30:35 <Dilt> complete with a message calling me a vandal
P6:30:41 <Rroff> lol
P6:30:44 <mezo> the only person i can reliably point to as a creator is vdgmprgrmr if you wanna get technical
P6:30:48 <Dilt> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/User_talk:Dilt
P6:30:49 <Dilt> :(
P6:30:50 <mezo> and im not even sure about that
P6:30:52 <fydo> Dilt: stop vandalizing !
P6:30:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, true.
P6:30:56 <citricsquid> Dilt: Quatro <.< I'll fix it.
P6:30:59 <Maulrus> Pentaclam did create it on his own
P6:31:02 <Maulrus> just after vdg
P6:31:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I r not liekz current origin.
P6:31:20 <Syndlig> I wanted to put "buddhist monk" but I don't know if they've ever been in the himalayas.
P6:31:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, and Pentaclam was much more successful in popularizing it, so I'd suggest joint credit.
P6:31:30 <mezo> Maulrus, lots of people created it on their own
P6:31:32 <mezo> that's why this is hopeless
P6:31:35 <Syndlig> This is so SERIOUS!
P6:31:37 <mezo> it's not exactly ice hockey
P6:31:44 <Dilt> I undid his changes to the blocks/etc because it was violating the established pattern
P6:31:54 <Dilt> :(
P6:32:16 <Syndlig> Honestly, I have to ask.
P6:32:20 <Dilt> so i get called a vandal and banned, yay... it's what i get for helping with the wiki :(
P6:32:21 <Syndlig> Who the fuck cares who made what when and where?
P6:32:24 <Syndlig> I know I don't.
P6:32:34 <Maulrus> that is a very good point
P6:32:37 <vdgmprgrmr> mezo, that's solved pretty easily as well.
P6:32:39 <mezo> i just get kinda indignant about this stuff
P6:32:41 <Syndlig> It's got a retarded name that sounds like a goon made it to mock all of you to begin with.
P6:32:49 <mezo> but if nobody at all cares, there doesnt need to be that info
P6:32:55 <Maulrus> There should probably just be one server for it so it doesn't ruin building servers
P6:32:58 <Syndlig> And it's basically Don't Break The Ice But With People.
P6:33:25 <vdgmprgrmr> "While it's very possible that many people could have played the game before it was popularized..."
P6:33:34 <mezo> maulrus i'll help build the spleef map if you need peoples
P6:33:41 <citricsquid> me too =D
P6:33:44 <vdgmprgrmr> So will I.
P6:33:49 <Dilt> citricsquid: it seems both Dilt and my ip are banned
P6:33:53 <Syndlig> Make it a huge football stadium :D
P6:33:53 <liq3> What we really need, is Notch to make a spleef "mode"

P6:33:57 <Dilt> i'm getting different banned messages now
P6:34:02 <notjotham> peter and i can probably write a script that autogenerates a spleef stadium whereever
P6:34:06 <citricsquid> dilt: ill check, silly quatro >:(
P6:34:07 <mezo> too many modes is bad
P6:34:17 <vdgmprgrmr> liq3, that would be pretty cool, but I think it'd be better as a player-run type of thing.
P6:34:19 <liq3> Mezo: Hell no.
P6:34:23 <Dilt> and this ban seems that it was placed after i talked with him about it
P6:34:28 <liq3> vdgmprpgmr: I don't.
P6:34:35 <vdgmprgrmr> So it can naturally evolve as a sport, instead of stagnating.
P6:34:41 <vdgmprgrmr> As a set game-mode.
P6:34:44 <mezo> indeed
P6:34:48 <mezo> it's just a fun gimmick
P6:34:52 <mezo> there's not gonna be spleef mode
P6:34:57 <Syndlig> Why does the Gameplay box have a mouse pointer in it?
P6:35:01 <greenslimy> I highly dought that
P6:35:02 <Maulrus> I'm not gonna build a spleef server
P6:35:04 <Rroff> has anyone watched franklyn, is it any good?
P6:35:10 <citricsquid> dilt: try relogging in, no blocks.
P6:35:13 <Maulrus> mainly cause one is taxing enough on my internet
P6:35:32 <Maulrus> but if there was a global one, maybe people would actually BUILD on my server again
P6:35:48 <citricsquid> I'll set up a proper spleef only on my dedi tomorrow :)
P6:36:03 <Dilt> nope, i'm still banned
P6:36:03 <Maulrus> great
P6:36:10 <Dilt> it's block ID #4 that's on me
P6:36:10 <Maulrus> then I might take it off mine
P6:36:12 <Maulrus> or
P6:36:18 <Maulrus> maybe everyone will just go there
P6:36:43 <liq3> What Notch really needs is the ability to load scripts. :/
P6:36:48 <mezo> i'll make the greatest spleef arena of all time on any server that lets me use permablocks

P6:36:55 <liq3> Then we could make our Spleef script.
P6:37:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Hm.
P6:37:10 <citricsquid> try now dilt :D
P6:37:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Spleef Arena competition.
P6:37:12 <Syndlig> Why would you bother with permablocks?
P6:37:13 <Maulrus> A spleef script would make resetting spleef nice
P6:37:15 <Syndlig> There's not really a point.
P6:37:15 <Maulrus> I thought about that
P6:37:21 <liq3> It's just a Spleef script would be totally superior to doing it all manual.
P6:37:22 <Maulrus> permablocks so you don't delete the walls
P6:37:25 <Dilt> i'm free! thanks citricsquid
P6:37:25 <Syndlig> If you've got people coming to play a spleef game.
P6:37:27 <Maulrus> not for the floor
P6:37:28 <Maulrus> >_>
P6:37:30 <Syndlig> They know the rules.
P6:37:31 <Dilt> but i have to ask you one last thing
P6:37:33 <liq3> since you have commands like /seal /countdown /reset
P6:37:35 <citricsquid> resetting is a fun part though!
P6:37:36 <mezo> manual re-spleefing is good
P6:37:37 <Dilt> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Glass <-- see how he's thumbnailing that image?
P6:37:37 <Syndlig> And if they're destroying the walls they get kicked/banned.
P6:37:40 <citricsquid> Just need a macro countdown
P6:37:40 <mezo> gives the losers something to d
P6:37:44 <liq3> All blocks are invincible until countdown is over.
P6:37:49 <Maulrus> destroying the walls happens by accident sometimes, syndlig
P6:37:51 <liq3> reset repairs the arena instantly.
P6:37:53 <mezo> and provides ample downtime between matches to have each one mean something
P6:37:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Whoever makes the most interesting Spleef arena has their arena made the formal regulation Spleef arena.
P6:37:55 <Dilt> that's what the person who called me a vandal is saying it over
P6:38:01 <mezo> if it was just a constant chain of battles it would be stupid
P6:38:06 <Dilt> i'm centering and un-thumbnailing it, he's rethumbnailing and righting it
P6:38:06 <liq3> A script could even have automatic scoring.
P6:38:08 <Syndlig> Dilt:  That looks ugly.  :(
P6:38:13 <Dilt> that's his version
P6:38:21 <citricsquid> thumbnails ftl :(
P6:38:23 <Dilt> mine is better, but he keeps changing it to that one
P6:38:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I say an organized tournament would be cool.
P6:38:32 <Dilt> lettme edit it, and say when to refresh
P6:38:37 <Syndlig> It was, uh...
P6:38:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe one-on-one.
P6:38:42 <Syndlig> Chrome Bolt?
P6:38:54 <Dilt> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Glass
P6:38:56 <Dilt> that's what i had it as
P6:38:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Or free-for-all with four people.
P6:38:58 <Dilt> and yeah, chrome bolt
P6:38:59 <Roras> hmm
P6:39:03 <Maulrus> spleef is taking over minecraft
P6:39:03 <Maulrus> ffffff
P6:39:05 <vdgmprgrmr> On a square arena.
P6:39:12 <citricsquid> still a thumbnail dilt
P6:39:16 <Maulrus> hopefully this is a fad and it will pass
P6:39:17 <Syndlig> Man
P6:39:19 <Dilt> it's still a thumbnail? Oo
P6:39:21 <Syndlig> I've been spleefing so hard today.
P6:39:24 <Dilt> I just made it not a thumbnail, refresh the page
P6:39:29 <vdgmprgrmr> It's okay, Maulrus, map editors were "taking over minecraft" as well but we still have MC just fine.
P6:39:40 <Dilt> I centered it and removed the thumbnail frame
P6:39:44 <Syndlig> Maulrus:  Why would you want it to "be a fad and pass"?
P6:39:53 <Testvan> hes humble OK
P6:40:12 <Roras> anyone would agree on a /invisible command for ops so that they could watch griefers?
P6:40:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I think a MP game with an actual official sport with regulation (not enforced, but the "official") rules and such would be interesting.
P6:40:37 <Syndlig> Hey
P6:40:41 <Syndlig> if oyu have a "spleef server"
P6:40:46 <Dilt> I think the question is how we should want the thing to be
P6:40:49 <Syndlig> There's no reason to use permabricks.
P6:40:54 <Syndlig> Backup the file and whenever a game ends...
P6:40:57 <Syndlig> Restart the server
P6:40:57 <Maulrus> syndlig: because it makes my building server into an annoying spleef-only server
P6:40:58 <Testvan> spleef is close to queef
P6:41:01 <Syndlig> Just make hte file read-only.
P6:41:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Syndlig, but rebuilding would have a more natural feel to it.
P6:41:19 <citricsquid> does replacing server_level.dat work in realtime?
P6:41:25 <Dilt> but yeah citricsquid
P6:41:33 <citricsquid> I like rebuilding, it's fun
P6:41:33 <Dilt> you're the boss, so which way do you want it?

P6:54:30 <Dilt> and i have to fix all the ones he's changed
P6:54:50 <Dilt> since by replacing the image with the thumbnail, removing |thumb from the template makes the images instantly huge

P6:54:53 <Dilt> blar
P6:54:57 <Dilt> i need to think up terms.

P6:55:37 <Dilt> thumbnail == the wiki code |thumb that makes the image smaller
P6:55:39 <Syndlig> If Notch added a block that falls if it's not connected to another block.
P6:55:48 <Syndlig> Not like sand that falls when a block below it's deleted.
P6:56:06 <Syndlig> A block falls if no block is touching it in the cardinal ("face") directions.
P6:56:09 <Dilt> both templates are reverted, citricsquid
P6:56:18 <Dilt> if you like it like it, can you lock them, citric?
P6:56:25 <Dilt> like that*
P6:56:33 <mezo> Syndlig, i secretly hope that's how every block is in the future
P6:56:36 <mezo> aka no more flying blocks

P6:58:24 <citricsquid> http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Spleef
P6:58:45 <Syndlig> I think a mixture of regular blocks and falling blocks would make spleef even more fun.
P6:58:52 <mezo> minecraft should be renamed to spleefcraft
P6:58:55 <citricsquid> trap blocks!
P6:59:08 <Syndlig> If the players weren't part of the creation process then they wouldn't know whick blocks are traps.
P6:59:48 <Maulrus> mezo: yes
P6:59:49 <citricsquid> that'd be the fun, some users know which to avoid, others don't

P7:06:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I vote new.
P7:06:23 <vdgmprgrmr> And yeah, mezo is right.
P7:06:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Pit is essential.
P7:06:34 <vdgmprgrmr> We need lava and everything.
P7:06:42 <mezo> it needs to be deep enough that a guy who's lost cant jump and hit remaining blocks

P7:20:26 <mezo> is if someone makes a small flatmap with or without lava

P10:14:48 <mezo> if you kicked me in the beginning

P10:15:02 <vdgmprgrmr> We would have something different.
P10:15:04 <mezo> just dont be ridiculous
P10:15:10 <mezo> yeah
P10:15:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Your argument relies on you being more creative than everyone else.
P10:15:15 <mezo> different indeed
P10:15:17 <mezo> no it doesnt
P10:15:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, because "different" does not mean "worse"
P10:15:28 <Zuriki> You're saying you decided everything.
P10:15:31 <mezo> if you guys just brickwalled me by "vote" on the stairs issue
P10:15:33 <vdgmprgrmr> So it wouldn't have mattered.
P10:15:35 <mezo> it would have turned out worse
P10:15:40 <Zuriki> Is that why you got mad at me placing some blocks.

P10:17:04 <Zuriki> Calm down man.
P10:17:05 <LazyWaffle> YOUR arena?
P10:17:07 <LazyWaffle> dude
P10:17:07 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not YOUR spleef arena, mezo!
P10:17:09 <LazyWaffle> we all built it
P10:17:10 <mezo> you can throw your finishing touches on the thing i designed from the ground up
P10:17:16 <mezo> that's how it looks from my perspective
P10:17:20 <citricsquid> http://rapidshare.com/files/247964654/splee.rar
P10:17:22 <mezo> deny it all you want
P10:17:23 <vdgmprgrmr> mezo, get off the power-trip.
P10:17:24 <citricsquid> Download and shut up
P10:17:24 <mezo> thanks squid
P10:17:26 <LazyWaffle> it's that time of the month, guys
P10:17:32 <vdgmprgrmr> and stop being a douche.
P10:17:35 <citricsquid> I turned the server off because you're all unbareable.
P10:17:38 <mezo> it's not about power vdg
P10:17:39 <Zuriki> :D
P10:17:42 <mezo> are you denying what i said?
P10:17:47 <mezo> have you really convinced yourself of otherwise?
P10:17:49 <LazyWaffle> Squid, is that the server?
P10:17:52 <Zuriki> LOOK THE SERVER IS OFF
P10:17:56 <Zuriki> WE STOPPED BUILDING
P10:17:57 <citricsquid> lazy: it's the map :)
P10:18:00 <LazyWaffle> Oh, ok

P10:18:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I honestly think we should try again minus mezo.
P10:18:16 <liq3> lol.
P10:18:18 <citricsquid> liq: there :P
P10:18:25 <LazyWaffle> so apparently mezo thinks he made the map
P10:19:06 <Zuriki> I think I'm going to leave.
P10:19:13 <LazyWaffle> Ok, bye
P10:19:17 <Zuriki> Only reason I didn't before is cause we were building.
P10:19:26 <citricsquid> 4:20am here :|
P10:19:31 <Zuriki> Yeah.
P10:19:35 <LazyWaffle> Who's gonna host the server?

P10:26:35 <LazyWaffle> i want in the spleef server

P10:26:55 <mezo> from scratch?
P10:26:56 <LazyWaffle> Mezo downloaded it, Vdg

P10:27:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, from scratch, without mezo.
P10:27:06 <LazyWaffle> No
P10:27:08 <xgills> shoy, any idea who did it?
P10:27:08 <Dilt> in my opinion, we could do this
P10:27:08 <LazyWaffle> Don't
P10:27:08 <Shoy> uuugh
13P10:27:11 * mezo slaps LazyWaffle around a bit with a large trout

P10:27:14 <mezo> i didnt ipban anyone
P10:27:21 <LazyWaffle> Mezo helped alot with it
P10:27:23 <LazyWaffle> Don't deny that
P10:27:28 <xgills> i know it wasnt me or you....i doubt it was animator quite a bit
P10:27:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I still don't want him involved.
P10:27:33 <LazyWaffle> We don't need to start it from scracth
P10:27:33 <xgills> dont knwo who else was op in there
P10:27:44 <mezo> i wanna finish that arena with the people i started it with
P10:27:49 <Shoy> I know it's not Animator, Phygar, or xGills or myself.
P10:27:52 <LazyWaffle> We just need to settle our stupid differences and finish it
P10:27:55 <mezo> unfortunately they're convinced im some power hungry douchebag
P10:27:58 <Dilt> 'owners', 'ops', 'voices', and everyone. Owners can add ops and voices, Ops can add voices. If the game is set to 'moderated', only voices and higher can build/delete :D
P10:27:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I think we should start it from scratch, because we know mezo's going to try and take the credit away from everyone else.
P10:27:59 <LazyWaffle> Mezo, what about me? D:

P10:28:08 <Animator> I'm not amused.

P10:28:14 <Shoy> I am not amused either. D:
P10:28:19 <LazyWaffle> Well Squid left
P10:28:30 <Animator> How long do bans last, Shoy?
P10:28:31 <mezo> vdgmprgrmr
P10:28:33 <LazyWaffle> Can we all just stop fighting and finish it?
P10:28:35 <xgills> hmm...lets see...master chief just got oped right before this hppened right?

P10:28:40 <LazyWaffle> No more insults. No more arguments.
P10:28:41 <vdgmprgrmr> So someone else can run a server.
P10:28:42 <Phygar> great now my neighbor's IP and my IP are banned
P10:28:45 <Shoy> But that means someone else made him op.
P10:28:46 <LazyWaffle> Let's just do this.
P10:28:50 <xgills> i didnt
P10:28:54 <xgills> did you anim?
P10:28:54 <mezo> i've learned my lesson about trying to organize a cohesive build online with strangers
P10:28:55 <Zuriki> ...
P10:28:59 <Shoy> I don't have a wifi card in my computer anymore.
P10:29:01 <mezo> everyone just gets offended
P10:29:01 <Animator> I didn't op him.
P10:29:05 <Shoy> So I can't get on a neighbor's wifi.
P10:29:12 <vdgmprgrmr> mezo, I've learned my lesson with trying to be in a build with you.
P10:29:14 <xgills> hmm...so thers another op in there we dont know

P10:29:28 <Phygar> no i didn't
P10:29:30 <LazyWaffle> Everyone. Shut up.
P10:29:31 <Shoy> Probably the same one who was pretending to be Barak obama earlier
P10:29:32 <LazyWaffle> It's a game.
P10:29:32 <vdgmprgrmr> So who's going to host the new server?
P10:29:33 <xgills> hmm
P10:29:34 <LazyWaffle> Don't fight.
P10:29:35 <Animator> There's also one more possibility.
P10:29:35 <Zuriki> Waffle cakes.
P10:29:37 <Phygar> never oped anyone
P10:29:42 <vdgmprgrmr> LazyWaffle, we're not talking about the game.
P10:29:43 <LazyWaffle> Lets just finish the server.
P10:29:45 <LazyWaffle> Stop fighting.
P10:29:45 <Animator> He may have been op all along.
P10:29:46 <vdgmprgrmr> We're talking about people.
P10:29:49 <xgills> yeah
P10:29:50 <LazyWaffle> We got this far, let's finish.
P10:29:51 <xgills> tgood point
P10:29:57 <mezo> you guys can continue the map
P10:29:59 <Shoy> I swear I deopped EVERYONE when Animator and I lost op.
P10:30:02 <LazyWaffle> Are you two ready to forgive eachother?
P10:30:03 <Shoy> and mastercheif was there.
P10:30:04 <xgills> ...wow i put that t there by habbit
P10:30:05 <mezo> i dont want to be ostracized from it when it's finished
P10:30:09 <mezo> considering i designed 90% of it
P10:30:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I will not work with mezo.
P10:30:16 <mezo> so you have my blessing to finish the arena
P10:30:16 <mezo> go nuts
P10:30:19 <LazyWaffle> You two are stubborn idiots :\
P10:30:20 <Animator> There's a theif among us.
P10:30:27 <mezo> but i'd prefer to be a part of it if you guys can untangle your panties
P10:30:27 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't fucking care what you call me.
P10:30:28 <LazyWaffle> Forgive eachother. Don't be douchebags.
P10:30:34 <Shoy> ;w;
P10:30:35 <Phygar> I've got one more neighbor to try, want me to see if it's only IP linked an not account?
P10:30:35 <LazyWaffle> It's a game.
P10:30:35 <xgills> theif among us?
P10:30:36 <mezo> i already did
P10:30:37 <vdgmprgrmr> If I'm going to work on something, I want equal credit.
P10:30:39 <mezo> vdg is the one holding a grudge
P10:30:44 <Zuriki> w/e If we're doing this shit gimme the link IN PM FORM
P10:30:44 <mezo> i told him no hard feelings in pm
P10:30:46 <LazyWaffle> Mezo, are you willing to forgive vdg?
P10:30:48 <Shoy> I don't think it's any of us 5 Animator
P10:30:51 <Phygar> And try going on and doping everyone
P10:30:56 <Shoy> I think there's an extra op.
P10:30:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Which means mezo needs to stop claiming "90%" of it.
P10:30:59 <Shoy> Phygar
P10:31:02 <mezo> [23:20] <vdgmprgrmr> It's your fucking map.
P10:31:02 <Shoy> He Ipbanned everyone

P11:05:57 <Animator> Awol is awol, all the ops are I.P. banned, and everyone in the server is destroying everything like lunatics.
