10A12:00:09 * Mastria_sleeping is now known as Mastria|AFK
A12:00:10 <Darkebrz> Well its running a lot worse for me
A12:00:23 <Shadaez> whats that negine tribes is made in
A12:00:26 <MonkeyDKS> My FPS' are in the 400-500 range
A12:00:28 <PuyoDead> Get yourself a 7 year old system, you'll be good.
A12:00:28 <Visiiri> I'm going to see if it will work better in my hacks
A12:00:33 <Darkebrz> 30fps on small map
A12:00:43 <gm|lap> Darkebrz: what fog level?
A12:00:45 <Shadaez> ff i cant think of the name
A12:00:48 <Darkebrz> No fog
A12:00:52 <Skillkills95> No fog here
A12:00:52 <gm|lap> hmmkay
A12:00:55 <Darkebrz> But before I would get around 100fps on small
A12:00:57 <MonkeyDKS> none
A12:01:04 <gm|lap> 64^3 is good for this
A12:01:09 <Darkebrz> HOLY SHIT
A12:01:12 <Darkebrz> 300FPS with all fog
A12:01:17 <Darkebrz> Never seen that before
A12:01:18 <Skillkills95> lol
A12:01:22 <Shadaez> All fog?

A12:01:30 <Skillkills95> ah crap
A12:01:30 <gm|lap> this must have vsync or something like that
A12:01:35 <Darkebrz> YES
A12:01:37 <gm|lap> because my max is 60fps
A12:01:37 <MonkeyDKS> Vis, try placing two tnt blocks then delete them
A12:01:37 <Darkebrz> gm|lap, thats it!
A12:01:44 <Skillkills95> browser keeps freezing up
A12:01:44 <Darkebrz> yeah, Im jittering

A12:03:34 <corvair> im bored....
A12:03:54 <Skillkills95> No texture atm Visiiri
A12:03:57 <Visiiri> I guess this is conceptually sound.
A12:03:59 <Visiiri> Waitwhat
A12:04:01 <Visiiri> no texture?
A12:04:07 <MonkeyDKS> at the moment
A12:04:08 <Visiiri> Does that mean
A12:04:10 <Skillkills95> Its like.... hidden somewhere
A12:04:10 <corvair> hi skills95 >:D
A12:04:10 <Visiiri> it's just faces
A12:04:15 <Visiiri> or is it in like an LTB
A12:04:19 <Skillkills95> I cant find it and ive been looking for an hour
A12:04:29 <Skillkills95> Its either hidden VERY good
A12:04:37 <Skillkills95> Or on the website somewhere

A12:05:04 <Skillkills95> Yea
A12:05:08 <Skillkills95> No texture at all

A12:05:25 <Darkebrz> What did you DO
A12:05:33 <Darkebrz> Skillkills95, these just look like completely solid colors
A12:05:39 <Skillkills95> but it doesnt have anything
A12:05:41 <Skillkills95> ?
A12:05:43 <Visiiri> Wait a second
A12:05:46 <Visiiri> maybe it's the M3D
A12:05:47 <corvair> am i muted or something?
A12:05:51 <Visiiri> Perhaps I don't have a driver?
A12:06:04 <Skillkills95> What Dark?
A12:06:08 <Darkebrz> Nevermind
A12:06:13 <Darkebrz> I was talking to Shadaez
A12:06:14 <gm|lap> corvair: i can see you
A12:06:17 <Darkebrz> Not you >_<
A12:06:18 <corvair> are yall just ignoring me or am i muted?
A12:06:18 <Skillkills95> Err
A12:06:20 <Skillkills95> kay
A12:06:23 <Skillkills95> Anyways
A12:06:28 <Darkebrz> There wouldnt be any need for textures if its completely solid colors
A12:06:31 <Shadaez> What Darkebrz?
A12:06:34 <Skillkills95> Im looking at the md3 model right now and its just grey
A12:06:38 <Visiiri> Skillkills95, try this? http://en.dark-omen.org/downloads/view-details/1.-modding-tools/1.-map-editor/darkomen-m3d-to-blender-converter.html

A12:06:51 <gm|lap> <corvair> are yall just ignoring me or am i muted?
A12:06:52 <Visiiri> oh
A12:07:04 <Shadaez> Lots of text, lap.
A12:07:05 <Darkebrz> Which bugs me. The eyes bulge out of the face
A12:07:07 <Skillkills95> Yes we are ignoring you
A12:07:08 <Skillkills95> xD
A12:07:08 <Shadaez> gm*
A12:07:09 <Visiiri> Sillkills, perhpas the color is in cube-nes
A12:07:17 <Skillkills95> let me check
A12:07:22 <gm|lap> wait, what
A12:07:26 <Visiiri> that looks correct
A12:07:46 <Visiiri> try editing that
A12:07:51 <Visiiri> and see what happens
A12:08:05 <Skillkills95> k
12A12:08:10 * Animator (dominatrix@adsl-11-207-175.mia.bellsouth.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:08:29 <Visiiri> Anyways, I am sort of liking the new models
A12:08:35 <Visiiri> if it was less anime, i'd be for it.
A12:09:04 <Visiiri> The cheek lines, the bulging eyes, the faces in general
A12:09:20 <Visiiri> And, there would have to be software to edit these bitches.
A12:09:22 <Shadaez> There are no new models.
A12:09:27 <Visiiri> the M3D?
A12:09:31 <Aeomin> dark omen?
A12:09:36 <Visiiri> Aeomin, yes.
A12:09:39 <Skillkills95> MD3*
A12:09:41 <Visiiri> Oh
A12:09:44 <Visiiri> it's MD3
A12:09:45 <Visiiri> shet
A12:09:48 <Skillkills95> xD
A12:09:57 <Shadaez> Froggirl is just a placeholder mD3 model that Dock gave Notch. I think it was from one of Dock's other projects.
A12:10:20 <Visiiri> Yes
A12:10:28 <Visiiri> but he is concepting them off of that?
A12:10:34 <Shadaez> IDK.
A12:10:34 <Visiiri> The miner picture sure as hell looks like it
A12:10:42 <Shadaez> It has similiarities; like the shirt
A12:10:50 <Visiiri> and block head
A12:10:58 <Skillkills95> Visiiri i love you
A12:11:01 <Skillkills95> That was it
A12:11:02 <Skillkills95> xD
A12:11:17 <Skillkills95> cube-nes is the texture for the girl
A12:11:18 <Visiiri> :>
A12:11:21 <Visiiri> hehehe
A12:11:22 <Skillkills95> VERY easy to edit
A12:11:23 <Skillkills95> xDDD
A12:11:28 <Shadaez> cube-nes?
A12:11:32 <Skillkills95> Just... no black
A12:11:36 <Visiiri> It's an image in the minecraft.jar
A12:11:45 <Shadaez> hwo do I get the new minecraft.jar
A12:11:55 <Visiiri> Play the new test
A12:12:02 <Shadaez> oh right
A12:12:05 <Visiiri> then run "%temp%"
A12:12:11 <Visiiri> find www.minecraft.net in your folder list
A12:12:18 <Visiiri> and this one is "minecraft-sneakpeak or something
A12:12:49 <Miclee> cube-nes.png?
A12:12:52 <Visiiri> Yup.
A12:13:01 <Visiiri> That is the colors for the frog-girl
A12:13:09 <Visiiri> :P I know this and I can't even get mine to fucking work.
10A12:13:14 * Cial (Gary@dialup-4.88.11.207.Dial1.Atlanta1.Level3.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:13:23 <Visiiri> But, I am starting to be happy with this.
A12:13:29 <Visiiri> It is amazing how it is growing on me.
A12:14:02 <Shadaez> Just means more customization
A12:14:07 <Visiiri> I see two problems in the future:
A12:14:15 <Shadaez> I'd love to see minecraft with celshading lol
A12:14:42 <Visiiri> 1. Editing the shape of the guy. I don't want a miners helmate, if the one in the blog is implemented. There would have to be a 3d editing program.
A12:14:57 <Shadaez> not relal
A12:14:58 <Shadaez> y
A12:15:04 <Visiiri> ?
A12:15:30 <Visiiri> Without that, notch would be taking away a good 80% of customization?
A12:15:36 <Shadaez> He could easily have a choice of models; or each peice of the model could have choices which you choose.
A12:15:57 <Shadaez> IDK, I know notch isn't going to remove features, though.
A12:15:58 <Visiiri> Were is customization, though?
A12:16:07 <Visiiri> I want a tophat on my guy.
A12:16:12 <Visiiri> Minecraft will be able to support it
A12:16:16 <Shadaez> Did you just not read what I said?
12A12:16:18 * Kapow (kapox@c-68-82-107-29.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A12:16:19 <Visiiri> Yes
A12:16:31 <Visiiri> I mean, selecting it isn't quite original enough
A12:16:32 <Shadaez> Not to mention you can jsut use the old models.
A12:16:35 <Visiiri> there might
A12:16:38 <Visiiri> :P that's not the point
A12:16:45 <Visiiri> I'm saying, if this is to work smoothly
A12:16:46 <Skillkills95> How about an equipment thing
A12:16:48 <Shadaez> More choices is never bad
A12:16:49 <Skillkills95> same model
A12:16:53 <Shadaez> And yes
A12:17:02 <Skillkills95> But you can choose if he carries a shovel, wears a helmet.. ect ect
A12:17:03 <Visiiri> you'd have to be able to give yourself a helmate of your choice
A12:17:07 <Shadaez> I was thinking the equipment. He has mentioned an inventory before.

A12:17:13 <Visiiri> Maybe I want him to have a V on his head.
A12:17:18 <Visiiri> Maybe I want him to have a peg-leg
A12:17:21 <Visiiri> maybe notch didn't add those
A12:17:30 <Visiiri> I mean, yeah
A12:17:36 <Visiiri> there will be no new stuff without this
A12:17:53 <Visiiri> The key word is new
A12:18:26 <Visiiri> Do you guys see what I'm saying?
A12:19:15 <Cial> its jusk a change in look not in features?
A12:19:38 <Cial> *just
A12:20:13 <Visiiri> Yes, but skinning is the only reason people buy the game atm
A12:20:34 <Visiiri> Well, I'll wait here for Notch to come.
A12:20:35 <PuyoDead> No?
A12:20:44 <Visiiri> No what?
A12:20:50 <Skillkills95> Ok
A12:20:51 <Visiiri> My skinning comment?
A12:20:52 <Skillkills95> Im sorry
A12:20:55 <Skillkills95> But i had to
A12:20:59 <Skillkills95> Pictures soon
A12:21:00 <Skillkills95> xD
A12:21:07 <Visiiri> You made her nekked?
A12:21:31 <PuyoDead> People buy it for future updates. For the cheaper price. To support Notch. For level saving.
A12:21:37 <Visiiri> :P
A12:21:38 <PuyoDead> Skinning is one of many.
A12:21:45 <Visiiri> I mean, ATM, that's the only advantage they have over other players
A12:21:48 <Visiiri> saving and skinning

A12:22:14 <Skillkills95> No
A12:22:18 <Skillkills95> Not yet atleast -_-
A12:22:20 <Skillkills95> xD
A12:22:22 <Visiiri> hehehe
A12:22:25 <Skillkills95> I dont think thats possible atm
A12:22:34 <Visiiri> :>
A12:22:42 <Visiiri> make them all tan except red for hair?
A12:22:42 <Shadaez> PuyoDead, you overestimate children.
A12:23:17 <Shadaez> There's only one obvious advantage for buying it: skins.
A12:23:32 <Visiiri> The way I see this: It could take away customization, it could be the best thing that ever happened. We will have to wait.
A12:23:34 <PuyoDead> Which is hardly why everyone is buying it.
A12:23:44 <Visiiri> Sweeping generalization. excuse me.
10A12:23:58 * Kapow (kapox@c-68-82-107-29.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:24:01 <Visiiri> Kapow
A12:24:03 <Visiiri> are you premium?
A12:24:10 <Kapow> nope
A12:24:15 <Visiiri> If I were to say
A12:24:19 <Visiiri> that I would give you premium
A12:24:24 <Visiiri> and you could only have one feature of the game
A12:24:27 <Skillkills95> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=54001#p54001
A12:24:27 <Visiiri> what one would you ask for?
A12:24:28 <Skillkills95> xDDDD
A12:24:40 <PuyoDead> Did you take some stupid pills this month or something?
A12:24:50 <Kapow> there's more than skins?
A12:24:59 <Darkebrz> Ive created a shrine dedicated to the frog princess
A12:25:00 <Shadaez> lol
A12:25:20 <Visiiri> Puyodead, see?
A12:25:23 <Visiiri> "there's more than skins"
A12:25:25 <Visiiri> that's my point.
A12:25:29 <PuyoDead> *sigh*
A12:25:33 <Darkebrz> I also need to give out my present
A12:25:34 <Visiiri> And personal insults aren't helping your conversation any.l
A12:25:36 <PuyoDead> Sure, you win.

A12:26:13 <Kapow> oh and saving single-player maps apparently
A12:26:21 <Darkebrz> Nimoea, have you bought the game?
A12:26:24 <mail2345> why the fucking hell did you think it was a good idea to piss off cha dawn
A12:26:26 <Kapow> not sure why anyone would care about that
A12:26:34 <mail2345> sure he/she is insane
10A12:26:39 * mail2345 is now known as mail2345|game

13A12:26:51 * PuyoDead has been owned.
A12:26:56 <mail2345|game> but honestly you don't want to say that when you have about 1483094832048 mindworm boils
A12:27:01 <Visiiri> Have I? Certainly wasn't my intention.
13A12:27:06 * PuyoDead prints up a contract

A12:27:54 <PuyoDead> Nah, I just felt like it, is all.
A12:28:02 <Visiiri> :P Aren't you kind today.
A12:28:04 <Shadaez> quit fightin' now.
A12:28:06 <PuyoDead> Yup
A12:28:09 <Darkebrz> But yeah, I didn't buy the game for skins.
A12:28:15 <Visiiri> I know I did.
12A12:28:21 * PickYerPoison (technowiz1@adsl-75-8-90-214.dsl.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: Daisy...daisy...)
A12:28:26 <Darkebrz> That sure is a reason, but I really wanted to play survival :B
A12:28:43 <Visiiri> I bought it before survival was developed to a large point
A12:28:51 <Visiiri> I bought it before hacks were 100% public
13A12:28:57 * mail2345|game wonder what would happen if you ran fundy/knowlage
A12:29:03 <mail2345|game> sure it's a retarded idea
A12:29:09 <mail2345|game> but what would the other factions think
A12:29:20 <Kapow> I had the hack client back when it was cool
A12:29:38 <Visiiri> :P  I did
A12:29:53 <Visiiri> I think gdude gave it to me o.O
A12:29:55 <mail2345|game> i had the original flying.exe
A12:29:59 <Visiiri> :P
A12:30:03 <Visiiri> I got CPColains
A12:30:04 <mail2345|game> shitty
A12:30:06 <mail2345|game> buggy
A12:30:10 <mail2345|game> it failed at times
A12:30:14 <mail2345|game> but it did work
A12:30:20 <mail2345|game> then i found CPColains
A12:30:34 <mail2345|game> then i realised that hacks were more powerful in the hands of griefers
A12:30:52 <Kapow> the one I had had Z and X set to change the blocks in front of you to any kind of block you wanted
A12:30:56 <Visiiri> I think I signed up for Minecraft in July
A12:30:57 <Kapow> but the change was only client-side
A12:31:10 <Visiiri> Kapow, that's CPColains
A12:31:12 <Kapow> so it was useless for anything besides walking through walls
A12:31:28 <Kapow> that was before noclip
A12:31:32 <Visiiri> :P
A12:31:33 <Kapow> I miss noclip
A12:31:44 <Darkebrz> Visiiri, I bought it before survival was being developed.
A12:31:49 <Kapow> going outside of the map and seeing the tunnels dug into the sides
A12:31:49 <Visiiri> o.O
A12:31:51 <Kapow> like an ant farm
A12:31:52 <Darkebrz> Well
A12:31:53 <Visiiri> then why'd you buy it for survival?
A12:32:05 <Darkebrz> Because he had anounced it.
A12:32:10 <Visiiri> :P true
A12:32:29 <Darkebrz> And I was one of the first handful of hackers
A12:32:32 <Kapow> he bought it early in case notch ran out of copies
A12:32:37 <Visiiri> :P
A12:32:40 <mail2345|game> i remember that convo earlier with darkebrz
A12:32:44 <Darkebrz> Kapow, I bought it for skins.
A12:32:46 <mail2345|game> where he mentioned it was private
A12:32:55 <Kapow> aha
A12:32:55 <mail2345|game> and i was whining about it being inaproviate for RP
A12:33:01 <Darkebrz> Hm.
A12:33:05 <Darkebrz> That was a long time ago
A12:33:07 <mail2345|game> and some other bits of convo i forgot
A12:33:08 <mail2345|game> indeed
A12:33:09 <Visiiri> o.O
A12:33:15 <Visiiri> I played on Moltars Gay Server the most
A12:33:18 <Darkebrz> I actually know one of the very first hackers
A12:33:19 <Visiiri> it was funneh
A12:33:25 <Darkebrz> He was on Angelo's server.
A12:33:35 <Kapow> I played on reddit public back when it didn't suck
A12:33:47 <PuyoDead> I miss that time,
A12:33:47 <Darkebrz> Y'know, allnaturalx never came back did he?
A12:33:55 <PuyoDead> He did, actually.
A12:34:04 <Darkebrz> And what happened?
A12:34:04 <PuyoDead> Made a right ass of himself, though.
A12:34:08 <Darkebrz> :/
A12:34:08 <Visiiri> Is he not whoisphone on the forums?
A12:34:23 <Darkebrz> PuyoDead, what exactly did he do?
A12:34:27 <Kapow> who will be phone?
A12:34:34 <Darkebrz> I still have his nick linked.
A12:34:38 <PuyoDead> First thing he did was bitch at Test about the whole akill thing. Told him he messed up, and should apologize.
A12:34:46 <Darkebrz> Wow.
A12:34:48 <Kapow> what happened?
A12:34:50 <PuyoDead> In here, in public, no less.
A12:35:04 <Kapow> I quit playing for months and came back to see it pretty much abandoned
A12:35:04 <Visiiri> Fail.
A12:35:17 <Visiiri> I just rolled with my punches
A12:35:18 <Darkebrz> Kapow, are you talking about minecraft?
A12:35:20 <Visiiri> and got off with a week
A12:35:23 <Kapow> the reddit public server
A12:35:28 <Darkebrz> Oh
A12:35:30 <Darkebrz> Okay
A12:35:31 <Darkebrz> Yeah
A12:35:36 <PuyoDead> The only reason his akill lasted so long was because he evaded it multiple times... to complain about it.
A12:35:48 <Visiiri> akill?
A12:35:49 <PuyoDead> Yea, Reddit Public is a wasteland now.
A12:35:51 <Visiiri> Is that like a gline?
A12:35:56 <PuyoDead> Pretty much.
A12:35:59 <Visiiri> oh my
A12:36:03 <Kapow> akill on what
A12:36:12 <PuyoDead> Esper, the whole network.
A12:36:15 <Visiiri> I did a proxy from the library and I couldn't evade my kline
A12:36:16 <Kapow> for what?
A12:36:16 <Visiiri> o.O
A12:36:22 <Darkebrz> "How To Remove Warts with Duct Tape"
A12:36:23 <Visiiri> I must fail.
A12:36:28 <Darkebrz> I... I dont want to read any further
A12:36:29 <Visiiri> hahahha
A12:37:09 <Kapow> how to make books about solving every problem with duct tape with duct tape
A12:37:17 <Visiiri> I don't understand why IRC servers have the right to G-Line ban
A12:37:27 <PuyoDead> Eh?
A12:37:30 <Kapow> "the right"?
A12:37:41 <Visiiri> Well, gline is all irc servers?
10A12:37:42 * Kratospie (Mibbit@h42.183.40.69.dynamic.ip.windstream.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:37:43 <Visiiri> Correct?
A12:37:46 <PuyoDead> It's not like IRC is a public right.
A12:37:56 <PuyoDead> All servers within that network, yea.
A12:37:56 <Kapow> it's done by network admins not server admins, I thought
A12:38:01 <Visiiri> wait
A12:38:02 <Kratospie> hey
A12:38:04 <Visiiri> "network"
A12:38:07 <Visiiri> so If I was glined here
A12:38:09 <Kapow> just running a server doesn't give you power over the whole network
A12:38:19 <Visiiri> Could I join one for a different game?
A12:38:22 <PuyoDead> Esper, Undernet, Freedone, etc.
A12:38:25 <Kapow> game?
A12:38:27 <Visiiri> Oh
A12:38:34 <Kapow> you do not really get how IRC works do you
A12:38:36 <Visiiri> kapow, mpgh, trivian, my own.
A12:38:37 <PuyoDead> Err, freenode rather
A12:38:42 <Visiiri> I don't.
A12:38:44 <Visiiri> I'm new to IRC
A12:38:55 <Visiiri> Only used it for about 6 months
A12:39:09 <Visiiri> Ajax is my thing :P
A12:39:39 <Kapow> #minecraft is a channel on the espernet IRC network, which is run through many IRC servers that are synced with the main server
A12:39:46 <PuyoDead> Esper has their own servers for this network. They are all "linked" together, and getting an akill here effectively bans you from all of them. (I'm sure I have some technical aspect wrong there)
A12:40:04 <PuyoDead> Where as EFNet has their own servers and rules (and channels, for that matter).
A12:40:04 <Visiiri> Like a mall
A12:40:13 <Visiiri> if you get kicked out
A12:40:16 <Visiiri> you can't go into ANY store
A12:40:20 <Visiiri> but you can go to a different mall
A12:40:21 <Visiiri> I see
A12:40:24 <Kapow> when you connect, you connect to one of those servers in order to get access to the whole network
A12:40:26 <PuyoDead> That's one way to look at it, sure.
A12:40:30 <Visiiri> :>
A12:41:22 <PuyoDead> Most usee g/klines, and ChanServ/NickServ, stuff like such. But some have little differences.
A12:41:43 <mail2345|game> diffrences between servers or networks?
A12:41:52 <PuyoDead> Like Undernet, they have X for channel stuff. And other networks have stuff like half-ops.
A12:41:56 <PuyoDead> Networks
A12:41:56 <mail2345|game> oh
A12:41:58 <mail2345|game> k
A12:42:22 <Visiiri> I always thought that half ops are a good idea.
A12:42:24 <mail2345|game> on this network, servers can differ on bot policy
A12:42:26 <mail2345|game> but they don
A12:42:27 <mail2345|game> t
A12:42:49 <PuyoDead> A community I frequent used their own website server to make an IRC server, so they have their own network they can do anything with.
A12:43:07 <Visiiri> I am going to host an IRC server too
A12:43:08 <Visiiri> :P
A12:43:11 <Visiiri> there's just no reason
A12:43:17 <Visiiri> unless minecraft would move to it o.O
A12:43:27 <Darkebrz> irc.visirri.net
A12:43:33 <Darkebrz> *visiiri
A12:43:35 <Darkebrz> Users: 1
A12:43:40 <Visiiri> hehee
A12:43:40 <Kapow> generally it doesn't matter which server you connect to within a network, except when it goes down or desyncs with the rest of the network (a netsplit)
A12:43:42 <Visiiri> Actually
A12:43:47 <Visiiri> it'd be irc.m4cx2.net
A12:43:49 <tentacos> I always forget I have an irc network
A12:43:51 <Visiiri> and there would be 2 users
A12:43:53 <Visiiri> me and my bot :>
10A12:44:33 * Mastria_sleeping is now known as Mastria|AFK
A12:44:38 <Skillkills95> well thats a dissapointment

A12:44:56 <Skillkills95> It seems that the helmet uses the same color for the clothes
A12:45:00 <Darkebrz> Shi
A12:45:04 <Visiiri> :<
A12:45:06 <Skillkills95> you take away the helmet, you take away the body...

A1:45:35 <AndrewPH> Herro dock.
A1:45:45 <Shadaez> Dock, have you played Minecraft at all?
A1:46:00 <Skillkills95> Obviously he has or else he wouldnt know that the models worked
A1:46:05 <Skillkills95> Other than notch...
A1:46:19 <Skillkills95> Or am i wrong?
A1:46:20 <Dock> Hi AndrewPH 
A1:46:28 <Visiiri> Dock!
A1:46:34 <Visiiri> Hey.
A1:46:34 <Skillkills95> Lol
A1:46:36 <Dock> Shadaez, yes, I was one of the first people to play minecraft :) 
A1:46:43 <Skillkills95> Your so late Visiiri
A1:46:49 <Visiiri> I was doing my job
A1:46:51 <Skillkills95> Oh yea thats right
A1:46:54 <Visiiri> administrating a great server
A1:46:58 <Shadaez> You must be a member of TIGsource 
A1:47:04 <Dock> back when notch was still testing it out on the tigsource irc 
A1:47:06 <Dock> yeah
A1:47:13 <Shadaez> Wow
A1:47:22 <Shadaez> Must be a lot of great dev people there?
A1:47:22 <Skillkills95> I remember reading you said you started playing minecraft long long ago

A1:48:24 <Dock> Take care! 
A1:48:25 <Shadaez> come back later
A1:48:28 <Visiiri> Well, dock, I've got two simple questions for you. 1: Will the models be editable, or just the colors? 2: Will it be more low-rez in the end?
A1:48:41 <Visiiri> :\
A1:48:42 <Visiiri> ofc.
A1:48:44 <Shadaez> lol
A1:48:46 <Visiiri> Right when he leaves.

A1:50:11 <Skillkills95> It could mean anything.... ANYTHING
A1:50:27 <Shadaez> Don't worry about it.
A1:50:46 <Skillkills95> -calls frog girl/ girlscout to hide me- im scared....
A1:50:47 <Skillkills95> xD
A1:51:09 <Shadaez> Dock is my hero
A1:51:18 <Skillkills95> Im gonna marry Dock...
A1:51:33 <Skillkills95> Never played LostWinds btw
A1:51:34 <Skillkills95> xD
A1:51:58 <Shadaez> The girl in Lost Winds looks similiar to Frog Girl 
A1:52:07 <Skillkills95> I saw that
A1:52:08 <Skillkills95> xD
A1:52:29 <Shadaez> I feel so special
A1:52:33 <Skillkills95> How?
A1:52:38 <Shadaez> I talked to an artist of the best wiiware game ever.
A1:52:51 <Skillkills95> I dont like Wii
A1:52:56 <Visiiri> Neither do I.
A1:52:58 <Skillkills95> Not very good motion detecion
A1:53:04 <Visiiri> And terrible graphics
A1:53:07 <Visiiri> terrible processing
A1:53:08 <Skillkills95> Yea
A1:53:13 <Visiiri> terrible UAC
A1:53:37 <Visiiri> Terrible ineternet
A1:53:41 <Visiiri> terrible web browser
A1:53:43 <Shadaez> "terrible processing" ?
A1:53:44 <Visiiri> terrible updates
A1:53:49 <Visiiri> It doesn't run very much
A1:53:51 <Skillkills95> Project natal for xbox 360 is much better
A1:53:51 <Visiiri> it's like
A1:53:56 <Visiiri> a 2 gig ram computer
A1:53:58 <Skillkills95> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2qlHoxPioM
A1:54:10 <Visiiri> gotta pee
A1:54:12 <Shadaez> You guys are incredibly...
A1:54:17 <PuyoDead> Sorry Vis, but I'm gonna call the trolling card on this one.
A1:54:24 <AndrewPH> Do you guys know nothing of what the wii is running on?
A1:54:30 <AndrewPH> :|
A1:54:40 <Skillkills95> Nope
A1:54:43 <Skillkills95> But ive played
A1:54:46 <Skillkills95> And it sucks ASS
A1:54:46 <PuyoDead> That minirant sounded like it came from a 6 year old.
A1:54:53 <Shadaez> Nah just dem graphix aint gewd.
A1:54:56 <AndrewPH> Let's just say, Mario Galaxy shouldn't even run on it.
A1:55:06 <Skillkills95> Graphics and motion sensing sucks...
A1:55:06 <AndrewPH> It shouldn't be able to run on it.
A1:55:26 <AndrewPH> It has very little RAM.
A1:55:29 <PuyoDead> If you're still hung up on GRAFIXX, you've got a few years to mature on the gaming front.
A1:55:34 <AndrewPH> iirc 512MB.
A1:55:51 <AndrewPH> I have it just because it's amazing what nintendo has managed to make run on it.
A1:55:56 <AndrewPH> (also homebrew)
A1:56:09 <Shadaez> TBH I play mostly PC and occasionally Wii.
A1:56:12 <Skillkills95> if I really cared about graphics... i woulda quit minecraft the first second i played...
A1:56:25 <Skillkills95> Its the motion sensign that got me
A1:56:52 <PuyoDead> They dropped the ball on that one, no doubt. But they've done pretty well dispite that.
A1:57:29 <Skillkills95> WHos actually watching that project natal thing?
A1:57:30 <Skillkills95> xD
A1:57:34 <Shadaez> Nobody.
A1:57:41 <Skillkills95> Watch it
A1:57:47 <Skillkills95> It kicks Wii's ass
A1:57:48 <Shadaez> I did when it was new.
A1:57:56 <Shadaez> And no, it doesn't look that good.
A1:58:03 <Shadaez> However, PS3's system looks pretty good.
A1:58:06 <PuyoDead> That's a joke, right?
A1:58:23 <Skillkills95> @ who?
A1:58:27 <PuyoDead> All three have similarities, but different directions in mind.
A1:58:44 <Skillkills95> I say Project Natal Wins
A1:58:45 <Skillkills95> xD
A1:58:54 <PuyoDead> Natal needs a lot more work to really work well, and even then, only for certain applications.
A1:59:00 <Shadaez> Thats' because you are a 360 fanboy
A1:59:19 <Skillkills95> I play 360 as much as i play wii...
A1:59:23 <Skillkills95> Almost NEVER
A1:59:25 <Shadaez> But wii sucks?
A1:59:26 <PuyoDead> It shows a lot of promise, but there's plenty more to be done.
A1:59:33 <Shadaez> Sigh
A1:59:41 <Skillkills95> I play wii at my friends house
A1:59:46 <Skillkills95> and 360 here
A2:00:03 <Shadaez> I think I know what the 95 is from.
A2:00:12 <Skillkills95> The onyl time i turn my 360 on is when my friend spends the night or i get a new game
A2:00:17 <PuyoDead> *chuckle*
A2:00:21 <Skillkills95> christmas i will be on for days though
A2:00:33 <Skillkills95> Im getting modern warfare2 and assassins creed 2
A2:00:51 <Skillkills95> Yes, Im 14
A2:02:30 <Skillkills95> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPIbGnBQcJY&NR=1
A2:02:36 <Shadaez> And?
A2:02:48 <Skillkills95> And what?
A2:02:57 <Shadaez> Not even that cool.
A2:03:37 <Skillkills95> gets good around 2:15
A2:04:12 <PuyoDead> Again, it shows promise, but not much for application right now.
A2:05:05 <AndrewPH> waiting for it to say "clare you're a faggot"
A2:05:16 <PuyoDead> It's still a "look, this will do amazing stuff!" thing right now.
A2:05:47 <Shadaez> And she doesn't really do anything special
A2:06:13 <Shadaez> If she moved her arm around quickly in the water it would look badly.
A2:06:28 <AndrewPH> Looks funt o fuck around with
A2:06:32 <AndrewPH> fun to*
A2:06:43 <Skillkills95> Theres a paint program too
A2:06:44 <Shadaez> Also, nobody's going to take it seriously like she does...
A2:06:55 <Skillkills95> You pick paint up with your hands and splat it
A2:07:05 <Shadaez> K now go look at PS3's
A2:07:13 <Shadaez> You can actually hold thingsi n your hands and swing them
A2:07:29 <PuyoDead> Yea, tangible objects really are a must for this kind of thing.
A2:07:34 <Shadaez> It's combining 360's and Wii's systems.
A2:07:34 <Skillkills95> Really....? You cant honestly say when you play a game no matter what it is... you dont get into it
A2:07:52 <Shadaez> Milo isn't a game.
A2:07:55 <AndrewPH> Skillkills95, I'm ashamed to be the same age as you :|
A2:08:25 <Skillkills95> Im ashamed yall dont see the potential in this
A2:08:39 <Shadaez> Sure, potential, I guess.
A2:08:39 <AndrewPH> There's potential
A2:08:47 <AndrewPH> We never once said there isn't.
A2:09:22 <Shadaez> Until you can actually try it out, then you don't know how well it works. The people doing it aren't going to try anything radical that might not work and make it look bad to the viewers.
A2:09:36 <Visiiri> That's a very nice video
A2:09:47 <Visiiri> but something tells me the real software will be about as impressive as the Wii
A2:09:51 <Visiiri> Very nice
A2:09:56 <Visiiri> but can only do so much
A2:12:15 <Shadaez> I have a Wii and PS3 but I do want a 360 for certain games.
A2:12:24 <Shadaez> And to develope XNA on.
A2:12:48 <Shadaez> And an easy way to watch Netflix on TV. Although PS3's getting that soon.
A2:17:55 <Visiiri> I want Natal
A2:18:05 <Visiiri> when would you propose the release date would be?
A2:18:42 <Shadaez> 2011

A10:33:35 <MysteryGuy> Hello Everyone
A10:33:37 <SMP|AC2> well you're changing something dear to their hearts...quite a lot
A10:33:39 <SMP|AC2> it's to be expected
A10:33:42 <laCour> Yeah
A10:33:53 <laCour> Once they get used to it, their bound to like it
A10:33:54 <Dock> SMP|AC2: well, yes, I expected it. 
A10:34:07 <Dock> but it doesn't make me any happier about it. 
A10:34:18 <laCour> It shouldn't. :P
10A10:34:18 * SMP|AC2 is now known as SMP
A10:34:24 <Quatroking> Can you make small edits to the logo you made?
A10:34:36 <griob> dock: us minecrafters JOKE alot. much of the "hostility" is really us being sarcastic.
A10:34:49 <Quatroking> griob: yeah or plain retardation
A10:34:55 <griob> trust me: we LOVE you and the things youre doing
A10:35:02 <griob> and yes, what quatro said.. :P
A10:35:06 <Dock> My next step will be to do new models and tiles, try to get something figured out. 
A10:35:44 <SMP> are you planning to change anything but the textures and player model?

A10:38:00 <Ten_Tacles> i dont hate you i cant do that
A10:38:05 <MysteryGuy> I love the new lightning :)

A10:38:35 <Ten_Tacles> i cant hate people i never met
A10:38:39 <serp> where is the new lighting?
A10:38:39 <Ten_Tacles> i just say that
A10:38:46 <Dock> I'd prefer to be working on minecraft without the feeling that the community hates me. 
A10:38:55 <Dock> Which a few people seem to be encouraging. 
A10:39:00 <Ten_Tacles> the wood/tnt bug is awesome

A10:39:28 <Dock> serp: yes, I'm doing new graphics
A10:39:32 <serp> cool stuff
A10:39:41 <Dock> The minecraft community reminds me a lot of the Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 communtiy
A10:39:43 <serp> are you changing the textures?
A10:39:44 <Dock> for good and bad
A10:39:52 <Dock> I'm changing everything
A10:39:53 <Quatroking> Dock, a little suggestion, could you change the curves from the logo a bit?
A10:39:56 <serp> ok neat
A10:40:10 <Quatroking> for example, from the blue we have now, to the green curve here? http://www.uploadscreenshot.com/image/45543/894057
A10:40:21 <Shadaez> guys im sure he is working on it
A10:40:21 <serp> I have noticed that game communities with young americans tend to be very hostile 
A10:40:45 <Quatroking> Pretty sure a lot of folks here are eurofags, serp.
A10:40:53 <serp> just saying
A10:41:16 <Dock> Quatroking: Ah, I see what you mean. 
A10:41:24 <Quatroking> it keeps a bit more blocky in it
A10:41:27 <Quatroking> yet curfy
A10:41:31 <Quatroking> curvy*
A10:41:37 <Quatroking> (whatever you spell it)
A10:41:45 <serp> Dock: you have any sneak peaks? :D
A10:41:46 <Dock> I'll probably be looking into the logo again later down the line, so I'll consider this approach
A10:41:58 <Dock> serp: no :) 
A10:42:04 <serp> bummer
A10:42:10 <Dock> I'm probably going to be careful with any previews, all things considered. 
A10:42:20 <serp> that's probably very wise
A10:42:20 <Quatroking> Oh, by the way, what program do you use for your graphics?
A10:42:24 <Quatroking> Plain ol' PS?
A10:42:41 <Dock> photoshop, 3D studio max, adobe illustrator, the usual stuff
A10:42:55 <Quatroking> yay vector graphics
A10:43:38 <Ten_Tacles> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=Ten_Tacles&id=3
A10:43:45 <Ten_Tacles> dock make it look like that
A10:44:22 <Dock> Ten_Tacles: I can't play minecraft on this computer at the moment, sorry. 
A10:44:27 <Ten_Tacles> oh
A10:44:29 <Ten_Tacles> :/
A10:44:35 <Ten_Tacles> i make a screen
A10:44:37 <serp> no thats horrible
A10:44:54 <Dock> but I don't presently expect to change the logo much. 
A10:44:59 <bildramer> ^ yay
A10:45:09 <Ten_Tacles> gah serp 
A10:45:13 <Ten_Tacles> everyone hates me
A10:45:24 <Quatroking> Ten_Tacles, you're the last one to give suggestions regarding graphics
A10:45:31 <bildramer> Dock, look at the Roblox logo and take it as a counter-example :P
A10:45:41 <Ten_Tacles> meanie
A10:45:50 <Ten_Tacles> why quatroking
A10:45:55 <Quatroking> the roblox logo is fucking mspaint
A10:46:16 <Dock> What does the Roblox logo have to do with Minecraft's new logo?
A10:46:41 <Ten_Tacles> bildramer is dumb
A10:46:45 <Ten_Tacles> thats why
A10:46:54 <Quatroking> as comparison how awesome our new logo is

A10:59:21 <Dock> No estimates :) 
A10:59:37 <Shadaez> We should just let dock not answer 20 questions/minute for a while.
A10:59:38 <Darkebrz> Nalok, you should know Notch's policy against deadlines
A10:59:44 <griob> ahahahaha i just bought freaking 5 games for myself, AND 2 for other people for under 25 dollars. it should have been more than 100... IM SO HAPPY
A10:59:54 <Shadaez> Steam?
A10:59:56 <Shadaez> What games.
A11:00:20 <Marach> griob: file corrupted D: i have to download again
A11:00:22 <Dock> the main thing is that it's quite a bit overhaul 
A11:00:28 <VurtualRuler98> I can't even buy off steam.
A11:00:33 <griob> :(
A11:00:42 <VurtualRuler98> The only game I want is 2 bucks, and I make someone else pay. 2 dollars is a bit fishy.
A11:00:45 <Dock> so I want to make sure it looks great
A11:00:51 <Marach> probably because of connection fail
A11:00:54 <VurtualRuler98> So now I have 3 games I only partially care about to pick from.

A11:10:40 <MysteryGuy> I love RCT3 :)
A11:10:44 <Quatroking> Well that's pretty cool
A11:10:52 <MonkeyDKS> Yeah Dock, I work for a hardware manufacturer and we're the same way...all kinds of things in the works, and we can't talk about any of them
A11:11:01 <Dock> It has a lot in common with minecraft.
A11:11:09 <Dock> :)
A11:11:19 <Dock> MonkeyDKS: yeah, it's tricky, right?
A11:11:24 <Quatroking> I'm not a fan of RCT3 due to the lack of the Chris Sawyer element, but still
A11:11:26 <MonkeyDKS> Especially in tech support!
A11:11:27 <Dock> because in general you 'can't win'

A11:11:53 <MonkeyDKS> Especially when you know you have a fix for something...and you just can't tell them, "Well...wait a week and we'll let you know"

A11:15:54 <Marach> let me see if this is what i think
A11:16:10 <Quatroking> I've been thinking of converting the Blackpool Pleasure Beach map from RCT1 to RCT2 lately
A11:16:12 <Marach> yes it is ^_^
A11:16:25 <Quatroking> it would make me internet famous once again if i manage to accomplish that

A11:17:41 <Quatroking> fffff
A11:17:46 <Quatroking> my rct 1 cd's are corrupted
A11:17:49 <Marach> a game has to be compiled for the emulator or however it is called

A11:31:56 <griob> dock: will the models youre making have joints? :P
A11:32:22 <MonkeyDKS> There is an off topic forum, but no one stays on topic here
A11:32:40 <MonkeyDKS> The unwritten rule seems to be if someone wants to talk on topic shuttup about off topic stuff for a bit
A11:32:44 <Dock> griob: do you mean marijuana? 
A11:32:47 <Marach> i think he will make quake3 format models, so it will include animations and such
A11:33:02 <Dock> ;)
A11:33:09 <griob> yes and of course elbows knees necks and such.. :P
A11:33:23 <Quatroking> it would be cool if we were able to have unshaved miners with sigarrettes
A11:33:32 <griob> ?
A11:33:43 <Dock> yes, they'll be full animated
A11:33:44 <VurtualRuler98> If we imported models someho, I could save myself a huge amount of time with my minecraft skin.
A11:33:48 <griob> ok cool
A11:34:19 <citricsquid> dock has a wiki page, we're in the presence of royalty.
A11:34:28 <Darkebrz> HE DOES?

A11:56:16 <Marach> i can take the pic in vertical mode
A11:56:44 <Dock> I think iphone OS 3.0 has a few bugs 
A11:57:13 <griob> lvl 14 5 moves 2 tries
A11:57:24 <PuyoDead> Hah, solved level 10 in one try.
A11:57:57 <citricsquid> did level 18 in 3 moves, I hate the inconsistency it seems to have, makes it sooooo much harder
A11:58:00 <Darkebrz> Oh man these speakers are so awesome.
A11:58:33 <Ten_Tacles> dock did you ever played minecraft?
A11:58:37 <Dock> citricsquid: if you hate it, why do you play it? 
A11:58:43 <Dock> Ten_Tacles: yes, of course. 
A11:58:48 <citricsquid> Dock: I've started now, I CANNOT GIVE IN.
A11:58:50 <Dock> I already stated this. 
A11:58:50 <Ten_Tacles> cool
A11:59:09 <Dock> I helped notch test it right at the start 
A11:59:13 <Ten_Tacles> lol
A11:59:16 <Ten_Tacles> cool
A11:59:19 <griob> unity hates me!]
A11:59:30 <Prow> Oh hey, Dock is here
A11:59:33 <Dock> griob: oh no! D: 
A11:59:34 <citricsquid> is there a bug that causes the game to reset dock? I just got sent back to level 2? :-o

A11:59:52 <citricsquid> and now it's auto completing all the levels
A11:59:55 <citricsquid> without any moves
A11:59:58 <Dock> citricsquid: oh, that version doesn't have a a proper ending, it just loops
P12:00:00 <Dock> ah
P12:00:03 <Darkebrz> So what game is this?
P12:00:04 <Dock> then yes, that's a bug
P12:00:06 <citricsquid> oh okay

P12:01:16 <Marach> its a sample model...

P12:01:37 <Nalok> Oh my god, LG gave me an idea
P12:01:41 <LG_Legacy> Did i?
P12:01:44 <Prow> Hooray, i beat the first level
P12:01:46 <Jat> a naughty one
P12:01:49 <Nalok> Torches should set trees on fire
P12:01:52 <Nalok> :D
P12:01:56 <LG_Legacy> Indeed
P12:02:07 <Ten_Tacles> lol
P12:02:08 <Shadaez> fire = bad news bears
P12:02:11 <Peerko> I just played the premium preview and found a funny bug with the TNT block
P12:02:13 <Jat> then as soon as the game starts people would just run aroud and wipe out all of thr trees
P12:02:19 <Darkebrz> Peerko, not a bug.
P12:02:21 <Ten_Tacles> strategic minecraft ROCKS
P12:02:29 <Peerko> well it's still funny
P12:02:29 <Jat> holy shit
P12:02:29 <Marach> empire interactive is DEAD D:
P12:02:40 <Jat> its not a bug that the ground turns into wood?
P12:02:43 <Peerko> I made all water into wood
P12:02:43 <Ten_Tacles> peerki its not premium preview
P12:02:53 <Ten_Tacles> *peerko
P12:02:59 <Ten_Tacles> its notchs test mode
P12:03:04 <Peerko> well the preview from the blog anyway
P12:03:16 <Darkebrz> Havn't I played a game exactly like Tumbledrop?

P12:08:20 <Cial> big bug
P12:08:32 <Nalok> In the MD3 demo, deleting a tnt block makes wood spawn
P12:08:45 <Marach> lol

P12:10:29 <citricsquid> I have the same skin now that I had the day I bought premium, I will never change!
P12:10:37 <Nalok> It looks fucking awesome though
P12:10:38 <Peerko> also, caves and torches make digging a lot more fun
P12:10:55 <Shadaez> Does water put torches out?
P12:11:00 <Peerko> no

P12:13:00 <bildramer> apparently torches make grass grow
P12:13:01 <bildramer> :P
P12:13:04 <Jat> is it just me or does the dynamic lighting and darkness in caves and torches actually make caves creepier?
P12:13:13 <bildramer> yep
P12:13:14 <Nalok> Well it provides light, bild
P12:13:19 <bildramer> in survival it would rock
P12:13:21 <citricsquid> I can't wait for screaming in caves
P12:13:24 <Prow> I just saw the player model concept art
P12:13:27 <Prow> Ew...
P12:13:27 <Dock> yeah, it's definitely more atmospheric 
P12:13:47 <Jat> i dont really like the way theres still some light even when there should be pitch black
P12:13:47 <Prow> I prefer old ones, but these new are very good.
P12:13:52 <Dock> Prow: didn't you already complain about it? How could you only just have seen it?
P12:13:55 <Nalok> No light in caves with a bunch of frog girls hopping around like spiders = DONOTWANTDONOTWANTDONOTWANT
P12:13:59 <Prow> I did?
P12:14:07 <Jat> lol nalok yeah i found that pretty creepy
P12:14:39 <Quatroking> Dock will you show more concept art/preview stuff soon
P12:14:44 <MonkeyDKS> I like the torch on the tree...NOT burning the leaves :)
P12:14:50 <Jat> it would be cool if there were a portable torch too
P12:14:51 <Prow> Anyway, i think the head should smaller
P12:14:55 <Jat> that you could carry
P12:14:56 <PuyoDead> So far, the general consensus has been that the new art stuffs is very nice. Some have been a bit slow in deciding on it, though.
P12:14:58 <Prow> Just my thought
P12:15:03 <Quatroking> MonkeyDKS, the leaves are made of plastic
P12:15:07 <Quatroking> they only smolder
P12:15:17 <Jat> and produce cancerous fumes
P12:15:17 <MonkeyDKS> With a non-flamable material?
13P12:15:23 * Peerko is also still getting used to the concept art
P12:15:24 <PuyoDead> Then people like Tacles are just to be ignored alltogether.
P12:15:31 <MonkeyDKS> Luckily the fumes only go up where the hackers are flying
P12:15:31 <Quatroking> um
P12:15:32 <citricsquid> general consensus from what I've seen: art is nice, BAWWWWWW CHANGE I HATE CHANGE NOTCH IS A BASTARD BAWWW
P12:15:39 <Quatroking> the leaves are made from chinese babies
P12:15:47 <Iguana> Nooo.

P12:16:00 <Dock> Quatroking: the next thing you'll probably see will be 3D models of the characters
P12:16:12 <Dock> concept can be misleading with angular characters like this

P12:16:16 <Jat> i like the new art style a lot
P12:16:17 <MonkeyDKS> Everyone had the same first reaction I think...But on the whole I've mostly heard good things after people get used to it
P12:16:19 <Quatroking> any date?
P12:16:24 <MonkeyDKS> (I lurk a lot more than I talk)
P12:16:26 <Dock> Quatroking: no :)

P12:17:29 <Jat> oh ok
P12:17:30 <Jat> cool
P12:17:36 <Jat> can i add different hats?

P12:17:51 <Dock> Jat: I'm working on that :) 
P12:17:56 <PuyoDead> Prediction: Nobody will use the old player model after a while.
P12:18:07 <MonkeyDKS> Actually Dock, what about big noses or giant monkey lips and weird stuff like that?
P12:18:09 <Animator> I love how Mochi's going through an entire petition for the sake of keeping the old models.
P12:18:19 <PuyoDead> Mochi is a bit of a doofus.
P12:18:23 <MonkeyDKS> The old models are staying as an option, aren't they?
P12:18:26 <PuyoDead> Well, more than a bit.
P12:18:39 <Animator> Honestly, as long as Dock adds in a monocle and top hats, I'm satisfied.
P12:18:39 <Nalok> Will we be able to take our own models and paste them on the MD3?
P12:18:41 <Dock> MonkeyDKS: I'm playing around with options, but it'll be pretty flexible 
P12:18:50 <Dock> Nalok: no, sorry
P12:18:51 <MonkeyDKS> Cool.  We will wait and find out then!
10P12:18:57 * Mastria_sleeping is now known as Mastria_afk

P12:19:08 <Nalok> Aww, I wanted an md3 grass skin :(
P12:19:10 <Animator> Did you create the frog hat girl concept?
P12:19:16 <Dock> yes
P12:19:21 <Mastria_afk> Oh. Hey Dock. Good job on the new art. :D
P12:19:29 <Dock> thanks Mastria_afk :)

P12:19:37 <Prow> Dock, you are awesome. Thanks to you i can make laboratories
P12:19:43 <Mastria_afk> Well i'm GOING to be afk. But i'll make an exception for this.
P12:19:52 <Dock> MonkeyDKS: I won't come on here when I'm busy  :) 
P12:20:06 <MonkeyDKS> Smart man!  Notch just leaves it on and shrinks it
P12:20:13 <MonkeyDKS> Just as effective
P12:20:20 <Dock> but I thought it was worth addressing some of the questions
P12:20:21 <Jat> you mean minimizes?
P12:20:28 <Nalok> Now that we have torches, someone needs to recreate the Great Deku Tree dungeon
P12:20:30 <MonkeyDKS> Very cool of you to do so!
P12:20:30 <Dock> and I wanted to get a better feel for the community
P12:20:33 <Mastria_afk> Dock, i have just one quick question. Are you in charge of ALL art? Or just character concepts?

P12:26:01 <Dock> Jat: yeah, problems with normals :) 
P12:26:07 <Vic> dock, quick question, are the frog girls based off a character or something
P12:26:21 <Vic> from an anime or a game or whatever
P12:26:30 <Cial> Dock just run they will not let you leave other wise
P12:26:32 <Dock> Vic: just one of my own
P12:26:33 <Quatroking> mysims
P12:26:37 <Vic> okay
P12:26:41 <Quatroking> they look like mysims
P12:26:51 <Dock> later chaps! see you soon!
P12:26:57 <Vic> it reminded me of a certain character from a certain series but yeah.
P12:26:57 <Quatroking> bai my hero
13P12:26:58 * Marach likes getting xmas gifts from strangers
12P12:26:59 * Dock (Dock@cpc1-cmbg3-0-0-cust834.cmbg.cable.ntl.com) Quit (Quit: bai bai)
P12:27:11 <Prow> Vic, from now Dock is a 
P12:27:16 <Prow> *takes breath*
P12:27:32 <Jat> dont say it
P12:27:35 <Cial> god?
P12:27:41 <Koitenshin> fuuuuuuuuuu, no custom skins. >_>
P12:27:45 <Marach> why
P12:27:46 <Prow> Yes.
P12:27:48 <Siiseli> sure there will be?
P12:27:49 <PuyoDead> What?
P12:27:50 <Vic> no customs? why not
P12:27:50 <Koitenshin> thank goodness for being gifted premium
P12:27:56 <PuyoDead> Err.
P12:27:57 <Vic> just a different model
P12:27:59 <Jat> dont worry there will still probably be lots of customization
P12:28:00 <Koitenshin> i can still use the old system
P12:28:06 <Prow> Yeah
P12:28:07 <Vic> besides, yeah, lots of customization.
P12:28:17 <PuyoDead> Koitenshin, where did you pull that idea from?
P12:28:20 <Prow> But i'd prefer a skins 
P12:28:26 <Koitenshin> rereading the thread
P12:28:31 <Koitenshin> twas afk
P12:28:34 <Prow> Every character would be you know, diffirent
P12:28:36 <Koitenshin> and not thread but irc chatlog
P12:28:37 <Vic> i think the new models will work just like the new ones
P12:28:44 <Jat> on notched dev blog he said people who already have premium will still be able to use the old model if they want
P12:28:50 <PuyoDead> The one where they both said customization will still be in?
P12:29:09 <vede> DAMN!
P12:29:13 <vede> Just missed him!
P12:29:16 <Vic> not only you'll be able to change textures, but maybe change the model too
P12:29:18 <Vic> maybe.
P12:29:32 <Vic> hats! capes! all sorts of things!
P12:30:08 <Koitenshin> I guess we will only see when it gets implemented.
P12:30:09 <Jat> he said you will not be able to use your own model you can only customize with what they give you
P12:30:20 <Koitenshin> Thank you jat
P12:30:26 <Koitenshin> Thats exactly what I said
P12:30:37 <Marach> that isnt bad
P12:30:43 <Marach> we had to live with ONE model so far.
P12:30:48 <PuyoDead> No you didn't.
P12:30:48 <Marach> so dont complain
P12:30:51 <vede> Jat, I think he means changing the model, like with preset modifications.
P12:30:55 <Jat> i know
P12:31:00 <bildramer> mhm.
P12:31:16 <vede> Which seems necessary if the model itself is going to be more detailed.
P12:31:19 <Jat> you can customize the model but you can not introduce your own content
P12:31:32 <Jat> which sounds fine to me
P12:31:34 <vede> Except with the texture, of course.
P12:31:37 <Prow> Hey, i've just got an idea
P12:31:40 <Jat> there will probably be tons of customization available
P12:31:45 <Prow> There will be a WAR
P12:31:49 <bildramer> cannot we make our own MD3 models? :/
P12:31:56 <bildramer> that sucks
P12:31:57 <Marach> its not easy
P12:32:02 <Prow> Between cartoony guys and between 8-Bit wars...
P12:32:08 <Prow> i mean guys
P12:32:10 <Marach> forums would fill up with model requests
P12:32:11 <Prow> i mean
P12:32:13 <Prow> pixelated
P12:32:14 <Jat> and it ensures that you dont have to see tons of stupid shitty looking models made by people who think they can model
13P12:32:18 * bildramer has a hex editor, 	everything	's easy
P12:32:20 <Prow> i mea-, whatever
P12:32:44 <vede> Jat, I hate it when people try to say that mods are bad because people will make bad mods.
P12:33:04 <vede> By that very same reasoning, custom player skins should not be there.
P12:33:09 <bildramer> There is a constant intelligence value in the world :P
P12:33:20 <vede> Because people will have to deal with all the shitty skins.
P12:33:23 <bildramer> *the sum
P12:33:36 <Jat> the current skins are so low resolution that bad quality isnt as obvious
P12:33:39 <bildramer> Well, modding is always good for games
P12:33:45 <Jat> so its ok with this low resolution
10P12:33:49 * Isak (stwisak@cpe-70-122-64-144.hot.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P12:33:52 <bildramer> and can always be abused
P12:34:04 <Jat> but allowing people to use custom models would ruin the visual and thematic consistency
P12:34:23 <Isak> Wow. I'm digging the new art concepts.
P12:34:27 <vede> True.
P12:34:27 <Iguana> But it would also open up many doors for custom servars.
P12:34:28 <Prow> I wonder how will minecraft look...
P12:34:35 <Iguana> And themed server would be +9000
P12:34:39 <Isak> I hope it doesn't become too cartoony.
P12:34:42 <Prow> Yeah
P12:34:42 <Nalok> We need a bone pile block
P12:34:44 <vede> Isak, why not?
P12:34:51 <Animator> It's all on Dock's hands now.
P12:34:58 <Isak> I'm just not a fan of cartoony games.
P12:34:59 <vede> Minecraft is a very silly game.
P12:35:03 <PuyoDead> Very capable hands, I might add.
P12:35:08 <Prow> But still, a bit serious
P12:35:15 <Isak> Dynamic shadows look great.
P12:35:17 <ZomBuster>  <Nalok> We need a bone pile block
P12:35:20 <Isak> Can't wait to see a dungeon survival map.
P12:35:23 <ZomBuster> lol I made one
P12:35:24 <bildramer> :P
P12:35:25 <vede> The whole world is made of colorful blocks, and the whole goal is to build little houses and stuff.
P12:35:28 <Iguana> Let's hope Dock doesn't screw up. I know he won't, but there's a chance. D:
P12:35:34 <Jat> i really hope notch removes the ambient lighting though in the dark
P12:35:38 <Prow> Little houses?
P12:35:38 <Drakkar> nah he won't
P12:35:40 <vede> The game is basically a small child's game.
P12:35:46 <Drakkar> dock is professional
P12:35:47 <ZomBuster> I replaced the gold block for bones in my dino theme set
P12:35:49 <Isak> I don't like the tree lighting. I love the underground lighting, though.
P12:35:53 <Iguana> vede, that's why I play it.
P12:35:54 <Jat> i dont like how you can still see stuff even when it should be completely dark
P12:35:56 <Iguana> I win. :D
P12:35:59 <vede> Same here, Iguana.
P12:36:00 <bildramer> :P
P12:36:01 <vede> :D
P12:36:13 <Isak> :D Minecraft is so awesome.
P12:36:24 <ZomBuster> Jat it's still pretty hard to see things
P12:36:25 <vede> Jat, I like how you can still see stuff where it should be pitch black, but I do think it should be a little darker.
13P12:36:27 * bildramer gets seriousness pills
P12:36:28 <Iguana> I'm a little 14 year old boy. :P

P12:36:30 <Prow> WELL, WE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT
P12:36:39 <Isak> Why did Notch review borderlands badly... I know I'm getting it this christmas.
P12:36:40 <bildramer> CAPS YEAH. Ahem.
P12:36:41 <Isak> :(
P12:36:45 <vede> I don't ever want my screen to become straight blackness, but I want to have to really strain occasionally.
P12:36:56 <ZomBuster> I already have that
P12:36:59 <SMP> i cant even play the indev :(, it freezes if i move
P12:37:01 <Shadaez> Borderlands sucks
P12:37:02 <Isak> I'm a PC Junkie.
P12:37:02 <ZomBuster> maybe my screen is a bit darker
P12:37:05 <bildramer> making the whole game black seems nice
P12:37:06 <Prow> I have a totally legal borderlands, trust me. TOTALLY LEGAL.
P12:37:11 <Prow> and yeah. It's very good
P12:37:12 <Isak> Hehe.
P12:37:15 <Vic> borderlands is great
P12:37:17 <vede> I have a legit copy of Borderlands.
P12:37:21 <Isak> I've only pirated old/indie games.
P12:37:23 <Isak> Like Trine
P12:37:25 <Isak> >_>
P12:37:27 <Vic> Trine's fun
P12:37:28 <Cial> borderlands is great i didnt find a revolver till i was Lv.16 or so
P12:37:31 <vede> YOU PIRATE INDIE GAMES?
P12:37:32 <Shadaez> You pirate indie games? :/
P12:37:35 <Isak> In no way is trine $30.
P12:37:36 <vede> What the hell is wrong with you?
P12:37:40 <Vic> PIRATING INDIE GAMES
P12:37:40 <gear|phone> I love borderlands
P12:37:41 <Isak> Minecraft was SO worth the $15./
P12:37:42 <Prow> Indie games are awesome
P12:37:47 <Prow> It was worth 50PLN
P12:37:58 <Prow> that is minecraft
10P12:37:59 * MysteryGuy (Mibbit@bl16-114-222.dsl.telepac.pt) has joined #minecraft
P12:37:59 <Jat> in survival you could have torches you can carry around for lighting instead of needing ambient lighting in the caves
P12:38:05 <Vic> 50 pln is a lot
P12:38:07 <Isak> i also pirated World of Goo (It sucks pirated. I want the real one.)
P12:38:08 <Vic> but hell, it's worth it
P12:38:11 <Prow> Yeah
P12:38:16 <Vic> world of goo
P12:38:16 <Shadaez> Isak, they are the exact same.
P12:38:16 <Quatroking> burn
P12:38:18 <SMP> world of goo sucks period
P12:38:18 <Shadaez> There is no DRM
P12:38:19 <Prow> You could buy orange box for that money
P12:38:20 <Isak> No.
P12:38:20 <Vic> its a fun nice game
P12:38:21 <vede> Jat, but if you end up in a cave without one, you're essentially *fucked*.
P12:38:22 <Vic> buuuut
P12:38:26 <Quatroking> I have world of goo legal, TWICE
P12:38:27 <Isak> No internet connection on the pirated version.
P12:38:27 <MysteryGuy> I bought World of Goo when it was on sale for a Custom Price ^^
P12:38:28 <Jat> dig up
P12:38:29 <Shadaez> You should have bought it for $.25.
P12:38:30 <Vic> i don't like world of goo that much
P12:38:40 <Jat> but thats what makes it fun
P12:38:41 <Isak> I KNOW! My parents didn't think it was real.
P12:38:42 <Shadaez> Isak, yes there is...
P12:38:52 <Jat> going into a cave will be a risk you have to make sure you have enough torches to last
P12:38:55 <Jat> and they would run out
P12:38:57 <MysteryGuy> Crazy prices these days...
P12:39:05 <MysteryGuy> I don't have a credit card but I have paypal
P12:39:05 <Isak> MW2 was not worth $60.
P12:39:09 <vede> I don't want the risk to become the loss of fun.
P12:39:10 <Vic> mw2 sucks
P12:39:10 <Prow> Yeah
P12:39:14 <Vic> its overhyped
P12:39:15 <Isak> And I bought it on steam.
P12:39:17 <Prow> Nah, i think it's pretty good.
P12:39:18 <Isak> So no returns.
13P12:39:18 * bildramer thinks there's one single thing that makes games good
P12:39:20 <ZomBuster> activision are dicks price wise
P12:39:25 <Shadaez> World of goo is the exact same pirated or not.
P12:39:27 <Jat> i guessi  dunno
P12:39:27 <bildramer> never getting bored of them :D
P12:39:29 <vede> Fumbling around in extreme darkness is good, but fumbling around in pure black is just futile.
P12:39:30 <ZomBuster> they lower the price with %10 after a year
P12:39:32 <Prow> But god! Too short! 
P12:39:34 <vede> ie. notfun
P12:39:37 <Aeomin> Nice one bild...
P12:39:42 <Jat> but why not just turn up your monitors brightness then? :|
P12:39:49 <Isak> The worst games I own: MW2, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Prototype, and MAYBE Halo 2.
P12:40:00 <Vic> prototype?
P12:40:00 <PuyoDead> MW2 is the equivalent of a big budget hollywood movie. It's the "must have" thing at the time, hyped to hell and back. But 6 months from now, nobody will care.
P12:40:11 <Isak> Avatar will forever be epic.
P12:40:11 <Vic> exactly, PD
P12:40:23 <Shadaez> Avatar was never "epic"
P12:40:26 <Vic> isak: *six months later*
P12:40:29 <VurtualRuler98> What game is BTTF then?
P12:40:34 <Isak> I'll still love it 6 months later.
P12:40:36 <ZomBuster> BTTF?
P12:40:38 <Nalok> Vegas 2 was good, get out
P12:40:40 <Shadaez> back to the future?
P12:40:42 <VurtualRuler98> Back To The Future yeah.
P12:40:43 <Isak> Vegas 2 Multiplayer sucks.
P12:40:49 <Vic> but yeah, prototype
P12:40:51 <Isak> The gunshots repeat endlessly.
P12:40:54 <Isak> It's just ear-rape.
P12:40:55 <Prow> I wish i'd havent buy Left 4 Dead
P12:40:55 <Vic> i heard people say good things about it
P12:41:05 <ZomBuster> terrorist hunt is pretty cool
P12:41:05 <Isak> I actually played the original L4D more than L4D2.
P12:41:09 <VurtualRuler98> RAINBOW SIX IS ONLY RAINBOW SIX IF YOU CAN SPEND HOURS PLANNING YOUR MISSION THROUGH A 3D BUILDING.
P12:41:09 <Nalok> MP sucks but SP is great
P12:41:10 <Prow> It's good but after a year they released L4D2
P12:41:14 <ZomBuster> its like L4D with terrorists
P12:41:16 <Prow> That they are going to update
P12:41:17 <Iguana> I hear Terrorist hunt
P12:41:22 <vede> Worst game I own is Borderlands.
P12:41:23 <Iguana> I am thinking R6V2
P12:41:30 <Isak> I played over 700 Hours of L4D.
P12:41:31 <Vic> no borderlands is great get out
P12:41:32 <Iguana> Vede, do you like it though?
P12:41:35 <Vic> !!!!!
P12:41:37 <vede> No, I don't.
P12:41:41 <Isak> I've only played like 40 on the sequel.
P12:41:43 <Iguana> And why is that?
P12:41:43 <Prow> Vic is angry
P12:41:47 <VurtualRuler98> oh nooo people are losing power here
P12:42:00 <Prow> TYPE INTO THE KEYBOARD FASTER
P12:42:01 <vede> Because the PC version sucked, and I played it on the PC.
P12:42:08 <Isak> Everyone get on steam and see what game you've played the most hours of
P12:42:17 <Prow> Team Fortress 2
P12:42:18 <Vic> mine is definitely tf2
P12:42:19 <PuyoDead> I already know, TF2
P12:42:20 <Prow> because i know it
P12:42:25 <Prow> without looking
P12:42:26 <Vic> hivemind
P12:42:27 <Isak> TF2 is fun, I just suck at it.
P12:42:31 <Prow> HA-HA
P12:42:33 <Prow> Let's laugh
P12:42:42 <Vic> yes let's laugh at him for sucking at tf2
P12:42:43 <Isak> I've played 101 hours of MW2.
P12:42:45 <Prow> Yes
P12:42:47 <Vic> because that's the trendy thing to do
P12:42:47 <Isak> Lvl 27Prestige.
P12:42:49 <VurtualRuler98> Source SDK
P12:42:56 <Vic> lol source mods
P12:42:56 <Isak> I get bored a lot.
P12:42:58 <Jat> wat
P12:43:00 <PuyoDead> I've put far more hours into console games, though.
P12:43:02 <Prow> Not source mods
P12:43:07 <vede> And then there's the other PC games I have that are good games, but they're behind the wall of stupid-ass publishers.
P12:43:10 <Prow> He is MAKING 
P12:43:10 <Iguana> Thing I've played the most is CSS, and that's only because I have a clan to attend to,
P12:43:13 <Prow> em or something
P12:43:15 <Iguana> And I've only played 200 hours or so.
P12:43:18 <Isak> I spent 21 hours on BAA!
P12:43:21 <VurtualRuler98> Followed by Garry's Mod, then ArmA 2, then Half-Life 2.
P12:43:26 <Isak> That's awesome for a singleplayer game!
P12:43:29 <Vic> gmod is amazing
P12:43:32 <VurtualRuler98> I don't recall spending 235 hours in HL2.
P12:43:41 <Vic> there's no fucking way anyone's gonna say gmod sucks
P12:43:43 <Iguana> I spend like 40 hours, and never touched it since.
P12:43:48 <Isak> Ah, my bad. Not 700 hours.
P12:43:50 <Koitenshin> gmod sucks
P12:43:51 <Iguana> Gmod sucks if you don't ahve mods.
P12:43:52 <Isak> 150 hours of L4D.
P12:43:55 <Iguana> I find. But that's me.
P12:43:56 <VurtualRuler98> Vic, go ask the stupider halo fanboys.
P12:43:56 <Vic> well, yeah
13P12:43:57 * Koitenshin doesn't have it. :(
P12:44:02 <Isak> I've played DAYS of the original L4D.
P12:44:03 <Vic> ...you got me there vr
P12:44:16 <VurtualRuler98> Also, Garry's Mod is still awesome without mods.
P12:44:16 <Iguana> Lul Halo.
P12:44:16 <vede> Red Faction: Guerrilla wanted me to confirm that I owned the game by EMAIL, Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2142 had to query the EA master server TWICE before I could even play multiplayer.

P12:45:43 <vede> Um, playing an FPS with a controller when you could use a mouse seems... stupid.
P12:45:44 <Isak> EVERYONE SAY YOUR STEAM ACCOUNT!
P12:45:48 <Iguana> Perfect Dark?!
P12:45:49 <Vic> why people think its comfortable 
P12:45:52 <VurtualRuler98> VurtualRuler98
P12:45:53 <Iguana> I love Perfect Dark. :D
P12:45:53 <PuyoDead> Goldeneye is an exception
P12:45:54 <Prow> hm
P12:45:54 <VurtualRuler98> WHAT DO I WIN
P12:45:56 <Isak> rutamin
P12:45:57 <Vic> 007 is an exception
P12:46:03 <vede> I hate controllers.
P12:46:09 <Iguana> What about Perfect Dark?
P12:46:09 <Isak> They like it because they get Auto-Aiming
P12:46:15 <VurtualRuler98> Actually pretty much most of the bond games can be played with a controller.
P12:46:15 <vede> When I use them they just feel like malformed lumps of plastic.
P12:46:30 <Vic> lol they cant aim
P12:46:35 <Isak> The ONLY game I _Need_ a controller for is RE5.
13P12:46:38 * bildramer thinks Notch actually plans using the torches, since there are bugfixes for them
P12:46:38 <Vic> i have a ps2 controller

P12:46:50 <VurtualRuler98> All shall fear my spaceship.
P12:47:13 <VurtualRuler98> Anyways yeah, controllers are lame.
P12:47:17 <VurtualRuler98> Real men use joysticks.
P12:47:20 <Iguana> :P
P12:47:21 <PuyoDead> Controllers are fully dependent on what the game is. Difficult concept, I know.
P12:47:31 <Isak> I am getting a gaming mouse and keyboard.
P12:47:34 <VurtualRuler98> I drive cars with a trim wheel.
P12:47:35 <Jat> i like controllers much more than joysticks

P12:53:56 <Jat> ill stick to dungeon keeper
P12:53:58 <Isak> I looked up a manual
P12:54:02 <Isak> And still didn't understand it.
P12:54:12 <Skillkills95> Dungeon Keeper ftw
P12:54:14 <Vic> i used a great tutorial
P12:54:38 <VurtualRuler98> Isak, take The Sims, but mix in strategy, base building, combat, and simulation of: civilizations, weather, fluids, creature migration, and gore.

P12:54:50 <Isak> Eh.
P12:54:54 <Jat> i wonder if we will be able to add bots with scripting when it is added... with customizable new models that could be really cool
P12:54:54 <Isak> I'm not a strategy game guy.

P4:10:10 <DethDonald> THose were made by Capcom right?
P4:10:20 <PuyoDead> Well, co-developed, but yea.
P4:10:22 <Shadaez> Are you serious or joking?
P4:10:26 <Shadaez> wut
P4:10:27 <Super-Dot> Yeah, I thought Christmachinima only needed to be in the topic to fill up spots
P4:10:33 <Jat> are they actually good games? i just sort of assumed they werent very good when they came out
P4:10:40 <Jat> if theyre good ill get the roms
P4:10:45 <Jat> maybe
P4:10:51 <PuyoDead> Kind of like how Minish Cap was with Capcom, too.
P4:10:56 <DethDonald> I have seasons

P4:11:28 <Animator> Listen to it.
P4:11:29 <Ten_Tacles> i played it
P4:11:31 <Jat> are oracle of seasons and time good?
P4:11:34 <Shadaez> I havn't playhed minish either. I shall get it.
P4:11:43 <PuyoDead> Jat, the Oracle games are actually really good.
P4:11:49 <Jat> oh ok cool
P4:11:52 <Jat> then i guess i should try them
P4:12:00 <VurtualRuler98> minish cap is on my list of games that are only worth it if it's free or with a bunch of other games.
P4:12:00 <Jat> i was kinda wondering what game i should play next
P4:12:02 <Shadaez> They're both basically the same, so just play though one.
P4:12:03 <DethDonald> I need to get back into Zelda
P4:12:03 <PuyoDead> Minish Cap is a little different, but it's still pretty good.
P4:12:46 <DethDonald> I borrowed Twilight from a friend
P4:12:52 <PuyoDead> I'm sorry.

P4:13:17 <PuyoDead> They kind of link, too.
P4:13:20 <Quatroking> aaaand installed
P4:13:25 <Jat> yeah i forgot how they linked though
P4:13:43 <PuyoDead> You'll get codes in one game that'll get you things in the other. And finishing one changes things in the other, etc.
P4:13:47 <Shadaez> I sitll have a gameboy cable.
P4:13:54 <PuyoDead> I have a few, heh.
P4:13:56 <Jat> oh ok cool
P4:14:18 <Quatroking> are we talking about the legend of zelda series on the GBC
P4:14:23 <Quatroking> oracle of seasons and ages
P4:14:27 <PuyoDead> The oracle ones, specifically.
P4:14:29 <DethDonald> SO are any of the DS Zeldas worth picking up
P4:14:29 <Jat> which game should i play first?
P4:14:38 <PuyoDead> The DS ones are... decent.
P4:14:38 <Quatroking> Hmm
P4:14:38 <bildramer> ...?
P4:14:52 <Quatroking> I played seasons first
P4:14:55 <PuyoDead> They're not really bad, per se, but they're not quite at the level of some of the others.
P4:14:55 <Quatroking> pretty cool
P4:14:57 <bildramer> free or wish-it-was-free for me :p
P4:15:07 <Quatroking> the oracle series are one of a kind
P4:15:13 <Shadaez> DS ones suck. 
P4:15:17 <Shadaez> IMO.
P4:15:18 <Quatroking> yup
P4:15:19 <Snowman> Quatroking, how many games have you bought in the holiday sale?
P4:15:23 <PuyoDead> Compared to the other ones? Yea.
P4:15:30 <DethDonald> I guess I need to dig out Seasons
P4:15:47 <Quatroking> Only one so far
P4:15:47 <Quatroking> I'm waiting for my paycheck

P4:16:39 <PuyoDead> I liked Ages better, personally, but it doesn't really matter which you go through first.
P4:16:39 <Shadaez> Mirror's Edge isn't that good. It's been $5 at my local Half Price Books for a while :V
P4:16:44 <Jat> oh ok
P4:16:53 <Marach> thats got to be a record, 6 contenders eliminated in one race

P4:47:55 <Snowman> Had that like 7 years ago
P4:48:00 <Snowman> PuyoDead, L4D1
P4:48:02 <VurtualRuler98> PuyoDead, Left 4 Dead.
P4:48:08 <VurtualRuler98> Actually that's about it the.
P4:48:15 <VurtualRuler98> But it was amazing being able to see your legs.
P4:48:17 <PuyoDead> Ahh, haven't played that much.
P4:48:19 <VurtualRuler98> Oh, ArmA 2.

P4:50:35 <mail2345> real life is wayy too hard
P4:50:39 <gordenfreechmen> some people believe as you end that first life, you forget about it and start a new one

P4:51:48 <Shadaez> I WANTED TO TELL HIM MAIL
P4:51:51 <mail2345> add &override=false
P4:51:53 <mail2345> or was it true
P4:51:54 <Shadaez> Add &override=true

P4:52:14 <mail2345|afk> what is your router?
P4:52:14 <Shadaez> Try again.
P4:52:17 <N00b> ill ask
P4:52:42 <Shadaez> Right after I put my server up I have problems as well, maybe your ports aren't forwarded correctly? Can others join it?
P4:52:49 <N00b> yeah
P4:52:54 <N00b> all my friends play in it
P4:53:00 <N00b> i just cant seem to get on
P4:53:39 <Shadaez> custom client?
P4:53:45 <N00b> yeah 
P4:53:48 <N00b> have that
P4:53:57 <N00b> i tried in the browser and on that
P4:54:00 <Shadaez> Does it just disconnect or not load?
P4:54:13 <N00b> it gives that servers down message
P4:54:28 <Shadaez> Your router may suck balls.
P4:54:46 <Shadaez> If you turn verify names off, you could connect.
P4:54:52 <Shadaez> That sucks though.
P4:54:58 <N00b> maybe because at my parents house when I set up a server on that network we could always access it on the LAN
P4:55:03 <N00b> I turned that off
P4:55:06 <N00b> still no luck

P5:03:17 <N00b> i was gonna do the one where the IP is in the URL
P5:03:21 <Shadaez> No idea why.. Why did Notch switch the connecting system?
P5:03:26 <N00b> and replace the public IP with the internal one

P5:46:23 <Snowman> lol @ 1:12
P5:46:43 <AlexVMiner> it isn't a tnt glitch
P5:46:49 <AlexVMiner> notch put it in there on purpose
P5:46:56 <AlexVMiner> and i discovered it first
P5:47:03 <AlexVMiner> <:D
P5:47:04 <Snowman> Glitch?

P5:47:52 <Darkebrz> It isnt a glitch
P5:47:54 <AlexVMiner> too long to asplain
P5:47:54 <Aeomin> okay, too much fire, client free
P5:47:56 <Darkebrz> How did you not read that
P5:47:59 <vede> TNT does a flood fill with wood.
P5:48:08 <Snowman> lol
P5:48:11 <vede> (2d flood-fill, on the horizontal)
P5:48:51 <serp> why?
P5:49:01 <AlexVMiner> notch put it in
P5:49:03 <Aeomin> probably test something
P5:49:04 <AlexVMiner> for a reason i forget
P5:49:16 <Shadaez> to test waterfalls
P5:49:24 <serp> waterfalls??
P5:49:26 <Darkebrz> I still don't see why he wont put in replace :/

P5:50:42 <Darkebrz> I just want a replace function
P5:51:00 <serp> what would a replace function do?

P5:51:10 <bildramer> :l
P5:51:15 <bildramer> true
P5:51:15 <Darkebrz> You would select a block to change, click, and it would change to whatever block you want
P5:51:31 <Darkebrz> The current delete and then rebuild thing is comlpletely unneeded.
P5:51:39 <serp> i agree
P5:51:39 <Snowman> Like the paint function on the archives
P5:51:45 <Darkebrz> Snowman, exactly like that.

P6:08:29 <Evilgrim> Yo.
P6:08:36 <vede> Ezekiel, try #theonemcft
P6:08:37 <Evilgrim> Zeke.. Your name is familiar.

P6:08:43 <Evilgrim> And yeah. Do as Vede says.
P6:08:43 <Ezekiel> thanks
P6:08:50 <Quatroking> Ezekiel, CAD reference.
P6:08:56 <Animator> Seriously, if the Dock-hate continues (especially incredibly trollish ones), there shall be bans.
P6:09:09 <Quatroking> Ezekiel what are you doing here maaan
P6:09:09 <vede> Animator, define "Dock-hate".
P6:09:16 <AndrewPH> I like his logo art
P6:09:17 <Quatroking> You're missing the wedding
P6:09:22 <AndrewPH> Needs to be a bit more blocky
P6:09:23 <vede> Because, uh, I really don't like his logo.
P6:09:27 <bildramer> :/
P6:09:29 <Animator> Mochi's petition, insults at him, etc.
P6:09:30 <bildramer> guys
P6:09:37 <vede> Oh.
P6:09:39 <bildramer> he's here since some weeks only, I guess
P6:09:46 <JoeyJo0> Dock is a cool guy, eh makes art and doesn't afraid of anything.
P6:09:49 <vede> Wouldn't we ban anyone for insults and such?
P6:09:50 <Quatroking> I've suggested Dock to make the logo less curfy using curved corners
P6:09:51 <Animator> Something that doesn't fall under respectable constructive criticism.
P6:09:57 <Animator> Yeah, we would.
P6:10:00 <Quatroking> he accepted it pretty good and is looking into it
P6:10:06 <vede> Mmkay.
P6:10:07 <byte[]> http://copy.bplaced.net/mc/obsidian3.png

P6:10:22 <byte[]> looks like that
P6:10:23 <Snowman> Why is it called obsidian?
P6:10:30 <Snowman> It has no obsidian whatsoever
P6:10:32 <byte[]> it's the name of my server
P6:10:42 <PuyoDead> Not liking his logo isn't a problem. I mean, it's an opinion. But stuff like Ten_Tacles saying "your stuff sucks and I'll never like it", and Mochi being a downright idiot...
P6:10:55 <Animator> And pubby8.
P6:11:01 <bildramer> ^^ && ^
P6:11:03 <PuyoDead> These people seem unable to understand what "constructive critisism" means.
P6:11:04 <Snowman> I just don't like anime

P6:11:42 <vede> The cheeks you can find in almost any TV show character directed at small children.

P6:11:58 <Quatroking> I'm so happy Dock is working with Notch
P6:12:05 <Evilgrim>  I don't mind Dock's style.. Sure it's not what I visioned minecraft in the future.. But if he gets rid of the cheek line puffy things. I'll be happy.
P6:12:09 <byte[]> Quatroking: yeah me too
P6:12:12 <bildramer> make it x + y * previous_value % z
P6:12:16 <bildramer> oh

P6:12:24 <Quatroking> Because really, I have illustrations of him in BOOKS i own
P6:12:31 <Quatroking> I own games he worked on!
P6:12:33 <bildramer> :D
P6:12:48 <Quatroking> HE WORKED WITH CHRIS SAWYER DUDE!
P6:12:57 <Quatroking> really short but he did!
P6:13:00 <bildramer> Quatroking: example of a nice person of the community
P6:13:06 <bildramer> some times :|
P6:13:08 <PuyoDead> *crickets*
P6:13:11 <vede> I think having a less blocky model will help Minecraft quite a bit in the character customization department (and the visual department), but only if Notch implements a way to interchange parts of the model, like boots, gloves, et cetera.
P6:13:22 <bildramer> AW NOES
P6:13:26 <Quatroking> am I that example or is Dock the example, bildramer
P6:13:30 <bildramer> That will be almost like Roblox

P6:14:26 <PuyoDead> Dock actually said that we'll probably have options of things like gloves and such. And really, why wouldn't we? They both know that's one of the things people like the most.

P8:55:31 <DethDonald> I was so excited that it was coming out in 2009
P8:55:38 <VurtualRuler98> Because Half-Life wasn't a 100 metacritic score, game of the year-given 50 times, and considered the game that made modding what it is for being a mindless shooter.
P8:55:40 <Lmaoboat> ITC: Nostalgia lenses 
P8:55:46 <charrr> FO3 is insanely open ended, while FO1 has great story and atmosphere
P8:55:58 <VurtualRuler98> charrr, YOU CANNOT GO THIS WAY
P8:56:06 <VurtualRuler98> Oh look a building try walking over here NOPE DENIED
P8:56:06 <AndrewPH> Gravity Gun
P8:56:08 <Eagle> Lmaoboat, I still play Half-Life a lot
P8:56:08 <AndrewPH> 'nuff said
P8:56:13 <VurtualRuler98> AndrewPH, that's hl2
P8:56:27 <DethDonald> Chainsaw Gravity Gun
P8:56:28 <AndrewPH> HL2 is more fun than HL1
P8:56:29 <AndrewPH> imo
P8:56:29 <VurtualRuler98> HL1 has the raw science anti-tank laser rifle and acrobatic combat weapon, or Tau Cannon.
P8:56:34 <AndrewPH> they're both awesome though
P8:56:37 <Lmaoboat> I really regret installing that FO3 mid that added tons of guns
P8:56:43 <AndrewPH> HL1 can be completed in less than an hour :D
P8:56:52 <Lmaoboat> They went way overboard with the weapons
P8:56:52 <Snowman> It can be completed in 24 minutes
P8:57:00 <VurtualRuler98> AndrewPH, but then you can't stop and listen to Nuclaer Mission Jam.
P8:57:01 <AndrewPH> The record is 31 minutes
P8:57:03 <Eagle> AndrewPH is you abuse the momentum a fuckton
P8:57:05 <AndrewPH> roughly
P8:57:05 <Eagle> then yes
P8:57:06 <Eagle> haha
P8:57:09 <Snowman> I meant 29
P8:57:14 <Snowman> 29 is record
P8:57:17 <Eagle> *if

P8:59:51 <Eagle> So wait
P8:59:51 <Snowman> Best song ever
P9:00:00 <Eagle> where's that one guy who said that HL was a mindless shooter
P9:00:09 <Snowman> It's ecrider
P9:00:12 <VurtualRuler98> THEY DO NOT EXIST
P9:00:21 <VurtualRuler98> Everyone who insults it will gradually play it.
P9:00:25 <VurtualRuler98> Then they take it back
P9:00:40 <Eagle> I think that ecrider has in fact not played any of the HL games
P9:00:55 <Snowman> Everyone who thinks Half-Life is bad has either not played it, or not played it very long
P9:00:58 <VurtualRuler98> Or he's not nice, and like my friend who has no attention
P9:01:00 <Jat> i liked hl1 more than hl2

P9:01:09 <charrr> I have played HL all the way to Zen
P9:01:10 <VurtualRuler98> He didn't know half-life had a plot.
P9:01:13 <VurtualRuler98> He beat all the games.
P9:01:20 <VurtualRuler98> charrr, no you didn't.

P9:01:50 <Snowman> Both the normal version as well as Source version
P9:01:51 <charrr> yeah, Xen
P9:01:56 <Eagle> HL1 had a very hard-to-notice plot
P9:02:07 <Jat> hl1 didnt need a plot
P9:02:10 <charrr> Haven't played it in a while
P9:02:11 <Jat> it was awesome as it was
P9:02:12 <VurtualRuler98> In order to destroy the end of On A Rail mg emplacement... you must BECOME the On A Rail mg emplacement.
P9:02:12 <Snowman> Hl1 has a plot that isn't directly told through cutscenes
P9:02:15 <VurtualRuler98> Eagle, HL2.
P9:02:18 <Eagle> pretty much SCIENCE > ALIENS > MILITARY > ALIENS
P9:02:22 <VurtualRuler98> He didn't know who anyone was, or what had happened.
P9:02:24 <AndrewPH> SCIENCE
P9:02:25 <AndrewPH> !
P9:02:33 <VurtualRuler98> Somehow he missed it all
P9:02:34 <Iguana> Eagle WRONG.
P9:02:39 <Jat> also hl2s storyline aws kind of boring
P9:02:41 <AndrewPH> SCIENCE!
P9:02:45 <Iguana> IGUANA >  SCIENCE > ALIENS > MILITARY > ALIENS
P9:02:55 <Iguana> Jat, I found it okay.
P9:02:55 <VurtualRuler98> He had no idea who Alyx was.
P9:02:57 <Eagle> Those weren't greater-than signs
P9:03:00 <Eagle> those were arrows
P9:03:04 <AndrewPH> Aliens and monsters are attacking my place!
P9:03:04 <Iguana> TOO BAD.
P9:03:06 <Jat> alyx was pretty annoying anyway
P9:03:10 <Eagle> showing the progression of the plot
P9:03:11 <Iguana> I changed mine into greater than signs.

P9:03:17 <Jat> gordon freeman does not need a love itnerest
P9:03:18 <DethDonald> Science owns
P9:03:25 <Iguana> Best plot ever, is any horror movie.
P9:03:32 <VurtualRuler98> Jat, Gordon has no love interes.
P9:03:33 <Iguana> Or any movie by Jackie Chan.
P9:03:41 <VurtualRuler98> Alyx does, but you're Gordon Freeman.
P9:03:43 <Iguana> Jackie Chan movies are repetitive.
P9:03:43 <Jat> isnt alyx supposed to be a love interest of some sort?
P9:03:46 <Snowman> Train ride -> Experiment -> OSHI- -> KILLKILLKILL -> KILL SOME MOOOOOOOOOOORE -> Defeat endboss
P9:03:47 <VurtualRuler98> Yeah
P9:03:49 <Eagle> So anyways, the Gauss Gun shoots SCIENCE
P9:03:50 <VurtualRuler98> But not for you.
P9:03:50 <Iguana> Alyx likes blind dudes.
P9:03:52 <Iguana> Lawl.
P9:03:58 <Jat> well shes still annoying
P9:03:59 <DethDonald> Freeman should be homosexual
P9:04:02 <Jat> too bad you cant shoot her
P9:04:05 <Snowman> Include puzzles in there
P9:04:06 <Iguana> Deth, alternate ending?
P9:04:07 <VurtualRuler98> Jat, she's the best sidekick AI ever.
P9:04:07 <Iguana> :D
P9:04:19 <Jat> not when shes talking
P9:04:20 <VurtualRuler98> Seriously, they put a huge amount of work into making her into a proper ally.
P9:04:36 <VurtualRuler98> Also, Valve abuses "girl with cheesy jokes" thing.
P9:04:40 <Jat> the ai may be good but i still dont really like listening to her talk
P9:04:48 <DethDonald> I actualy like Alyx
P9:04:48 <VurtualRuler98> And in EP1, at the bars, her animations break.
P9:04:56 <VurtualRuler98> Seriously.
P9:05:02 <VurtualRuler98> Go to the ep1 map where you get the little wheel.
P9:05:09 <Jat> i dont have ep1
P9:05:13 <Eagle> Tram ride -> Experiment -> OH SHI- -> ALIENS -> GOVERNMENT COVERUP -> KILL -> SCIENCE! -> Annoying TELEPORTATION PUZZLES -> Xen
P9:05:14 <Iguana> Jackie Chan Movie: Vacation > Guy steals his GF > Finds him but they run off > Ransom > Gun battle > Sidekick dies > Epicly avenges > Makes out with Gf > Flash forward ----- ALTERNATE ENDING: His sidekick comes back to life
P9:05:18 <VurtualRuler98> Look at her animations, she may end up just having a generic talking face and standing without emotion.
P9:05:22 <Iguana> I'm not even kidding when I wrote that out.
P9:05:27 <Iguana> Watch any Jackie Chan movie. o.o

P9:05:43 <Eagle> Alyx was unneeded
P9:05:47 <Jat> yes
P9:05:49 <Eagle> Her dad is a cool guy though
P9:05:50 <VurtualRuler98> Alyx was needed.
P9:05:57 <VurtualRuler98> You need to have a main character that you aren't.
P9:06:00 <VurtualRuler98> Half-Life had Gordon.
P9:06:08 <DethDonald> I liked Alyx more than any other sidekick ever!
P9:06:12 <Jat> i like being gordon freeman, lone badass not gordon freeman, my friends babysitter
P9:06:22 <VurtualRuler98> Half-Life 2 had Gordon, his friends, the resistance, Alyx, and they all worked to fight an enemy.
P9:06:25 <VurtualRuler98> A faceless monster.
P9:06:33 <Jat> it had a face
P9:06:36 <Jat> it was just a weird face
P9:06:45 <Eagle> It was covered up by science
P9:06:46 <VurtualRuler98> flurlrpflrplfllllllllrrrrr
P9:06:51 <VurtualRuler98> That's what it says.
P9:07:02 <VurtualRuler98> flurlp is one syllable btw.
P9:07:11 <DethDonald> My friend just told me that he still hasnt beaten HL2
P9:07:19 <Iguana> It's boring enough, not to.
P9:07:20 <Eagle> also it they're so technology dependant that they are floating slugs of fat
P9:07:26 <Iguana> Only reason I have it, is because of mods.
P9:07:29 <Iguana> WITH STORYLINES.
P9:07:45 <VurtualRuler98> Tell him "flurlp'flp flrplp flrprlrllrlrlll"
P9:07:55 <Iguana> :/
P9:07:58 <VurtualRuler98> Their floating isn't their technology dude.
P9:08:04 <VurtualRuler98> They're floating maggots.
P9:08:12 <Jat> hl2 should be open ended enough to let you kill your allies
P9:08:13 <VurtualRuler98> Purring maggots that fly, and are psychic.
P9:08:18 <VurtualRuler98> Jat, it didn't work out.
P9:08:25 <VurtualRuler98> People would be killed, ruining a trigger.
P9:08:31 <Eagle> The developer handbook thing said that they didn't used to be floating fat slugs
P9:08:31 <VurtualRuler98> Or you'd end up shooting them on accident
P9:08:35 <Jat> then just make alyx killable
P9:08:42 <VurtualRuler98> Alyx is most triggers.
P9:08:46 <Eagle> it's just that thousands of years of technology dependance made them that way
P9:08:47 <Jat> then fix the game D:<
P9:08:52 <VurtualRuler98> Like, 70% of the people doing something for you is her.
P9:09:16 <VurtualRuler98> Combine are humans from the future.
P9:09:26 <Eagle> G-man is Gordon's father
P9:09:27 <Jat> the combine have time travel?
P9:09:27 <VurtualRuler98> Who started out as the resistance.
P9:09:34 <VurtualRuler98> G-Man is Alyx.
P9:09:41 <Eagle> Who is also Gordon's father
P9:09:45 <Eagle> and son
P9:09:48 <VurtualRuler98> Future-Gordon has Alyx hire past Gordon.
P9:09:48 <DethDonald> COmbine are just enhanced humans
P9:09:52 <Jat> its the hioly trinity
P9:09:58 <VurtualRuler98> DethDonald, well, their ground troops are.
P9:10:03 <VurtualRuler98> Their new, beta tested troops.
P9:10:08 <VurtualRuler98> They aren't even as good as USMC.
P9:10:14 <DethDonald> yeah thats what I meant
P9:10:18 <Eagle> Gordon and Alyx (G-man) had a son who went back in time and became Gordon's father

P9:11:01 <VurtualRuler98> There is an EP3.
P9:11:05 <Miclee> Wow, people are still waiting for EP3???
P9:11:07 <VurtualRuler98> It's considered a HL2 sequel.
P9:11:15 <VurtualRuler98> Miclee, Valve has to do lots of engine upgrades to do what they want.
P9:11:20 <DethDonald> I work for Valve I know!

P9:11:28 <VurtualRuler98> Like, lots.

P9:11:56 <Iguana> Miclee, :D
P9:11:59 <VurtualRuler98> They've been doing L4D1 since CSS was out guys.
P9:12:03 <Eagle> Well, that was a modified Source engine, I mean
P9:12:03 <VurtualRuler98> No wait, maybe before.
P9:12:06 <Eagle> Look at HL2
P9:12:14 <DethDonald> there is no EP3 only Left 4 Dead 3
P9:12:15 <Eagle> and to a degree the episodes
P9:12:24 <VurtualRuler98> HL2 is the oldest version of Source that is Source still.
P9:12:32 <VurtualRuler98> EP2 and L4D2 are the newest.
P9:12:34 <Eagle> Compared to like, the unreal engine
P9:12:40 <VurtualRuler98> Unreal sucks though.
P9:12:46 <Snowman> TF2 and L4D2 are the newest
P9:12:46 <Eagle> That's not the point. :P
P9:12:49 <VurtualRuler98> And it's ugly.

P9:12:59 <VurtualRuler98> EP2, TF2, and L4D2.
P9:13:07 <VurtualRuler98> Since EP2 is the newest HL2.
P9:13:08 <Iguana> Unreal DOES NOT suck.
P9:13:10 <Iguana> I like it.
P9:13:44 <DethDonald> Valve are already developing Left 4 Dead 3
P9:13:54 <DethDonald> I know, I work for them

P10:49:23 <Miclee> This is made with Drupal -> http://theclee.co.cc/
P10:49:51 <mail2345> dammit
P10:49:59 <mail2345> yang
P10:50:04 <mail2345> is spamming missiles
P10:50:09 <mail2345> everywhere
P10:50:12 <mail2345> for no random reason
P10:50:17 <mail2345> every unit is at risk of being hit
P10:50:24 <mail2345> and every base is at risk of being spammed
P10:50:24 <Super-Dot> Miclee your site says "html" eight times in the first six lines
P10:50:43 <Miclee> Source is automatically converted to HTML. -_-
P10:50:54 <Miclee> It's PHP, based on Drupal
P10:51:06 <Iguana> Well, how do you get a domain?
P10:51:07 <mail2345> my website is so awesome
P10:51:10 <Iguana> Without paying...
P10:51:11 <mail2345> it doesn't have html
P10:51:17 <mail2345> or convert stuff to html
P10:51:18 <Shadaez> You pay for a domain, period.
P10:51:22 <Miclee> I got some co.cc domain for free.
P10:51:31 <mail2345> i send viruses to the client
P10:51:33 <Shadaez> Unless you want a subdomain..
P10:51:38 <mail2345> which then directly draw to the screen
P10:52:01 <Miclee> No, mine's not a subdomain. I can even have e-mail accounts/subdomains on my site. >.>
P10:52:11 <Miclee> Free domain+hosting
P10:52:32 <Super-Dot> I think you can get a .tk domain for free
P10:52:48 <Shadaez> co.cc is a subdomain.
P10:52:49 <mail2345> i think i can get any domain for free
P10:52:53 <mail2345> oh wait you mean legally?
P10:53:13 <Super-Dot> It used to be that it framed your site, but I think if you keep it active for long enough, it gets automatically converted
P10:53:14 <Miclee> Shadaez, it is, but not in the usual sense.
P10:53:15 <Shadaez> mail, you can't.
P10:53:25 <Shadaez> Yes it is, miclee.
P10:53:27 <mail2345> o
P10:53:29 <mail2345> i am joking
P10:53:35 <Miclee> Then explain how I can have subdomains on it?
P10:53:44 <mail2345> SUB SUB DOMAINS
P10:53:44 <Iguana> How do you get a free domain?
P10:53:49 <Iguana> I still don't understand. o.o
P10:53:50 <Shadaez> yes sub sub
P10:53:57 <mail2345> sub sub sub domains
P10:53:58 <Shadaez> google could do
P10:54:08 <mail2345> ad inifnitum sub domains
P10:54:10 <mail2345> aol did
P10:54:11 <Shadaez> g.mail.google.com if they wanted.
P10:54:13 <mail2345> apparently for email
P10:54:16 <tentacos> if you don't want a redirect, you have to pay for a .tk domain
P10:54:27 <mail2345> they would setup a squatter site
P10:54:54 <mail2345> the customer gets thier own domain name for email if it's popular enough
P10:55:10 <mail2345> AOL gets easy info on where to place thier typosquatters

P10:57:34 <Drakkar> good award
