A11:06:11 <TrueWolves> But that list is not up quite yet
13A11:06:16 * TrueWolves is on both of them anyhow xD
A11:07:09 <LG_Legacy> Meh
A11:07:18 <LG_Legacy> I really don't feel like going with it
A11:07:29 <LG_Legacy> I just got this uneasy feeling it's going to be strict and out of control one day
10A11:07:52 * Arf (a@190.176.247.150) has joined #minecraft
10A11:08:07 * Arf is now known as Arf|Homework

A11:08:47 <Arf|Homework> My cats already did
A11:08:51 <Arf|Homework> Since they are in the playful age
A11:09:00 <Arf|Homework> They grabbed some of my printed pages
A11:09:06 <Arf|Homework> and well, the rest is a classic.
A11:09:10 <citricsquid> quick, recommend me a film.
12A11:09:50 * Arf (a@190.176.247.150) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A11:10:34 <LG_Legacy> Lol... peroggi still has a server up?
A11:10:49 <TrueWolves> Yeah, I just personaly try to earn people's trust
A11:11:05 <TrueWolves> so if there is a list that's based on trust, I will tr to prove me self on it so I can help people
A11:11:14 <TrueWolves> plus I just don't like griefers, the more chances to take them down the better
A11:11:27 <LG_Legacy> I don't try to earn peoples trust, i let them trust me. I believe it's their choice and oppurtunity to trust me :P
A11:11:38 <Quatroking|AFK> the list is bullshit
A11:11:44 <TrueWolves> I don't pressure people either though
A11:11:56 <TrueWolves> if someone don't trust me, I'm not like a noob who goes "comeonman"
A11:11:59 <TrueWolves> ^.^
A11:12:10 <Quatroking|AFK> if people need ops they should get to know their server community
A11:12:12 <PuyoDead> <LG_Legacy> Lol... peroggi still has a server up?
A11:12:13 <TrueWolves> There is quite a few servers I visit where I'm no an op =D
A11:12:16 <PuyoDead> it's in your sig :P
A11:12:17 <LG_Legacy> Yes he does
A11:12:19 <LG_Legacy> Find it
A11:12:33 <LG_Legacy> It's a Verticle Build
A11:12:49 <LG_Legacy> Good thinking wolve.
A11:13:06 <Maveric> TrueWolves: I'll look into the trusted op list
A11:13:10 <LG_Legacy> However, i could give a two shits if someone trusts me or not. It's their decision, and if they want to. Fine. Don't want to? Sure.
A11:13:18 <LG_Legacy> Couldn't*
A11:13:27 <Maveric> I don't mind giving ops to people who have a presence on the forums or IRC, as they're more likely to consider there reputations
A11:13:42 <Maveric> However, it's getting the trusted ops to play on my server :P
A11:13:47 <TrueWolves> XD
A11:13:53 <TrueWolves> I visit random servers once in a while
12A11:14:12 * Nalok (gdhammerbo@pool-71-176-138-45.hag.east.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
A11:14:16 <TrueWolves> then biuld something random, stick around for a while, biuld something else sometimes and go to another server if I get bored there
A11:14:19 <LG_Legacy> See if you get someone like me, you won't see me as often.
A11:14:33 <LG_Legacy> Because i'm op in like 8 billion servers thanks to my sig :l
A11:14:39 <TrueWolves> XD
A11:17:21 <Maveric> Problem with my server, I think, is that once people join they don't leave for ages
A11:17:45 <Maveric> And I'm quite sure that having a busy server just makes it a target for griefers, because they can see the impact there actions have on people
A11:17:47 <TrueWolves> What server?
A11:18:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Woot.... Reddit Public reset, fresh new map
A11:18:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Our last one was up for just over 2.5 days
A11:18:31 <PuyoDead> spiffy
A11:18:48 <Maveric> AlLnAtuRalX: I'll have to check it out

A11:19:55 <Snowman> why?
A11:20:02 <Quatroking|AFK> I need to tell him something

A11:26:00 <Maveric> Will you be the Goose to my Maverick?
A11:26:37 <citricsquid> I got banned earlier, on minecraft :(
A11:26:38 <Maveric> Oh, ok
A11:26:43 <Maveric> You are right. I hate you. Nevermind
A11:26:43 <citricsquid> Joined a french server and pretended to be french.
A11:26:54 <vede> That's lame.
13A11:26:57 * AlLnAtuRalX can speak French
A11:26:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> and Romanian
A11:27:05 <citricsquid> I was all
A11:27:08 <citricsquid> "TRES BIEN!"
A11:27:10 <citricsquid> and got banned :(
A11:27:20 <Maveric> What does that mean?
A11:27:24 <citricsquid> very good, I think.
A11:27:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> very good
A11:27:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can raise you one
A11:27:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> TRES BIEN!
A11:28:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> BON! BON!
A11:28:01 <vede> When I go to FR servers I just say I speak English and am only there for the foreign-language atmosphere.
A11:28:02 <citricsquid> he said "something french?" which I guess was "are you french?" so I said "oui" so he let me out of spawn, then I accidentally went back into the spawn prison and he banned me :(
A11:28:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> OUI OUI OUI!
A11:28:06 <vede> Then I get banned.
A11:28:11 <citricsquid> CA VA BIEN, ET TOI?!

A11:28:53 <LG_Legacy> I prefer german
A11:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm going to France for two weeks in a couple of days
A11:29:03 <Maveric> omg, lucky you
A11:29:12 <citricsquid> There's whipped cream on my monitor.
A11:29:14 <Maveric> The french seem to be good looking... apart from the pits

A11:29:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> not as common as you'd believe Maveric :P
A11:29:27 <Maveric> citricsquid: a kinky night? Or is that just run of the mill for you?
A11:29:28 <Snowman> Alex
A11:29:34 <Snowman> Can you reset again, we had a girefer
A11:29:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid has no excuse not to go to france

A11:29:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> The pits part
A11:29:53 <citricsquid> like, once :(
A11:29:57 <Maveric> hehe :P
A11:29:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol, I've been like... 8 times
A11:30:15 <Maveric> Have you evre been to the vatican city?
A11:30:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Italy is the best country, buit I can't speak Italian
A11:30:21 <citricsquid> in belgium I had ketchup flavour crisps, they were so amazing.
A11:30:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Me?  No... It's not worth it :P
A11:30:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, I'm a non-believer
A11:30:36 <Maveric> citricsquid: you get them in Austrralia
A11:30:46 <Maveric> I'm not catholic, but I'd still love to go
A11:30:47 <citricsquid> Maveric: get them here as well, but not as nice.
A11:30:50 <vede> I'd like to go to Russia.
A11:31:03 <Maveric> I'd lov to go to england
A11:31:09 <Maveric> But the idea of warm beer scares me too much
A11:31:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> I hate England... no offense squid
A11:31:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> London is boring :P
A11:31:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't hate it, it's just boring
A11:31:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, everyone there speaks English
A11:31:48 <Maveric> It's my goal to pass out in every conteninent
A11:31:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> but I can never quite understand them when they're speaking quickly
A11:31:55 <Maveric> So far I've done it in Australia
A11:32:42 <TrueWolves> XD
A11:33:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you're going to do it in Africa, I recommend Ciaro
A11:33:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Cairo(
A11:33:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Cairo*
A11:33:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> grrr
A11:33:43 <Maveric> Good beer?
A11:33:46 <Maveric> Cheap beer?
A11:33:51 <Maveric> Better yet.. cheap wimminz?
A11:34:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah, plus it's an interesting place
A11:34:43 <Maveric> Not too interested in Egypt
A11:34:52 <Maveric> Roman history is cooler
A11:36:38 <Quatroking> i prefer the future
A11:37:02 <Quatroking> you guys go ahead and inhale sand, while I explore the galaxy with plasma cannons and ion bombs

A11:47:03 <LG_Legacy> Do me a favor, sticky this topic. http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=1788 And i'll go ahead and make one in the Bugs and Problems and you sticky that too, alright?
A11:47:39 <PuyoDead> looks like a good sticky
A11:48:04 <LG_Legacy> Edit the title as-well if you can in the Support version
A11:48:04 <malcovent> wheres AllnAtuRalX when you need to hassle him repeatedly.
A11:48:11 <LG_Legacy> Minecraft All-around FAQ
A11:49:12 <PuyoDead> done and done
A11:49:16 <citricsquid> I've never been up for over 30 hours before, right now I've been awake for 31 hours and I don't feel tired in the slightest. I love lucozade.
A11:49:17 <LG_Legacy> Wicked, thanks.
A11:49:37 <PuyoDead> my record is 3 days
A11:49:43 <PuyoDead> I would not suggest it to anyone
A11:50:06 <citricsquid> I've never felt the need to stay awake for so long, is it true that eventually you start hallucinating?
A11:50:21 <TrueWolves> after 2-3 days you can
A11:50:24 <PuyoDead> yup
A11:50:36 <Snowman> Ive been up once for like 40 hours
A11:50:52 <TrueWolves> the longest I've been up is... around 70-80 hours, I never want to do that again
A11:50:57 <PuyoDead> I used to be on a few different medications + a sleeping disorder = wtfsleepinghabits
A11:51:16 <PuyoDead> oh, and work and school at the same time
A11:51:40 <citricsquid> I normally do about 18 hours awake before I'm too tired and then sleep.
A11:52:06 <citricsquid> mind you, I have quite a lot of sugar yesterday/today
A11:52:57 <LG_Legacy> PuyoDead
A11:53:05 <LG_Legacy> Ye forgot about the one in the Bugs and other problems
A11:53:16 <LG_Legacy> I would like it stickied cause some people mistake it for Support
A11:53:27 <LG_Legacy> And it's practically another support <_<
A11:53:55 <PuyoDead> hmm, odd to have two of them, but I suppose it applies in this case
A11:55:04 <citricsquid> LG_Legacy: in regards to the report you just made, solution doesn't mean a topic should be locked :)
A11:55:54 <malcovent> may i just add x_x
A11:56:02 <malcovent> or ask, should i say, what your average download speed is?
A11:56:40 <malcovent> (sorry, just a quick conversation hijack)
A11:56:59 <LG_Legacy> Meh
A11:57:07 <LG_Legacy> I'm beginning to panic
A11:57:10 <LG_Legacy> But then i realized
A11:57:12 <LG_Legacy> It's a test
A11:57:31 <LG_Legacy> Damn tornado testings
A11:58:44 <Quatroking> lmao
A11:59:17 <citricsquid> time to watch sweeney todd.
A11:59:19 <Quatroking> dinner time

P12:01:05 <LG_Legacy> And here i was fearing i was going to get a hard-ware failure when i was making the FAQ
P12:03:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> malcovent, what's wrong?
P12:04:39 <malcovent> O_O back from the blue!
P12:04:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P12:05:00 <malcovent> my server would appear to have dissapeared xD 
P12:05:05 <malcovent> just wondered if it was a crash or intentional.
P12:05:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> weird... showing that it's up
P12:05:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold one
P12:05:16 <malcovent> throw me a link
P12:05:23 <malcovent> might just be my server list thats dead x_x
P12:05:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> should be the same link
P12:05:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> I didn't change anything
P12:05:55 <malcovent> hmmm
P12:05:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=20c2bbea254509086136873310b7ac5b
P12:06:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> about to test in a second
P12:06:42 <malcovent> okay x_x <3
P12:07:01 <SteGriff> I'm looking for a well policed server to play. Anyone want to advertise theirs?
P12:07:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Reddit Public
P12:07:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> redditpublic.com has all you need
P12:07:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P12:07:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> #redditpublic if you like IRC
P12:07:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> malcovent, I see the issue
P12:07:44 <SteGriff> I don't like it
P12:07:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold on
P12:07:54 <SteGriff> I'm looking for a quiet server
P12:08:00 <SteGriff> Somewhere low profile
P12:08:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> malcovent, try now
P12:09:00 <LG_Legacy> That would probably be mine when it rises
P12:09:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> malcovent, what's the word?
P12:09:42 <SteGriff> I look forward to it, LG_Legacy
P12:10:20 <LG_Legacy> Indeed, i might just make it a flatgrass building, or based off medieval roleplay
P12:10:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> malcovent, how big is your map?

P12:11:16 <MalcoventMarkII> if the maps causing issues, feel free to flick it to a default flatgrass

P4:50:38 <Quatroking> ez: i only eat japanese snacks
P4:51:19 <ez> and the it pops whit the chili in the oil taking flavour from it, it's GREAT! so yummy
P4:51:37 <ez> hi LKA

P4:52:00 <vede> I like putting hot dogs in my Mac'n'Cheese.
P4:52:04 <vede>  >.>
P4:52:21 <Quatroking> hotdogs are awesome
P4:52:29 <doohan> But in macaronni?
P4:52:33 <vede> YES
P4:52:39 <doohan> You sir, are an odd person.
P4:52:56 <vede> Slice up some hot dogs (or smoked sausage), put'em in some Mac/Cheese, makes it doublegood.
P4:52:56 <ez> since capsaicin dissolves in oil it's perfect
P4:52:58 <Quatroking> well actually
P4:53:03 <doohan> You mean just the sausage or the bun + ketchup and mustard?
P4:53:11 <Animator> TOWER POST.
P4:53:13 <Quatroking> sausages are used a lot in pasta

P4:53:23 <ez> PUT CHOPPED CHILI IN OIL WHEN POPPING POPCORN!
P4:53:40 <Quatroking> I always use microwave popcorn
P4:53:47 <Quatroking> tbh
P4:54:07 <ez> that's just shit
P4:54:09 <Quatroking> too lazy to make it fresh plus I wlays burn it
P4:54:13 <ez> u need the real thing :D
P4:54:30 <ez> nothing like the real thing
P4:54:43 <ez> always make popcorn with chili nowadays
P4:54:46 <Quatroking> well I always cut the bag open, take a tupperware box, transfer the corn, and add honey
P4:54:57 <Quatroking> epic flavour is epic
P4:55:03 <ez> only time I'd eat anything else is at the movies =) cause they have nice popcorn there^^
P4:55:26 <ez> oh, then u can do the same thing with chili
P4:55:53 <ez> cant wait till my chili plant got fruit :D
13P4:56:03 * ez does a chili dance
P4:56:17 <Quatroking> chili girl
P4:56:27 <ez> lil bit, yes :P
P4:56:30 <Animator> In a chili world.
P4:56:30 <doohan> Why isn't there a list of known griefers?
P4:56:32 <Quatroking> What does Notch eat usually?
P4:56:39 <Snowman> HIS BEARD
P4:56:40 <Snowman> :D
P4:56:41 <ez> there is doohan
P4:56:41 <doohan> Surely that can be picked up by everyone that runs a server?
P4:56:47 <Animator> Because a list of known griefers have been tried.
P4:56:51 <Animator> Twice.
P4:56:58 <doohan> And what happened with it?
P4:57:00 <ez> it's not a good idea though
P4:57:02 <Quatroking> and the list got griefed every time
P4:57:10 <ez> cause then EVERYONE would be banned everywhere
P4:57:10 <Animator> Both are questionable because of false accusations.
P4:57:21 <vede> griefer list got griefed
P4:57:22 <ez> I am banned from atleast 3 servers...
P4:57:23 <Quatroking> the trusted list os shit too
P4:57:26 <doohan> I'd have gone for something like if a certain number of server ban a user
P4:57:27 <vede> That makes me laugh.
P4:57:32 <doohan> then they go on hte naughty list
P4:57:46 <ez> once I got banned for saying "hi" in prison
P4:58:00 <ez> other times I just got banned for entering server
P4:58:02 <doohan> To be honest we probably just need to wait for the beta
P4:58:08 <doohan> ez same here
P4:58:15 <doohan> Some people don't know how to make a private server

P5:08:57 <Snowman> And if I wanna bother him, I'll ask about the medal system
P5:09:02 <ChJees> lol
P5:09:36 <Snowman> 77.9% done
P5:09:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, captchas are a feature that it seems like you guys would actually need
P5:10:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> medals are just another way for the monkey 12 y/os who frequent that place to feel better about themselves when they have no real accomplishments whatsoever
P5:10:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> And yes, I'm in an incredibly bad mood
P5:10:39 <Snowman> btw, citric thinks the spammers arent bots
P5:10:42 <Snowman> but people
P5:10:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Good for him, he's probably wrong
P5:11:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> And even if he's not, what's wrong with a captcha?
P5:11:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> If I wasn't leaving Wednesday and I didn't have things to actually do with my life, I'd write a bot that registers 20k accounts and starts spamming everywhere just for fun
P5:11:54 <Snowman> the truth is, citric is just lazy
P5:12:03 <Snowman> too lazy to implement them
P5:12:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> He should say that then, not just dance around the issue

P6:26:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> Every server I like dispears.
P6:27:16 <fleshBasedProcessor> There was a server wit a giant canyon. It was the first server I ever bookmarked and purposefully returned to. It lasted about 3 or 4 days.
P6:28:17 <ez> Despairs in disappearing diaper
P6:28:43 <fleshBasedProcessor> Next came the Hell map citric hosted. It was griefed and flooded every single day. I don't remember how long it was up but even before citric took down all his servers it was gone
P6:28:46 <ez> sry, Im a bit tired :)

P6:29:14 <PuyoDead> that I'm making
P6:29:24 <PuyoDead> no need for excited panic
P6:29:38 <Zuriki> Did you see my post Puyo?
P6:29:41 <fleshBasedProcessor> Then Potato, the maker of tons of great maps, put up a server with an awesome desert map. It only lasted about 30 minutes and then went down while I was playing
P6:30:27 <fleshBasedProcessor> 2 days ago I found a cool server with floating islands and a kick ass tree house. Of course, It is gone today
13P6:30:33 * PuyoDead throws a prinny at Zuriki
P6:30:40 <Zuriki> :]
P6:30:57 <Zuriki> Ez, I was trying to beat your record, ITS IMPOSSIBLE
P6:31:11 <Zuriki> I have a house pumping out peons near the tower and a mason
P6:31:23 <Zuriki> And they end up all getting killed except my farmers
P6:31:29 <Zuriki> Who are on the other side of the map.
P6:32:07 <ez> Im a pro :D
P6:32:36 <ez> u have soldiers to kill the mobs?
P6:32:43 <Zuriki> Yes
P6:33:01 <fleshBasedProcessor> Are you talking about that game where you have to destroy the tower?
P6:33:04 <LG_Legacy> Wheeeeee
P6:33:06 <Zuriki> I call them ninjahs
P6:33:12 <ez> and enough food to respawn peons when they are killed?
P6:33:16 <Zuriki> Yes
P6:33:25 <ez> well, then it's all about tactics =)
P6:33:28 <Zuriki> I have a constant stream of about 30 peons
P6:33:37 <Zuriki> + 10 warriors
P6:33:43 <ZomBuster> I just spam planters and get a zillion peons
P6:33:45 <ez> I think I usually have about 40 peons
P6:34:00 <ez> two houses near food and two houses near tower
P6:34:19 <Zuriki> Oh I keep about 10ish peons farming
P6:34:22 <Zuriki> 20 mining
P6:34:25 <Zuriki> and 10 fighting
P6:34:35 <Zuriki> But on the map it's like
P6:34:49 <Zuriki> Tower-Mason-House-------------------------Farm
P6:34:52 <ez> u have to be fast getting to the tower as well, chopping down the forrest to it

P6:36:16 <ez> fleshBasedProcessor, yes breaking the tower
P6:36:28 <ez> http://www.mojang.com/notch/ld12/breaking/
P6:37:11 <ez> I was fooling around with it now, then I got 23 min
P6:37:12 <fleshBasedProcessor> notch made that game? I played it months ago, I had no idea.
P6:37:21 <ez> yes fleshBasedProcessor :)
P6:37:28 <fleshBasedProcessor> never could quite beat it.
P6:38:01 <fleshBasedProcessor> I finally got to a point where I had plenty of resources and could fend off the sodiers, but never enough to get my miners to the tower
P6:38:48 <ez> have to build houses near the tower so peons spawn there, then a mason so they destroy it ;)
P6:39:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn, it.
P6:39:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> time to redo the chan! whee

P8:32:57 <mail2345> damm. upload it to some non-retarded site
P8:32:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not that hard to download from there

P8:33:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Plus, DCC is slow as balls
P8:33:32 <mail2345> anyway, go use will host for food.
