P1:36:29 <Rydia> isometric map rendering
P1:36:39 <autoswim> it is saucy stuff
P1:36:52 <Akai> I also want to see ops able to make any block unbreakable
P1:37:00 <Akai> so they can make some unbreakable pretty stuff
P1:37:07 <Akai> instead of having to use black boxes all the time
P1:37:13 <Rydia> C418 is there anywhere i can download the music for minecraft
P1:37:18 <Rydia> it's very pretty

P2:13:52 <citricsquid> has to be done in ipbans.txt
P2:18:02 <Akai> so...
P2:18:27 <JTE> I think it died again ... /mute doesn't work.
P2:18:34 <PuyoDead> poo
P2:18:42 <Akai> what do you guys think are the odds of me getting banned for accidentally superflooding a server, when I'm an op?
P2:18:57 <Akai> considering the host has OME...
P2:19:08 <potato> if you deop all the other ops first

P2:22:04 <citricsquid> I de-op myself normally, keep my alt opped so I can re-op if needed :P
P2:22:40 <cryzed> citricsquid: 
P2:22:44 <cryzed> I just found a squid in my map
P2:22:52 <cryzed> http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/nea8btvk/Unbenannt.png looked like this

P2:28:28 <Animator> Ohhhh yeah. Download those packages, Minecraft. OH YESSSS.
P2:28:39 <Animator> Er.
P2:28:44 <Animator> You didn't see that.
P2:29:14 <PuyoDead> we all do that, secretly
P2:29:55 <Animator> Aw, what? No more arrow key moving?
P2:29:57 <Animator> That sucks.
P2:30:10 <Animator> Oh wait.
P2:30:13 <SteGriff> I need some help for the wiki
P2:30:23 <SteGriff> I need someone to let me on their server
P2:30:27 <SteGriff> and op me
P2:30:36 <SteGriff> So I can document /solid stone
P2:30:58 <SteGriff> ...any takers?
P2:31:16 <SteGriff> citricsquid, perhaps?
P2:31:24 <Animator> Citricsquid has a server.
P2:31:35 <Animator> You could also document the board games I made.
P2:31:42 <SteGriff> what is it?
P2:31:47 <Animator> THAT CITRICSQUID DID NOT FINISH WITH ME.
P2:32:01 <Animator> It's a board I made that can be used for checkers and chess.
P2:32:01 <SteGriff> I've finished doing all the "wanted pages"
P2:32:07 <SteGriff> oh ok
P2:32:09 <Animator> Checkers is fun.
P2:32:31 <Animator> Woah, wait a minute.
P2:32:55 <Animator> My board. Citricsquid!
P2:33:20 <SteGriff> actually, I'm auto op on facepunch
P2:33:24 <SteGriff> might try there
P2:33:28 <citricsquid> I flooded the map so I deleted it, I have a back up though animator :)
P2:33:41 <SteGriff> hm, their old servers are gone
P2:33:46 <SteGriff> citric, read above
P2:33:54 <Animator> Ah, good.
P2:34:15 <Animator> Can you load the back-up?
P2:34:26 <citricsquid> animator: I'll make you a server with it :)
P2:34:51 <Animator> Oh, okay.
P2:34:53 <SteGriff> can I come on your server and go op, please?
P2:34:59 <SteGriff> to document /solid stone
P2:35:08 <Animator> Don't make it public, though.
P2:35:31 <Animator> I'm going to keep it private until it's gone through enough testing and documentation.
P2:35:32 <citricsquid> ste: didn't see what you were saying, do you need a server?
P2:35:43 <citricsquid> animator: mmmkay :) I'll do it now
P2:36:00 <SteGriff> I need one where I can quickly go op, take some pictures of /solid stone, and then make like a tree
P2:36:11 <SteGriff> i.e. yours

P2:38:07 <SteGriff> but its convenient and isn't nagware
P2:38:41 <Animator> I like my nagware.
P2:39:00 <Animator> It lets me know that mIRC cares about me. ;_;
P2:39:19 <Rock_D> I'm content with mibbit except for the fact that you can't use it on freenode

P3:30:46 <Akai> interesting glitch I found out about...
P3:31:20 <Akai> when you're opped, you have to reconnect to destroy unbreakables... which I'm sure is known... but apparently, the opposite is true for deop. They can still destroy unbreakables
P3:31:41 <citricsquid> yeah, it's annoying
