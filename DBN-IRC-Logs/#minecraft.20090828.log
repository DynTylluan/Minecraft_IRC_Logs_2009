A12:04:55 <PuyoDead> wait... why would people think #help is for minecraft?

A12:05:57 <Drakkar> the opers are apparently getting annoyed by people advertising
A12:05:58 <Drakkar> so uh
A12:06:03 <Drakkar> KNOCK IT OFF GUYS |:<
A12:06:05 <mail2345|homework> actually it's more of
A12:06:16 <liq3> opers?
A12:06:17 <mail2345|homework> o hai
A12:06:22 <Drakkar> the ircops
A12:06:25 <mail2345|homework> can i haz help setting up a server
A12:06:32 <Drakkar> the people who can permaban you from the irc server
A12:06:37 <mail2345|homework> or network
A12:07:10 <liq3> Drakkar: That's not possible. :P
A12:07:25 <Drakkar> it is
A12:07:28 <liq3> Nope.
A12:07:51 <mail2345|homework> err
A12:07:53 <mail2345|homework> do the words
A12:07:57 <Visiiri> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f6ca4dce664b3b82c796e5cd76181a8e
A12:07:59 <Visiiri> mail
A12:08:00 <Visiiri> check it out
A12:08:03 <gear> ffffffffffff
A12:08:24 <Drakkar> you can set a gline or zline with an obscene enough duration that there's no likelihood of it ever elapsing while the server is still up
A12:08:29 <gear> LOL
A12:08:31 <mail2345|homework> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-line#G-line
A12:08:36 <gear> ALL THE GLASS IS GRASS
A12:08:48 <PuyoDead> sure, you can do some spoof/proxy crap, but a gline is pretty much going to make it annoying as hell
A12:08:57 <Drakkar> yep
A12:09:00 <Drakkar> and then there are shuns
A12:09:06 <Drakkar> which just ignore any commands you send to the server
A12:09:07 <mail2345|homework> or you could just track them down

A12:09:15 <mail2345|homework> and uhh, nuke them from orbit
A12:09:19 <gear> screen shoooot
A12:09:31 <liq3> mail: you can switch network card and possibly IP address (or even ISP). A true permaban is impossible atm. :P
A12:09:37 <mail2345|homework> hmm
A12:09:38 <mail2345|homework> really
A12:09:41 <PuyoDead> I don't see why the advertising is going on. is there some troll raid happening?
A12:09:41 <Drakkar> incidentally they can just report you to your ISP
A12:09:46 <Drakkar> dunno
A12:09:48 <mail2345|homework> analyze psycologival characteristics of
A12:09:55 <mail2345|homework> the person's messages
A12:09:55 <gear> im going to screen shot log all this
A12:10:01 <liq3> gear: oh?
A12:10:02 <mail2345|homework> but really not possible
A12:10:05 <mail2345|homework> oh wait
A12:10:08 <PuyoDead> liq3, someone has some serious problems if they do that. I mean, really... switch network card?
A12:10:13 <gear> visiiris progress
A12:10:21 <liq3> PuyoDead: Not hard, only $20 for a cheap one. :P
A12:10:28 <liq3> They could buy them in bulk. xD
A12:10:38 <Drakkar> and get every one lined
A12:10:39 <Visiiri> mmkay ready now
A12:10:41 <PuyoDead> yea, they're not expensive, and easy to install... but futile to say the least
A12:10:44 <Drakkar> it takes ten seconds to gline someone
A12:10:44 <Drakkar> lmao
A12:10:48 <Drakkar> less really
A12:10:53 <Visiiri> Drakkar
A12:10:59 <Visiiri> Check this out --> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f6ca4dce664b3b82c796e5cd76181a8e
A12:11:05 <PuyoDead> yea, as soon as someone reports who it is, *poof* another
A12:11:10 <Drakkar> don't remember my account details
A12:11:12 <mail2345|homework> anyway the point is
A12:11:13 <Drakkar> too lazy to
A12:11:17 <Visiiri> :<
A12:11:20 <PuyoDead> enough of those, and ISP could be contacted for abuse
A12:11:21 <Visiiri> It's fking amazing
A12:11:23 <mail2345|homework> that some dumb people thought that #help was for miencraft help
A12:11:36 <Drakkar> alot of ISPs I know actually disconnect you after so many reports
A12:11:39 <Drakkar> regardless of validity
A12:11:43 <Visiiri> lol
A12:12:22 <Drakkar> some really backwoods ones don't though
A12:12:29 <Drakkar> like fuckin' BRAZILIAN ISPs
A12:13:30 <PuyoDead> oh god, I think it was about '96 or so, a channel I was in got flooded by "BR idiots"
A12:13:44 <PuyoDead> spouting "br speak"
A12:14:02 <Drakkar> rofl
A12:14:15 <PuyoDead> "HOW IS I AM FIXING THIS"
A12:14:18 <mail2345|homework> anyway
A12:14:26 <mail2345|homework> i think the correct topic addition is
A12:14:37 <Visiiri> mail, do you want to join us?
A12:14:38 <mail2345|homework> #help is for irc help, not minecraft help. ask for minecraft help here
A12:14:39 <Visiiri> XD
A12:14:51 <mail2345|homework> and got to stop proctrastinating
A12:15:08 <Drakkar> I did add to ask any minecraft questions in here

A1:04:33 <liq3> Anyone wanna try out a Minecraft TBS prototype?
A1:04:54 <asiekierka> TBS?
A1:04:59 <asiekierka> The Bad Sigh?
A1:05:02 <asiekierka> xD
A1:05:16 <asiekierka> And now for srs
A1:05:19 <asiekierka> What IS TBS?
A1:06:37 <asiekierka> liq3
A1:06:42 <liq3> ha.hpa
A1:06:43 <liq3> ?
A1:06:47 <liq3> Turn Based Strategy.
A1:07:07 <asiekierka> oh
A1:07:11 <liq3> Been trying to come up with a game for minecraft for ages adn  I finally did. xD
A1:07:24 <asiekierka> You could do that in craftr when it's done
A1:07:25 <liq3> oh, that reminds me!.
A1:07:26 <asiekierka> OR luacraft
A1:07:39 <liq3> yes, but it also works just fine without hardcoding. :P
A1:07:48 <asiekierka> nooo
A1:07:53 <asiekierka> both wouldn't be hardcoded
A1:08:03 <asiekierka> luacraft is meant to be a lua-programmable minecraft server
A1:08:03 <liq3> craftr?
A1:08:10 <liq3> uh.
A1:08:11 <asiekierka> craftr - a minecraft sandbox-only clone
A1:08:21 <asiekierka> nothing else but the sandbox and lua
A1:08:22 <asiekierka> :D
A1:08:22 <liq3> You do realise Notch is adding Lua support later?
A1:08:28 <asiekierka> Yes I do
A1:08:32 <asiekierka> But who likes waiting lol
A1:08:36 <liq3> nobody!
A1:08:37 <liq3> XD
A1:08:41 <asiekierka> See?
A1:08:54 <liq3> you wanna try it tho?
A1:08:56 <asiekierka> Also later may mean "in 2-3 months"
A1:08:58 <asiekierka> Also, no
A1:09:09 <liq3> Yeh, honestly Notch is programming pretty slow. :/
A1:09:18 <asiekierka> Well, he has a life
A1:09:20 <asiekierka> Unlike me
A1:09:27 <liq3> Just, the guy who is making AI War.
A1:09:33 <liq3> Is going much faster imo.
A1:09:42 <asiekierka> Well, yeah
A1:09:44 <liq3> But that may be because his game is already released and it's just patching now. xD
A1:09:50 <asiekierka> I think if I get to contact Notch pre-Sept 4th
A1:09:59 <asiekierka> It may be tested until he comes back
A1:10:14 <asiekierka> When he decides where and how it gets released
A1:10:42 <asiekierka> as in, free or paid
A1:10:44 <asiekierka> :P
A1:17:24 <asiekierka> I want to do a logic gate simulator with luacraft
A1:17:37 <asiekierka> So green blocks are PCBs

A1:20:13 <asiekierka> and diff colors for gates
A1:20:49 <asiekierka> Actually I'll download mingw
A1:20:55 <asiekierka> also
A1:21:01 <asiekierka> Is it true that protocol is changing on sept 1?
A1:21:43 <liq3> not that i know of.
A1:21:49 <asiekierka> For luacraft i'm waiting for info from someone that does know the protocol (Anyone really)
A1:22:04 <liq3> I know the current net protocal. :/
A1:22:08 <liq3> or at least what's in the packets.

A2:25:47 <asiekierka> I got gmod a week ago
A2:26:00 <gordenfreechmen> also asiekierka, losing the game is a deadly and contigious virus

A2:28:22 <asiekierka> There are no rules in The Game
A2:28:29 <asiekierka> The point is to win
A2:28:35 <asiekierka> The other point is, you can't win
A2:29:04 <gordenfreechmen> http://up.mibbit.com/up/JKrrvS5P.png
A2:29:08 <gordenfreechmen> the first thing I made.

A4:42:51 <asiekierka> i wondered about something
A4:42:53 <Quatroking> I ordered a silver-grey one at J-list but I got the blue one by accident, which I already had
A4:42:56 <asiekierka> If someone makes a server
A4:43:05 <asiekierka> with survival multiplayer
A4:43:14 <asiekierka> Can free users join as well or will they be banished? O_O
A4:43:21 <Quatroking> snowman: the blue one is 3 times more worth than the silver-grey one :P
A4:43:41 <asiekierka> AGH
A4:43:43 <Quatroking> asiekierka: survival multiplayer isn't coming out till october, no idea
A4:43:46 <asiekierka> libsdl.org lags way too much
A4:44:16 <Quatroking> I guess that free users will simply not be able to join survival servers
A4:44:19 <Snowman> So you got like the thing for less cash?
A4:44:23 <Quatroking> and that they won't see them in their serverlist either
A4:44:28 <Quatroking> snowman: yeah
A4:44:31 <liq3> asiekierka: I'm pretty sure Survival will always be paid-only. Although, freebies might be able to play during beta.
A4:44:39 <liq3> and by "pretty sure" i mean "99.99%" 
A4:44:53 <asiekierka> well
A4:44:53 <Quatroking> snowman: paid $20 while its actually $58
A4:45:09 <asiekierka> the singleplayer test IS paid-only
A4:45:14 <Quatroking> liq3: but singleplayer survival beta is paid-only?
A4:45:20 <liq3> no, we're just getting it 3 weeks early.
A4:45:24 <Quatroking> I doubt the multiplayer beta will be free

A4:46:59 <Quatroking> griskard: yeah, youtube vids don't work well with 3D unless they're specially made for it
13A4:47:01 * Notch rubs it in
A4:47:12 <08Notch> it actually works on in hd mode
A4:47:14 <liq3> oh...that's a neat idea Griskard! *pulls out 3d glasses*
A4:47:14 <Griskard> So, Notch, Have you got attacking in yet?
A4:47:20 <Quatroking> I wasn't really able to see much depth in the minecraft vid
A4:47:22 <08Notch> no, but that's what I'm doing today =)
A4:47:39 <Griskard> Nice Nice. Im suffering physical pain from the tension
A4:47:42 <Quatroking> [Prototype] is fucking awesome in 3D
A4:48:00 <Griskard> Ive actually been playing singleplayer, without hacks, with survival rules. Only no monsters
A4:48:10 <Griskard> I tried mobs, but they generally end up stuck in the ocean
A4:48:23 <Quatroking> my mobs always end up in a hole gangraping each other
A4:48:27 <Quatroking> :(
A4:48:46 <Griskard> Oh thats right. Notch, in the beta release is there going to be some form of crafting?
A4:48:54 <Griskard> Or will ore just remake into ore
A4:48:59 <Quatroking> aera, you there?

A4:50:40 <08Notch> i want to have crafting, but I'm running out of time fast! :-O
A4:50:49 <Quatroking> if you select nvidia preview during the setup wizard it produces anaglyphs

A4:51:10 <aera> Quatroking: i'll fix the IP thing on my lunchbreak
A4:51:16 <liq3> Quatroking: Yeh, I got an ATI card, so iz3d is best I can do.
A4:51:20 <Quatroking> aera: the main page loads incredibly slow
A4:51:24 <doohan> Hey Notch 
A4:51:27 <doohan> hey7 Quatroking 
A4:51:28 <Quatroking> it just took me 20 seconds to load it
A4:51:29 <doohan> -7
A4:51:33 <Quatroking> doohen
A4:51:35 <doohan> hey aera and liq3 
A4:51:38 <liq3> hi
A4:51:55 <Quatroking> liq3: don't expect hardcore gaming with 3D tho, resource-heavy games run like a bitch with anaglyph
A4:52:14 <Quatroking> Burnout and GTA IV for example, are rather slow under 3D
A4:52:23 <Quatroking> Fallout 3 just crashes
A4:52:39 <doohan> Who was being a 'tweak'?
A4:52:46 <liq3> Quatroking: Well I find games run fairly fine with 3d mode, just that it looks terrible. Getting it set right is hard as a bitch, and even then there's almost no colour.
A4:52:51 <Quatroking> Well, it doesn't crash, but with a framerate thats less than one, its not fun to play
A4:52:51 <doohan> The topic made me laugh
A4:53:18 <Griskard> Just one more question until I remember more Notch, Will mobs repopulate, or will they slowly dissapear due to death, like falling, drowning, and chronic sword-to-brain?
A4:53:29 <Quatroking> liq3: it really depends much on the game you play
A4:53:38 <liq3> Quatroking: Y eh I know. :/
A4:53:59 <liq3> Quatroking: still, with anaglyph I don't see any way to fix the lack of colours.
A4:54:07 <liq3> Which makes stuff like TF2 impossible to play.
A4:54:08 <Quatroking> True.
A4:54:22 <Quatroking> I tried audiosurf in anaglyph...
A4:54:24 <Quatroking> HELL.
A4:54:31 <liq3> haha, because no colours?
A4:54:33 <Quatroking> ALL BLOCKS ARE GREY.
A4:54:45 <liq3> i'm tempted to get an iz3d moniter, but I dunno if it's worth it.
A4:54:55 <Quatroking> doubt it
A4:55:02 <liq3> Well, it's 3d, but full colour. :P
A4:55:14 <liq3> The main reason I'm not is because most games do have terrible support for it. :/
A4:55:23 <08Notch> Griskard: In the first test, there'll probably be a fixed amount of mobs
A4:55:28 <08Notch> but they will repopulate in the actual game
A4:55:45 <Quatroking> I might save up some money for the Geforce 3D kit, they have a demo booth over at the local electronica store
A4:55:51 <08Notch> i wish I had more time to finish up the test better
A4:55:53 <Griskard> So do you think you could add a cheat button that would spawn more mobs?
A4:55:56 <Quatroking> Didn't try it out yet, but it sounds great
A4:55:59 <08Notch> but I guess this way I'll actually release SOMETHING. ;)
A4:56:05 <liq3> Notch: Think you could make them slowly respawn over time up to a max number?
A4:56:06 <aera> asiekierka: yes, I have no idea why the main page is so slow, it's not actually doing anything
A4:56:10 <aera> ack!
A4:56:12 <08Notch> liq3: That's the plan
A4:56:13 <aera> i meant Quatroking
A4:56:17 <liq3> Notch: Yay :D
A4:56:24 <aera> silly tabcomplete
A4:56:30 <Quatroking> aera: is there a way to check for server thingies?
A4:56:34 <Quatroking> logs or something
A4:56:43 <liq3> what main page you guys talkin about?
A4:56:47 <aera> Quatroking: there's plenty of logs
A4:56:48 <Griskard> Im just imagining building a home/fort, leaving to do some hunting, coming back and finding your walls filled with zombies
A4:56:49 <Quatroking> Minepedia
A4:56:56 <Griskard> Because they respawned inside
A4:57:05 <Griskard> Notch:So do you think you could add a cheat button that would spawn more mobs?
A4:57:41 <liq3> Notch: Oh that reminds me.... Will mobs have any way to get past walls in the test?
A4:58:30 <liq3> Quatroking: I'm finding the whole website is slow.
A4:58:36 <Quatroking> blame aera
A4:58:41 <Quatroking> I just run it
A4:58:55 <08Notch> I'll try to get as much as I can into the test. Mobs will probably not break down walls
A4:58:56 <liq3> especially when trying to search for a page that don't exist.
A4:59:12 <Griskard> "  Mobs will probably not break down walls" Thank goodness
A4:59:21 <doohan> Hey Notch dfid citricsquid tell you about the awesome new trick that isnotchon has learned?
A4:59:33 <Griskard> I didnt
A4:59:35 <Griskard> So tell me!
A4:59:35 <08Notch> no, what is it?
A4:59:36 <liq3> Quatroking: huh, weird, it just got fast all of a sudden.
A4:59:48 <doohan> It can pm forums mods in here when reports appear on the forum
A4:59:52 <Quatroking> liq3: I guess the tubes finally flushed
A4:59:57 <Quatroking> gotta oil it
A5:00:00 <doohan> Integration ftw!
A5:00:12 <liq3> Quatroking: nvm, main page is still slow as a snail.
13A5:00:18 * doohan <3 web services :)
A5:00:20 <Quatroking> like I said, gotta oil it
A5:00:26 <liq3> XD

13A5:00:42 * liq3 chuckles at the idea of Quatroking oiling it and it catching on fire. >.>
A5:00:48 <aera> stupid mediawiki
A5:00:59 <liq3> aera: check what the main page is loading?
A5:01:12 <liq3> there's probably something stalling the whole page.
A5:01:28 <aera> liq3: yes, I thought so too
A5:01:34 <aera> last test results showed nada
A5:01:41 <liq3> hrm.
A5:01:45 <liq3> i wish i knew a way to test it. :P
A5:01:57 <Quatroking> oh my!
A5:02:03 <Quatroking> his dick is incredible huge!
A5:02:03 <aera> Notch: can we get [temporarily down] removed from the links? :)
A5:02:12 <08Notch> oh yeah!
A5:02:40 <liq3> Notch: Also forums aren't down anymore... Says they are.
A5:02:59 <aera> liq3: that's also what I was referring to
A5:03:05 <aera> the forums are on the same server
A5:03:10 <liq3> oh?
A5:03:12 <liq3> nvm then.
A5:03:16 <aera> and they're fast as blazes
A5:03:23 <08Notch> the wiki's still down, right?
A5:03:42 <08Notch> no, I'm stupid :D
A5:04:16 <Griskard> So Notch, what ways will we have to restore HP, and roughly how many weapons do you think you will have in the beta?
A5:04:20 <Griskard> weapons/armour
A5:04:35 <aera> no, just slooooooow
A5:04:38 <liq3> Notch: Oh, how are we going to aquire weapons?
A5:04:39 <08Notch> food, only food, and in the first test, probably not many at all
A5:04:55 <Quatroking> aera: is the wiki using mysql?
A5:04:59 <08Notch> crafting. In the test, I don't know. :-/
A5:05:12 <08Notch> I'm very much running out of time, and I've been underestimating how much work this is
A5:05:16 <liq3> Notch: Maybe really basic crafting? Like have some ore and press a button and it makes a wep?
A5:05:53 <aera> Quatroking: yes, since mediawiki supports nothing else IIRC
A5:06:11 <Quatroking> well, maybe the tables are slow?
A5:06:12 <Quatroking> I dunno
A5:06:29 <Griskard> You could always just have the generic "mobs drop weapons
A5:07:00 <aera> Quatroking: it's not mysql, the page renders in only .2 seconds
A5:07:08 <Quatroking> Hmm
A5:07:22 <Quatroking> Well
A5:07:46 <Quatroking> I know one thing that might work but it could also go horribly wrong if something fails

A5:17:57 <Quatroking> Hmm
A5:18:02 <Quatroking> lemme try something else first
A5:18:24 <Quatroking> I'm changing the main page for a sec

A5:20:07 <aera> eh
A5:20:10 <aera> it changes

A5:20:31 <Quatroking> after making a change to the main page it loaded instantly

A7:08:00 <doohan> No idea.
A7:08:01 <citricsquid> can't be that much
A7:08:08 <doohan> Nah it'd less than that.
A7:08:08 <Ritave> Let's do overkill and do stand alone using ogre3d :D
A7:08:19 <doohan> hey citricsquid 
A7:08:21 <Griskard> Well I know normal FPS does what, 4kbs?
A7:08:29 <offset> more than that an hour
A7:08:37 <Griskard> kbs
A7:08:40 <Griskard> s for second
A7:09:00 <doohan> I thought s meant sunday
A7:09:29 <doohan> Griskard, are you on some monthly bandwidth limit?
A7:09:36 <Griskard> Yes
A7:09:41 <doohan> Can you tell how muhc you have left?
A7:09:49 <Griskard> Not alot. Its not for now.
A7:10:00 <doohan> But can you tell?
A7:10:00 <liq3> Griskard: You'll find this rather useful. http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/Network/nsl/Freeware.htm
A7:10:00 <Griskard> 500mb
A7:10:03 <doohan> If so not the figure
A7:10:07 <doohan> play the game for 10 minutes
A7:10:11 <doohan> note the differece
A7:10:14 <doohan> and times that by 6
A7:10:19 <doohan> note*
A7:10:26 <doohan> Not hard.
A7:10:28 <Griskard> Then I have to download Gmod. Hehe
A7:10:41 <citricsquid> He'll have to take into account the downloads when you connect
A7:10:43 <liq3> doohan: or he could dl the link adn just run the game in a window, and check what NetStat says.
A7:11:00 <doohan> Oh that's pretty
A7:11:02 <liq3> It tells you live up/down usage for your PC. :/
A7:11:04 <doohan> yeah you could use that
A7:11:07 <liq3> :D

A7:11:22 <liq3> it is. it's the best one i've found.
A7:11:34 <liq3> 6.75gb?

A7:17:25 <offset> for typical source games
A7:17:25 <LG_Legacy> Internet = Billions and billions of floppys
A7:17:31 <Quatroking> 60MB an hour is nothing
A7:17:33 <LG_Legacy> All stuffed in five warehouses
A7:17:52 <Quatroking> my maximum speed is 10 megabit a sec, which is...
A7:17:56 <citricsquid> internet size increases by 2PB a day apparently
A7:18:02 <Quatroking> about 1250 kilobyte a sec
A7:18:16 <Quatroking> thats 75MB a minute
A7:18:30 <Quatroking> or 4,5GB an hour.
A7:18:43 <Morgranth> so u only need to dl with 76 mb/m to downlao9d the enitre internet
A7:19:00 <Siiseli> Morgranth, no really just everything new that day
A7:19:01 <Quatroking> uh
A7:19:07 <Quatroking> a petabyte is frickin' big
A7:19:10 <citricsquid> you could never download the internet
A7:19:15 <Siiseli> oh pish posh Quatroking 
A7:19:19 <Morgranth> 75 is new, 76 = 1 extra:P it will take a while tho
A7:19:29 <LG_Legacy> So much porn would be downloaded, it's unreal.
A7:19:39 <Quatroking> was petabyte 1000 times a terabyte or was it 1000 times a betabyte?
A7:19:47 <citricsquid> wtf is a betabyte?
A7:19:51 <Morgranth> idd
A7:20:18 <Quatroking> huh, last time I checked there was a beta byte in the charts

A7:20:51 <Gaeel> Similar to Pendulum you have DJ Fresh
A7:20:51 <offset> Morgranth, Metallica :D
A7:21:08 <Quatroking> now I think of it, a petabyte is actually easy to realize
A7:22:06 <Quatroking> a terabyte drive is a mere 75 euro's these days
A7:22:24 <citricsquid> afk shower.
A7:22:57 <Quatroking> so you could have an outdated version of the internet for only 150,000 euro's!
A7:27:59 <Ritave> Heh if you had 500 exabytes you could have whole internet on your disk :D Too bad it's 500 000 000 000 000 000 000 gigabytes :P
A7:28:20 <Quatroking> if you had one exabyte you could probably have the internet
A7:29:03 <Morgranth> how much % of the tinernet woudl be porn i wonder
A7:29:44 <Siiseli> 90?
A7:29:46 <Quatroking> hmm
A7:29:51 <Ritave> http://www.healthymind.com/s-porn-stats.html :D
A7:29:53 <Quatroking> well at least 5% I think

A9:19:32 <doohan> Who types with one hand?
A9:19:35 <doohan> Fools.
A9:19:36 <Marach> "Does someone care to explain why every time I finish building my console project, separate instances of javaw are running in the background, all competing for the CPU (just what the hell are you doing?  The build finished, and program has halted!)"
A9:19:37 <doohan> All fools.
A9:19:48 <Marach> lol
A9:20:25 <asiekierka> I was a fool
A9:21:21 <doohan> And that last comment about jbuilder? JBuilder was the worst pile of pish ever.
A9:21:22 <doohan> EVER>
A9:21:26 <SMP> How does one generate a good winter map in OMEN. Right now the winter preset blows huge dick
A9:21:26 <Marach> "The worst bug i had was when saving a .java file. In the eclipse interface everything looked saved o.k., i.e., the save button was dulled. After two days wondering why my code wouldn't compile, I decided to open the .java in a different editor; turns out eclipse wasn't saving it at all - thanks a feckin bunch! "
A9:21:29 <LG_Legacy> Hey Notch, you there?
A9:21:49 <doohan> Marach, that sounds a little special
A9:21:56 <doohan> I think the user must have done something.
A9:22:05 <osici> SMP, lower the height scaling/increase the smoothing
A9:22:06 <doohan> Like saving to a mapped drive or some wierd shit like that.
A9:22:12 <SMP> thanks osici
A9:22:20 <doohan> I don't use eclipse my self, I have done but it's not that bad.
A9:22:49 <Marach> My favorite Eclipse editor is "NullPointerException." That's it. No details, no stack trace, no explanation of what exacly was null. Just the exception name and an OK button. 
A9:22:49 <Marach> HA?HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
A9:22:49 <Marach> LOOOOOOOOL
A9:22:49 <Marach> XDD

A10:41:35 <LG_Legacy> I went up the stairs with the lava and found a dead end
A10:41:38 <LG_Legacy> Thats the only place to go
A10:41:40 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:41:43 <AlexVMiner> it isn't
A10:41:45 <gordenfreechmen> LG_Legacy: inb4thatswhatshesaid
A10:41:45 <LG_Legacy> I fear lava = death
A10:41:50 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:42:01 <AlexVMiner> the stairs to the tunnel is a clue
A10:42:01 <Marach> alex, you should use custom textures
A10:42:09 <AlexVMiner> i did
A10:42:09 <LG_Legacy> Yay green!
A10:42:10 <Marach> SPOILER ALERT
A10:42:16 <AlexVMiner> wait
A10:42:26 <AlexVMiner> will it show up for others on singleplayer?
A10:42:33 <PuyoDead> no
A10:42:38 <AlexVMiner> exactly
A10:42:42 <AlexVMiner> so there is no point
A10:42:44 <Marach> you have to share modified files
A10:42:50 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:42:52 <PuyoDead> which you can't do
A10:42:52 <AlexVMiner> no
A10:42:54 <LG_Legacy> Dammit my client crashed
A10:42:57 <AlexVMiner> it doesn't matter
A10:43:01 <Marach> its not hard to replace files in minecraft.jar
A10:43:14 <PuyoDead> we all know this
A10:43:16 <Marach> its not forbidden to share your own images
A10:43:24 <LG_Legacy> I just got an idea
A10:44:04 <Marach> i give up, minecraft sucks
A10:44:09 <LG_Legacy> Lol?
A10:44:11 <AlexVMiner> lol
A10:44:14 <AlexVMiner> marach
A10:44:17 <AlexVMiner> just do it
A10:44:24 <AlexVMiner> or close it
A10:44:26 <Marach> i will try to use custom client..
A10:44:27 <AlexVMiner> and do mine
A10:44:31 <Marach> no
A10:44:33 <LG_Legacy> Hm, i may need to open the minecraft jar..
A10:44:41 <Marach> it keeps having 2 fps
A10:44:44 <Marach> MAX
A10:44:46 <Marach> usually 0
A10:44:52 <Marach> for 10 minutes
A10:44:58 <AlexVMiner> well
A10:45:01 <Marach> and chunk updates are high all the time
A10:45:03 <AlexVMiner> then shutup and close it
A10:45:14 <Marach> rename minecraft.jar to minecraft.zip
A10:45:26 <Marach> tar is zip
A10:45:29 <Marach> jar*
A10:45:44 <Marach> then just replace images and you have custom textures
A10:45:47 <AlexVMiner> or just unzip it with winRAR
A10:46:08 <Marach> then share images, notch cant say its bad
A10:46:19 <Marach> because images are yours xD
A10:46:21 <AlexVMiner> man
A10:46:29 <AlexVMiner> i can't change the water texture
A10:46:35 <AlexVMiner> can you guys?

P12:16:42 <Zuriki> Ugh, I was playing Mario Karts Wii on the... Wii... whilst I was over there. And I feel that sense of "imcomplete goals" because I never finished 100cc/150cc on gold cups with max stars.
P12:16:56 <AlexVMiner> lol
P12:17:15 <Zuriki> I did it on 50cc though.
P12:17:26 <Zuriki> Cause I'm smooth like that.
P12:17:33 <AlexVMiner> lol
P12:17:57 <PuyoDead> I don't remember how far I got in that

P12:18:15 <PuyoDead> *shrug* still like mine
P12:18:31 <AlexVMiner> darn
P12:18:37 <AlexVMiner> i still didn't beat Pikmin 2
P12:18:39 <AlexVMiner> :(
P12:18:46 <Zuriki> I'd much rather have a PS3 than a Wii. But a Xbox360 than a PS3.
P12:18:57 <Zuriki> I have Pikmin and Pikmin 2 on the NGC.
P12:19:05 <AlexVMiner> me too
P12:19:06 <AlexVMiner> well
P12:19:10 <Zuriki> I can't complete them though. I suck to bad.
P12:19:13 <AlexVMiner> i don't have pikmin anymore
P12:19:15 <PuyoDead> There are a lot of Wii games I like, but almost nothing on PS3
P12:19:15 <LG_Legacy> I have a ps2 :l
P12:19:19 <LG_Legacy> And it's not even mine
P12:19:22 <AlexVMiner> I am so close to beating pikmin 2
P12:19:22 <LG_Legacy> Yet i keep it
P12:19:28 <PuyoDead> I can only think of about 3 games on PS3 I really want
P12:19:40 <AlexVMiner> only 7 sublevels to victory
P12:19:43 <PuyoDead> as for 360, I've got a fair amount of games. enough to warrant my purchase
P12:19:47 <AlexVMiner> 100% completion of the game
P12:19:56 <Zuriki> I don't think there is even that many I want on the PS3 but tbh, there is none on the Wii.

P8:36:43 <Aexis> b + b = b

P8:36:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> i've never used client hacks

P8:37:07 <Aexis> 2 = 1

P8:37:52 <Aexis> This is in fact invalid proof
P8:37:57 <Colain> Sorry what?
P8:38:02 <Aexis> Since a = b
P8:38:10 <Aexis>  a - b = 0
P8:38:20 <Aexis> And dividing by (a - b)
P8:38:24 <Aexis> Would be

P11:01:54 <LG_Legacy> I would think since connected to router = Changes internal ip apon playing with network connections, as the modem itself has the external and if manually hooked to the modem then it would change that ip?
P11:02:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> he loves inflicting flame wars
P11:02:44 <UnknownX> Now its true that Mocheeze is trying to start the same flame war with someone else who said the exact same thing
P11:02:55 <mib_ilfzon> hey i was able to get back my old one but it was griefed? and it has been down for 2 weeks? how did that happen?
P11:02:55 <UnknownX> in another topic

P11:03:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> awes
P11:04:04 <mail2345> @LG only if the router is a router/modem
P11:04:11 <mail2345> if router and modem are separte

P11:04:22 <UnknownX> And it started the flame war

P11:49:34 <Visiiri> TY
P11:50:08 <TheOne> any idea where I could find the lava skin or something to blend in?
P11:50:32 <mib_lvp06x> i did all that stuff and when it showed the map on omen it was just white?
P11:51:01 <TheOne> you only see one level at a time
P11:51:07 <mib_lvp06x> what am i doing wrong?
P11:51:13 <TheOne> its fine
P11:51:24 <TheOne> you just need to scroll through the levels
P11:51:33 <mib_lvp06x> its supposed to be white?
P11:51:40 <TheOne> some levels are
P11:51:47 <mib_lvp06x> ohh ok
P11:51:49 <TheOne> the white is air
P11:51:57 <geekahedron> you're looking at the highest part of the sky
P11:52:03 <TheOne> every block has its own color in omen
P11:53:51 <mib_lvp06x> ohh so when i go down and see gray that is the ground?
P11:54:47 <geekahedron> gray is rock
P11:54:55 <geekahedron> or stone
P11:54:59 <geekahedron> or gray cloth
P11:55:05 <geekahedron> depending on the shades
P11:55:25 <mib_lvp06x> and when i have what i want and i save it i can just open my server and it will be different?
P11:55:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> guh
P11:55:40 <flyboy-ssww> http://theoatmeal.com/img/quizzes/generated/6_42_baboons.jpg
