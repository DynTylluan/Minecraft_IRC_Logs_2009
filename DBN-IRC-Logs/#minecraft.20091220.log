A12:05:36 <Koitenshin> I only hate yours because for some reason it takes an ungodly amount of RAM

A1:47:59 <Brett> With which program?
A1:48:13 <Visiiri> Just an image, as of now.
A1:48:28 <Brett> There are multiple image manipulation tools. :P
A1:48:35 <Brett> What are you looking to do?
A1:48:47 <Visiiri> I understand, and I feel I am rather good with them, I just can't seem to get this one banner looking how I want it.
A1:48:48 <Shadaez> I don't think he cares what program, and just wants an image.
A1:49:38 <Brett> @Visiiri: What are you looking to do?
A1:50:09 <Visiiri> Well, I'm going to have a large banner for the website i'm launching soon.
A1:50:17 <Visiiri> My outline:
A1:50:17 <Visiiri> http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/8999/m4cx2v2.png
A1:50:29 <Visiiri> The robot is my little logo, so he must stay.
A1:50:40 <Visiiri> And that's the sort of deal I want, but I can't make this look good.
A1:50:51 <Visiiri> It's just messy, and no matter what I try, I cannot stop that.
A1:51:31 <Visiiri> :> And now everyone is silent.
A1:51:35 <Shadaez> Make it smaller.
A1:51:56 <Visiiri> It's a banner, not a signiture.
A1:51:58 <Shadaez> Too much negative space, otherwise it looks very good.
A1:52:03 <Visiiri> It will go across the top of my web page
A1:52:14 <Visiiri> So it must be ~ that size
A1:52:14 <Shadaez> oh
A1:52:15 <Brett> well
A1:52:29 <Brett> i would get rid of the m4cx2 url on either side of the logo
A1:52:35 <Brett> raise the contrast of the bg and also darken it
A1:52:43 <Brett> move the logo a little downward (the text)
A1:52:50 <Brett> move the robot to the left more

A2:27:03 <Brett> That's for poser pilots.
A2:27:04 <Roadcrosser> what lolhate?
A2:27:36 <VurtualRuler98> Technically I could limit myself to what I know: Making the plane go up, flying incredibly awesomely, then doing a creepy landing because I didn't line up perfectly.
A2:28:04 <VurtualRuler98> Maybe pull the F-18 eject seat in feign hope to not have to land.
A2:28:48 <VurtualRuler98> Anyways, yeah. I hit the "request takeoff clearance" button, and nothing happened. I'm doing what I assume is "holding short".
A2:30:12 <Brett> Can there be like random hijackings and stuff?
A2:30:15 <Brett> That would be cool.

A3:38:34 <David_Davidson> so mail, is Python hard to learn?
A3:38:41 <mail2345> not really
A3:38:46 <Shadaez> IDK why everyone likes python so much.
A3:38:49 <mail2345> the bulk of time
A3:38:54 <mail2345> is learning the libary
A3:39:00 <mail2345> @shadez HEREASY
A3:39:04 <mail2345> PYTHON IS THE LIGHT
A3:39:12 <David_Davidson> I dont either Shadaez, but it might be worth learning.
A3:39:33 <clone1018> Shadaez, its easy to learn
A3:39:42 <Shadaez> C++ isn't?
A3:40:04 <clone1018> Nope
A3:40:10 <clone1018> Its more complex structure
A3:40:32 <Shadaez> I just never liked the idea of Python, for some reason.

A3:41:12 <clone1018> http://helloworldsite.he.funpic.de/hello.htm#Python
A3:41:14 <clone1018> :)
A3:41:24 <Graham> languages like python hide a lot of things from you which C++ doesn't
A3:41:28 <Graham> e.g. pointers
A3:41:38 <AndrewPH> "Who here knows python?"

A3:54:16 <Shadaez> 04? lul
A3:54:20 <AndrewPH> 04's smaller
A3:54:26 <VurtualRuler98> FSX does let you crash.
A3:54:31 <David_Davidson> my copy of FSX is 2 dvd's
A3:54:32 <VurtualRuler98> Accelleration adds an F-18!
A3:54:39 <AndrewPH> FSX is like 7 gigs

A3:56:55 <AndrewPH> We used to have 500kb/s but then they did an unauthorized update or some shit on our router
A3:57:01 <AndrewPH> and then I got piss'd off.
A3:57:14 <VurtualRuler98> New router?
A3:57:18 <Koitenshin> so in essence they capped you
A3:57:20 <Shadaez> I download on steam @ 1.1 MB/s sometimes. It's very nice.
A3:57:22 <Koitenshin> and never removed the cap
A3:57:36 <AndrewPH> Koitenshin, I'm going to yell at them
A3:57:39 <AndrewPH> you know

A4:11:14 <clone1018> Without your OS on it
A4:11:34 <Marach> why?
A4:12:10 <clone1018> Because it requires wiggling the hdd connector (forgot name) until you get a windows error saying what programs can't save to what directorys
A4:12:22 <Marach> . . .

A4:13:40 <Marach> i donwloaded a game

A7:08:12 <Snowman> He's one fucked up moron
A7:08:30 <Snowman> He was telling me that other people called my skins shit
A7:08:43 <Snowman> Then I was like "Oh yeah, that's why Notch thinks I'm the best skinner"
A7:08:47 <Snowman> Then he shut up
A7:09:07 <Snowman> And started to add quotes like "snoowmen iz g3y"
A7:09:11 <Snowman> Then I kicked him
A7:09:13 <FalleM> Oh, that loopert dude?
A7:09:13 <VurtualRuler98> I don't think you're the best skinner.
A7:09:20 <VurtualRuler98> You have yet to defeat minecraft face.
A7:09:34 <FalleM> Yeah, I thought he was alright. Untill he spewed 9-year old all over my server.
A7:09:37 <Snowman> <Notch> Snowman probably does better textures imo.
A7:09:37 <Snowman> <Notch> your skins are absolutely top-notch
A7:09:43 <Snowman> <Notch> snowman makes super duper good skins!
A7:09:51 <SMP> just cause notch likes your stuff doesn't make you the best skinner out there

P4:33:29 <bildramer> fff- global warming
P4:33:38 <Jat> division by zero does not equal a number but the function x/y does approach infinity as y approaches 0 so if anything it would actually bea very large number
P4:33:38 <bildramer> IE works fine for me
P4:33:48 <Jat> unless x is 0

P4:34:11 <Jat> from the right
P4:34:19 <bildramer> I guess 0 / 0 can be 0 or 1
P4:34:23 <Jat> no
P4:34:26 <serp> i guess it is undefined
P4:34:27 <Jat> it does not exist
P4:34:29 <bildramer> so let's conveniently define it to be 0.5
P4:34:32 <Jat> it is undefined

P4:34:48 <Skillkills> 0 goes into 0 infinetly many times
P4:34:51 <bildramer> or none
P4:34:52 <bildramer> or 1
P4:34:53 <mail2345> what does a graph of Z=X/Y look like
P4:34:57 <byte[]> just ... shut up if you have no idea what u're talking about
P4:35:01 <mail2345> ^^
P4:35:02 <Jat> 0 does not go into 0 any number of times
P4:35:10 <byte[]> i discussed this like ... 100 times already
P4:35:21 <bildramer> 0/0 = undefined, of course
P4:35:22 <Skillkills> you can add 0 + 0 as many times as you want
P4:35:28 <Skillkills> it will always = 0
P4:35:28 <Skillkills> xD

P5:29:08 <JoeyJo0> Oh wow
P5:29:09 <realg> go to the main wom server to be in it
P5:29:14 <Brett> ON BOOT
P5:29:14 <Brett> worldmanager is initialized 	VVV
P5:29:14 <Brett> 	worldmanager looks in data/maps/ for every map file and initializes a world for each. the default world specified in the server global configuration is the world in 	 	which players will initially spawn and is given ID 0; each world configures itself according to a configuration file in /data/maps/ of the same name as the map.
P5:29:14 <Brett> 		Worlds without configuration individually will use the defaults.
P5:29:14 <Brett> 	worldmanager maintains a WorldList of all worlds (ID => world), with a maximum number of fields N as specified in the server global configuration. 
P5:29:14 <Brett> 	The default world CANNOT be removed at runtime. All other worlds can be dynamically closed and started.
P5:29:14 <Brett> 		Worlds can be started during runtime even if the map file was added while the server is running.
P5:29:15 <Adam01> oh wait
P5:29:16 <Brett> 		Each world maintains its own playerlist. 
P5:29:16 <Brett> 		
P5:29:16 <realg> we have over 20 already
P5:29:17 <bildramer> AAAARGH.
P5:29:18 <Brett> 	Certain commands must be server specified and not routed through gamemode. 	/world list, /world join [worldid], /world create [mapname], /world destroy [worldid]
P5:29:18 <Brett> 											/world kickall [worldid], /world lock [worldid], /world unlock [worldid] (?)
P5:29:20 <Brett> 											/world setdefault [worldid]	
P5:29:20 <Brett> 	Change SetManager => userlevels. Remove setmanager and user flags as a whole (?), instead an integer field for user level. Make Owner something high like 1000 so there  	is lots of differentiation potential.
P5:29:22 <Brett> 	When a player joins a world, unregister them from the current world and register them on their new world. If it isn't already, register process should sent entire map.
P5:29:22 <Brett> 	/ann l [msg] and /ann g [msg] commands. "l" to every player on current world, "g" to every player on every world. Independant of gamemode.
P5:29:24 <Brett> 	globalplayerlist
P5:29:24 <Brett> 	player object contains reference to world ID theya re currently on

P5:32:52 <PuyoDead> If you figure that one out serp, let me know.
P5:33:17 <PuyoDead> It's that most clients have a built in limiter to avoid the flood kick.
P5:33:23 <Skillkills> Its more of a kids game than a 24 year odl mans game
P5:33:42 <serp> i dont understand what age has to do with anything though
P5:33:45 <Brett> I'm not kidding. I went to some page, hit ctrl + A, and pasted it into chat all at once. I also fed it erotic literature :3

P5:34:49 <bildramer> Brett: nice
P5:34:50 <Zedd> No prob. :)
P5:34:54 <PuyoDead> [Skillkills] Because 24 year old men shouldnt be spending thier time on a video game unless they actually program for it or beta test it or ect. ect.
P5:34:55 <vede> What about the game DOESN'T appeal directly to small children?
P5:34:56 <Skillkills> Erm... working, being responsible, trying to earn a living?
P5:34:57 <PuyoDead> What are you, dense?
P5:34:58 <gm|lap> actually, it really depends...
P5:35:07 <serp> i am in univeristy and i have a job
P5:35:10 <bildramer> add gore
P5:35:11 <gm|lap> most servers are G-friendly
P5:35:13 <serp> is that responsibility enough for you?
P5:35:16 <bildramer> instant-grieferless
P5:35:31 <Zedd> Gamers are gamers to the day they die
P5:35:32 <Adam01> What friendly?
P5:35:35 <vede> I mean, you build colorful buildings out of what essentially amount to TOY BLOCKS.
P5:35:40 <Zedd> Minecraft is stressless
P5:35:44 <Adam01> Yeah
P5:35:47 <Zedd> And can get pretty complex, the building.
P5:35:49 <Adam01> Until the server crashes that is...
P5:35:54 <Zedd> That's technical.
P5:35:58 <Zedd> That's not part of the game.
P5:36:03 <Adam01> Yeah...
P5:36:05 <Adam01> I guess
P5:36:08 <mail2345> http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2009-12/new-simulation-renders-entire-known-universe
P5:36:09 <gm|lap> the thing is, you really don't need hacks unless you're in a hurry or you need to get somewhere fast
P5:36:11 <Zedd> Stress less is good.
P5:36:14 <serp> i hate the colorful square buildings though :S
P5:36:15 <Adam01> But its super effective.
P5:36:28 <vede> Also skillkills, you know everyone who is playing Minecraft is testing an alpha, right?
P5:36:34 <Adam01> I hate the crappy sprites people do
P5:36:48 <Adam01> But I still "applaud" them
P5:37:01 <Adam01> (that was the only word I could think of)
P5:37:05 <serp> the sprites are cute
P5:37:05 <Skillkills> Well yes vede but iw as talking about the aactual getting paid version of beta testing
P5:37:06 <Skillkills> xD
P5:37:16 <PuyoDead> Still ridiculous logic.
P5:37:23 <vede> ^^
P5:37:25 <vede> Indeed.
P5:37:31 <Adam01> What, buying in-dev games?
P5:37:47 <MonkeyDKS> What about being really really bored?
P5:37:50 <PuyoDead> It's essentially saying adults should only be working, and have no hobbies or time to themselves.
P5:37:55 <Adam01> Cortex command is in dev, but is f'awesome
P5:37:59 <Brett> Just a quick FYI, this is probably not the place to say that gaming is irresponsible or only for children
P5:38:15 <Skillkills> Who said that?
P5:38:15 <Adam01> Heh
P5:38:17 <Skillkills> xDD
P5:38:18 <vede> I think the "ridiculous logic" was about how adults shouldn't be playing children's games or something.
P5:38:20 <PuyoDead> You.
P5:38:21 <Adam01> Gaming is for everyone

P5:39:55 <JoeyJo0> All the ages up to 13 should be banned.
P5:40:05 <bildramer> yeah...
P5:40:06 <Skillkills> Thats not saying that playing games is irresponsible
P5:40:10 <bildramer> well.
P5:40:11 <MonkeyDKS> All the ages up to 20 should be banned
P5:40:12 <PuyoDead> You are dense.
P5:40:14 <JoeyJo0> A 13-year-old once told me to stop saying "shit"
P5:40:17 <MonkeyDKS> Or 40
P5:40:20 <MonkeyDKS> Or 60
P5:40:23 <JoeyJo0> Because his mom might see it and kick him off the PC.
P5:40:27 <vede>  <Skillkills> Because 24 year old men shouldnt be spending thier time on a video game unless they actually program for it or beta test it or ect. ect.

P5:49:26 <Zedd> but then again, vede, I didn't care
P5:49:33 <vede> Well, good for you.
P5:49:39 <Zedd> The important was that I didn't allow my parents to throw MY electronics out
P5:50:01 <Brett> YAY! I get to plug it again. http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencraft/
P5:50:08 <Zedd> It might be an important detail here that my poor mother is some sort of anti male sociopath
P5:50:15 <vede> But your parents are able to do whatever they like regarding you at twelve years old no matter what the hell you say, so long as they aren't exploiting you or hurting you.
P5:50:32 <Zedd> Learn to stand up early.
P5:50:32 <mail2345> THE INTERNET IS SATAN
P5:50:43 <Zedd> And you won't be caught sitting when the times come.
P5:51:09 <vede> Yeah, make a decent argument, sure, but that doesn't mean you'll always win.
P5:51:40 <Zedd> Oh, hell no.
P5:51:53 <vede> But for some reason, I'm thinking the way you made your parents NOT take your shit away involved throwing little tantrums.
P5:51:56 <Zedd> A lot of my electronic gadgets & games got tossed against my will.
P5:52:02 <Zedd> Still, I saved a good deal of it.
P5:52:07 <Zedd> No.. not tantrums LOL
P5:52:12 <JoeyJo0> And your point?
P5:52:15 <gm|lap> mine's c/lua
P5:52:16 <vede> Zedd, I thought you said they just COULDN'T do it.

P5:52:38 <Zedd> vede, a computer you fight a LOT harder for, than some of the random junk I lost
P5:52:42 <JoeyJo0> First of all, why the hell did your parents toss your games away?
P5:52:45 <gm|lap> the thing i've found with lua is that the objective usually boils down to shoving as much of the core as you can into lua
P5:52:50 <JoeyJo0> Any reason?
P5:52:52 <Zedd> Look at my point above.
P5:52:56 <gm|lap> that was a long line without a comma.
P5:52:59 <Zedd> My mother is an anti-male sociopath

P5:53:36 <JoeyJo0> Then you lock the door.
P5:53:55 <Zedd> one small tactic
P5:53:55 <vede> Zedd, which OBVIOUSLY means that:
P5:53:56 <vede>  <Zedd> Kids over 12 who let their parents kick them off their own comps (if it's not the kid's comp, doesn't apply) --> spineless idiots
P5:54:04 <AndrewPH> Speak some asian-ese for me.
P5:54:06 <Zedd> Yes, yes it does, vede.
P5:54:18 <JoeyJo0> Actually
P5:54:20 <Zedd> I had higher stakes.
P5:54:25 <JoeyJo0> Your parents probably paid for your computer.
P5:54:25 <Zedd> But I have no respect for you
P5:54:27 <Zedd> No.
P5:54:29 <Zedd> LOL.
P5:54:42 <vede> So your experience with an obviously NOT ORDINARY mother applies even to people with totally reasonable parents.
P5:54:50 <JoeyJo0> Because I doubt you have the money to buy your PC on the age of 12...
P5:55:19 <JoeyJo0> you can't do any work, and small jobs which every kid does when he's 12 don't give you a lot.
P5:55:30 <JoeyJo0> So you have allowance, which is basically your parents paying for things.
P5:55:39 <Zedd> My mother, who is who I refer to when I say "parents"
P5:55:42 <Zedd> Gave me no allowance
P5:55:47 <Zedd> And bought me no electronics
P5:55:48 <vede> And since your mother just plain hated people with penises, that obviously didn't happen.
P5:55:52 <vede> So you, what?
P5:55:55 <vede> Stole all your money?
P5:56:02 <JoeyJo0> Then how did you get the money?
P5:56:07 <Zedd> I say it applies to all kids over 12. Gotta learn to have a f-ing spine.
P5:56:12 <Zedd> I didn't buy my comp at 12.
P5:56:22 <JoeyJo0> <Zedd> Kids over 12 who let their parents kick them off their own comps (if it's not the kid's comp, doesn't apply) --> spineless idiots
P5:56:29 <JoeyJo0> kick them off their own comps (if it's not the kid's comp, doesn't apply)
P5:56:29 <Zedd> Yes.
P5:56:33 <JoeyJo0> own comps
P5:56:36 <Zedd> Own comps
P5:56:40 <Zedd> Being the KID"S COMPS
P5:56:42 <vede> Dude, you need to realize that having a fucking spine doesn't involve being irrational.
P5:56:45 <Zedd> Dude.
P5:56:51 <Zedd> I'm 19.
P5:56:56 <Zedd> Lots of friends in Middle & High
P5:57:05 <Zedd> Not one of them has a comptuer thanks to their parents
P5:57:07 <Zedd> Those that do
P5:57:12 <Zedd> Worked outside their house
P5:57:15 <JoeyJo0> I get kicked off of the computer a lot of the times.
P5:57:17 <vede> And honestly, a lot of the time when parents (NOTE, REASONABLE GODDAMN PARENTS) want kids to get off their computer or stop texting at night they have a really goddamn good reason to.
P5:57:19 <Zedd> And earned the $$ themselves
P5:57:23 <JoeyJo0> And most of them have a perfectly viable reason.
P5:57:34 <JoeyJo0> The time where my dad banned me from the computer for stupid reasons is gone.
P5:57:45 <Zedd> No... not any good reasons, looking at peopel I know
P5:58:28 <JoeyJo0> Still, you had to listen to your parents.
P5:58:40 <JoeyJo0> Sure, you can rebel against them, and it might work to some extend.
P5:58:47 <JoeyJo0> But you can't keep going against them.
P5:59:13 <clone1018> I bought my computer with job money

P5:59:38 <Zedd> CLONE1018 HAS IT!
P5:59:41 <Zedd> oops.
P5:59:43 <vede> Zedd, because they have legal control over you.

P6:00:19 <Animator> My parents bought me my laptop when I was 12.
P6:00:33 <vede> No, the only way you can WIN is if your parents are retards who let their kids walk all over them.
P6:01:07 <Zedd> Animator -- you have really really f-ing nice parents
P6:01:08 <clone1018> It does not count if they bought it

P6:01:32 <vede> I've had a computer since around ten-ish.
P6:01:36 <JoeyJo0> My parents bought me one because I got accepted to some special class for super-smart kids.
P6:01:41 <JoeyJo0> And stuff
P6:01:42 <MonkeyDKS> Puyo, how old are you?
P6:01:45 <Zedd> Do you not remember your childhoold, puyo?
P6:02:00 <PuyoDead> I'm 30, but getting a laptop was certainly not an option when I was a kid.
P6:02:09 <MonkeyDKS> Damn...you got me beat by two years
P6:02:12 <PuyoDead> Getting a Gameboy, however, was awesome.
P6:02:23 <MonkeyDKS> and walkmans were all the rage!

P6:02:38 <Zedd> LOL...
P6:02:39 <Zedd> silly.

P6:02:44 <JoeyJo0> I currently buy stuff with my own money. I never have problems with my parents
P6:02:47 <clone1018> I think I still have it
P6:02:49 <Zedd> I had a GB Pocket.
P6:02:54 <Zedd> I do NOT still have it.
P6:02:56 <MonkeyDKS> My brother found one of my parents old 8-tracks...
P6:03:10 <JoeyJo0> When I want to buy something new, I'm just going to talk with them, if they could possibly lend me some money.

P6:05:48 <vede> Right.
P6:05:56 <KamikazeBeat> hello
P6:05:57 <Zedd> They're funny and they're easy to beat at games.
P6:06:08 <Zedd> Heya Divine Wind Beat person.
P6:06:22 <KamikazeBeat> greetz
P6:06:25 <JoeyJo0> You know what's the problem with most 12-year-olds.
P6:06:32 <JoeyJo0> They always go against their parents, and create problems.
P6:06:34 <Animator> Zedd, they're also getting me another one since this one's getting too old. I'll give my old one to my Mom, because she wants a computer to her own.
P6:06:39 <JoeyJo0> And then they whine about their parents being irrational.
P6:06:57 <JoeyJo0> But if you just 'go with the flow', then your parents would be a lot most easy-going.
P6:07:06 <clone1018> AndrewPH, you there?
P6:07:07 <vede> Indeed, JoeyJo0
P6:07:12 <AndrewPH> query me
P6:07:26 <JoeyJo0> My parents totally don't care about my going to a party and getting back drunk, as long as I take a bucket with me and clean up all the mess.
P6:07:30 <Zedd> JoeyJo0, of all the 13-17 yo kids I know, which is a good number
P6:07:37 <Zedd> Not one single set of parents
P6:07:45 <Zedd> Has a rational "flow"
P6:07:47 <Zedd> To go with.
P6:07:55 <JoeyJo0> In that case, you don't know an awful lot of those.
P6:08:10 <Zedd> I went to a private school, 1st - 12th. 
P6:08:16 <vede> Zedd, of all the 13-17 year old kids I know, which is an absurdly large number, have an easily recognizable flow to go with.
P6:08:18 <Zedd> I have a fuckton of friends who are young

P6:08:41 <Zedd> vede, look more closely
P6:08:46 <JoeyJo0> Sure, there are a few stupid parents
P6:09:00 <Zedd> A few?
P6:09:02 <JoeyJo0> But having strict parents is different from now having a recognizable flow
P6:09:06 <vede> I, and all my friends, have a pretty simple "flow".
P6:09:10 <vede> ...
P6:09:14 <vede> *have parents who have
P6:09:57 <bildramer> epic spleef in the pic serv :D
P6:10:06 <clone1018> I remember I had a windows 98 until about 11 months ago
P6:10:09 <Zedd> The norm, in my experience,
P6:10:21 <Zedd> Is that parents push excess artificual responsibility on their kids
P6:10:35 <Zedd> While allowing the zip time to decompress / do their own shit. 
P6:10:35 <JoeyJo0> My parents don't really care much about what I do, as long as it hurts no-one, is legal, and follow their rules.
P6:10:44 <vede> From what I can see of the way you describe the place you live, adults are overbearing freaks who like watching their children squirm under their thumbs.
P6:10:51 <Zedd> Yes, vede.
P6:10:56 <Zedd> Most parents I know are like that.
P6:11:00 <PuyoDead> Sheesh, back.
P6:11:06 <vede> Then I'm pretty sure you live in a stupid fantasy world.
P6:11:11 <JoeyJo0> If your parents understand that you are getting responsible, they are lowering the rules they enforce on you, in the thought that you'd keep them without being enforced.
P6:11:18 <Zedd> No, nto really, vede, there are exceptions
P6:11:32 <JoeyJo0> Zedd, really.
P6:11:36 <bildramer> ...
P6:11:36 <JoeyJo0> Never ever get kids.
P6:11:39 <JoeyJo0> For your own good.
P6:11:40 <bildramer> :D
P6:11:52 <JoeyJo0> I'd feel REALLY sorry for those kids.
P6:11:56 <bildramer> my parents don't seem to understand I'm spending my time...
P6:12:03 <bildramer> they're too easy to trick
P6:12:05 <vede> Either that or you lack the maturity to see anything other than evil in anyone who doesn't want you do the things you do.
P6:12:06 <bildramer> lucky me :D
P6:12:18 <Zedd> The problem with that, JoeyJo0, or at least so I think, is that none of the parents of people I know understand that their children are getting responsibility

P6:14:32 <JoeyJo0> A teacher at my school has two of her sons in my grade.

P6:22:06 <vede> Hm, true.

P6:37:13 <Zedd> theism?
P6:37:15 <Wareya> buddhism

P8:08:06 <Aeomin> is pyJTE made by JTE too? or was unofficial
P8:08:24 <Koitenshin|Sleep> will you charge for yours too or will it be free?
P8:08:34 <clone1018> pyJTE is made by mail
P8:08:34 <mail2345> unoffical
P8:08:35 <PuyoDead> If they don't look at the message the forums list before clicking the link, AND miss that, AND assume help is for MC, they are hopeless no matter what we do.
P8:08:36 <Shadaez> Unofficial mod for an unofficial server. WUT?

P8:08:55 <mail2345> @puyo that would be the motd
P8:08:57 <AndrewPH> it's a port of JTE's to python
P8:08:59 <mail2345> they see a link
P8:09:03 <mail2345> and it says help
P8:09:04 <Shadaez> HSHUT UP HOMEO
P8:09:06 <mail2345> and they click on it
P8:09:12 <PuyoDead> Did you not just read what I said?
P8:09:18 <mail2345> right
P8:09:23 <mail2345> but grey text is hard to read
P8:09:31 <mail2345> compared to bright green text
P8:09:33 <PuyoDead> Have you clicked the link on the forums?
P8:09:37 <LG_Legacy> Shadaez?
P8:09:43 <mail2345> i have
P8:09:53 <mail2345> but it is possible for sombody to ignore the grey text

P8:11:14 <PuyoDead> What? It says not to join. That is a pretty simple concept.
P8:11:16 <mail2345> right
P8:11:17 <Nalok> Yeah
P8:11:20 <mail2345> but they don't know clicking
P8:11:23 <mail2345> means joining
P8:11:28 <Shadaez> What do you mean?
P8:11:31 <PuyoDead> If they don't they're an idiot.
P8:11:31 <Super-Dot> What's the forum topic with the mibbit link in it?

P8:11:53 <Visiiri> Can someone here help me? I am trying to change the color of fog in minecraft with Cheat Engine
P8:11:56 <mail2345> they don't know to type /join #help
P8:11:59 <Visiiri> how would I do this?
P8:12:02 <mail2345> and thus removing the motd
P8:12:10 <mail2345> would prevent them from getting onto #help

P8:12:41 <Super-Dot> I have to agree with mail here
P8:12:43 <PuyoDead> Sorry to bug you, TD, but is forcing people to skip the MOTD forbidden?
P8:12:47 <Shadaez> Use paint.net or gimp. It has to be transparent, if you edit it in paint it will remove transparentcy
P8:12:53 <Shadaez> (bad spelling D:)
10P8:13:02 * Conundrumer (chatzilla@cpe-72-229-63-237.nyc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P8:13:07 <Nalok> I can't find transparency on paint.net
P8:13:08 <Conundrumer> is it just me
P8:13:14 <Conundrumer> or are servers getting randomly flooded?
P8:13:34 <Shadaez> I'm not familiar with Paint.net, but try the eraser.
P8:13:36 <PuyoDead> Nalok, make a new layer and make sure its transparent. Anything you delete above that layer should be transparent.
P8:13:46 <Nalok> Ah
P8:13:51 <PuyoDead> Either way, usi... what Shadaez said.
P8:13:54 <TestDummy> PuyoDead: Nothing ever said that you had to read it, but we generally assume that you've read it and agree to its terms if you've made a connection to the network and haven't broken it.
P8:13:56 <Visiiri> Shadez, it's not am image
P8:13:57 <TestDummy> AFAIK
P8:14:14 <TestDummy> I mean, generally if you make a complete connection, you're automatically sent back the MOTD.
P8:14:21 <Shadaez> I'm talking to Nalok visiiri.
P8:14:22 <TestDummy> So clients choose to ignore it, it's not as if they never received it.
P8:14:25 <Visiiri> oh, sorry :<
P8:14:28 <Shadaez> The fog colour thing requires cheat engine.
P8:14:31 <Visiiri> Yeah
P8:14:36 <PuyoDead> See, mail is saying we need to make it so when people connect from the forums, they don't see the MOTD whatsoever.
P8:14:37 <Visiiri> but I can't figure out how to edith the hex
P8:14:39 <Shadaez> I have no experience doing that.
P8:14:48 <Shadaez> Can't remember who did that...
P8:14:52 <Visiiri> Zuriki
P8:15:03 <Visiiri> And zuriki has since ran off with citricsquid to antartica
P8:15:08 <PuyoDead> I'm just curious if that's even allowed.
P8:15:10 <Visiiri> *antarctica
P8:15:21 <Visiiri> And cryzed
P8:15:27 <Visiiri> :< The good people are gone
P8:15:34 <Koitenshin|Sleep> and the guy who did the city generator
P8:15:37 <Shadaez> Puyodead

P8:15:40 <Koitenshin|Sleep> he disappeared too

P8:15:55 <Visiiri> Ah, yes
P8:15:58 <Visiiri> it started with a P
P8:16:01 <Shadaez> Just put a disclaimer page up before the join ling?
P8:16:02 <Visiiri> I saw him the other day
P8:16:02 <Zedd> Shadaez, PuyoDead talked a moment ago?
P8:16:08 <David_Davidson> really Visiiri?
P8:16:13 <Visiiri> Really really
P8:16:17 <David_Davidson> huh
P8:16:18 <Shadaez>  yeah?
P8:16:19 <Visiiri> It was two days ago, actually
P8:16:20 <PuyoDead> Shadaez, that's how it is now, but mail thinks we need to go even further.
P8:16:24 <David_Davidson> I know his city gen was real
P8:16:26 <Visiiri> it was very breif, but I saw him
P8:16:29 <Shadaez> Oh.
P8:16:31 <David_Davidson> I have one of the actual maps
P8:16:37 <Shadaez> Make them type "I UNDERSTAND!"
P8:16:48 <mail2345> maybe
P8:16:50 <Shadaez> lol
P8:16:52 <mail2345> insert a small irc primer
P8:16:56 <Visiiri> David: hehehe
P8:17:00 <Visiiri> I have the generator
P8:17:03 <mail2345> and then quiz them on it
P8:17:04 <David_Davidson> >_>
P8:17:07 <mail2345> before letting them use it
13P8:17:10 * David_Davidson tackles Visiiri
P8:17:10 <Visiiri> I am angery!
13P8:17:10 * Visiiri pokes David_Davidson with the Needle of Oblivion dealing 9257 damage!
P8:17:14 <Visiiri> It's because I asked for it when survival came out
P8:17:15 <David_Davidson> hand it over
P8:17:19 <Super-Dot> PuyoDead: You could solve it partway by amending the text telling them not to CLICK ON #help
P8:17:24 <Visiiri> So I could prepare for multiplayer survival
P8:17:28 <Conundrumer> parthon
P8:17:32 <PuyoDead> See, he has a point that not having the option to even click to join it in the first place would help, but I'm curious if it's forbidden to strip the MOTD from people.
P8:17:36 <Super-Dot> Since that doesn't require an understanding of IRC
P8:17:40 <mail2345> super-dot's idea also works
P8:17:42 <PuyoDead> Hmm, good point, super.

P8:18:13 <PuyoDead> I mean, I know you can turn it off client side anyway.
P8:18:13 <David_Davidson> Me and visiiri are discussing the city generator
P8:18:22 <PuyoDead> Couple things at the same time, vede.
P8:18:40 <David_Davidson> so visiiri....mind uploading the file somewhere?
P8:19:15 <Visiiri> hehe
P8:19:16 <Visiiri> I do mind

P10:03:15 <Jat> what i mean is why is it better than regular wine?
P10:03:34 <Shadaez> commercially supported, probably

P10:04:26 <Jat> is it faster or something?

P10:05:00 <Animator> Rockmael's questioning your ban there.
P10:05:07 <Zedd-AFK> It's supported, period
P10:05:10 <Zedd-AFK> It is fairly stable
P10:05:19 <Zedd-AFK> Wine on OS X has ZERO support
P10:05:23 <Zedd-AFK> In fact it's hard to find
P10:05:32 <Zedd-AFK> CoG, however, is supported.
P10:05:39 <Zedd-AFK> Assuming you have a legal copy.
P10:05:51 <Jat> what exactly do you mean by support?

P10:16:31 <Koitenshin|LAVA> This is really bothering me.
P10:16:43 <Koitenshin|LAVA> You can't do good skins with the way MC is set up.
P10:17:14 <Koitenshin|LAVA> 64x32 is good an all.
P10:17:21 <Koitenshin|LAVA> but 65x32 would help me even more
P10:17:43 <Koitenshin|LAVA> most bodies are divided between that center line
P10:18:35 <PuyoDead> Yea, sometimes I like having the symetrical sides, while other times I wish I had a center to use.

13P10:21:09 * Zedd-AFK nods at Shadaez
P10:21:47 <Zedd-AFK> Puyodead, Koitenshin, what if it were another option? 
P10:21:52 <clone1018|MM> Minecraft mania in 1hr 30 min!!!
P10:22:07 <Zedd-AFK> As in, a skin can be 65x32 OR 64x32?
P10:22:25 <Shadaez> why don't you like 64?
P10:22:33 <PuyoDead> I actually thought of that, and I would like that, but...
P10:22:48 <Zedd-AFK> But?
P10:22:59 <Koitenshin|LAVA> I don't like 64x32 because most of the character skins I want to make use that center line in their original art
P10:23:01 <PuyoDead> People have enough trouble figuring out skins in the first place, that would cause so much confusion to so many people.
P10:23:26 <Shadaez> or just make htem 128x64
P10:23:39 <Shadaez> then the center wouldn't be as big.
P10:23:42 <Koitenshin|LAVA> Still wouldn't solve my problem Shadaez
P10:23:48 <Shadaez> 65x32 would bother me :|
P10:23:49 <PuyoDead> That won't be happening.
P10:24:09 <Koitenshin|LAVA> 65x32 would make it easier to make skins
P10:24:17 <Shadaez> don't see how
P10:24:19 <Zedd-AFK> Here's another question!
P10:24:30 <Zedd-AFK> With 64 pixels
P10:24:30 <Koitenshin|LAVA> what if your character has a symbol on their forehead?
P10:24:34 <Koitenshin|LAVA> like a diamond?
P10:24:36 <PuyoDead> But having a center line.
P10:24:39 <Zedd-AFK> Do you have enough to make a double line?
P10:24:44 <Koitenshin|LAVA> no
P10:24:47 <PuyoDead> Say, to make a 1 pixel nose or something.
P10:24:50 <Zedd-AFK> No?
P10:24:53 <Koitenshin|LAVA> it wouldnt be a diamond then
P10:24:55 <Shadaez> get creative.
P10:25:26 <Koitenshin|LAVA> I'm making "Chill the fuck out guys! I got this."
P10:25:28 <PuyoDead> It makes for a rather ugly Prince of all Cosmos skin.

P10:27:23 <Aeomin> creepy smile
P10:27:25 <PuyoDead> Yea, not a bad skin, just kinda creepy.
P10:27:32 <Shadaez> well
P10:27:34 <Shadaez> thats how she wanted it.
P10:29:00 <Shadaez> god, Windows Forms is so simple.
P10:29:29 <Aeomin> simple as in?
P10:29:29 <Shadaez> and awwwwwesome
P10:29:43 <Shadaez> easy to use
P10:30:05 <Aeomin> well, the IDE did everything
P10:30:05 <Shadaez> I was all looking at GTKmm and wxWidget and ugh looked so hard
P10:30:45 <Shadaez> so? :(
P10:32:10 <Shadaez> Anyone here have an aquarium?
P10:32:24 <PuyoDead> I did years ago.

P10:57:31 <Shadaez> (Birthday was recent)
P10:57:32 <Koitenshin|LAVA> Thats why.

P10:57:51 <Koitenshin|LAVA> 24 here
P10:57:55 <PuyoDead> Oh yea? I have you beat.
P10:57:57 <Zedd-AFK> So, what?
P10:57:57 <Koitenshin|LAVA> I was born in 1985
P10:58:14 <Shadaez> Power rangers was plenty popluar when I was a kid.
P10:58:14 <Koitenshin|LAVA> Basically it means the 90's were my plaything
P10:58:22 <PuyoDead> As were the 80's to me.
P10:58:22 <Zedd-AFK> In 4 ~ 5 years did P. Rangers go from "OMG! AWESOME!" to "Fuck this shit" ?
P10:58:27 <Shadaez> My cousin loved it.
P10:58:34 <Koitenshin|LAVA> Yeah but the height of the series was the original
P10:58:42 <Zedd-AFK> The late 90's were blah to me. But then I was young.
P10:58:48 <Shadaez> And? I seen it as a kid...
P10:59:02 <Koitenshin|LAVA> How old of a kid though?
P10:59:06 <Shadaez> No idea.
P10:59:22 <Koitenshin|LAVA> It depends on when you saw the series what impact it had.
P10:59:24 <Shadaez> I think i was into it a little because I remember watching the first movie on VHS.
P10:59:33 <PuyoDead> The 80's are my nostalgia reservoir.
P10:59:40 <Shadaez> I jhust hated the lady and couldn't get over it
P10:59:44 <Shadaez> she made me mad.
P10:59:52 <Shadaez> with the stupid hat thing, wtf was that
P10:59:55 <Shadaez> makes me rage
P10:59:56 <Koitenshin|LAVA> from 197(whenever tron came out) to 1998 is my nostalgia factor

P11:00:35 <Koitenshin|LAVA> And I'll form the head
P11:00:37 <Zedd-AFK> Okay, my nostalgia has to be '96 to '99

P11:02:03 <Zedd-AFK> Metroid will never ever f-ing ever hit the level of Zelda. But, Metroid games are f-ing fun
P11:02:03 <PuyoDead> I still regard LttP as my favorite, even though I played the hell out of all of 'em.
P11:02:05 <Zedd-AFK> Hi, akai.
P11:02:22 <Skinning|Koitenshin> LTTP is clearly one of the best
P11:02:25 <Zedd-AFK> TP is actually the best (On GCN). Basically OoT on Steroids.
P11:02:29 <Zedd-AFK> And LttP is #3.
P11:02:30 <Skinning|Koitenshin> But Dark prophecy will be even better
P11:02:44 <Shadaez> Metroid 2 was actually very good.
P11:02:46 <Shadaez> On GB.
P11:02:49 <PuyoDead> I do admit, TP was a good one.
P11:02:53 <Shadaez> PT sucked.
P11:02:54 <vede> Yes, they f-ing are f-ing fun.
P11:02:55 <Shadaez> dddddddddddd
P11:03:00 <vede> Those fucking Metroid games.
P11:03:17 <Zedd-AFK> The first two Zelda's are a bother.

P11:03:29 <PuyoDead> I absolutely love the first Zelda.
P11:03:29 <vede> Also: Metroid > Zelda
P11:03:36 <Zedd> No way, vede
P11:03:41 <vede> Yes way!
P11:03:53 <PuyoDead> That's just an apples to oranges comparison.
P11:03:58 <Shadaez> You're an apple.
P11:04:10 <PuyoDead> I still have everything memorized in the first Zelda.
P11:04:15 <vede> Well, I happen to like oranges better than apples. (Apples are Metroid)
P11:04:21 <vede> ...
P11:04:25 <vede> (ORANGES ARE METROID)
P11:04:30 <PuyoDead> I think you... yea.
P11:04:31 <Shadaez> oranges are delicious.
P11:04:45 <Shadaez> One of the only fruit I like.
P11:04:53 <Shadaez> Actually, all citrus fruit are awesome. Except grapefruit.
P11:04:54 <Zedd> It's dangerous to go alone.
P11:04:59 <vede> But I did really like the first Zelda.
13P11:05:04 * Zedd offers out oranges
P11:05:07 <Zedd> Here, take this.
P11:05:08 <Zedd> :D
P11:05:20 <vede> They just declined in quality over time.
P11:05:24 <PuyoDead> Hell, I still remember where to bomb all the overworld walls, what bushes to burn, etc.
P11:05:29 <vede> Except for Wind Waker.
P11:05:47 <Zedd> Different style, different ideas
P11:05:53 <vede> Wind Waker and the original are the only Zelda games I really liked.
P11:05:56 <Zedd> The MM -- WW -- > timeline split
P11:06:00 <PuyoDead> More apples/oranges.
P11:06:02 <Zedd> Are fun, but honestly
P11:06:09 <Shadaez> Never played MM:|
P11:06:14 <Zedd> TP is the best. OoT 2. LttP 3.
P11:06:16 <vede> MM was particularly bad.
P11:06:19 <Shadaez> I think that's when I got into PC gaming and forgot about consoles for a while.
P11:06:21 <PuyoDead> MM was probably the most different of them all.
P11:06:23 <Zedd> MM was ecccch.
P11:06:35 <Zedd> It was fun, but it was weird ass and not nearly as good.
P11:06:44 <PuyoDead> Even though it was pretty much built on OoT, the whole system was different.
P11:07:08 <Zedd> Well, there's no reliance on masks in OoT
P11:07:12 <Zedd> Just the sidequest
P11:07:22 <Zedd> Annnnnd no real important time manipulation
P11:07:34 <vede> Actually, screw it. I'm not working in my server control panel.

P11:19:44 <Skillkills> Im working on making multi worlds for JTE

P11:20:30 <Skinning|Koitenshin> D3
P11:20:34 <Bradness> okay.
P11:20:55 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Build something decent in the guest area to get builder permissions
P11:21:32 <Bradness> why is there like +hax and -noclip on titles and descriptions?
P11:21:39 <Bradness> Is it the hacker protection thingy for MC?
P11:21:50 <Skinning|Koitenshin> I built a floating island complete with trees, flowers, and a house
P11:21:59 <Shadaez> heh
P11:21:59 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Yes Bradness
P11:22:07 <Shadaez> I made a giant floating island that took HUOPRS
P11:22:18 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Mine took about 45 minutes
P11:22:20 <Shadaez> and then the map was reset.
P11:22:22 <Skinning|Koitenshin> No hacks
P11:22:42 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Fuck Yeah, "Still Alive" just came on the mix list
P11:22:48 <Bradness> omg... d3 server is epic... the changing times on the walls is sooo cool.

P11:24:19 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Custom server architecture
P11:24:29 <Bradness> what language?
P11:24:48 <Skinning|Koitenshin> it's funny. An image showing peodbear standing there is against photobuckets rules

P11:28:33 <Skinning|Koitenshin> Make a server in c++ iif you want
P11:28:36 <Skinning|Koitenshin> it's up to you.
