A3:55:36 <Tripknotix> hey do u guy sknow where i can get a map that is basically the ground
A3:56:49 <Tripknotix> then about 20 ocean level, then below that is just a large cut out of ground using invunerable blocks on all edges, but gray destructible blocks filling that area
A3:56:51 <Tripknotix> ?
A3:57:14 <Tripknotix> i tried to use the generators, but .bat files in windows 7 just open and close
A3:57:21 <Tripknotix> and dont actually produce a file
A3:57:46 <utilitas> use the editor
A3:57:53 <Tripknotix> the .jar file wont open
A3:58:08 <utilitas> get new flash and java then
A3:58:12 <utilitas> if you got vista
A3:58:15 <Tripknotix> win7
A3:58:16 <utilitas> reinstall to XP
A3:58:29 <Tripknotix> theres no option in rc1 to go backwarsd to xp
A3:58:47 <Tripknotix> there is xp-mode, in windows 7
A3:58:53 <Tripknotix> but its just a virtual machine running windows xp
A3:59:05 <Tripknotix> and sharing the same desktop and startmenu and enviroment, swapping
A3:59:14 <Tripknotix> at the push of a button
A3:59:16 <Tripknotix> but other wise
A3:59:40 <Tripknotix> i wouldnt be surprised if u asked me to just reinstall to dos utilitas
A3:59:52 <Tripknotix> get updated
A3:59:58 <Tripknotix> its 2009 not 2001
A4:00:38 <utilitas> vista got only a good design
A4:00:50 <utilitas> but its windows 98
A4:01:26 <Tripknotix> id ont use vista
A4:01:34 <Tripknotix> its bloated
A4:01:41 <Tripknotix> and buggy even in sp2
A4:01:55 <Tripknotix> windows 7 is far superior, and runs on less ram then windows xp
A4:02:29 <Tripknotix> http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/windows-7-runs-on-a-pentium-ii-with-96mb-ram-20090622/
A4:02:39 <Tripknotix> Windows 7 runs on a pentium2 with 96 mb of ram
A4:02:49 <Tripknotix> Windows XP is bloated and requires 128mb of ram
A4:02:50 <utilitas> you need good java to run
A4:02:51 <utilitas> it
A4:02:53 <Tripknotix> xp = inferior
A4:02:55 <Tripknotix> 7 = superior
A4:03:11 <utilitas> vista = even more inferior
A4:03:15 <Tripknotix> vista = fail
A4:03:36 <Tripknotix> all they did was design a new base to build on, then bloated it
A4:03:54 <utilitas> the base is DOS + win 95
A4:04:07 <utilitas> they given it a new classy look and published it
A4:04:54 <Tripknotix> Scores
A4:04:54 <Tripknotix> XP: 3.5 / 5
A4:04:54 <Tripknotix> Vista: 3 / 5
A4:04:54 <Tripknotix> Windows 7: 4.5 / 5
A4:05:02 <Tripknotix> performance scores
A4:05:48 <Tripknotix> but ya, do these tools come with any easy editors?
A4:05:50 <utilitas> XP can run any game exept DOS
A4:06:09 <Tripknotix> xp cannot run direct x 10 , 10.1, and the almost released 11 games
A4:06:12 <utilitas> easy editors?
A4:06:23 <Tripknotix> so xp cannot run 90% of all new games =(
A4:06:24 <Tripknotix> = fail
A4:06:29 <utilitas> it can run direct C 10
A4:06:45 <Tripknotix> what gaurentees do u have on stability or superior framerate?
A4:06:53 <utilitas> but normaly it doesnt got the good hardware
A4:06:54 <Tripknotix> the only thing xp beats windows 7 in, is older games
A4:07:44 <utilitas> btw i could make the map
A4:07:57 <utilitas> but you should describe its details
A4:08:05 <utilitas> flat ground or normaly generated?
A4:08:28 <utilitas> the overal size?
A4:08:30 <Tripknotix> http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/gaming-smackdown-windows-xp-vs-windows-vista-vs-windows-7-604178?artc_pg=2
A4:08:38 <Tripknotix> the stats are pretty close across teh board
A4:08:49 <Tripknotix> but when u launch far cry 2, win 7 leaps forward
A4:08:53 <Tripknotix> oh
A4:09:01 <Tripknotix> flat or nroamlly generated
A4:09:03 <Tripknotix> but the thigns i need
A4:09:22 <Tripknotix> flat would probably be easiest
A4:09:27 <Tripknotix> and would do just fine
A4:09:34 <utilitas> ok then flat
A4:09:42 <utilitas> but the overal size of the map?
A4:10:01 <Tripknotix> 256 x 256 x 256, hrese the thing
A4:10:05 <Tripknotix> 128 should be above ground
A4:10:34 <Tripknotix> about 10 blocks down should be water
A4:10:47 <Tripknotix> except, u dont see any water
A4:10:50 <Tripknotix> because its a flat ground map
A4:10:57 <Tripknotix> in order to stop the water

A4:11:07 <Tripknotix> after those 10 blocks below ground is gray rocks
A4:11:11 <Tripknotix> just nothing but gray rocks
A4:11:26 <Tripknotix> to keep the water from going into that area, it needs to have a side wall shield of permanent blocks
A4:11:40 <Tripknotix> basically it lines the entire map underground
A4:11:44 <Tripknotix> even the floor bottom
A4:11:48 <utilitas> writing it down
A4:12:13 <Tripknotix> that lining shoudl go all the way up to about 10 before the ground level
A4:12:25 <Tripknotix> so water can be "forced' in by just knocking some regular blocks out, when wanted
A4:12:44 <utilitas> 256 x 256 x 256 128 should be above ground about 10 blocks down should be water after those 10 blocks below ground is gray rocks to keep the water from going into that area, it needs to have a side wall shield of permanent blocks basically it lines the entire map underground even the floor bottom that lining shoudl go all the way up to about 10 before the ground level  so water can be "forced' in by just knocking some regular blocks out, when wanted
A4:12:47 <utilitas> ok?
A4:13:41 <utilitas> ill try
A4:14:11 <Tripknotix> yeah =)
A4:14:17 <Tripknotix> im gonna try one of those osci eidotrs
A4:14:27 <Tripknotix> see if i can knock it out real quick =P
A4:14:32 <Tripknotix> ive never editted
A4:14:33 <Tripknotix> so i might fail
A4:14:46 <Tripknotix> sounds better than those generators =X
A4:16:52 <utilitas> ground grassy/non-grassy?
A4:18:46 <Tripknotix> grassy
A4:19:29 <utilitas> i dont understand the water part much
A4:19:35 <Tripknotix> well
A4:19:38 <Tripknotix> the water isnt in the map at all
A4:19:45 <utilitas> 10 blocks of water under the ground?
A4:19:51 <Tripknotix> well no
A4:20:01 <Tripknotix> just the possibility of water to get into those 10 blocks tall worth
A4:20:07 <Tripknotix> those 10 blocks should be filled with grass
A4:20:11 <Tripknotix> or dirt
A4:20:13 <utilitas> normal rock there?
A4:20:25 <Tripknotix> just dirt, so the ground can be dug into soil
A4:20:36 <Tripknotix> after that just gray rocks
A4:20:43 <Tripknotix> after those 10 below ground level
A4:20:59 <utilitas> and nothing after rock?

A4:22:41 <Tripknotix> the rocks go from those 10 to the very bottom of the map
A4:22:46 <Tripknotix> i mean after the 10
A4:23:17 <utilitas> hmmm it frozen
A4:24:01 <Tripknotix> o.O
A4:24:16 <Tripknotix> was it too awesome of an idea for the program?

A5:14:41 <Tripknotix> k i asked u a question with a 3 letter answer
A5:14:43 <citricsquid> Thread is hilarious, bunch of idiots clearly registered for trolling, you don't call yourself "niggs" if you dislike racism.
A5:14:45 <Tripknotix> some how u turned that into a battle
A5:15:14 <Wolfram> Tripknotix, what on earth are you talking about
A5:15:27 <Wolfram> And you should probably do away with that thread, citricsquid

A5:15:47 <Wolfram> I'd have done it myself, but since you already addressed it I figured I'd leave you to it
A5:15:48 <Tripknotix> this game is so addicting
A5:16:07 <citricsquid> mahhhhhnnnnnn, I liked it though, I'll just put it into hidden admin section then :)
A5:16:14 <Wolfram> Haha, suit yourself
A5:16:28 <Tripknotix> is there anything planned to be done about the hackers that fly around rapidly dropping trails of blocks through the sky and deleting peoples stuff in weird designs
A5:16:33 <Wolfram> I just think that as long as people can access it, mail will continue to have his reputation damaged
A5:17:17 <citricsquid> Tripknotix: Notch is using every method he knows to prevent this, it'll eventually be properly blocked, I'm sure he'll address it further when survival is finished.

A5:17:44 <Wolfram> It's not a huge deal yet, anyway. OPs can still ban people who hack if they so choose
A5:17:46 <citricsquid> Wolfram: Does that damage his reputation though? I read through it and it made him out to be a pretty stand up guy, he fought his corner properly and came across not racist in the slightest.
A5:18:00 <Wolfram> Well, you and I know that, yes
A5:18:04 <Wolfram> Because we read the whole thread
A5:18:16 <Wolfram> But we also know better than most that many people will skim it at best
A5:18:20 <citricsquid> True, I guess I will then :)
A5:18:26 <tripel> hey i got banned from forums and i need to know who to talk to?
A5:18:32 <citricsquid> I banned you.
A5:18:35 <tripel> ok
A5:18:51 <citricsquid> wait, no I didn't. I thought you claimed "niggs" was a different person?
A5:19:03 <Wolfram> Two people in the same room, he said.
A5:19:04 <tripel> niggs is a different person, this is tripel
A5:19:10 <tripel> niggs is my roommate
A5:19:13 <Wolfram> I didn't notice either of them being banned
A5:19:13 <citricsquid> I only banned niggs though.
A5:19:18 <Wolfram> According to their titles, anyway
A5:19:28 <citricsquid> Niggs
A5:19:28 <citricsquid>     Banned
A5:19:29 <citricsquid> :P
A5:19:35 <tripel> was it an IP ban?
A5:19:37 <Wolfram> Hm
A5:19:48 <citricsquid> That might be why then, I'll check.
A5:19:57 <tripel> he's getting the same message
A5:20:03 <Wolfram> The forum bans are IP based, I believe
A5:20:15 <citricsquid> Try now.
A5:20:23 <citricsquid> I banned the account and IP, meant to just ban the account :)
A5:20:29 <tripel> oh ok, that's cool
A5:20:37 <tripel> understandable, my roommate took it too far as it is....
A5:20:53 <tripel> and so did i probably, but i was kinda angry at how everything went down
A5:21:17 <Tripknotix> u know black people are racist too 
A5:21:19 <citricsquid> I disagree with what you said, tripel, but you were at least reasonable in your posting, niggs was over the top and deserved a ban for the name alone.
A5:21:27 <Wolfram> Agreed
A5:21:28 <Tripknotix> but ur not allowed to say that, or else u look racist for saying it
A5:21:29 <Tripknotix> =P
A5:21:43 <tripel> for sure, and i understand that, tripknot i know black people are racist too.

A5:21:50 <Tripknotix> ya
A5:21:50 <Wolfram> The responsibility shouldn't fall on just one side
A5:21:59 <Wolfram> As much as people should know which lines not to cross and when
A5:22:08 <Wolfram> Other people should know when to take it all in stride
A5:22:09 <tripel> for sure, and realistcally i think both sides, as far as on the server, handled it poorly.

A5:22:14 <Wolfram> It's not all necessarily a witch-hunt

A5:23:33 <Wolfram> Haha
A5:23:45 <Wolfram> Most of my players actually thought the original skin looked pretty black
A5:24:05 <tripel> yeah i would agree
A5:24:47 <tripel> where's everyone from?
A5:25:37 <utilitas> whats the disscusion about?
A5:26:10 <Adura> Block people
A5:27:01 <Wolfram> From? I'm FROM Washington D.C., but I don't live there now
A5:27:14 <Wolfram> Or simply "united states" for those of you who live in other parts of the world
A5:28:10 <tripel> lol
A5:28:17 <tripel> i live in wash. state, also United states

A5:29:07 <citricsquid> I'm swaying towards having a section for server complaints, too many popping up now to allow them in general. New section for them or ban them?
A5:29:43 <Tripknotix> the original skin does look black to me
A5:29:47 <Wolfram> What we really need is a PM system.
A5:29:57 <Wolfram> And personal issues can be resolved in private since not everyone displays their email.
A5:30:02 <Tripknotix> if u cant see urself, theres no big issue
A5:30:03 <Tripknotix> lol
A5:30:06 <Wolfram> Then we ban public flame wars for not utilizing that feature.
A5:30:07 <citricsquid> wolfram: I'm going to build one when I finish my current work, but how will they know that they're the server owner?
A5:30:33 <Wolfram> How will the victim know who offended them?
A5:31:24 <Wolfram> When I think about it, some sort of server "review" section would be interesting
A5:31:25 <citricsquid> They would do, like, "Reddit public: I was banned unfairly!" and then an admin from that server could come along and resolve it?
A5:31:50 <citricsquid> Just have a rule that they include server name in the title, we could give it a few days test run? :)

A5:32:17 <Wolfram> I sense that you're enthusiastic about this idea, and that it would be difficult to dissuade you
A5:32:21 <Niggs> Hello
A5:32:36 <Niggs> I am banned from the forums, it told me to come here.
A5:32:45 <Wolfram> Welcome Niggs
A5:32:46 <citricsquid> Niggs: Yeah, hello. I put that.
A5:33:26 <Niggs> Yeah, that guy was being racist against me in the server, we wanted to put the word out without his lies.

A5:33:44 <Niggs> I didnt mean to get all drawn out
A5:33:50 <Wolfram> Well, technically, he's allowed to do whatever he wants on his own server
A5:33:53 <Niggs> yeah
A5:34:00 <Niggs> but we should be allowed to tell people what he does.
A5:34:05 <Wolfram> He could keep virtual slaves there and it would be none of your business
A5:34:10 <citricsquid> Niggs: How are we supposed to take you seriously with that name? I have no idea if you really think such a name is acceptable when complaining about racism, but...
A5:34:50 <Wolfram> I'm less convinced that you care enough about the strangers in this community to publicly denounce someone 
A5:35:06 <Wolfram> And more convinced that you just wanted to harass someone because you were at odds with him
A5:35:25 <Niggs> It would be hard to explain, I told him time and time again, it was cool, I didnt really care about racial jokes, I was makin em, others were, etc... I dont really care. But he was going on about gays and just bashing people in general. I dont see how Im the badguy when he's the one going on and on about stuff. 
A5:35:51 <Niggs> I put up with racist jokes all day long, a joke or two in someones server doesnt bother me.
A5:36:04 <Niggs> I mean, if it did, I could just go to another server.
A5:36:21 <Wolfram> You should have, and that should have been the end of it
A5:36:31 <Niggs> yeah, but like i said, i didnt really care.
A5:36:40 <Wolfram> Cared enough to flame war about it
A5:36:46 <Niggs> I wasnt flaming.
A5:36:58 <Niggs> I was calm and collected in all my posts.
A5:37:09 <Wolfram> ...indeed
A5:37:12 <Niggs> I wasnt like YOURE A CRACKER HO AND U SHOULD DIE!
10A5:37:19 * smn`offline is now known as smn
A5:37:22 <Niggs> I was just explaining my point
A5:37:43 <Wolfram> Okay, let's assume what you're saying is perfectly valid just for the sake of this next point
A5:37:50 <Wolfram> What should have happened in THAT case
A5:38:05 <Wolfram> Is you and your witnesses/associates/whatever should have stated your case
A5:38:14 <Wolfram> And mail should have had the opportunity to defend himself
A5:38:15 <Wolfram> And no more
A5:38:17 <Wolfram> No argument
A5:38:25 <Wolfram> Since this is just for public awareness
A5:38:26 <Niggs> I thought it was a discussion forum.
A5:38:47 <Wolfram> Minecraft discussion
A5:38:55 <Wolfram> Not mail and Niggs' arguments discussion
A5:39:02 <Niggs> We were discussing activities in a minecraft server.
A5:39:19 <Wolfram> You were arguing semantics and trying to disprove one another
A5:39:27 <Wolfram> Like I said, the whole thread should have been three posts or so
A5:39:48 <Niggs> tripel was making a note about an OP's activities, I simply stated what happened, and explained it more and more as he responded and re-edited.
A5:40:00 <Wolfram> Defended himself
A5:40:02 <Wolfram> To better inform the public
A5:40:11 <Niggs> I feel he was misinforming
A5:40:18 <Niggs> Thats why I continued to explain
A5:40:24 <Wolfram> And I feel you're misinforming
A5:40:31 <Wolfram> And in either case, it's a fruitless struggle
A5:40:36 <Wolfram> Did you honestly expect to convince him?
A5:40:40 <Wolfram> "Oh, Niggs, you're right"
A5:40:42 <Wolfram> "I'm a racist"
A5:40:45 <Wolfram> "Lol guys"
A5:40:45 <Niggs> No, its not about him
A5:41:27 <Niggs> Im gonna go on a whim and say he probably wasnt banned...
A5:41:39 <Wolfram> Of course not
A5:41:39 <Niggs> just me and tripel
A5:41:41 <Wolfram> He's white
A5:41:45 <Wolfram> Bahaha
A5:41:52 <Niggs> thats what i thought lol
A5:41:55 <Wolfram> I actually don't know
A5:42:02 <Niggs> jk
A5:42:08 <Wolfram> But what I do know is that the forum administration determined that you were in the wrong
A5:42:08 <Niggs> but yeah i think thats kinda bogus
A5:42:14 <Wolfram> In practice if not in intent
A5:42:20 <Wolfram> And your name was considered offensive
A5:42:23 <Wolfram> So you were banned
A5:42:29 <Niggs> That's our word.
A5:42:38 <citricsquid> Only you were banned niggs because of the way you argued and your name, tripel wasn't.
A5:42:49 <Niggs> hm
A5:42:52 <Niggs> that sucks. 
A5:42:56 <citricsquid> If you want to be unbanned, that's fine, but be prepared to have a different name.
A5:43:06 <offset> "Niggs" is offensive?
A5:43:10 <citricsquid> Your name is clearly going to offend some people, do we really want another argument like that?
A5:43:11 <Niggs> apparently
A5:43:15 <offset> Grow some thick skin 
A5:43:23 <offset> espectially on the internet :)
A5:43:24 <citricsquid> offset: Some people cry about it being niggers. I don't find it offensive in the slightest.
A5:43:37 <offset> I guess you have to keep the mass happy
A5:43:38 <Wolfram> "Man up" doesn't work for public relations
A5:43:51 <Niggs> i dont see how my name offends people who play a game where you enter a server and theres nazi, racist, satanic, all sorts of crap everywhere.
A5:44:20 <LF> FYI I draw swaztikas because I like the shape
A5:44:25 <LF> I am not a nazi
A5:44:34 <Adura> Just say it's a Manji.
A5:44:36 <Wolfram> That's not the fault of the people in charge of the forum, the game or in many cases the servers
A5:44:45 <Niggs> Its still a symbol commonly associated with Nazism
A5:44:50 <Wolfram> That argument is essentially "two wrongs make a right"
A5:44:52 <Wolfram> And they don't
A5:44:56 <Niggs> no
A5:44:57 <Niggs> its 
A5:45:00 <Niggs> neither one is wrong
A5:45:02 <LF> Three lefts do though
A5:45:06 <citricsquid> lmao
A5:45:09 <Wolfram> "How is this offensive, there's all sorts of offensive stuff"
A5:45:17 <Wolfram> It is, they are, and neither are sanctioned
A5:45:29 <Niggs> so why is mine so much worse?
A5:45:36 <LF> Call yourself sggiN
A5:45:37 <Wolfram> They're equal
A5:45:39 <Wolfram> Here, tell you what
A5:45:42 <Wolfram> If you get unbanned
A5:45:46 <Wolfram> Register as Hitler
A5:45:46 <Tripknotix> sgin
A5:45:47 <Tripknotix> lol
A5:45:51 <Wolfram> And see how long you last
A5:45:51 <Tripknotix> kinda name is that
A5:45:59 <Niggs> but im not a white german nazi
A5:46:01 <utilitas> ...
A5:46:03 <Tripknotix> reltiH
A5:46:09 <Tripknotix> Izan
A5:46:11 <Wolfram> I'm not black, but if I named myself Niggs
A5:46:12 <Tripknotix> izaN
A5:46:12 <Tripknotix> lol
A5:46:15 <Wolfram> It would still be offensive
A5:46:21 <LF> Izan sounds cool
A5:46:25 <Niggs> well its not to me.
A5:46:28 <Tripknotix> funny thing is that it does
A5:46:29 <Tripknotix> lol
A5:46:29 <citricsquid> Niggs: I would have no problem with you using that name, but you've put forward the suggestion that players are racist and if that happens on the forum lots more arguments will start and I'd rather avoid that. Your name doesn;'t offend me but it could offend others.
A5:46:53 <Wolfram> Just like Hitler doesn't offend me
A5:46:58 <Wolfram> I'm not german OR jewish
A5:47:06 <Wolfram> But I can understand how it would offend others
A5:47:19 <Wolfram> And that's the kind of cognizance we expect of our forum users
A5:47:23 <Niggs> I dont see how it offends people when theres so much other offensive stuff around. Its like going into a volcano and being like... man i hope the ash from my cigarette doesnt fall on my hand
A5:47:32 <offset> At the end of the day it's a legit name, doesn't exactly mean you're pushing forward his values

A5:53:41 <Wolfram> Yeah
A5:53:44 <Stick35> You mean ignorance taught to others?
A5:53:45 <Wolfram> Take these dudes in Colorado
A5:53:48 <Wolfram> There's the town, right
A5:53:49 <utilitas> CZ guys
A5:53:53 <Wolfram> And the population is like
A5:53:56 <Wolfram> .5% black
A5:53:58 <Stick35> If I had kids and I never told them anything about race
A5:54:05 <Wolfram> These are people who like, don't even KNOW about black people
A5:54:12 <Stick35> They would grow up not caring
A5:54:12 <Stick35> However if I told them over and over niggers suck then they would adopt the same attitude
A5:54:21 <Niggs> Yeah.
A5:54:24 <Stick35> It's all psychology
A5:54:32 <Wolfram> Upbringing is part of it
A5:54:33 <Niggs> My kids will probably love white women too.
A5:54:33 <Stick35> Reinforcement from society makes it easier to go with the flow
A5:54:41 <Wolfram> But if you've never laid eyes on a black woman, and you're a white male
A5:54:50 <Wolfram> You're going to fantasize about white women
A5:54:53 <Wolfram> Period
A5:55:00 <Stick35> Cause you don't know anything else?
A5:55:03 <Stick35> How is that racism?
A5:55:05 <Niggs> Exactly.
A5:55:07 <Wolfram> It isn't
A5:55:08 <Wolfram> That's genetics
A5:55:12 <Stick35> No
A5:55:14 <utilitas> we are all the same and aliens in one
A5:55:16 <Stick35> That's psychology
A5:55:17 <Niggs> No its not.
A5:55:21 <utilitas> everybody is unique
A5:55:22 <Niggs> Its psychology
A5:55:22 <Stick35> Genetics is like DNA encoding
A5:55:35 <Wolfram> Why am I not attracted to black women
A5:55:38 <utilitas> RNA too
A5:55:40 <Wolfram> But I am attracted to white ones?
A5:55:41 <Stick35> Cause you're a racist
A5:55:44 <Niggs> Because youre racist
A5:55:49 <Wolfram> Okay, why are gay people attracted to men?
A5:55:52 <Wolfram> Because that's the same thing
A5:55:56 <Niggs> Because theyre gay
A5:55:57 <Stick35> Because they are no longer human
A5:56:08 <Wolfram> No counterpoint? I didn't think so
A5:56:11 <Stick35> You forget, gays have no rights once they make that decision
A5:56:21 <Stick35> Here's a question
A5:56:25 <Stick35> Why do I think wolfram is a nerd?
A5:56:27 <Stick35> Cause he is!
A5:56:32 <Stick35> That's genetics dude

A5:56:54 <citricsquid> how to abolish racism: make everyone where minecraftman costumes.
A5:57:03 <Niggs> I made my own costume
A5:57:04 <Stick35> where?
A5:57:10 <Wolfram> No, only the black people go in the mines

A6:00:56 <Wolfram> I get so burnt up
A6:01:01 <Wolfram> I rage around my living room
A6:01:01 <Stick35> That's because we cant see his scrawny body and high pitched voice
A6:01:06 <utilitas> if your name is wolfram
A6:01:08 <Parthon> how dare you say that!!!
A6:01:10 <utilitas> you know all :D
A6:01:14 <Niggs> Anyway...
A6:01:17 <Wolfram> The chicks love my falsetto
A6:01:21 <Niggs> I think I should be unbanned w/o a name change.
A6:01:23 <Stick35> You mean gays?
A6:01:36 <Wolfram> Not gonna happen, Niggs
A6:01:40 <Stick35> Yeah, I like the absence of "color blind" user input here
A6:01:46 <Stick35> Banning someone for a black name
A6:01:54 <Wolfram> You don't have to agree
A6:01:59 <Wolfram> There's nothing you can do about it
A6:02:07 <Stick35> Would you ban me if I named myself "Mahammed" and then built a carbomb on your server?
A6:02:07 <Wolfram> Other than sit in here with us and chill
A6:02:29 <Wolfram> We would ban you from the server for the carbomb probably. At least I would. I can only speak for myself
A6:02:37 <Wolfram> But Mohammed is the most common name on the planet
A6:02:43 <Stick35> Oh so you would ban me for building something
A6:02:45 <Stick35> That makes sense
A6:02:46 <utilitas> :D
A6:02:47 <Wolfram> Me? Yes
A6:02:48 <Wolfram> I would
A6:02:53 <Wolfram> And I have the right on my own server
A6:02:55 <Stick35> Do you like men too?
A6:03:06 <utilitas> gays...
A6:03:06 <offset> If he does?
A6:03:11 <Stick35> If he does
A6:03:13 <Stick35> Then I will lol
A6:03:17 <Wolfram> That depends
A6:03:18 <Stick35> With the rest of my buddies in the NRA
A6:03:19 <Parthon> give me an I, give me an N, give me an N, give me a G, give me an E, give me an R .. what does tha make?
A6:03:19 <Wolfram> Are they black or white?
A6:03:21 <offset> Don't see why it'd be a problem
A6:03:22 <Stick35> While we burn his house
A6:03:31 <Stick35> Offset you a homo?
A6:03:32 <Niggs> INNGER?
A6:03:35 <offset> No, 
A6:03:42 <Stick35> Do you know someone that is?
A6:03:46 <offset> Yes
A6:03:50 <Stick35> Do they drive a car?
A6:03:55 <offset> sure...
A6:03:58 <Stick35> Unplug their brakecords and do us a favor
A6:04:02 <Wolfram> Well, that proves it
A6:04:04 <Wolfram> Tupac is alive
A6:04:05 <Parthon> oh .. I fucked up .. lol
A6:04:18 <utilitas> :DD
A6:04:24 <Parthon> was meant to be einggr
A6:04:31 <Wolfram> Einggr
A6:04:33 <offset> Wait,
A6:04:36 <Stick35> no
A6:04:45 <Parthon> and it makes Ginger
A6:04:51 <Niggs> So someone else bes racist, someone else calls them out on it, I input my info, the guy goes ballistic, I respond in a calm manner, he keeps flipping out, I keep stating additional facts; again calmly; he flips out more. I get banned. 
A6:05:01 <offset> So you're telling him off for banning the name "Niggs" but you're allowed to kill gay people
A6:05:03 <offset> Hmm...
A6:05:08 <Wolfram> Hey, Niggs
A6:05:14 <Wolfram> I just realized something about your story
A6:05:15 <Stick35> YOu missed the point
A6:05:19 <Stick35> Gays are no longer people
A6:05:21 <Stick35> They are animals
A6:05:27 <Stick35> You can get a license to hunt em
A6:05:29 <Parthon> you can't kill gay people .. then who will make very weird looking dresses for women?
A6:05:30 <Wolfram> "Niggs signs up, Niggs is discovered, Niggs is banned for his name"
A6:05:36 <Wolfram> That's pretty much it
A6:05:40 <Siiseli> how funny you people
A6:05:46 <Niggs> I dont buy that.
A6:06:01 <Wolfram> That's okay, because I'm not selling it
A6:06:03 <Wolfram> That's just how it is
A6:06:13 <Stick35> selling it?
A6:06:17 <citricsquid> Niggs: If you agree to change your name, I have no problem unbanning you, just don't be such a twat :)
A6:06:20 <Stick35> Wolfram, do you have children?
A6:06:29 <Stick35> Who says twat?
A6:06:32 <Parthon> citricsquid: was it your server?
A6:06:33 <Stick35> Maybe UK children say it
A6:06:42 <Niggs> Im not being a twat, why isnt mail banned for being a twat? He was twatting out like no twat has ever twatted
A6:06:43 <citricsquid> Stick35: Wow, you're correct!
A6:06:44 <citricsquid> Parthon: nah
A6:07:07 <Parthon> mine craft isn't a democracy anyways, there's no free speech or right to exist ..
A6:07:07 <Wolfram> Honestly, I say ban them both for attempting to troll
A6:07:15 <Wolfram> I don't really expect anything productive to come from either of them
A6:07:16 <Stick35> Rofl
A6:07:20 <Stick35> Wolfram wants a ram for his ass
A6:07:22 <Parthon> it's a dictatorship :P
A6:07:24 <Stick35> Any takers?
A6:07:57 <Stick35> *Silence*
A6:07:59 <Wolfram> Right here, chief
A6:08:02 <Wolfram> Sign me up for two
A6:08:06 <Stick35> Gay
A6:08:07 <Wolfram> 10% of the house take, if you don't mind
A6:08:43 <Niggs> If I was banned because my name is niggs, how come my ban message didnt say "change your name" ????
A6:08:45 <Stick35> <<<<< = 8=======D - - -- --  ( . ) ( . )    <<<< Wolframs mom
A6:08:53 <Wolfram> It said to come here
A6:08:55 <Wolfram> Which you did
A6:08:57 <Wolfram> Then we told you
A6:09:05 <Wolfram> My mom is a dirty bird, man
A6:09:06 <Niggs> It said more than that
A6:09:09 <Wolfram> You'd better double bag
A6:09:21 <Stick35> Yeah, UK women are pretty fail
A6:09:26 <Stick35> Especially black UK women
A6:09:35 <Wolfram> Not sure what that has to do with me
A6:09:40 <Wolfram> Being as I'm from the states
A6:09:41 <Stick35> You fail too
A6:09:45 <Stick35> I was talking about genetics
A6:09:51 <Stick35> Your mom fails so you fail by default
A6:09:57 <Stick35> World keeps on spinnin
A6:09:58 <Wolfram> I see
A6:10:30 <Stick35> Quite a few people in here
A6:10:35 <Wolfram> Always is
A6:10:38 <Stick35> Yet only about five are participating in this
A6:10:51 <Wolfram> It's generally a list of people who aren't paying any attention
A6:10:52 <Niggs> How about, I get unbanned as niggs, I promise not to start anymore forumfights?
A6:10:58 <Wolfram> Many of them are probably asleep
A6:11:01 <Wolfram> Never happen, Niggs
A6:11:05 <Niggs> or IRC arguments.
A6:11:06 <Stick35> never happen?
A6:11:11 <Stick35> YOu mean.... HAPPENED???
A6:11:15 <Stick35> Wolf are you the admin?
A6:11:20 <citricsquid> niggs: Sure, if you agree to have your name changed.
A6:11:21 <Wolfram> No, as in "It will never happen."
A6:11:23 <Wolfram> And I'm a forum mod
A6:11:29 <Stick35> forum mod
A6:11:31 <Stick35> omg
A6:11:35 <Wolfram> Yeah, you know
A6:11:36 <Stick35> Whenever you get a job
A6:11:39 <Stick35> Or an interview
A6:11:39 <Wolfram> The place where all this went down
A6:11:39 <Niggs> I would like to keep my name, but I promise to avoid problems.
A6:11:41 <Stick35> Put that on your app
A6:11:46 <Stick35> And be all serious about it
A6:11:49 <Wolfram> Can't keep the name, Niggs
A6:12:01 <Stick35> Yo, Niggs, why dey be hatin?
A6:12:20 <citricsquid> niggs: but you brought up racism, it's now going to follow you around, with a name like that people have a reason to shout at you. + if you have a new name mail can't harass you :P
A6:12:32 <Stick35> mail?
A6:12:41 <citricsquid> I think that was his name.
A6:12:43 <Wolfram> It was
A6:12:44 <Niggs> yeah.
A6:12:48 <Stick35> Is he a homo?
A6:12:50 <Niggs> He was making the big deal, not me.
A6:13:00 <Wolfram> Well, you're making one now, really
A6:13:12 <Stick35> Wolfram do you have kids?
A6:13:15 <offset> Why so homophobic Stick?
A6:13:21 <offset> Scared of something? :)
A6:13:25 <Stick35> I'm not scared of gay people
A6:13:32 <Stick35> Like I said, they're animals
A6:13:36 <Stick35> You shoot em
A6:13:38 <offset> Why though?
A6:13:42 <Niggs> I dont care what follows me, I wish to keep the name, but like I said, if stuff flares up, ill just avoid it.
A6:13:42 <Stick35> Why what?
A6:13:53 <Wolfram> Can't keep the name, Niggs
A6:13:58 <offset> Why are they animals?
A6:14:04 <Wolfram> That's the condition of you having restored access
A6:14:05 <Stick35> They deviate from a social norm
A6:14:14 <Niggs> I paid all this money to use the name in the game, so now my forum name cant match it?
A6:14:22 <Wolfram> Pretty much
A6:14:28 <Niggs> this is dumb.
A6:14:29 <Wolfram> Your avatar can be kicked
A6:14:34 <Wolfram> Or you can run your own server
A6:14:34 <Stick35> Plus homosexuality is a clinically diagnosed deviance
A6:14:38 <citricsquid> niggs: Well, if anyone complains you agree to have it changed?
A6:14:51 <Wolfram> I'd like to register a complaint
A6:14:54 <Stick35> Same as cross-dressing
A6:14:58 <offset> So you shun lesbian pronographic material, right?
A6:14:59 <Niggs> It has to be a valid complaint, not someone who oversees this convo and complains.
A6:15:15 <Niggs> just for the shits and giggles of it.
A6:15:18 <citricsquid> Niggs: k, well, promise to play nice then?
A6:15:23 <Stick35> lesbian pornographic material
A6:15:26 <Niggs> I promise to play nice, like I said.
A6:15:26 <Stick35> You mean lesbian porn?
A6:15:27 <Stick35> rofl
A6:15:29 <Stick35> Big name
A6:15:41 <offset> :)
A6:15:48 <Stick35> Yeah, lesbians is the same deviance as gay men
A6:15:56 <citricsquid> niggs: :) Try now
A6:16:14 <Niggs> Thank you, greatly appreciated. 
A6:16:18 <Stick35> However, for a woman to like another woman is not as fail because it is their nature
A6:16:32 <Stick35> They are woman after all, you cant expect them to do anything right
A6:16:55 <offset> Sounds like a double standard to me, but anyway
A6:17:24 <Stick35> k
A6:17:31 <citricsquid> sexism is bad, stick :(
A6:17:40 <Stick35> So is fail women
A6:18:00 <Stick35> What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?  NOTHING!!! She's already been told twice
A6:18:59 <Stick35> *silence*  *Everyone has been offended*
A6:19:16 <Stick35> Alright people
A6:19:20 <Stick35> My job is done here
A6:19:20 <Stick35> Peace
A6:19:21 <Stick35> and

A6:20:37 <Siiseli> who the hell was that
A6:20:40 <offset> <@citricsquid> 99% of trolling on the internet doesn't work.
A6:20:45 <offset> His thoery stands true still
A6:21:03 <Siiseli> :D
A6:21:12 <Siiseli> we call this the citricsquid-theory.
A6:21:48 <Wolfram> Well, a troll will say that being banned is a victory
A6:21:54 <Wolfram> Because they must have irritated the banner
A6:22:03 <Wolfram> But then, who really cares what a troll thinks
A6:22:22 <Wolfram> Administrative duty often calls for the removal of one person to the benefit of others
A6:22:22 <postlogic> Troll mothers?
A6:22:26 <Siiseli> citricsquid claimed in his book "theory of trolling" that 99 % of trolling does not work. This theory has later been confirmed and is considered the only correct theory on the subject.
A6:22:42 <citricsquid> forum down for anyone else?
A6:22:46 <Wolfram> Checking
A6:22:54 <Wolfram> Yep
A6:22:57 <citricsquid> bugger
A6:23:00 <Wolfram> DDoS?
A6:23:04 <Wolfram> That'd be a pretty quick response
A6:23:10 <citricsquid> nah, I couldn't afford my server renewal.
A6:23:16 <Wolfram> Bummer
10A6:23:17 * Niggs (theonebman@c-76-28-185-127.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
A6:23:18 <citricsquid> I think it got taken offline =\
A6:23:28 <Wolfram> Dire straits, citric?
A6:25:09 <citricsquid> terribly
A6:25:29 <citricsquid> *hopes he has money somewhere*
A6:25:44 <offset> How much?
A6:26:05 <citricsquid> ...$100, haha.
A6:26:08 <Wolfram> I'd love to donate, but I'm unemployed and very, very broke.
A6:26:20 <offset> $100USD?
A6:26:24 <citricsquid> yeah
A6:26:25 <offset> Might pass on that one :"(
A6:26:30 <Wolfram> I do surveys online for three bucks per. They actually send me little checks
A6:26:38 <Wolfram> Just cashed in for a Guild Wars expansion, so
A6:26:52 <citricsquid> I have work to do that would get me $250 today, but now I can't do it because I need server online =o
A6:27:11 <Wolfram> Can you call the host?
A6:27:17 <Wolfram> Make an arrangement?
A6:27:29 <citricsquid> I was already overdue, I'm a terrible customer :(
A6:27:52 <Wolfram> Well, alternatives are scarce, I take
A6:28:04 <Wolfram> It's certainly the simplest solution. Can't hurt to ask
A6:28:14 <Wolfram> If they say no, you can proceed to consider alternate means
A6:28:22 <Wolfram> considering, rather
A6:28:27 <citricsquid> I have another server, but that'll require switching everything over :(
A6:28:42 <Wolfram> Time-consuming?
A6:28:46 <citricsquid> very

13A6:35:25 * citricsquid is terrible with money
A6:36:10 <Wolfram> You budget poorly?
A6:36:12 <Wolfram> Impulse spend?
A6:36:18 <citricsquid> very much so
A6:37:13 <citricsquid> also I'm lazy
A6:37:24 <Ausfriend> silly citric
A6:37:29 <Wolfram> Working from home will do that to you
A6:37:31 <Ausfriend> your private server has a spawn prison?
A6:37:40 <citricsquid> does it?
A6:37:41 <Wolfram> Does it, now
A6:37:45 <Ausfriend> yeah
A6:38:02 <Wolfram> I would call that ironic
A6:38:11 <Wolfram> But since he clearly didn't build it himself, I can't
A6:38:18 <Wolfram> I take it back. It's still kind of ironic
A6:38:20 <citricsquid> I might have done, which one?
A6:38:37 <Ausfriend> NG private
A6:38:58 <citricsquid> Not really a prison, just have to climb lots to escape :D
A6:39:13 <Ausfriend> i can see it
A6:39:14 <Ausfriend> damn pits
A6:39:35 <Wolfram> Squid, did you happen to see the post about block deletion notification?
A6:39:52 <Parthon> lol
A6:39:57 <citricsquid> i have no idea
A6:40:03 <Ausfriend> cant believe this shit
A6:40:03 <Parthon> spawn prisons can't be done completely can they?
A6:40:08 <Ausfriend> my house got griefed :(
A6:40:10 <Ausfriend> on your private
A6:40:12 <Wolfram> They can, Parthon
A6:40:15 <citricsquid> :(
A6:40:27 <Wolfram> People do them wrong often enough, but they can be made infallible by non-OP
A6:40:29 <Parthon> Wolfram: what stops people from building their way out of it?
A6:40:36 <Ausfriend> Unbreakable
A6:40:39 <Wolfram> Making it a 1x1x2
A6:40:42 <Wolfram> Out of adminium
A6:40:47 <Parthon> aaah .. of course
A6:40:50 <Parthon> that would do it
A6:40:53 <Wolfram> And above that, another 2 blocks height
A6:40:55 <Wolfram> Totally cased
A6:40:59 <Wolfram> To prevent outside assistance
A6:41:22 <Wolfram> Assuming you want a window
A6:41:23 <Parthon> that would be the only way
A6:41:29 <Wolfram> A ground level iron maiden works just the same
A6:41:36 <Adura> Honeycomb jails above the main one work.
A6:41:42 <Wolfram> They do, but why bother
A6:41:49 <Wolfram> People inside can block up the initial spawn, too
A6:41:53 <Wolfram> Forcing new players into a shell
A6:41:59 <Wolfram> And defeating the purpose of the design
A6:42:08 <Parthon> you can block up the initial spawn, and then spawn above the construction
A6:42:20 <Wolfram> That's valid, you can
A6:42:34 <Wolfram> But so elaborate and for what? A gate?
A6:43:38 <Parthon> iron madien with windows could work
A6:44:05 <Wolfram> With windows just means make sure to include another closed maiden above
A6:44:11 <Parthon> whysat?
A6:44:14 <Wolfram> To prevent people from getting in and then blocking the spawn form outside
A6:44:18 <Parthon> aaah
A6:44:18 <Wolfram> From, rather
A6:44:46 <Wolfram> I love prison science
A6:44:47 <Wolfram> Haha
A6:44:54 <Wolfram> But before I forget, citricsquid
A6:45:09 <Wolfram> Someone suggested being able to undo changes made by players
A6:45:22 <Wolfram> And it occurred to me that while an undo is a huge double-edge
A6:45:35 <Wolfram> In-game or console notification of block deletion could be very helpful
A6:45:37 <citricsquid> Hey guys, my name is sam and I'm a complete idiot. 
A6:45:45 <citricsquid> The company forgot to suspend my server and all was going fine
A6:45:49 <citricsquid> and then I emailed them asking about it
A6:45:52 <citricsquid> and it wasn;t suspended
A6:45:55 <citricsquid> just network maintenance
A6:45:57 <citricsquid> :(
A6:45:59 <citricsquid> Your server is actually unreachable now due to a scheduled upgrade at the data center. You can inquire to billing regarding the outstanding balance. I will forward this to that department for you. 
A6:46:02 <Wolfram> Haha
A6:46:08 <citricsquid> dropped myself rightttt in it
A6:46:18 <Wolfram> Couldn't have known
A6:46:33 <Wolfram> Now's your chance to get that work done
A6:46:36 <citricsquid> they sent an email last week about maintenance, should have probably read more than the title.
A6:47:26 <Wolfram> You should move to the states
A6:47:30 <Wolfram> Everybody is lazy here
A6:47:50 <citricsquid> I'm lazy more than lazy, like, imagine lazy and then square it, I'm that lazy.
A6:48:12 <Wolfram> Ah, but your advantage is your accent
A6:48:25 <Wolfram> Some of the people here would probably pay you just to say things out loud
A6:48:35 <citricsquid> hahah
A6:48:41 <Wolfram> I hate that that doesn't seem to work in reverse
A6:48:51 <Wolfram> If I were to go to England, people would hear my accent
A6:48:59 <Wolfram> And assume that because I'm a yank I'm a moron
A6:49:36 <Wolfram> Likewise, southern US accents earn you points up north
A6:49:45 <Wolfram> But northern accents create enemies in the south
A6:49:55 <Wolfram> So, naturally, I moved from D.C. to Tennessee
A6:50:06 <Wolfram> So that I'd have every opportunity to irritate hillbillies

A8:38:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Yup, it is.
A8:38:11 <Wolfram> Trigger the flood, Tripknotix
A8:38:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, does anyone know about problems with the game running faster than it should for some computers?
A8:38:30 <Tripknotix> how do u trigger the flood?
A8:38:37 <Wolfram> Bust the top blocks of the tower.
A8:38:47 <Wolfram> It happened to my brother's computer.
A8:38:52 <Wolfram> Slowly over time following a restart
A8:38:58 <Wolfram> His speed in-game would increase
A8:39:05 <Wolfram> Whether or not he was playing.
A8:39:15 <Wolfram> So if he waited a day after a restart, he would be blinding fast
A8:39:40 <vdgmprgrmr> On an identical computer to my soon-to-be new one, it seemed like the game would jump forward a few frames pretty often.
A8:39:56 <vdgmprgrmr> So I would run really fast and jumping would be hard.
A8:40:04 <Tripknotix> wow ya mine went to 0 fps, but would do the jumping every 3 seconds or so
A8:40:28 <Tripknotix> like i was getting 0.33 fps  i bet =P
A8:41:03 <Tripknotix> does that happen in multiplayer? like ur suddently able to run fast in th egame building? =P
A8:41:13 <Tripknotix> perhaps thats how the hacks are done?

A10:57:36 <JTE> I have something that 'works'
A10:57:52 <JTE> It can TAKE input, it just can't lock the mouse in place right. >.x;
A10:58:25 <iPope> nah do arma 2 style aiming
A10:58:35 <JTE> If I try to use the stupid Robot class to do that for me, it fails to load and probably gives some runtime error to the java console, which I don't know how to open and read!
A10:58:36 <iPope> where your head dont move but the cursor does
A10:58:56 <iPope> get a ide
A10:59:12 <ZomBuster> why lock the mouse in place, just hide it.
A10:59:33 <JTE> ZomBuster: Because it's already hidden and not restricted to the Java applet window itself.
A10:59:59 <JTE> Basically, mouse goes in the window and disappears, mouse aiming works properly, then the mouse leaves the Java applet window and returns to being normal.
A11:00:22 <YQM> Its better to control it.
A11:00:36 <YQM> If soomeone moves to quickily, they click out, and get annoyed.
A11:00:56 <YQM> hiding it might be easier but it isn't better

A11:24:51 <liq3> then*
A11:25:02 <YQM> polymorphism is in c
A11:25:10 <liq3> YQM: I know.
A11:25:17 <liq3> It's in java too, just trying to figure it out a little.
A11:25:23 <JTE> I prefer C over C++.
A11:25:38 <JTE> I prefer C++ over Java.
A11:25:48 <YQM> Its abasicly the ability to hadle differnt unit types with the same methods

A11:25:58 <ZomBuster> I prefer C++ over anything else since I don't know anything else D:

A11:26:42 <iPope> whats perls syntax like?
A11:26:44 <JTE> liq3: I have to write less to get a more optimized version of the same effect, in nearly all cases. :| Plus I get more control over the lower level details.

A11:27:31 <liq3> Yeh, what lower level details?
A11:27:32 <JTE> C doesn't need classes, it has structs and function pointers.
A11:27:40 <liq3> JTE: so does C++ >.>
A11:27:45 <ZomBuster> C++ original names was "C with classes"
A11:27:56 <ZomBuster> im not kidding
A11:27:58 <liq3> CLasses are just structs that can have methods.
A11:28:00 <JTE> C++'s structs are just its classes with everything set to public by default.
A11:28:30 <JTE> And I can have methods in C just as well. :3
A11:28:33 <liq3> I mean.
A11:28:38 <liq3> You miss out on polymorphism!
A11:28:38 <liq3> D:
A11:28:51 <JTE> I can change the function pointers to anything I like at runtime.
A11:28:57 <ZomBuster> im not sure what that is..
A11:29:00 <liq3> yes, but then you end up with names like
A11:29:00 <JTE> And I have polymorphism too. O_o
A11:29:16 <JTE> Polymorphism of ANY type is easy in C. ...
A11:29:30 <liq3> mainloop_mainMenu, mainloop_game, mainloop_highscore
A11:29:35 <JTE> Naw.
A11:29:35 <liq3> that'd be terrible to deal with. D:
A11:29:48 <JTE> Why would I end up with something silly like that?
A11:29:55 <liq3> So how do you do polymorphism in C thenL?
A11:30:08 <liq3> Also I'm talking game related.
A11:30:14 <ZomBuster> isnt polymorph stuff to do with operators?
A11:30:23 <liq3> Specifically Finite State Machines
A11:30:37 <JTE> GameState *gamestate = (GameState *)&Running;
A11:30:52 <liq3> ZomBuster: Polymorphism means I can have like 10 lines of code in my main loop, and then change from the main menu to say, the option menu, with a few lines extra. :P
A11:31:08 <liq3> JTE: Wut?
13A11:31:26 * ZomBuster reads wikipedia article
A11:31:37 <JTE> The only catch is that all of the structs need to have the same variables in the same order at the top
A11:31:43 <liq3> lulz.
A11:31:44 <JTE> The bottom you can add anything you want to it.
A11:32:01 <liq3> oh so you use structs?
A11:32:05 <liq3> Can structs have methods in them?
A11:32:23 <JTE> They can have function pointers, which work the same aside from needing to be set at initialization.
A11:32:25 <ZomBuster> oh I get it
A11:32:37 <JTE> Running->run();
A11:32:45 <liq3> JTE: so i.e, you're more or less emulating C++ classes.
A11:33:01 <liq3> Seems rather pointless to me.
A11:33:20 <Siiseli> hehe.. pointless..

A11:35:02 <JTE> In C I am not expected to write setVar() and getVar() functions for every single variable that another class uses anyway, and all the private/public nonsense goes to waste.

A11:35:25 <iPope> yeh

A11:36:20 <JTE> Then what's the point?
A11:36:30 <liq3> I mean, the only reason to use setVar and getVar is for debugging.
A11:36:42 <liq3> and maybe error checks.

A11:41:55 <Awol10> with compilers today writing in assembly on common CPU is usually a waste of time. On rarely chips it might be the only way.

A11:50:54 <ZomBuster> yeh
A11:51:08 <Awol10> they should cause OOP would allow you to change the libraries to fit what you want them to do. 
A11:51:13 <JTE> C++ has terrible memory management when you do a lot of class stuff, but if it's speed optimizations you're looking for they can both just use bits of assembly... :3 It really doesn't make that much of a difference though.
A11:51:14 <ZomBuster> most libraries really
A11:51:29 <liq3> JTE: Terrible memory management how? O.o
A11:51:48 <liq3> ZomBuster: reallY? o.O
A11:51:54 <Awol10> it doesn't collect the garbade you need to make sure to reference and dereference pointers
A11:52:00 <liq3> I thought stuff like iostream was mostly functions.
A11:52:03 <JTE> My classes tend to inherit from classes which inherit from classes which inherit from classes which inherit from classes, and gain copies of a whole bunch of variables which have become pointless then and I can't reuse the space for anything else.
A11:52:12 <JTE> Ooor something like that. :3
A11:52:13 <ZomBuster> uuh yeh what am i saying
A11:52:14 <Awol10> C++ makes it very easy to have memory leaks
A11:52:23 <liq3> JTE: Why would you EVER do that?
A11:52:24 <ZomBuster> I mean most graphics libraries
A11:52:31 <liq3> no, seriously, like, could you give an example?
A11:52:49 <JTE> Because I have an object -> renderable -> physical presence -> player -> networked player?
A11:52:51 <liq3> Awol: C is worse afiak.
A11:53:12 <Awol10> well C doesn't monitor it either
A11:53:20 <liq3> So, bad as each other. :P
A11:53:24 <Awol10> Java does as well as .Net
A11:53:31 <liq3> Python does too.
A11:53:38 <JTE> Thou shalt not rely on petty garbage collection for all of ye memory management.
A11:53:49 <Awol10> that is true too
A11:53:51 <liq3> It's not like memory management is hard in C++ tho.
A11:53:59 <Awol10> you should always clean up after yourself
A11:54:02 <liq3> it's pretty damn easy really.

P12:57:57 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: ok
P12:58:02 <citricsquid> You've all seen googlewave, right? http://www.zenbe.com/shareflow haha
P12:58:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Basically, on this new computer, MC runs really, really fast.
P12:58:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, it seems to skip frames.
P12:58:28 <08Notch> oh that bug again.. damn it sun
P12:58:43 <08Notch> i don't know if I even CAN fix that
P12:58:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm sprinting all over and I can't really time jumps right.
P12:58:50 <08Notch> sun says they're aware of the bug, but won't fix it

P12:59:14 <LKA> Unless system clock and running too fast are the same thing

P12:59:39 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: Is your system clock running too fas as well when playing minecraft?
P12:59:49 <iPope> nah you should show them how awesome your game is
P12:59:51 <LKA> Yeah it turns out the other day my friend's system clock was so far ahead, he almost went to bed like, four hours early
P12:59:54 <iPope> then they will fix
P12:59:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno, it's not my computer (but I'll have one like it soon), so I couldn't play that long.
P1:00:17 <08Notch> it's such a retarded bug
P1:00:31 <liq3> Notch: What IS the bug?
P1:00:42 <vdgmprgrmr> I might have to cry if I can't play Minecraft on my shiney new computer. :'(
P1:00:57 <08Notch> when sleeping for a time that isn't a multiple of 10ms, they change the timing system before and after the sleep
P1:01:06 <liq3> oh...
P1:01:15 <08Notch> and that causes the system clock to run too fast on some computers
P1:01:21 <08Notch> they've provided a "work around" that doesn't work
P1:01:34 <Dilt> notch: can you add in a 'sun sucks eggs' mode that makes the sleep a multiple of 10ms?
P1:01:39 <liq3> it's not possible to only sleep for 10ms increments?
P1:01:43 <08Notch> when confronted on that, they replied "people haven't complained, so we're afraid to fix it"
P1:01:43 <JTE> My FPS count constantly says 130-ish.
P1:01:44 <vdgmprgrmr> I stand by my recommendation of "convince faces with fists"
P1:02:08 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: Need the ability to punch people through the internet :D
P1:02:19 <08Notch> Dilt: yeah, might have to
P1:02:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch can figure that out, can't he?
P1:02:25 <iPope> why dont you make it so if it sleeps before it stops sleeping it gets to a multible of 10ms, noone would notice
P1:02:40 <iPope> or is that exactly the same as what dilt said?
P1:02:50 <08Notch> i'm not sure what you said.
P1:02:55 <Dilt> neither am i, actually
P1:03:33 <iPope> well iff its sleeping, it wont wake up till the sleep time is a multible of 10
P1:03:34 <JTE> Get the ms time, and do a "while the current time < time to next frame -> sleep some more" loop?
10P1:03:44 * dillon (wallsdil@user-8c4ca7.user.msu.edu) has left #minecraft
P1:03:55 <08Notch> the sleep has to be an even 10 ms, or sun kills your computer
P1:04:14 <liq3> Notch: can't you just make it always a even 10ms?
10P1:04:21 * Awol10 (Awol@206.173.165.111) has left #minecraft
P1:04:25 <Dilt> nope
10P1:04:25 * Awol10 (Awol@206.173.165.111) has joined #minecraft
P1:04:31 <Dilt> not easily, at least
P1:04:40 <Dilt> since the sleep regulates the FPS
P1:04:44 <JTE> If you sleep for 20ms that's still 50 frames per second.
P1:04:47 <JTE> 50 fps is good.
P1:04:47 <Dilt> so it'd be forcing a particular FPS
P1:04:56 <Dilt> which is not good with slower computers
P1:04:57 <iPope> for the time being
P1:05:00 <08Notch> well, the sleep is in the rendering thread
P1:05:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Honestly, I'd be totally fine with a "Sun sucks eggs" mode.
P1:05:18 <08Notch> so if rendering takes 12 ms and the sleep is 10 ms, you've got a 22ms delay between each frame
P1:06:09 <JTE> Still 45 fps, still good. o.o
P1:06:19 <iPope> thats about what i get anyway
P1:06:49 <JTE> As long as it's 60 fps or less and 35 fps or more, that would be fine.
P1:06:53 <liq3> Notch: Would be it possible to not sleep every frame?
P1:07:07 <liq3> And like, only sleep when it's 10ms ahead or something.
P1:07:11 <08Notch> then you get stuttering
P1:07:16 <08Notch> which is worse than low framerate
P1:07:53 <08Notch> but yeah, perhaps a fixed 10 ms sleep is the only solution
P1:07:57 <liq3> wait, how would that cause stuttering?
P1:08:17 <08Notch> if it sleeps every third frame, every third frame would take 10 ms longer than the rest
P1:08:21 <liq3> nono.
P1:08:30 <iPope> if it takes 12ms to render then just delay for 8ms?
P1:08:30 <liq3> I mean like...
P1:08:35 <iPope> to get 20ms
P1:08:41 <Dilt> iPope: see that 'delay' part?
P1:08:43 <08Notch> no, the sleep has to be 10 ms or 20 ms
P1:08:45 <Dilt> that's the sleep part that has to be 10ms
P1:08:45 <liq3> It counts a 'sleeplogg', and if the sleeplog is >=10ms, it sleeps.
P1:08:49 <liq3> or something like thaht.
P1:08:56 <08Notch> yeah, that will cause stuttering
P1:08:56 <Awol10> anyone here know Flash Action Script?
P1:09:09 <Dilt> yeah notch
P1:09:10 <citricsquid> Awol10: I can do stop(); and gotoAndPlay!
P1:09:10 <liq3> Awol: I learned a little.
P1:09:13 <Dilt> you have an options mode, right?
P1:09:16 <08Notch> if you're getting 100 fps normally, every once in a while a single frame will display for twice as long as the rest
P1:09:22 <Dilt> slap in a 'fixed 10ms' mode or such
P1:09:38 <Dilt> see how that makes things work
P1:09:41 <JTE> I don't like getting 100 fps normally. @.@;

P1:33:34 <08Notch> if their parents don't want to buy them the game, it's a bit wrong of me to offer them an alternative way to pay behind their parents back.. Plus pay by phone is expensive
P1:33:55 <iPope> charge em extra
P1:34:05 <iPope> fro going behind there parents backs
P1:34:11 <08Notch> haha
P1:34:11 <liq3> iPope: Pfft.
P1:34:19 <liq3> Nothing wrong with going behind their parents backs. :/
P1:34:19 <citricsquid> he'd have to charge 25 euros to get 10 euros :O
P1:34:45 <iPope> serves em right :P
P1:35:01 <iPope> anway citric did you hear my compotetion idea?
P1:35:07 <iPope> (spelling :( )
P1:35:17 <citricsquid> yes, it's good :D *makes*
P1:36:04 <iPope> :D credit me pwese
P1:36:34 <citricsquid> anyone want to sponsor my minecraft lan party? Just $1,000 and you can have your name mentioned a few times.
P1:36:40 <JTE> Why is just getting the mouse to lock so I can use it so hard. X_X; Geeeze...
P1:36:57 <liq3> Because you're using Java?
P1:37:02 <JTE> I hate Java.
P1:37:14 <iPope> notch hates java really
P1:37:15 <Siiseli> <3
P1:37:19 <liq3> Then why are you using it? o.O
P1:37:20 <Dilt> -everyone- hates java
P1:37:21 <JTE> So does Francis.
P1:37:37 <Siiseli> francis hates java - you should too
P1:37:40 <JTE> liq3: Because my alternatives for in-browser gaming are Flash and custom plugins.
P1:37:53 <JTE> And custom plugins requiring an installation process and all that, totally negate the point.
P1:37:55 <liq3> Why are you making an in browser game? O.o
P1:38:00 <Siiseli> JTE, uniteh
P1:38:07 <JTE> Because nobody cares about games you have to download and set up.
P1:38:16 <liq3> ...yehhhhhh, right. >.>
P1:38:17 <Siiseli> what
P1:38:26 <Siiseli> I generally dismiss browser games in total
P1:38:38 <JTE> That's because you're not a 13 year old.
P1:38:40 <Siiseli> because no one makes (usually) browser games as good as dowloadables
P1:38:48 <Siiseli> well why make games for 13 yolds
P1:38:49 <iPope> im 14, have been for 4 days
P1:38:55 <Siiseli> they can't appreciate it 
P1:38:59 <liq3> Siiseli: On a rating of 1-10, most browser games score -1. ;]
P1:39:00 <citricsquid> I'm 12 and what is this
P1:39:10 <iPope> siiseli: but they would be raging hormone fuelled porn games
P1:39:20 <Siiseli> liq3, is what I mean, exactly
10P1:39:26 * Prime_2 (Prime_2@97-116-98-6.mpls.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft
P1:39:33 <JTE> Hi Prime_2.
P1:39:36 <iPope> i gave minecraft a 12
P1:39:37 <Prime_2> hi JTE
P1:39:37 <Siiseli> but why make browser games when you can make proper games :(
P1:39:46 <citricsquid> accesibility
P1:39:49 <Siiseli> notch is one of the only ones who make proper browser games.
P1:39:51 <citricsquid> more casual gamers for browser based
P1:39:56 <liq3> Siiseli: Because browser games are good for 2d platformers.
P1:39:57 <iPope> browser games open a whole new market to your game
P1:40:04 <liq3> And some 2D platformers are actually good.
P1:40:15 <Siiseli> liq3, noo theyy're noot
P1:40:21 <liq3> Siiseli: Played N?
P1:40:22 <Siiseli> I meant good for platformers that is
P1:40:25 <JTE> Heh. My first Java applet was a Megaman-styled 2D platformer.
P1:40:27 <JTE> That was fun.
P1:40:28 <Dilt> oh, trust me
P1:40:31 <JTE> Then my harddrive failed.
P1:40:33 <JTE> And I lost it all. :3
P1:40:34 <Dilt> i'm making a browser game right now
P1:40:35 <Siiseli> liq3, exceptions expshmecshions
P1:40:39 <Dilt> currently i have the initial database set up
P1:40:39 <liq3> hahaha :P
P1:40:42 <iPope> nope, 2d games are fun
P1:40:48 <iPope> lots of fun
P1:40:53 <liq3> I know 3 good Browser games. N, Minecraft and Audiotorium.

P1:41:11 <Siiseli> iPope, is 2d some kind of "not good"-sign for most?
P1:41:16 <Dilt> it's a plain -browser- game, in php with baybe a pinch of javascript
P1:41:32 <Dilt> you make robots and send them into combat
P1:41:33 <iPope> Siiseli: your expecting too much from browser games
P1:41:35 <liq3> Dilt: All php based games automatically fail.
P1:41:37 <Siiseli> I generally have found most 2d games to be much more fun than any 3d game I've plaed.
P1:41:48 <iPope> Dwarf Fortress is one of the best games i have oplayed, and everything is symbols
P1:41:57 <Siiseli> so?
P1:41:58 <liq3> iPope: It needs good UI
P1:42:01 <JTE> I like two kinds of games: 2D platformers, 3D first person shooters.
P1:42:01 <Dilt> mind you, it's pretty much just a casual game
P1:42:04 <JTE> :3~
P1:42:05 <iPope> its UI is fine
P1:42:07 <Siiseli> df does need an ui
P1:42:09 <Dilt> CASUAL GAMERS~
P1:42:12 <liq3> Dilt: That's why they all automatically fail.
P1:42:25 <Dilt> excuse me liq3, i'm not done using my nintendo buzzwords
P1:42:28 <Dilt> CASUAL GAMERSSSS
P1:42:33 <Dilt> WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME OUT?
P1:42:34 <Siiseli> I coded one game for browsers
P1:42:37 <Siiseli> making it was meh
P1:42:41 <Siiseli> because it's a browser game.
P1:42:51 <liq3> iPope: no it isn't, it has one of the worst UI's ever.
P1:42:55 <citricsquid> casual gamers shit money, but only little shits.
P1:42:59 <Siiseli> I went back to coding with c++ and stuffs and this makes me happy
P1:43:05 <iPope> ui and graphics arent everything
P1:43:14 <Dilt> mainly i'm a compsci geek and i'm using a game as an excuse to write some code that handles the robot part datatype I thought up
P1:43:14 <Dilt> :D
P1:43:19 <liq3> UI is one of the most important parts of any game.
P1:43:28 <Siiseli> no really iPope the ui is awful
P1:43:40 <iPope> and? the gameplay is good
P1:43:45 <iPope> thats what matters in the end
P1:43:50 <Siiseli> doesn't make the ui good
P1:43:53 <vdgmprgrmr> UI has HUGE effects on gameplay.
P1:43:57 <liq3> iPope: Yes, it is. The UI is still terrible, and it detracts from the game.
P1:44:07 <iPope> i dont think it detracts
P1:44:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Seeing how you have to use the UI to PLAY the GAME.
P1:44:12 <Siiseli> it'd be better if not for the horrid ui
P1:44:16 <iPope> if you get past the learning curve its fine
P1:44:30 <liq3> iPope: It's extremely easy to survive.
P1:44:44 <iPope> choose somewhere hard to survive then
P1:44:53 <liq3> There is no where. :P
P1:44:58 <liq3> except maybe above ground.
P1:45:03 <JTE> But the thing is, now I can use OpenGL. In web browsers. I know how to use OpenGL. I've made OpenGL games and stuff before. :3~ I can do stuff with it.
P1:45:05 <liq3> All you need is stone + hemp seeds.
P1:45:12 <liq3> erm, not hemp, plump.
P1:45:20 <iPope> what about sieges?
P1:45:25 <iPope> megabeasts
P1:45:33 <liq3> ...Those might be harder xD
P1:45:39 <liq3> But basic survival is easy. :P
P1:45:51 <liq3> Actually, Megabeasts and stuff are easy too.
P1:45:54 <iPope> but your not going futher than first year
P1:45:56 <liq3> dunno about siegges.
P1:46:09 <liq3> You just trap them in really deep pits. :D
P1:46:23 <liq3> They can't hurt you if they can't get to you :P
P1:46:31 <iPope> what about starting in a frightning area?
P1:46:40 <iPope> most of your dwarfes slaughtered in first season
P1:46:42 <liq3> T...yeh...
P1:47:12 <liq3> Point is, while the UI is terrible, the game will never be popular.
P1:47:21 <Dilt> but yes
P1:47:23 <iPope> but it is popular
P1:47:26 <Dilt> and there's also absolutely no tutorial
P1:47:29 <liq3> Not popular enough! :P
P1:47:34 <iPope> heard of the wiki?
P1:47:36 <Dilt> it would be rampant if there were a proper tutorial

P1:47:56 <Dilt> you are wrong
P1:48:02 <Dilt> it has to be an ingame tutorial
P1:48:04 <liq3> The video tutorial is like 2+ hours long. :p

P1:48:24 <Dilt> having to look up an external tutorial is a motivation killer
P1:48:38 <liq3> iPope: The other problem with the game is scale...
P1:48:41 <Dilt> iPope: indeed, which is why the tutorial needs to be mentioned when we talk about UI improvement
P1:48:46 <iPope> i think toady would rather work on gameplay that tutorials
P1:48:49 <liq3> Unless he doesn't plan to finish the game for another 3-4 years...
P1:48:59 <iPope> he doesn't, its early aplha

P1:49:55 <vdgmprgrmr> They'll run out of stuff to add when it hits 0.0.4 or some crap.

P2:05:57 <Super-Dot> beaten by two people =/
P2:06:00 <Awol10> ok then adobe shouldn't mess with others languages
P2:06:01 <citricsquid> :D
P2:06:30 <Awol10> in the 3 different versions of AS they do thing 3 different ways!
P2:06:31 <LF> Notch how about seeing how many blocks of sand are above it?
P2:06:41 <Super-Dot> Isn't ActionScript 3 supposed to be way better than the first two?
P2:06:53 <LF> If it's 2 or more slide the first one out and move the bit above down
P2:07:26 <Awol10> it is but they managed to change how things are done. Was trying to scroll to the bottom of a text box... well it seems that they changed the method name for no good reason
P2:07:28 <08Notch> Super-Dot: It is!
P2:07:33 <08Notch> but it still sucks. ;)
P2:07:37 <Super-Dot> Heh
P2:07:40 <citricsquid> as3 is more programming than as2 and 1, apparently.
P2:07:54 <Super-Dot> That would be an argument in FAVOR of letting Adobe mess with programming languages

P2:08:28 <Super-Dot> Maybe they changed the method name because the new method name makes more sense :O
P2:08:46 <liq3> I don't know why you'd want to use AS anyway, it's slow as.
P2:09:05 <Super-Dot> it's slow as ______
P2:09:10 <Super-Dot> Mad Libs!
P2:09:20 <liq3> Molasses.
P2:09:28 <Awol10> Super-Dot: It was but the funny part was in AS 1 is was the same name they changed it to something else to change it back
P2:09:38 <Super-Dot> I was going to say "potatoes"

P2:09:42 <08Notch> liq3: In survival mode, yes, it's very likely

P2:09:56 <liq3> We're be able to use them to kill people right?
P2:10:00 <Awol10> so searching for help on this I was looking at an older version wondering why sample code wasn't working

P2:10:50 <08Notch> Prime_2: It's fixed, but i haven't put out a new server version yet
P2:10:53 <Super-Dot> Yeah, dirt should sink when placed over water
P2:10:56 <08Notch> i just fixed a bug with it, though..
P2:10:57 <Super-Dot> Sheesh
P2:11:01 <Prime_2> let me guess
P2:11:05 <Prime_2> it removed all water on the way down?
P2:11:17 <08Notch> no, it spawned water where the sand was..
P2:11:19 <Awol10> hey Notch why doesn't Minecraft do my work?
P2:11:22 <Prime_2> oh
P2:11:23 <Prime_2> lol
P2:11:29 <08Notch> :D
P2:11:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, what?
P2:11:36 <08Notch> you can try it in sp if you want to see the bug :D
P2:11:43 <Awol10> its a cool bug
P2:11:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Dirt's supposed to sink if it's over water?
P2:11:52 <08Notch> no, but sand is
P2:11:58 <08Notch> scroll down! =D
P2:12:01 <Super-Dot> I was kidding :P
P2:12:20 <08Notch> god, I love the clouds
P2:12:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
P2:12:22 <08Notch> they're so solly
P2:12:24 <08Notch> *silly!
P2:12:32 <Prime_2> anyways
P2:12:33 <Prime_2> Notch!
P2:12:33 <citricsquid> clouds? It's floating paper!
P2:12:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I made big actual clouds with white blocks.
P2:12:43 <Prime_2> In survival mode, I want you to replace all the zombies with Jesus
P2:12:45 <08Notch> yeah =D
P2:12:54 <Prime_2> and if a Jesus kills you, you become another Jesus
P2:12:56 <liq3> lol jesus mode?
P2:12:57 <Super-Dot> I like how one can jump above the clouds
P2:13:01 <Prime_2> Night of The Living Jesus
P2:13:03 <JTE> Christian mode.
P2:13:11 <vdgmprgrmr> But I was stupid and put them too far up so I couldn't make a fortress on them.
P2:13:13 <Super-Dot> Though I still wish I could build one or two blocks above them
P2:13:18 <Prime_2> it actually makes sense if you think about it
P2:13:28 <Prime_2> Jesus is a zombie! He came back from the dead on easter
P2:13:47 <Super-Dot> He's so polite
P2:13:54 <PuyoDead> hence "sweet zombie jesus"
P2:13:57 <Prime_2> ...hehehehe
P2:13:59 <Prime_2> Notch
P2:14:02 <Super-Dot> Other zombies would be biting brains out left and right
P2:14:02 <Awol10> more like Jesus was an undead but not quite a zombie
P2:14:06 <Prime_2> I seriously want you to do this
P2:14:13 <Prime_2> make it do it on the week of easter
P2:14:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh hey a friend of mine had an idea about how to do ambient sounds for MC. Basically, everything based on your elevation and whether or not the spot you're in is dark.
P2:14:22 <Awol10> would be a cool easter egg
P2:14:26 <liq3> Jesus must be the one who started the infection! 
P2:14:54 <Prime_2> yeah, and the turned zombies are christians
P2:14:58 <liq3> Prime_2: Rofl. Zombie Jesus's attacking everyone on easter. :P
P2:14:59 <Prime_2> and the boss zombies are apostles
P2:15:11 <Prime_2> Yeah
P2:15:14 <liq3> That'd be epic.
P2:15:18 <vdgmprgrmr> And then ZONB3H G0D
P2:15:19 <Prime_2> but he wouldn't look like a zombie, just like Jesus.
P2:15:20 <Super-Dot> vdgmprgrmr, then I would hear bat noises when I enter my house :O
P2:15:20 <liq3> he could like make it free for a week to, as advertising. :D
P2:15:32 <vdgmprgrmr> No you wouldn't!
P2:15:54 <Prime_2> left 4 minecraft
P2:15:55 <Super-Dot> But it's dark in my house
P2:15:59 <Super-Dot> Since there's a roof
P2:16:12 <vdgmprgrmr> But the elevation in your house is different than the elevation of most caves.
P2:16:24 <Super-Dot> Oh, a combination
P2:16:26 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: What if you live a cave, but clear out the bats regurarly?
P2:16:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Well then that sucks for you!
P2:16:48 <vdgmprgrmr> And we wouldn't really need bat sounds anyway.
P2:17:07 <Super-Dot> Of course we need bat sounds
P2:17:14 <Super-Dot> Otherwise the bats can't echolocate
P2:17:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I was just thinking the drippity-droppity of water coming of stalactites or something.
P2:18:18 <JTE> There's a terrible bug in my custom block code, I've found...
P2:18:41 <liq3> JTE: What ARE you making?
P2:18:41 <JTE> When it loads a map containing them, they turn into the block type they're set to look like instead to the client
P2:18:53 <JTE> So my new watervator blocks turn into normal water. D:
P2:19:13 <Super-Dot> On the bright side, flooding is FUN
P2:20:07 <Super-Dot> JTE, you had to reimplement the cellular automata stuff yourself, right?
P2:20:28 <Super-Dot> Since that stuff happens serverside?

P4:24:13 <liq3> Nah, we need Survival.
P4:24:43 <Eagle> Admin Glass Blocks would definitely help stop the griefing in my server. :O
P4:25:00 <Eagle> Mainly because there's a trail of lava on the ceiling
P4:25:05 <Eagle> And I want people to see it
P4:25:15 <Eagle> But every once in a while people unleash it too early
P4:25:25 <liq3> lol early?
P4:25:25 <liq3> :p
P4:25:26 <Eagle> So I have to block it off with adminblocks and then nobody can see it.
P4:25:33 <Eagle> Yeah, Lava Survival
P4:25:52 <Eagle> I let a trail of lava slowly go around the top of the map until it hits the center
P4:25:52 <liq3> man, what we need is a real lava survival.
P4:26:34 <liq3> LOL. That'd be evil.
P4:27:16 <ZomBuster> that would be cool in survival 
P4:27:30 <ZomBuster> because you would have to work to build stuff
P4:27:48 <liq3> Hrm.
P4:27:53 <ZomBuster> and the lava kills all the animals too so you would need alternative food supplies
P4:28:06 <liq3> Ah...

P4:28:18 <liq3> What'd be fun is lava survival, and tehre's like a volcano. :D
P4:28:24 <liq3> and lava flows out of it constantly.
P4:28:42 <ZomBuster> you could build a wall around it
P4:28:48 <liq3> No, not really.
P4:28:51 <liq3> It'd be too big.
P4:29:02 <liq3> Like, it'd flood before anyone could stop it. :p
P4:29:17 <ZomBuster> build underground and close the entrance :D
P4:29:25 <liq3> Make health slowly drain. :P
P4:29:27 <liq3> i.e. hunger. ;]
P4:29:37 <ZomBuster> you could eat the other players
P4:29:41 <liq3> LOL.
P4:29:45 <Eagle> Ahahahahaha!
P4:29:46 <Eagle> XD
P4:29:56 <liq3> You'd run out of players to eat. :P
P4:30:06 <ZomBuster> mushrooms
P4:30:14 <ZomBuster> cave elephants
P4:30:17 <Eagle> Yourself
P4:30:20 <liq3> lol cave elephants.
P4:30:46 <liq3> rofl... there needs to be a castle war mode.
P4:30:48 <liq3> Would be so fun. :D
P4:31:25 <Eagle> Flood the other castle with lava
P4:32:14 <Awol10> would be awesome if there was a catapult to use
P4:32:18 <liq3> Nah, you just build it above lava level.
P4:32:19 <Malcovent> <3 indeed
P4:32:21 <Malcovent> launch stone blocks
P4:32:28 <Malcovent> =P and then depending on what block it hits, it destroys more blocks
P4:32:36 <liq3> Awol: Lulz, I could simulate catapults with lua. :P
P4:32:38 <ZomBuster> that would be cool
P4:32:50 <ZomBuster> Notch already was working on arrows
P4:32:58 <Malcovent> rofl xD <3
P4:32:59 <ZomBuster> both work pretty much the same
P4:33:09 <Malcovent> i hope weapons are allowed on online servers
P4:33:15 <Malcovent> so that we can build anything we want and defend it x_x
P4:33:22 <Malcovent> could have some awesome 32 man online games with it xD
P4:33:23 <liq3> online servers?
P4:33:32 <Eagle> Compared to offline servers?
P4:33:33 <Malcovent> as in..
P4:33:43 <Malcovent> rawr! xD
P4:33:47 <liq3> lol...
P4:33:47 <Malcovent> as in the current public building servers
P4:33:49 <Malcovent> opposed to just survival.
P4:33:56 <liq3> maybe there will be a server option?
P4:33:56 <ZomBuster> thats silly
P4:34:03 <Malcovent> why? =P
P4:34:05 <liq3> Yeh,
P4:34:11 <liq3> You can just do whatever you want in Survival.
P4:34:16 <liq3> Like, Survival Sandbox mode.
P4:34:30 <Malcovent> meh
P4:34:37 <liq3> Hrm, I hope critters respawn.
P4:34:47 <liq3> It'd suck to clear out a map of critters. :/
P4:35:03 <ZomBuster> makes sens that they do
P4:35:23 <liq3> Could make like, burrows, that they spawn from. :D
P4:35:30 <liq3> and the burrows randomly over time. xD
P4:35:47 <ZomBuster> you could enclose a burrow, rabbit farm :3
P4:35:53 <liq3> haha, exactly. :P
P4:36:12 <ZomBuster> or when 3 rabbits hit eachother another one pops out randomly
P4:36:17 <ZomBuster> I mean 2
P4:36:18 <liq3> ...3?
P4:36:19 <liq3> lol.
P4:36:43 <Malcovent> awesome x_x
P4:36:52 <ZomBuster> completely unrealistic but it would be hilarious to have farms overflooded with rabbits
P4:37:01 <liq3> lol...
P4:37:01 <Malcovent> well, aslong as they drown in water =P
P4:37:03 <Malcovent> *evil* xD
P4:37:07 <liq3> rofl, i could see it now.
P4:37:17 <liq3> having like 1000 rabbits in this 4x4 pen.
P4:37:30 <liq3> then letting them all out and hunting them xD
P4:37:37 <liq3> omg...
P4:37:38 <Malcovent> xD
P4:37:44 <ZomBuster> or let the lava flood in
P4:37:45 <liq3> should do it with spiders... NO, BEARS!

P4:37:55 <liq3> Trapping some bears in a cave.
P4:38:03 <Malcovent> that way can trap bears in secret comparments in buildings x_x!
P4:38:04 <liq3> leaving them for a few hours to mate.
P4:38:08 <Malcovent> greifer tears it down and relases BEARS!
P4:38:09 <liq3> then letting them out!
P4:38:16 <liq3> and you have to survive the wave of bears. :P
P4:38:44 <liq3> and the bears could be really evil and like, have the ability to wear down walls. o.o
P4:39:03 <ZomBuster> D:
P4:39:27 <liq3> Man, I hope there's like, some digging type animal in survival.
P4:39:46 <Malcovent> should be poisoning animals x_x
P4:39:52 <Malcovent> snakes or such.. would be awesome
P4:40:01 <ZomBuster> and then you would have to find antidote
P4:40:46 <Malcovent> id love to just fill a small chamber with snakes..
P4:40:54 <Malcovent> infact that would be a awesome twist to spleef
P4:40:54 <ZomBuster> I had this idea of different types of animals
P4:41:10 <ZomBuster> ones that would dig trough walls so you would need trenches
P4:41:20 <ZomBuster> then ones that jump over the trenches

P7:15:43 <mib_qtvtp8> Who would I email to get my password for my account?
P7:15:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zuriki basically took the opportunity to flame JTE and assume the reasons he was doing this in the first place, sucked Notch off, and flexed his powers in the same post... Just seems off to me.  Also, threatening JTE with a ban for no reason
P7:15:55 <citricsquid> mib_qtvtp8: notch@mojang.com
P7:16:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Unless it was under Notch's request
P7:16:20 <mib_qtvtp8> Thanks citric
P7:16:43 <Eagle> What did JTE do that Zuriki threatened a ban for?
P7:16:44 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Her* Also she pretty much presented what Notch has said; he doesn't want people doing mods before he has allowed them. He doesn't want free players getting the full game either, it seems reasonable what he wants.
P7:16:59 <citricsquid> eagle: If he distributes the server client he's programmed.
P7:17:06 <Eagle> !
P7:17:08 <Eagle> But
P7:17:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold on, let me pull up the post
P7:17:21 <Eagle> JTE's doesn't have anything that Paid users would get.
P7:17:45 <citricsquid> eagle: afaik he's planning on building game modes etc
P7:17:46 <Eagle> If anything all it does is make owning a server easier.
P7:17:54 <Eagle> Well
P7:17:57 <Eagle> That's wtf
P7:18:20 <citricsquid> eagle: Is it fair for him to steal what Notch has been building? I mean, if you started a game then I beat you to finishing it would you let me distribute it?
P7:18:32 <Eagle> That's why I said wtf.
P7:18:37 <citricsquid> ok :D
P7:18:41 <Eagle> :D
P7:19:15 <citricsquid> Notch, as far as I'm aware - so don't take this as the truth or anything - has no problem with making your own stuff, but distribution isn't allowed. So you can do what you like with the game, but don't distribute it.
P7:19:38 <AlLnAtuRalX>  advertise said hacks on here (not hacks, it's a rewrite of the entire code),  cracking the game ... This has nothing to do with cracking the game or circumventing DRM, it is a rewrite, leech the success of Minecraft (which he openly announced) (I doubt those were Notch's words, it seems he alway stakes a more moderate position when pressed about this),  But these operations should be shutdown immediately upon release of
P7:19:39 <AlLnAtuRalX>  the Lua scripting (why, if these let you do things the LUA can't, that's unreasonable and almost totalitarian)
P7:19:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> That was @ citricsquid BTW
10P7:20:56 * Jat (Mibbit@ool-457917b5.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
P7:21:12 <citricsquid> I don't represent notch and neither does zuriki, but from what I can tell that is notchs opinion: He doesn't want people taking his game and creating modifications for it and then distributing them without his permission or waiting for the official mod release. He doesn't want 100s of different versions of his game floating around. He wants the paid users to be rewarded
P7:21:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> If JTE said, here' s a crack, a script that gives you a free MC account, I would second Zuriki, but that's not at all what he's doing... people seem to be missing that
P7:21:40 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: He's taken notchs game, built a copy of the server and has been told not to distribute it, what isn't fair about that?
P7:21:47 <Rroff> tbh not sure what the point of what JTE is doing is
P7:22:07 <liq3> citric: He seems to mainly want paid users to get rewarded for buying... 
P7:22:12 <Rroff> its nice to add some extra features but completely rewriting it means hes gotta keep it updated at the same time as notch to keep it relevant
P7:22:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> By who citricsquid ?  If Notch makes a topic in there saying he agrees with Zuriki, I'll drop it
P7:22:23 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: lemme find blog post
P7:22:23 <liq3> And imo, I think the main reason he doesn't want hacks yet, is because he'll make a lot less money.
P7:22:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, Saw them all
P7:22:34 <Eagle> I should probably take Notch off my highlight list... >>;
P7:22:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> I want to see him use or agree with the leeching terminology, and the fact that this is a hack and a crack
P7:22:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's all
P7:22:55 <citricsquid> "
P7:22:55 <citricsquid> I dont wish to lose control of this project, and definitely not before its been finished."
P7:22:58 <citricsquid> is the bottom line.
P7:23:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> I read it
P7:23:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> read above plox
P7:23:07 <liq3> AllNatural: The only real problem with it is that it'll make buying the game pointless.
P7:23:21 <Adura> The main issue is, you're referring to JTE as male?
P7:23:22 <liq3> Because anyone and they're dog will get just about any mod.
P7:23:35 <Jat> jte is a female?
P7:23:36 <Eagle> JTE's name is John.
P7:23:37 <Eagle> ?
P7:23:38 <citricsquid> jte isn't a man?! but he looked like one =o
P7:24:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> liq3, respectfully disagree, there are plenty of things that make the game worth it
P7:24:04 <liq3> Time to derail IRC: 3.4 second.s
P7:24:09 <Adura> Looked, where?
P7:24:09 <Jat> well jte being a female does explain a lot
P7:24:13 <liq3> Allnatural: Name one.
P7:24:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Official mod support.  survival
P7:24:39 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I bought the game - ignoring the support for notch - because I want survival mode and more features. If JTE can offer that for free why would I buy the game?
P7:24:41 <liq3> Survival alone is not really worth the asking price.
P7:24:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> JTE has said that unless he rewrites in C, there will be no mod support

P7:24:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Where do you see JTE giving survival or mod support?
P7:25:05 <citricsquid> It's been mentioned as intended.
P7:25:13 <liq3> AllNatural: It'll be completely opensource if he releases it in Perl.
P7:25:18 <citricsquid> This is what notch is annoyed about afaik
P7:25:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not official mod support liq3 
P7:25:28 <Adura> Whend you get to see what JTE looks like?
P7:25:32 <liq3> AllNatural: Doesn't matter.
P7:25:54 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=7059#p7059 AlLnAtuRalX <<
P7:25:55 <liq3> Modders are usally rather tech savvy to begin with. They'll learn Perl if they have to.
P7:25:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, it kind of does... I pay for apps on my phone because the unofficial pirated ones crash frequently, are hard to update, always behind the release cycle
P7:26:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, survival is wheya?
P7:26:27 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: As a player, would you say "$15 for the full game or free for a knock off that does the same?" You'd go for the free one, obviously.
P7:26:51 <Colain> Everyone: Curious, do you guys want a group of shows with the name "Minecraft TV" which includes Machinima, documentries and stuff like that?
P7:26:56 <Jat> once notch adds scripting support what will jtes server have that the official one doesnt?
P7:27:01 <Jat> or cant
P7:27:07 <citricsquid> jat: game modes for free users
P7:27:09 <liq3> Jat: Switch it around. 
P7:27:19 <Jat> oh ok
P7:27:22 <Adura> Whatever the Lua API doesn't offer.
P7:27:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I can rip off Notch right now anyway.. as long as he doesn't force verify-names
P7:27:29 <Jat> yeah
P7:27:40 <citricsquid> If you start building a game then someone finishes it off and ends your revenue stream, you'd be pissed off wouldn't you?
P7:27:45 <Jat> but theres not really that much more you would need to do that the lua notch has mentioned cant do
P7:27:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can get all of his jars and dependencies, host them somewhere, and use a server (or crack one later if needed) that supports them
P7:27:56 <Jat> even if lua sucks
P7:27:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> bypassing Notch's system
P7:28:04 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Yes, and that's bad.
P7:28:06 <PuyoDead> it would kind of piss me off, too, since I would like to see Notch finish his own project
P7:28:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, that's a crack
P7:28:10 <citricsquid> I don't see your point.
P7:28:13 <liq3> AllNatural: I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
P7:28:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Taking Notch's code, distributing it
P7:28:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> very illegal
P7:28:29 <PuyoDead> I don't see him doing that if JTE just does and makes more of the game himself
P7:28:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Why not? 
P7:28:46 <PuyoDead> why would he?
P7:28:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Remember that Notch is in this for the dough, and if people keep buying, he'll keep working
P7:28:58 <citricsquid> If someone does it before him, what does he gain? He can't work for free.
P7:29:00 <Akai> I think, JTE, should, at the very least, wait until the game itself is finished. Then talk with Notch
P7:29:11 <citricsquid> and if JTE beats him why would anyone pay? they'd play JTEs free version
P7:29:20 <Colain> I think what JTE is doing is cool, but I dislike him doing it while Notch is working on it.
P7:29:29 <PuyoDead> yea, but if people can get the same (or more) feature for free from a custom server, why buy it?
P7:29:30 <citricsquid> Colain: Exactly.
P7:29:32 <liq3> Akai: I think the best solution may be to ask Notch if Notch can change the packets later on, to disable old versions of JTE's server.
P7:29:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because if JTE does some things, Notch could do others / do them better, and he can have official support... remember, Notch could easily break JTE altogether
P7:29:52 <liq3> So when Lua mods and Survival go paid only, he can just make JTE's stop working.
P7:29:57 <citricsquid> JTEs server is awesome and clever and mad props to him for it, but nobody should be justifying ripping off notch.
P7:29:58 <PuyoDead> yea, it is very cool stuff, no doubt. but it would be nice if he'd let Notch actually finish the game first
P7:30:36 <Akai> or maybe helped Notch with it?
P7:30:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch also said once that if someone buys the game, they can decompile or do whatever they want with it, as long as they don't illegaly distribute his code
P7:30:39 <liq3> Actually, right now JTE's can't do much at all.
P7:30:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don'
P7:30:42 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: You realise how fickle players are, right? They couldn't give a toss, the cheaper the better, dangle a free minecraft infront of them with paid features and they'll switch to it without any thought.
P7:30:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> t see how this is outside that
P7:30:53 <Eagle> Citric I remember that. :O
P7:30:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, those same players aren't the market, they wouldn't pay ANYWAY :P
P7:31:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> trust me, I deal with em every day
P7:31:14 <Akai> actually...
P7:31:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> If it's not free, they'll move on, the people who pay pay for the quality / to support Notch
P7:31:26 <Akai> question...
P7:31:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm sure you're in the same ballpark as me

P7:31:45 <Akai> wouldn't griefers probably go for the free option, rather than paying to grief?
P7:31:48 <citricsquid> I bought the game for the features, if I could have had it for free I would have. I am a premium player, surely I put that category?
P7:31:56 <Colain> Lets not forget, Notch has his stuff copywrited.
P7:32:02 <Colain> And I would go for the real version.
P7:32:02 <liq3> Hahaha I think Akai just won this argument.
P7:32:10 <Colain> Because I <3 Notch.
P7:32:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> You yourself said you'd pay for quality citricsquid, did you not?
P7:32:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> The original is always better than the knockoff
P7:32:22 <Akai> I myself plan on paying anyways.
P7:32:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> I believe we were discussing VPS
P7:32:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> s when you said that
P7:32:30 <citricsquid> and what if I don't know about the full version?

P7:32:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> You told me that if you didn't poay for quality, you're not worth having as a customer?
P7:32:50 <liq3> It's just an argument between citric and Allnatural now.
P7:32:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> no?
P7:32:55 <liq3> They're ignoring everyone else.
P7:33:01 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: One off payment != customer imo
P7:33:01 <Akai> And I remember I stopped playing Lineage 2 free servers once I'd had a taste of the real, pay to play, deal.
P7:33:02 <PuyoDead> mostly, heh
P7:33:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> +1 to Akai BTW
P7:33:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh no/
P7:33:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> A customer, also client, buyer or purchaser is the buyer or user of the paid products of an individual or organization, mostly called the supplier or seller. This is typically through purchasing or renting goods or services.
P7:33:45 <Animator> Someone get the lawyers! This shit just went legal!
P7:33:51 <citricsquid> I'm not talking about the definition, I'm talking about what I meant when I said about VPS things.

P7:37:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> eg - A written statement condoning the ban of JTE
P7:37:18 <notcitricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Did anyone claim to be acting on behalf of notch? o.0

P7:37:33 <Adura> No, just wondered what'd happen if JTE did post the code.
P7:37:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> You guys are talking about Notch's opinions / getting them a little lost in translation, I just want to see an official statement from him
P7:37:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's all..> Saying JTE should be banned for posting code
P7:38:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just saying, if he gets banned without that, ban me as well
P7:38:28 <notcitricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: Nobody will be banned for making anything, notch has no problem with that. If anyone gave that impression then feel free to correct them :P
10P7:38:37 * notcitricsquid is now known as citricsquid
P7:39:02 <Eagle> Let's remember that JTE didn't make another Minecraft
P7:39:08 <Eagle> He just made another server code
P7:39:14 <Colain> I believe that if JTE produced that client, or anyone else produces a client like that, it would be invading copyright, they would be fined. Producing it would be hard to keep hidden, due to the lack of publicity of Minecraft compared to others games, would it not?
P7:39:25 <citricsquid> which, as far as I can tell, is going to be used to create gamemodes accesible by free players.
P7:39:39 <Colain> It never said that citric.
P7:39:48 <liq3> citricsquid: Actually, atm it can't.
P7:39:56 <liq3> Since the client can only create/destroy block.s

P7:43:06 <Colain> Yeah, making "Infection" would be stealing Notch's future ideas for his own game.
P7:43:14 <Colain> Your right Citric.
P7:43:18 <Azjherben> Hello
P7:43:30 <Azjherben> What is this "Infection"?
P7:43:34 <Colain> hi, major debate here
P7:43:43 <Azjherben> Oh, sounds intresting.
P7:43:55 <liq3> I still say the best way is to change how the packets work or something, to make JTE's stop working once paid goes through. :/
P7:44:00 <citricsquid> colain: That's the problem everyone has, he would be making purchasing the game pointless for any other reason than supporting notch which most people wouldn't. You have to remember, notch wants to live off this.
P7:44:10 <citricsquid> liq3: Surely that can be worked around?
P7:44:29 <Azjherben> I don't think 15 dollars is a huge price
P7:44:30 <liq3> citric: It'd be as hard or harder then just straight hacking the current jar client. :P
P7:44:40 <Azjherben> Considering the game and future updates
P7:44:46 <Colain> It's going to go up azjherben
P7:44:54 <Azjherben> What?
P7:45:01 <liq3> especially if JTE wrote his server in C++ first, and used Lua moddin.
P7:45:03 <Colain> The price.
P7:45:08 <Azjherben> I know
P7:45:11 <Azjherben> To 30
P7:45:22 <PuyoDead> I like liq3's idea myself. a small game code change to render it useless. only thing is, that an unnecessary bit of interuption :P
P7:45:33 <citricsquid> Notch wants to make this his job, people making buying the game pointless destroy his plans. 
P7:45:37 <liq3> Puyodead: What do you mean interuption?
P7:45:47 <Colain> I agree totally with Citricsquid.
P7:45:48 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: I thought notch didn't mind mods though, he just doesn't want them distributed. He wouldn't block them...
P7:46:03 <PuyoDead> as in, having to go out of his way to "fix" something
P7:46:15 <Azjherben> Wait, so what's happening to make buying the game pointless?
P7:46:16 <liq3> PuyoDead: It could be as simple as version number. :p
P7:46:17 <PuyoDead> oh, I know. I'm talking about a potential release
P7:46:19 <Azjherben> Really good mods?\
P7:46:47 <Colain> But a mod, that releases future game types, to the non-paying public would make people just play there, making Notch have no customers.
P7:46:49 <liq3> I mean Notch invalidates old server versions with client updates frequently anyway.
P7:46:51 <PuyoDead> yea, but something simple could be simple to circumvent
P7:47:02 <PuyoDead> but hey, what do I knoq
P7:47:04 <PuyoDead> know
P7:47:14 <citricsquid> Azjherben: Someone has built a server side client that replaces the official one, we're saying if it were released as publicly downloadable it would undermine notchs work because nobody would have to buy the game to play new game modes :)
P7:47:39 <Azjherben> Yeah, that'd be bad for Notch. And he deserves the money.
P7:47:50 <liq3> PuyoDead: He's going to have to add code to check if someone is paid when he goes that route too. 
P7:47:53 <Azjherben> Maybe...
P7:48:00 <PuyoDead> but really, in the long run, Notch would obviously be able to do far more awesome things if he wants
P7:48:01 <Azjherben> Notch could make the payed game moddable
P7:48:09 <PuyoDead> that's the idea, sorta
P7:48:20 <liq3> Azjherben: He's going to.
P7:48:36 <Azjherben> Good, I wanna try modding it,I'm going to buy it soon.
P7:48:39 <Colain> but then, if JTE pays, he could always have the non-paying public come in, he could have the mods.
P7:48:52 <liq3> colain: Eh?
P7:49:09 <liq3> lol colain, you just gave me an evil idea. hahahaha.
P7:49:29 <Colain> If the pay-only modable version comes out, JTE could buy payable and still realise the types to the public.
P7:49:34 <Colain> Or anyone else, if they know coding.
P7:49:36 <citricsquid> it's always possible to bypass the security of the game, we're discussing ethics not methods. With enough effort you can bypass anything.
P7:49:43 <liq3> A single server with paid mods and such, that free players can use. Of course, max players of 24 and there's only 1. ;]
P7:50:00 <Azjherben> Okay, is JTE like a users name?
P7:50:05 <PuyoDead> yea
P7:50:06 <Azjherben> I've never seen a JTE
P7:50:09 <Colain> JTE is a user.
P7:50:09 <Azjherben> But okay
P7:50:12 <Azjherben> k
P7:50:13 <citricsquid> JTE is awsm.
P7:50:18 <UnknownX> look in the chat list
P7:50:32 <Azjherben> I see him.
P7:50:33 <UnknownX> JTE is idle
P7:50:35 <liq3> citric: Ethics of bypassing and making Notch lose money is straight out wrong. There's nothing to discuss.
P7:50:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Aw gawd, JTE is going to wake up with too many highlights
P7:50:46 <PuyoDead> haha
P7:50:51 <UnknownX> and you just added another one
P7:50:56 <Azjherben> JTE
P7:50:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly my point ;)
P7:51:01 <liq3> Lets give JTE another! :D
P7:51:09 <citricsquid> Drakkar BING
P7:51:16 <UnknownX> oh no
P7:51:19 <Colain> And JTE will not be happy for another two! Hurray JTE!
P7:51:32 <liq3> Colain: It's only one per message I think.
P7:51:34 <Azjherben> Anyway.... JTE probally dosn't want to make Notch lose all his money. Idk JTE but I hope JTE isn't that mean. JTE JTE JTE
P7:51:40 <Colain> Curses.
P7:52:07 <liq3> Kay, what FPS should I set my game at?
P7:52:13 <citricsquid> 2
P7:52:14 <liq3> I'm thinking 30. o.O
P7:52:20 <UnknownX> it only highlights it once even if you were to say JTE 1,375,436,452,343,452,323,452,343 times
P7:52:32 <UnknownX> 50
P7:52:35 <PuyoDead> 6000
P7:52:36 <Colain> .1 ?
P7:52:38 <liq3> Eh, 50 is rather high...
P7:52:45 <Azjherben> I set my view mode to short and my FPS is usually high. :P
P7:52:46 <UnknownX> i go to 100

P9:17:33 <Wolfram> Hello, MANCHiLD.
P9:17:37 <MANCHiLD> Hia.
P9:18:10 <Wolfram> Don't think I've seen your name in here before
P9:18:15 <Wolfram> But then, I'm not in here very often, either
P9:18:23 <MANCHiLD> Likely not. This is my first time.
P9:18:24 <Colain> Kk, want me to check out the server now? I won't do any filming or anything, just look.
P9:18:32 <MANCHiLD> Was only poking in to see if notch was active.
P9:18:41 <MANCHiLD> I work in videogames and had a small suggestion.
P9:19:20 <MANCHiLD> Not that the former information is important.
P9:19:27 <Colain> to teh suggestion page in Wiki?
P9:19:36 <MANCHiLD> Mm, I'd rather not.
P9:19:43 <Wolfram> Want to keep it to yourself, eh.
P9:19:57 <MANCHiLD> No. Not in the slightest.
P9:20:07 <MANCHiLD> I'd much rather converse about it then put it up in the sea of suggestions.
P9:20:17 <Wolfram> I see. So what is this suggestion, then?
P9:20:23 <MANCHiLD> Mmm.
P9:20:38 <MANCHiLD> I think his focus on adding proper gameplay for this sort of game is unessecary.

P9:22:01 <MANCHiLD> Re: Block relationships. It's there now. But its infant.
P9:22:09 <Colain> chrstfer, why aren't you in your own server?
P9:22:23 <chrstfer> um, ill be there in a sec
P9:22:29 <Wolfram> You mean like sand and gravel falling, light spreading grass from grass to dirt, etc?
P9:22:43 <MANCHiLD> Water stopped by sponges, and so on.
P9:22:43 <MANCHiLD> Yes.
P9:23:25 <Wolfram> To be honest, I'm not sure I agree.
P9:23:38 <MANCHiLD> Don't focus on my comments about the blocks.
P9:23:38 <Wolfram> Many aspects of the game could use some polish, but while Sandbox will remain free...
P9:23:41 <MANCHiLD> Its minor.
P9:23:47 <Wolfram> Survival will be paid-only
P9:23:57 <Wolfram> And thus releasing it will increase his sales, or so goes the theory
P9:24:39 <PuyoDead> I would say that aside from some small nitpicking, sandbox is for the most part, complete. well, complete enough to remain on its own and head to survival
P9:24:50 <MANCHiLD> Mm.
P9:24:52 <MANCHiLD> Disagree.
P9:24:58 <MANCHiLD> Sandbox is functional atm, but not robust.
P9:25:06 <MANCHiLD> I cannot find my friends online.
P9:25:10 <MANCHiLD> Nor can I teleport to them.
P9:25:12 <PuyoDead> well, that's more or less what I mean, it's functional
P9:25:14 <MANCHiLD> I do not have a friends list.
P9:25:18 <MANCHiLD> Nor can I see what they are working on.
P9:25:37 <Wolfram> These things have already been suggested.
P9:25:49 <MANCHiLD> This is why I am not posting abou tit.
P9:25:55 <MANCHiLD> There's an entire discussion about the functionality.
P9:26:05 <MANCHiLD> Outside of the Sandbox.
P9:26:19 <MANCHiLD> And, if I may say it, Survival mode won't be what Minecraft is... to me.
P9:26:27 <MANCHiLD> I can go to any game I want and play survival mode.
P9:26:33 <PuyoDead> yea, but things like an actual downloadable client, more user features, etc, would cover all game modes. and it may just be me, but I'd like to see the game modes themselves released first
P9:26:34 <MANCHiLD> I can't go to any game I want and build and explore.
P9:26:43 <Wolfram> You can do both in Survival.
P9:26:49 <Wolfram> Which isn't true of other survival games.
P9:26:57 <PuyoDead> I think that's the beauty of it, that it will be such different game types within the game
P9:27:00 <MANCHiLD> It's still stress on the gameplay, not on the other factors.
P9:27:03 <MANCHiLD> TLDR
P9:27:17 <MANCHiLD> I do not think Sandbox is fully realized atm and it has entirely too much potential to move on.
P9:27:28 <MANCHiLD> Especially to things that've been done previously.
P9:27:34 <PuyoDead> I'd agree, there's a lot of potential for sandbox still
P9:27:35 <MANCHiLD> I have pasta burning on the stove, brb.

P9:32:52 <liq3> Manchild: I have 2 problems with it. Well, mainly anyway. 1. Difficulty in getting ahead. 2. Single squads are worth too much.
P9:33:08 <MANCHiLD> The game is about the individual squads.
P9:33:15 <MANCHiLD> Tier 1 is meant to be expensive.
P9:33:22 <MANCHiLD> Tier 2 and 3, respectively, are cheaper.
P9:33:43 <Wolfram> Before the original conversation is too far gone
P9:33:50 <Wolfram> MANCHiLD, what else did you want to see in Sandbox?
P9:34:14 <MANCHiLD> As I said, iterated design on whats there.
P9:34:18 <liq3> Manchild: That's why I don't like it. Squad choice is too simple. It becomes  a game of attrition.
P9:34:28 <MANCHiLD> If the game had proper accessibility, IMO, it wouldn't need other game modes.
P9:34:37 <liq3> I prefer complex games like Go and Starcarft.
P9:34:39 <MANCHiLD> Ah, liq.
P9:34:44 <MANCHiLD> You see, you need to play more.
P9:34:51 <MANCHiLD> It's not as simple as you may see.
P9:35:07 <liq3> It's not, but the complexity is mainly nuicenses, if you know whaht I mean.
P9:35:12 <MANCHiLD> Each squad has 2 handfuls of upgrades within them that change their addition to your strat.
P9:35:14 <Wolfram> Well, in my opinion, even if Sandbox was polished to a mirror sheen
P9:35:16 <Wolfram> I'd still want more modes.
P9:35:19 <JTE> Silly..
P9:35:22 <Wolfram> So we'll have to agree to disagree there.
P9:35:25 <MANCHiLD> ;)
P9:35:26 <MANCHiLD> Cool.
P9:35:39 <JTE> You guys argue about me even when I sleep? Geeze.
P9:35:42 <MANCHiLD> IMO he's doing what's already been done with the game modes. I play Minecraft now because I cannot play this sort of thing anywhere else.
P9:35:45 <PuyoDead> plus, part of the paid option has already been determined to be access to future game modes
P9:36:16 <Wolfram> Fortunately, you'll still be able to do that

P9:40:15 <JTE> That's arguable, apparently.
P9:40:39 <PuyoDead> considering the action earlier, obviously, heh
P9:41:18 <JTE> But Notch doesn't plan on developing everything just to deveop more sandbox mode.
P9:41:35 <JTE> Notch probably isn't planning on making Spleef an official game mode any more than it already is, at that. :P
P9:41:40 <MANCHiLD> JTE is this a seperate release from minecraft?
P9:41:42 <MANCHiLD> Or just 1 server?
P9:42:14 <JTE> at the moment, it's a server that isn't even released and doesn't have a decent public uptime.
P9:42:35 <JTE> It freezes up for several minutes whenever there's a connection error.
P9:43:28 <JTE> And eats my CPU like mad when some morons abusing dynamite blast giant underground tunnels spreading through the entire map and then let water flood through the whole thing
P9:43:57 <JTE> Or even just using a super sponge to clean up such a mess.
P9:45:24 <JTE> The whole server stops to send the map to new joining players, and nothing is threaded, and until recently getting a communication error when trying to connect to minecraft.net to send a heartbeat message to the master game list the server would crash.
P9:46:52 <JTE> My present issue is that of custom tile types (including watervator) turning into normal tile types (such as water) somehow whenever the map is saved and loaded (which is bad, since now there is water floating around everywhere for griefing)
P9:48:04 <JTE> Clearly, it is far from ready for release, even with it's extensive feature set, possibly to the point where Notch's simple servers are still 'better'. Further, I am liable to stop working on my server entirely as I'll get bored within a few days and go off to do other things. :/
P9:50:09 <MANCHiLD> Uhm
P9:50:14 <MANCHiLD> It sounds like you need to work locally.
P9:50:24 <MANCHiLD> Or prison spawn your server.

P10:30:48 <JTE> and then my server STOPPED when it realized he was gone.
P10:30:52 <Colain> Well, how soon before you can get it back?
P10:31:02 <Super-Dot_iPod> Yeah, it crashed on the loading screen
P10:32:04 <JTE> Server coming back up ....
P10:32:18 <JTE> Is up.
P10:33:03 <Colain> In the near future, so we could have infection types and everything, you should change it to Payed only

P10:54:35 <Super-Dot> Hello Saer 
P10:54:36 <Saer> Anyone please help me for a moment
P10:54:41 <Saer> Hello, Super-Dot
P10:54:45 <JTE> No, you're right Super-Dot... Just hold on a moment.
P10:54:56 <Saer> When I attempt to run a server program thing
P10:54:58 <Saer> the batch file
P10:55:03 <Saer> for a private server for ym friends
P10:55:14 <Saer> umm, it says "java" is not a command
P10:55:21 <Saer> and then terminates basically
P10:55:26 <Super-Dot> Are you running Windows?
P10:55:50 <liq3> Super-dot: How could he run the bat file if he wasn't.? O.o
P10:55:57 <Super-Dot> Yeah you must be if you're
P10:56:00 <Super-Dot> yes
P10:56:10 <Thi3f> Saer, there's topics about that on the forum
P10:56:21 <Saer> I looked, but i cant find it
P10:56:33 <Saer> and yes i am running windows
P10:57:12 <Thi3f> Well, I'm guessing you've got Java installed, right?
P10:57:45 <Saer> it says word for word: "java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
P10:57:45 <Saer> Press any key to continue . . ."
P10:57:47 <Saer> Indeed
P10:58:14 <Thi3f> Mm, go find the path to your java.exe, it's usually hanging out in something like C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe
P10:58:26 <Thi3f> Then open up the start server.bat in notepad or something
P10:58:36 <Saer> i tried that
P10:58:39 <Saer> well
P10:58:40 <Saer> the second one
P10:58:45 <Thi3f> replace java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer with "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -Xms512M -Xmx512M -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer
P10:59:01 <Thi3f> You tried that?
P10:59:08 <Saer> there is not java.exe

P11:04:18 <Saer> with the link?
P11:04:20 <Saer> ok
P11:04:23 <Thi3f> If the link contains spaces
P11:04:28 <Thi3f> You'll have to enclose the path in " "
