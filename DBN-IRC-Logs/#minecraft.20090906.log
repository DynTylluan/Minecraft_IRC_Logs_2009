A12:03:50 <vede> Why does it forget?
A12:04:05 <Parthon> because some things are worth forgetting
A12:04:06 <kryptn> people tell it to 'forget' a factoid
A12:04:12 <vede> Oh.
A12:04:22 <vede> "Forget I'm a rapist."

A12:36:32 <vede> Hey guys do you think you could help me identify a game?
A12:37:16 <vede> It's an old game, where you played as a spaceship, and you flew around blowing shit up.
A12:37:25 <vede> (Uh... this isn't a joke.)
A12:37:32 <kryptn> Freelancer
A12:37:34 <vede> You could fly in any direction you wanted.
A12:37:40 <vede> It's old, like, it's all 2d.
A12:37:41 <kryptn> FREELANCER
A12:37:42 <kryptn> oh
A12:37:48 <kryptn> still
A12:37:48 <vede> Like, NES era.
A12:37:51 <kryptn> find freelancer :D
A12:37:56 <kryptn> that game rocks
A12:38:15 <vede> The whole game was you playing as a ship, in a huge space with big enemy bases randomly placed in it.

10A12:38:23 * ChanServ sets mode: +o Evil-Ville
A12:38:26 <vede> And you just played until you died.
A12:39:15 <vede> I remember the bases took up about the space four of you would take up, and you could destroy smaller parts before they actually died.
A12:39:33 <vede> And the bases spawned enemies that flew around and shot at you.
A12:39:36 <PuyoDead> vede: Solar Jetman?
A12:39:43 <PuyoDead> oh, nevermind, that doesn't sound liek it
A12:39:44 <vede> Name's too complex.
A12:39:45 <PuyoDead> *like
A12:39:58 <vede> The name is one word, and it's not actually a word.
A12:40:10 <PuyoDead> do you know for sure what system it was on?
A12:40:12 <vede> The title on the title screen was so stylized I couldn't read the name. ._.
A12:40:27 <vede> It was either NES, Sega, or an arcade machine. :/
A12:40:33 <kryptn> lol
A12:40:41 <kryptn> Ask reddit
A12:40:44 <vede> ...
A12:40:47 <{TheOne> hi evil
A12:40:52 <PuyoDead> was it Sinistar?
A12:40:56 <{TheOne> and everyone else
A12:40:58 <vede> Hm. Maybe.
A12:41:03 <vede> Lemme check.

A12:43:05 <Darkebrz> Well...
A12:43:07 <PuyoDead> ok, bedtime for me (and friends are sleeping in the room with the PC, so I'm turning it off)
A12:43:08 <vede> Okay, no, it's not.
A12:43:12 <Darkebrz> Time to play Spelunky for the first time!
A12:43:37 <TheOne> ?
A12:43:39 <vede> Heh.
A12:44:04 <PuyoDead> wait, I'll turn down my pc fan
A12:44:13 <vede> But it's very similar to sinistar.
A12:45:47 <TheOne> The cake is a lie, unlike pie!
A12:45:57 <vede> Heh.
A12:46:05 <vede> I always said the cake was a pie.
A12:46:38 <TheOne> need a bot that inserts the pi value for pie, that would be banned rater quick
A12:46:42 <vede> "The cake is a lie!" "Not necessarily. Respectable sources say that, in fact, the cake is a pie."

A12:47:19 <vede>  >.>
A12:47:32 <asiekierka> well
A12:47:37 <asiekierka> about 1900 people saw it from notch's blog
A12:47:39 <vede> I think the only reason I like it so much is because you pronounce stuff so crazily.
A12:48:05 <asiekierka> also some 11 people found it from someone's favourites
10A12:48:20 * Arf (a@190.176.210.138) has joined #minecraft
A12:52:31 <vede> Hrm. Similar game to Sinistar, extremely stylized title screen, enemy bases are big and blue, and spawn smaller (purple?) enemies, and the world consists only of randomly placed bases, and you are gray.
A12:53:06 <kryptn> i found it amusing, asiekierka

A1:02:36 <mail2345> ect
A1:02:46 <mail2345> and sets it only to a controller entry for the owner

A1:03:07 <mail2345> used if a rouge controller occours
A1:04:20 <kryptn> that'd be neat, mail2345
A1:04:50 <mail2345> of course if you have a rouge controller you have bigger problems

A1:05:02 <LG_Legacy> Lol
A1:05:13 <vede> Oh man, it appears my memories have failed me once again.
A1:05:22 <vede> The game I was looking for is Bosconian.
A1:05:34 <vede> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosconian
A1:05:35 <mail2345> a bot storming irc and annoying the fuck out of anyone it can would get the owner in trouble
A1:06:48 <vede> And I remembered it not having any levels as well...
A1:06:49 <vede> :/
A1:07:24 <kryptn> oh hey i know that game
A1:07:49 <vede> Really good game.

A1:09:09 <vede> Kinda tempts me to write my own version. :/
A1:09:38 <kryptn> lol
A1:09:56 <kryptn> if i could get a hold on GUI programming  and oop id be better with that stuff
A1:10:33 <vede> I'll have to learn python, though, if I wanna code right now.
A1:10:43 <kryptn> i love python :D
A1:10:52 <vede> GUI programming is REALLY easy.
A1:11:30 <kryptn> with what?
A1:11:39 <vede> I'd figure most everything.
A1:12:03 <kryptn> you've done it in what language?
A1:12:05 <vede> For a GUI, you really only ever need to do for loops, multiplication, and image drawing, in my experience.
A1:12:27 <vede> Unless, you're thinking about different things than I am...
A1:12:53 <vede> What sort of programming do you normally do?
A1:13:14 <kryptn> simple console games.
A1:13:15 <kryptn> lol
A1:13:21 <kryptn> that's all i really have the time for
A1:13:45 <kryptn> stuff you can display in a console mostly.
A1:13:53 <vede> Oh.
A1:13:56 <kryptn> connect 4, i've done conway's game of life.
A1:14:10 <kryptn> i also do stuff at http://projecteuler.com
A1:14:12 <kryptn> net
A1:14:14 <kryptn> .net
A1:14:17 <vede> If you want something you can write quickly and learn easily, I recommend BlitzPlus.
A1:14:26 <kryptn> http://projecteuler.net/
A1:15:22 <vede> Blitz3d, actually...
A1:15:31 <vede> Since it allows you to do 3d AND 2d.

A1:16:13 <kryptn> is that a language or an api?
A1:16:30 <mail2345> blitz is a basic based language am i right?
A1:16:44 <mail2345> i do not support basic in any of it's mutated forms
A1:16:58 <Parthon> blasphemy!
A1:18:55 <kryptn> Yeah.. for any kind of gui programming.. i'd stick with python or c/c++
A1:19:17 <TrueWolves> C++ is what I do best
A1:19:29 <kryptn> i'm in a C class currently
A1:19:31 <TrueWolves> Though I'm learning java for the sole sake of helping some friends of mine with it.
A1:20:11 <vede> Heh, yeah, BASIC as a starting language is about the worst choice I've ever made.
A1:20:34 <vede> But it's really good for hobby programming.
10A1:20:55 * Arf (a@190.176.208.136) has joined #minecraft
A1:20:56 <Parthon> in my day, the only language was BASIC .. and you liked it!
A1:20:58 <TrueWolves> Anyone got a way of uploading a omen made map for singleplayer?
A1:21:15 <TrueWolves> Or is that still not possable.
A1:21:22 <Parthon> the alternative was coding directly onto microchips with tweezers
A1:21:40 <TrueWolves> Becuase I haz a great great survival map =D
A1:22:21 <mail2345> @vede Python > BASIC
A1:22:28 <mail2345> @TW hacks
A1:22:38 <TrueWolves> Who wants to hear what the level is?
A1:22:42 <vede> Yeah, Python > BASIC
A1:22:56 <vede> But I learned BASIC first, and switching is god-awful hard.
A1:23:06 <mail2345> i avoided basic
A1:23:11 <mail2345> :D
A1:23:16 <mail2345> but there is worse
A1:23:19 <Parthon> after you learn 4-5 language they all become the same
A1:23:19 <mail2345> see GML
A1:24:01 <TrueWolves> mail, any guesses? *continues to not contribute to current conversation, mostly saying all he could ;.;*
A1:24:13 <kryptn> i had to familiarize myself with basic for a math competition
A1:24:25 <Parthon> True: is it .. a dusty highway just north of the mexican border?
A1:24:37 <TrueWolves> ... no, that's a good idea though
A1:25:01 <TrueWolves> think more fantisy setting, though think out of the box, not "sword and sorcerey" fantisy
A1:25:02 <mail2345> @Parthon assuming that they are all of the same paridigram.
A1:25:07 <mail2345> @TW get the hack
A1:25:13 <mail2345> @use it to rip the map
A1:25:17 <mail2345> paste it
A1:25:21 <mail2345> in a regular sp
A1:25:24 <mail2345> load in a survial
13A1:25:40 * TrueWolves nods
A1:25:48 <TrueWolves> First time I'd get a hack...
A1:25:56 <Parthon> mail: there's only a few main paradigms anyways, and my of the concepts are transferable
A1:26:01 <Parthon> my=many

A1:27:31 <vede> I think the ability to move MP maps to SP or the other way is the only reason I'd ever have any kind of hack client.

A1:30:26 <kryptn> Hunter2458, mind elaborating?
A1:30:36 <Hunter2458> It has a certain section where it refuses to grow below, and the opposite section above ground.
A1:30:43 <Hunter2458> Both have appropriate light and source
A1:31:04 <Hunter2458> It just decides that is won't grow past a certain area of the entire map.
A1:31:27 <Hunter2458> It's on the Tokyo-3 server
A1:31:38 <PD-lt> lol
A1:31:39 <kryptn> is.. is it touching other grass?
A1:31:41 <Hunter2458> We're really flabbergasted.
A1:31:50 <Hunter2458> Yes, it's all touching other grass.
A1:31:54 <Hunter2458> It just ends.

A1:43:39 <Hunter2458> Water is broken the same way
A1:43:48 <Hunter2458> Water won't regen into the same place...
A1:43:50 <Parthon> :S
A1:43:56 <Parthon> sounds like that's a problem with your server
A1:44:03 <Hunter2458> Unless I go another block out into the green zones...
A1:44:08 <Hunter2458> I guess it might be.
A1:44:45 <Hunter2458> Hrmm...
A1:44:59 <mail2345> wow
A1:45:03 <kryptn> Hunter2458, Are you sure the server is the right size?
A1:45:06 <mail2345> crashed theone lava twice
A1:45:19 <Hunter2458> 256x256x256 last I checked
A1:45:25 <kryptn> check again
A1:45:29 <Hunter2458> Else we got a funny glitch at the border
A1:45:50 <Hunter2458> What would be the easiest method of checking? Open in omen?
A1:47:48 <vede> Um, wow.
A1:47:57 <vede> Coding in Ubuntu is like freaking dreamland.
A1:48:06 <TrueWolves> survival is hard o.o;
A1:48:12 <vede> Survival is EASY.
A1:48:14 <Hunter2458> Possitive or Negative connotation there Vede
A1:48:18 <vede> Positive.
A1:48:22 <Hunter2458> Good Dreamland?
A1:48:24 <TrueWolves> This is my first time playing vede
A1:48:29 <vede> Good dreamland.
A1:48:32 <Hunter2458> :D
A1:48:33 <TrueWolves> I have little clue of what I'm doing
A1:48:34 <vede> VERY GOOD dreamland.
A1:48:51 <vede> Since A) everything I need is already here
A1:49:13 <vede> B) With multiple workspaces, I can have one desktop for graphics, and another for code
A1:49:38 <kryptn> vede, i love linux for coding period
A1:49:46 <kryptn> yeah workspaces rock
A1:49:49 <TrueWolves> Also: Survival map: Space Ship: Your on a spaceship with zombies/skeletons/creapers... watch out for the creapers, as to much damage to the hull will result in a loss of air to breath! a whole multi floor level sized ship to explore, with the outside full of water and airlocks threw out the ship
A1:49:53 <kryptn> compiz-fusion makes it more awesome
A1:50:01 <vede> (And I can move from desktop to desktop by just moving my mouse to the edge of the screen and scrolling.)
A1:50:01 <TrueWolves> Basicly, the water is meant to be the vacume of space.
A1:50:10 <Hunter2458> Water doesn't flow up thow.
A1:50:19 <kryptn> oh, i use ctrl-alt-[left|right]
A1:50:29 <TrueWolves> It doesn't
A1:50:34 <Hunter2458> So it'd create an air pocket above wherever the level comes in.
A1:50:36 <vede> I like mouses.
A1:50:41 <TrueWolves> That is the only problem with the map, there would be air pockets
A1:50:42 <TrueWolves> but
A1:50:54 <TrueWolves> being creapers blow up a LOT I'm not worried to many air pockets would form
A1:51:02 <TrueWolves> And water fills the whole map =/
A1:51:17 <vede> That would be really fun...
A1:51:32 <vede> Although, actually, it would make a lot more sense if you just said it was a submarine.
A1:51:37 <Hunter2458> Yeah.
A1:51:42 <vede> Then the air pockets are explained right away.
A1:51:48 <vede> And... the strange blue tint.
A1:51:52 <TrueWolves> lawl
A1:51:55 <Hunter2458> Or not a sub, but Sealab 2021 XD
A1:52:00 <TrueWolves> =D
A1:52:00 <vede> Yeah.
A1:52:03 <TrueWolves> Imagion
A1:52:06 <vede> Underwater lab FTW.
A1:52:16 <Hunter2458> That's doable right now...
A1:52:21 <vede> If it was big enough, that would potentially be among the coolest survival maps ever made.
A1:52:25 <TrueWolves> a creaper blowing your area of the map to hell, water begins flooding in! your forced to swim threw it and crack open another area in order to get air!
A1:52:31 <TrueWolves> I'm making it right now!

13A1:52:52 * TrueWolves ish good at creative maps
A1:53:05 <vede> You should add airducts.
A1:53:10 <TrueWolves> good idea
A1:53:18 <TrueWolves> So, Sea Lab + Submarine or two?
A1:53:19 <vede> That have bends which make them mildly flood-proof.
A1:53:31 <vede> Yeah, that should be good.
A1:53:39 <vede> But they need to be big.
A1:53:44 <TrueWolves> vede
A1:53:53 <TrueWolves> You have seen Spadge and my Eagle 3 creation right?
A1:53:58 <vede> No...
A1:54:00 <Hunter2458> Ah...
A1:54:02 <Hunter2458> ...
A1:54:04 <Hunter2458> Hrm.
A1:54:11 <TrueWolves> It's my first map, 11 hours for one huge submarine/spaceship
A1:54:19 <Hunter2458> What do maps have to be a multiple of?
A1:54:23 <Visiiri> 2
A1:54:29 <TrueWolves> (my first single player map, saved back when you could save multi player maps on single player ones
A1:54:44 <Hunter2458> So would 384x256x384 be fine?
A1:54:47 <TrueWolves> no
A1:54:52 <TrueWolves> 2^X
A1:55:00 <Visiiri> 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 264 512 1024
A1:55:05 <vede> Go for 384...
A1:55:05 <Hunter2458> Ah, square of 2.
A1:55:11 <vede> It's not a power of two, but it works.

A1:55:21 <Hunter2458> Yeah, except that's what our map is.
A1:55:26 <Hunter2458> And the grass is broken
A1:55:34 <Visiiri> that's why
A1:55:36 <vede> It makes it so physics work right, but plants never die, and grass never grows.
A1:55:41 <vede> But it's an underwater lab.
A1:55:52 <vede> Grass won't exist, and you'll want plants around for decorations.
A1:55:58 <Hunter2458> I was talking about my current map with the grass that is borked
A1:56:03 <TrueWolves> Ahh, good idea
A1:56:09 <Hunter2458> And grass does grow, just at awkward rules.
A1:56:10 <TrueWolves> or else the plants would die
A1:56:20 <TrueWolves> (water blocks light)
A1:56:21 <Hunter2458> And grass doesn't die naturally D:
A1:56:37 <Hunter2458> 256-512 is a huge jump
A1:56:43 <vede> Actually, you shouldn't do 384.
A1:56:46 <vede> Do...
A1:56:46 <GreyIBlackJay> Water doesn't block light, it...
A1:56:47 <vede> 192.
A1:56:49 <GreyIBlackJay> What's the term I'm looking for
A1:56:55 <Hunter2458> Water does block light in the game
A1:56:57 <GreyIBlackJay> refracts it.
A1:56:59 <GreyIBlackJay> Ah
A1:57:03 <vede> Bigger maps make Survival lag really bad.
A1:57:03 <GreyIBlackJay> Well, hrmph
A1:57:13 <GreyIBlackJay> Probably because there are more mobs, vede.
A1:57:16 <Hunter2458> Vede, my current Tokyo-3 map that I was talking about messed up grass earlier is 384
A1:57:21 <TrueWolves> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=TrueWolves&id=0
A1:57:25 <TrueWolves> The Eagle 3
A1:57:27 <vede> Yeah.
A1:57:36 <TrueWolves> Biggest under water creation ever made by hand.
A1:57:43 <TrueWolves> before sponges
A1:57:50 <vede> I bet the mobs could be optimized way more than they are now.
A1:58:17 <vede> Simpler AI when they're far away and not visible.
A1:58:21 <kryptn> Going from daft punk to queen is a bit strange
A1:58:23 <kryptn> imho at least
A1:58:33 <GreyIBlackJay> Oh, right.
A1:58:36 <Hunter2458> I guess I'm upgrading it to 512...
A1:58:39 <Hunter2458> HUGE MAP IS HUGE
A1:58:42 <GreyIBlackJay> Wah
A1:58:44 <GreyIBlackJay> It doesn't work.
A1:58:45 <GreyIBlackJay> >>;
A1:58:47 <vede> Maybe have three AI states. Up-close, far-away-visible, and far-away-not-visible.
A1:58:52 <TrueWolves> Yggdrasil is 64/64/1024
A1:58:55 <vede>  :/
A1:59:10 <GreyIBlackJay> I still am quite an IRC noob. >>;
A1:59:11 <vede> (I did the pre-emoticon space again. DAMN YE NETTALK)
A1:59:12 <Hunter2458> So my map will be 512x256s512
A1:59:36 <Hunter2458> I guess a dual core server can take it.
A1:59:37 <Hunter2458> Still huge
A1:59:53 <TrueWolves> what size should the Sea Lab map be?
A1:59:59 <vede> ...
A2:00:09 <TrueWolves> We WANT plants to be broken in this btw
A2:00:27 <GreyIBlackJay> I thought Minecraft couldn't use dual-core.
A2:00:27 <vede> I'd go for 192x64x192 maybe.
A2:00:27 <GreyIBlackJay> >>;
A2:00:31 <Hunter2458> Yeah.
A2:00:56 <GreyIBlackJay> 256x256x256 is already pretty damn large
A2:01:03 <TrueWolves> yeah
A2:01:04 <GreyIBlackJay> 512^3 is massive
A2:01:08 <Hunter2458> Yeah, but it's not big enough for the city we were making
A2:01:13 <vede> 512^3 is AWESOME
A2:01:15 <Hunter2458> And uh...384 was just right
A2:01:19 <vede> And takes forever to save/load.
A2:01:23 <GreyIBlackJay> 134217728
A2:01:30 <GreyIBlackJay> That's how many blocks there are in a 512^3 map
A2:01:41 <vede> Wait.
A2:01:42 <Hunter2458> uh...you sure?
A2:01:44 <GreyIBlackJay> Yer
A2:01:47 <GreyIBlackJay> Hunter
A2:01:51 <GreyIBlackJay> Put it into calculator
A2:01:51 <vede> I'm thinking about 512x64x512

A2:02:02 <GreyIBlackJay> 512^3
A2:02:07 <GreyIBlackJay> 512x512x512 = 134217728
A2:02:07 <vede> Uh, man.
A2:02:16 <vede> 512^2 is NOT 512x512x256

A2:02:53 <GreyIBlackJay> But not that wide.
A2:02:55 <Hunter2458> Yeah I do.

A2:03:36 <GreyIBlackJay> Really?
A2:03:38 <vede> Yeah.
A2:03:40 <Hunter2458> X/y/z
A2:03:43 <GreyIBlackJay> Notch is using Y for up/down?
A2:03:46 <vede> Yeah.
A2:03:47 <GreyIBlackJay> Meh.
A2:03:51 <GreyIBlackJay> I'm used to Z being up/down
A2:03:56 <TrueWolves> hm
A2:04:00 <vede> Don't even think about starting that debate again, either.
A2:04:01 <TrueWolves> 200/100/200 map good?
A2:04:05 <Hunter2458> XD
A2:04:07 <vede> Just stay away from it.
A2:04:11 <Hunter2458> I was about to say...
A2:04:16 <GreyIBlackJay> X, Pitch/Y, Roll/Z, Yaw.
A2:04:17 <GreyIBlackJay> I think it was.
A2:04:27 <Hunter2458> 200,100,200 will have messed up borders I believe
A2:04:27 <vede> That's for rotation, not dimensions.
A2:04:31 <GreyIBlackJay> I know
A2:04:32 <Hunter2458> It has to be a multiple of 32.
A2:04:39 <Hunter2458> I think
A2:04:42 <vede> It has to be a multiple of 16 actually.
A2:04:50 <vede> Minecraft uses 16^3 sectors.
A2:04:55 <Hunter2458> But a power of 2 to be with working grass D:
A2:04:59 <GreyIBlackJay> It's best to keep maps sizes in powers of 2.
A2:05:05 <TrueWolves> hm
A2:05:16 <TrueWolves> so
A2:05:17 <vede> GreyIBlackJay, haven't been reading the conversation have you?
A2:05:25 <GreyIBlackJay> I only recently joined.
A2:05:26 <GreyIBlackJay> :3
A2:05:31 <Hunter2458> So...a 384 map...
A2:05:31 <TrueWolves> 212/160/212 good?
A2:05:45 <vede> We want a non-power-of-two map so plant physics can be broken.
A2:05:46 <Hunter2458> I'd have to make it 384^3?
A2:05:47 <GreyIBlackJay> 384 isn't a power of 2, so it wouldn't grow grass according to what you said earlier.
A2:05:54 <vede> So we can have plants in an underwater lab.
A2:06:00 <GreyIBlackJay> Ah
A2:06:18 <vede> That SHOULD be good, but you should test it first.
A2:06:18 <Hunter2458> Yeah, but 384^3 is according to 14^3

A5:31:55 <Nohbdy> I'm planning on building a PC you guys.... except I don't know a DAMN thing
A5:32:10 <Nohbdy> I'll be getting a lot of money.. price range is $1,000 to $1,200
A5:32:51 <Nohbdy> I want to get as good of hardware as I can WITHOUT making it so that things I run become incompatible... like I heard too much RAM and 'quad-core' processors can not work with certain things
A5:33:13 <]Snowman> You gonna build 64 bit or 32 bit?
A5:33:30 <Nohbdy> Probably 32 bit.. since my friend got 64 bit and a lot doesn't work on it
A5:33:35 <Marach> ok, added "ident" command to make identifying faster

A5:33:57 <Marach> works :)
A5:34:09 <Nohbdy> I don't need a moniter, keyboard mouse.. I don't need an OS even...so focusing on hardware
A5:34:11 <Evil-Ville> It's just that if you get too much for example 32 bit windows xp isn't going to recognise it
A5:34:32 <Nohbdy> exactly... therefor I'm wasting money on unworking RAM?
A5:34:36 <Marach> max. 3.2 GB RAM
A5:34:42 <Nohbdy> Sounds pretty good
A5:34:43 <Marach> buy 3 GB
A5:34:52 <]Snowman> get 4 gb ram, a good quad core processor and like Nvidia GTX card
A5:34:53 <Marach> you probably wont need more
A5:35:08 <Marach> my pc is crappy and im happy
A5:35:08 <kryptn> I enjoy my 6gb of ram
A5:35:12 <Nohbdy> I already read up on quad core and how certain things don't work with it >.>
A5:35:12 <iPope> Better safe than sorry
A5:35:18 <kryptn> i run virtual machines :D
A5:35:27 <Nohbdy> like games and etc
A5:35:28 <Marach> kryptn so you need it
A5:35:29 <]Snowman> Nohbdy, you will probably only have problems with really old applications
A5:35:38 <Marach> DosBox!
A5:35:39 <kryptn> mhm
A5:35:40 <]Snowman> which dont support multi core
A5:35:51 <Evil-Ville> I have a dualcore and I've never had any problems with it
A5:35:52 <Nohbdy> I use really old applications... like 3DMM.. and I download random crap like a mofo
A5:35:56 <Marach> old Worms games have hardware problems
A5:36:07 <Nohbdy> no I'm gettin dual core
A5:36:26 <Evil-Ville> That's no different than getting quadcore
A5:36:27 <Nohbdy> and yes I play DOS games like 'Wasteland'
A5:36:42 <Marach> DosBox has been ported to PSP *happy(
A5:36:47 <Marach> *happy* *
A5:37:02 <Nohbdy> well the people who said quadcore didn't work with games were talking about MODERN games mainly
A5:37:14 <Evil-Ville> They were talking out of their ass then
A5:37:48 <Marach> any computer in which minecraft runs is fitting me
A5:37:54 <Marach> :)
A5:38:14 <Marach> btw how's POLYBIUS?
A5:39:09 <Marach> running?
A5:39:22 <Nohbdy> Oh dude Marach.. yesterday I played Polybius like crazy.. I've gotten much better. I'm at the #2 at the high score... not that it's that hard.. but the game is agh
A5:39:36 <Nohbdy> oh but it wasn't on this computer.. this computer still runs it slowly
A5:39:42 <Nohbdy> luckily things like youtube run well though
A5:40:20 <Nohbdy> although I obviously have graphics card problems... since the youtube videos still do this weird "glitch" where it like... zooms out and in constantly
A5:40:57 <Marach> i have the flashing graphics bug in survival
A5:41:23 <Marach> i had it in 0.24, but updating graphics drivers fixed
A5:41:25 <Marach> it
A5:41:33 <Marach> nwo, in 0.25 it returned
A5:41:41 <Evil-Ville> Nohbdy I've never heard of a glitch like that
A5:41:56 <Nohbdy> Well if dual core is no different than quad core then I SUPPOSE I'LL TAKE YOUR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE... and not the professional advice of a website made for building Pc's >.>
A5:42:04 <Nohbdy> lol
A5:42:30 <Marach> 4 days to my iPod Touch!!

A5:43:09 <Marach> almost forgot
A5:43:10 <Nohbdy> Newegg.com
A5:43:32 <Evil-Ville> And where does it say that quadcore processors cause problems with modern games
A5:43:56 <Nohbdy> idk I was clicking randomly everywhere I'll try to find it.. it was on a specific pre-built copmuter
A5:44:49 <Marach> data[botX][botY].reload == BOT_REPAIRDELAY;
A5:44:51 <Marach> i suck
A5:45:47 <Marach> now it doesnt happen that often... some months before, i was misusing "=" like crazy
A5:46:35 <Nohbdy> "For it to actually work, the software must be prepared to function that way. Compatibility is an issue. Software companies have to keep up with the processor industry. It takes some time for it to catch up. And that is why dual-cores outperform the quad-cores. Im certain that a year or two from now, the quad-cores will receive all the accolades."
A5:47:12 <Marach> thats why i love my handheld collection ^_^
A5:47:19 <Nohbdy> and like I said... I use old programs
A5:47:36 <Marach> well, can "2" be called a collection? :)
A5:47:37 <Nohbdy> but I've USED a dual core before and everythign worked fine it seemed for all my programs

A5:55:31 <Marach> now the game should zoom scrren 4x

A6:06:03 <Nohbdy> I don't plan on living in a house so I don't need to worry about forgetting the stove since it'll be close by... IN MY EARTHROAMER...or normal van hah
A6:06:10 <TrueWolves> I had 4 creepers in a water cave below me, and I shot a bunch, killed one, which killed the others soon after, for explosion, lawl no water, lawl flood, lawl another explosion for missing chunk of water, after they all died, I jumped down to collect the some 80 stone and sand.
A6:06:39 <kryptn> Marach, how is health a floating number?
A6:07:05 <Marach> i checked it
A6:07:11 <Marach> arrow doesnt hit for 2 points
A6:07:20 <Marach> if max  health is 5
A6:07:32 <Marach> it hits for like 1.5
A6:07:34 <cal> it's more practical for health to be a floating point anyway
A6:07:39 <Marach> cal yes
A6:07:45 <Marach> a punch is 1
A6:07:56 <Marach> maybe health is between 0 and 1
A6:07:56 <kryptn> are we talking about player health or mob health
A6:08:00 <Marach> mob
A6:08:14 <kryptn> ok.. i havent messed with that yet
A6:08:22 <Marach> maybe its not float
A6:08:29 <kryptn> i wouldnt think it's float
A6:08:34 <Marach> maybe its in heart pieces like player
A6:08:46 <kryptn> i'd assume so
A6:09:02 <kryptn> it wouldnt make sense to use float in some places, regular int's in others

A6:59:09 <Nohbdy> which one..?
A6:59:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> it transfers at a higher  rate, allows for more ram (CHIP CAPACITIES) and has higher bus rates
A7:00:04 <Nohbdy> that doesn't help my little knowledge out lol
A7:00:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's faster
A7:00:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> How's that?
A7:00:19 <Nohbdy> I asked for compatibility
A7:00:22 <Nohbdy> not speed
A7:00:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not compatible
A7:00:37 <citricsquid> I hate you all, so much. You can't even do one thing right.
A7:00:37 <Nohbdy> which one, or both?
A7:00:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> neither
A7:01:05 <Evil-Ville> Can't you just google it Nohbdy
A7:01:12 <Siiseli> citricsquid, what thing might you be talking about :D
A7:01:13 <Nohbdy> neither? do you mean both? if it was neither then they "would" be compatible
A7:01:27 <Nohbdy> google isn't helping with the compatiblity aspect side of things.. expecially when comparing two things
A7:01:36 <citricsquid> Siiseli: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2400 They're supposed to reply with "lol", instead people reply with unfunny shit. WAY TO RUIN THE JOKE GUYS.
A7:01:40 <Evil-Ville> You can't put DDR3 in a DDR2 motherboard and other way round that's the only compability issue
A7:01:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> They are not.  Compatible.  With each others slots.
A7:01:53 <Siiseli> citricsquid, why should they respond lol
A7:02:04 <citricsquid> Siiseli: notch quote, I'll see if I can find it.
A7:02:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> DDR3 slots can only take DDR3 memory.  Same with DDR2
A7:02:16 <Nohbdy> ... well I'm checking out a site for customizing computers and the first choice is the processor.. so obviously they'll match it up
A7:02:18 <Evil-Ville> That's what I said
A7:02:31 <Nohbdy> When I say compatibility.. I mean with software... like a wide range of programs
A7:02:36 <citricsquid> Siiseli: "I want to see forum posts saying "how do i kill dragon" with replies reading "lol"."

A7:20:26 <Nohbdy> That's stupid.. I hate that method of business forget it...
A7:20:28 <do0han> And also reduce the risk of you zapping something when you're putting it in.
A7:20:46 <do0han> Static electricity is your enemy :)
A7:20:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Method of business?
A7:20:51 <Nohbdy> I have my dad who's experienced with electronics... I know a bit about capacitors and etc
A7:21:08 <Evil-Ville> You'll do nothing with that knowledge though
A7:21:13 <Nohbdy> yes method of business... I'm paying extra money for technical useless support
A7:21:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> My dad's an electric engineer and I still buy pre-built
A7:21:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
A7:21:25 <do0han> I build my own boxes but sometimes it's not worth it.
A7:21:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, you're not, they don't provide much support
A7:21:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> besides of course DOA
A7:21:35 <do0han> The prices are getting pretty much the same now as well.
A7:21:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's a limited warranty, which means it won't cover shit
A7:22:00 <do0han> Covers enough stuff.
A7:22:01 <Nohbdy> I've seen some books that help beginners build copmuters so I can read those for info
A7:22:08 <do0han> Get a recent one.
A7:22:11 <Nohbdy> indeed
A7:22:29 <do0han> Other wise you'll end up with scsi, ide and a cirrus logic video board :P
A7:22:33 <do0han> Or an s3 virge!!
A7:22:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh, and Nohbdy, I'd go dual core
A7:22:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> With a higher clock-speed
A7:22:51 <Nohbdy> I already chose dual-core before I started all this haha
A7:22:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Most applications aren't optimized to use mutli-core tech anyway, so you'd be wasting $
A7:22:57 <do0han> Nah go dual core with lower power comsumption
A7:23:15 <do0han> Most stuff you'll do is games and that's pretty much all on the gpu
A7:23:18 <do0han> Save the money for that.
A7:23:19 <]Snowman> Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".
A7:23:22 <]Snowman> WTF FLASH

A7:24:36 <do0han> Happy birthday
A7:24:41 <do0han> Belated.
A7:24:45 <Evil-Ville> You don't need a good computer to program games
A7:24:58 <Nohbdy> I don't plan on using Linux anytime soon, just experimentation.. I'm about ready to burn "Knoppix" onto a CD soon.. the dist. of Linux that runs solely off the CD
A7:25:03 <]Snowman> If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent...
A7:25:05 <]Snowman> ...hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.

A7:25:23 <Quatroking> do0han my b-day was yesterday
A7:25:23 <Nohbdy> But I need a good computer so that if I see problems with my programming.. I'll know it's most likely ME and not ehc computer
A7:25:31 <do0han> That's what the belated was for
A7:25:32 <Nohbdy> the*
A7:25:38 <Quatroking> oh, yeah
A7:25:45 <Quatroking> Well thanks anyways
A7:25:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, get a cheap rig also Nohbdy 
A7:25:56 <do0han> Nohbdy, what do you use just now?
A7:26:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> Too often game devs have high-end rigs and program like shit, but it wells run on the nice rig.  Then when people play on a cheap rig, it uses way more resources than it should.
A7:26:23 <Nohbdy> Don't worry about price... I'm getting up to $1,200 very soon and a computer is the only thing I'd ever spend my money on
A7:26:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> NOTCH
A7:26:35 <Nohbdy> I mean spend money on right now
A7:26:41 <do0han> But Nohbdy what's in your current rig?
A7:26:48 <Marach> notch? where
A7:26:52 <do0han> Indonesia.
A7:27:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> PS, if you dream of using DirectX, I will kill your family.
A7:27:02 <asiekierka> No
A7:27:04 <asiekierka> IndoNESia
A7:27:15 <do0han> Very funny asiekierka.
A7:27:19 <Nohbdy> my current 'rig' can't handle youtube videos... or even any videos... it glitches a lot.... can't play minecraft at all.. it doesn't have anything like pixel shading or pixel acceleration and all that etc
A7:27:28 <offset> :|
A7:27:29 <do0han> If it weren't for the belt I'm wearing, I fear my sides may have split.
A7:27:54 <Marach> fixed
A7:27:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, I was saying NOTCH because he did what I said earlier
A7:28:23 <Quatroking> nohbdy: I wouldn't even call that a rig
A7:28:36 <offset> 80's information terminal?
A7:28:48 <Quatroking> fuck my old pentium 3, on 800MHZ could run youtube video's fine
A7:28:51 <Nohbdy> I don't mind spending all my money on a computer because I don't need anything else. Clothes? I'll obtain those through normal working money. Car? Not gonna happen anytime soon at all.
A7:28:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nohbdy, slap Linux on it.  It'll put life into your old box :P
A7:29:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> ;) ;)
A7:29:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> I recommend XUbuntu
A7:29:12 <Quatroking> nohbdy: specs?
A7:29:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.xubuntu.org/ ;) ;)
A7:29:18 <Quatroking> Xubuntu is lovely
A7:29:22 <Nohbdy> lol here come the specs again hehe
A7:29:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> For old computers?  Hell yeah
A7:29:38 <Nohbdy> 1.20ghz, 760mb RAM. S3 Savage Graphics card umm
A7:29:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, that'll run XUbuntu like a pro
A7:29:49 <citricsquid> not thaaattt bad
A7:29:50 <Quatroking> Yep, the S3.
A7:30:10 <Quatroking> OS?
A7:30:11 <Evil-Ville> 1.20GHz doesn't mean anything
A7:30:18 <LG_Legacy> I wonder if running linux would differe the speed of some applicaitions..
A7:30:22 <citricsquid> the PC that I replaced recently for my family to use had 256MB of ram and a P2
A7:30:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Send it to me citricsquid 
A7:30:42 <Nohbdy> I'll get into Linux at a future date... staying with Windows for now
A7:30:42 <Quatroking> no to meee
A7:30:42 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: it's mine >:( >:( >:(
A7:30:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> ha.  Slap Tinycore on that bitch
A7:30:56 <Quatroking> nohbdy: you could try the LiveCD
A7:31:03 <Quatroking> thats trying linux without installing it
A7:31:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Except on slow rigs the LiveCD is really slow
A7:31:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> And the installation is not
A7:31:17 <Quatroking> Yeah, true..
A7:31:24 <Nohbdy> I NEED to use Windows applications, I doubt it'll work with all the old and new programs I download all the time
A7:31:33 <LG_Legacy> Wine?
A7:31:39 <Nohbdy> especially my highly prized 3D Movie Maker
A7:31:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, you don't.
A7:31:41 <Quatroking> Sounds like my problem with linux
A7:31:49 <citricsquid> If you need windows stuff don't bother with linux
A7:31:53 <Nohbdy> I tried wine on the Mac OS X I was on before.. didn't run well at alll
A7:32:02 <Quatroking> I don't use Ubuntu too often due to the fact of me using CS4 a lot
A7:32:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> You mean darwine
A7:32:04 <LG_Legacy> Wine works with mac?
A7:32:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> There is no WINE for Mac otherwise
A7:32:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> and it's not the same thing
A7:32:18 <Nohbdy> well I was using "CrossOver" apparently it's similar to Wine
A7:32:27 <Quatroking> crossover is based on wine
A7:32:36 <Quatroking> works well for a few games
A7:32:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, but not sure how it would run on OS X
A7:32:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Works for steam, source-games, etc that I play
A7:32:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> (I have crossover games)
A7:33:03 <Nohbdy> I don't play any modern games that you guys might play... I play old ones because it's all I've ever been able to run ^.^
A7:33:15 <Quatroking> nohbdy: jazz jackrabbit?
A7:33:23 <Nohbdy> SimTower? Hell yeah... all those sim games... SimAnt, SimCopter.
A7:33:32 <LG_Legacy> Funny isn't it?
A7:33:36 <Nohbdy> can't run "The Sims" 'too' well...still slow
A7:33:39 <do0han> Jazz Jackrabbit is the shit!
A7:33:43 <do0han> Awesome game.
A7:33:48 <Quatroking> nohvdy you can't run The Sims 1 ?!
A7:33:51 <Quatroking> wtf
A7:33:52 <Nohbdy> nooope
A7:34:05 <Nohbdy> lags a storm
A7:34:17 <Nohbdy> specially if I move the camera view at all
A7:34:25 <LG_Legacy> Here i sit with a xbox 360 with a copy of guitar hero, oblivion, RE5 and something else, drumkit and all, and i got Cod 4 on my pc, and other goodies. And yet i play minecraft all day and run irc while looking at porn and playing skulltag from time to time.
A7:34:52 <Marach> give me xbox
A7:34:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's because both XBox and Guitar Hero are streaming piles of shit
A7:35:01 <Marach> i would make better use of it
A7:35:06 <Nohbdy> LG I have about all those games you mentioned.. except guitar hero(but I did have GH2 for Ps2.. and I became an expert in no time.. one of the few games I'm usually better at than my friends)
A7:35:18 <Quatroking> Say, the old Xbox, what could I do with it these days?
A7:35:34 <Evil-Ville> Play Xbox games
A7:35:34 <Marach> better than my friends? all from WipEout series!
A7:35:43 <Marach> i own them
A7:35:44 <Quatroking> A store nearby is selling one of the promotional units for 35 bucks
A7:35:54 <Marach> frends, not games
A7:35:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nohbdy, check this out from SA
A7:36:00 <Quatroking> You know, the one's they used at E3 and in stores
A7:36:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold on
A7:36:08 <Nohbdy> I play Halo 3 and COD 4.. they're my two favorite FPS's... I keep switching back and forth because they're different...hmm
A7:36:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
A7:36:20 <Nohbdy> I think I like COD 4 better though...
A7:36:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> MY EARS!
A7:36:26 <citricsquid> cod1 4 life
A7:36:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> HALO 3 AND COD4???? BEST FPS??????????
13A7:36:31 * AlLnAtuRalX dies.
A7:36:33 <Quatroking> Hmm
A7:36:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> CoD 4 is nice to play through.  Once.
A7:36:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> It has no replay value because it's easy even on veteran.  It has nice environments though
A7:36:58 <Nohbdy> The Orange Box is probably one of my all-time favorites... only just getting into TF2 though
A7:37:00 <Quatroking> does the Xbox 1 have VGA output?
A7:37:12 <Quatroking> or is there any easy way to get that
A7:37:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> No
A7:37:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can use a converter cabkle
A7:37:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> they're cheap on the ebay
A7:37:38 <Nohbdy> I don't play "story mode" I play multiplayer... but story is good I guess...I mean it's "story" egh I prefer free-roam story games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3
A7:38:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> Have you played Quake 1?  Doom?  Fallout 2?  Quake 3?
A7:38:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Now those are all real games
A7:38:12 <LG_Legacy> All of the above except Fallout 2

A7:38:48 <Nohbdy> I've played Doom 3.. that game amazed me when I first played it (at a WarZone Gaming place)

A7:40:10 <Evil-Ville> condemned realistic???
A7:40:32 <Nohbdy> Yes.. because I explore old messed up abandoned buildings.. the rubble and everythign is just so real
A7:41:29 <Nohbdy> and the fighting was great too.. when enemies were far away the 'echo' and distance was like creepy and cool
A7:41:40 <citricsquid> aww

A7:43:17 <LG_Legacy> You'll know what i'm saying when
A7:43:32 <LG_Legacy> Penumbra: The only game where you shit brix whiel running away from aliens with swinging slongs.
A7:43:36 <Evil-Ville> Yes Nohbdy and then halfway through it turns into a Dragon Ball Z fangame
A7:43:44 <citricsquid> "Dont ban me if im new. So dont an be nice I just want to have a friend." with a little sad face at the end.
A7:43:52 <Nohbdy> ahaha oh yeah I remember that.. I wouldn't say halfway..that was at the end
A7:44:20 <Nohbdy> it was a very fun game for me by far
A7:44:49 <Nohbdy> although I messed up quite a bit when you're in the office and all those creatures try to get you.. had to replay that part over a bit

A8:00:48 <Nohbdy> I'll check that out ^.^
A8:01:01 <Nohbdy> I'll have to start with some bookage first.. forgot it's 6am and my dad's asleep in there
A8:01:02 <Quatroking> the G5 is too round for my tastes
A8:01:52 <Nohbdy> Oh damn this is a high-quality PDF... usually I get lower quality copied-the-pages versions
A8:02:11 <Nohbdy> It's like High-def dummies :P
A8:02:40 <Nohbdy> I wish the programming books were this nice... so I don't mistake parenthesis and curly brackets
A8:03:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Get the real books?  Nothing is better than a desk reference when learning programming
A8:03:35 <do0han> Yeah you can't beat a real book sometimes
A8:03:36 <Nohbdy> I think you missed the part where I'm poor haha
A8:03:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> get a job :P
A8:03:43 <Quatroking> library ftw
A8:03:48 <do0han> You said you have $1200 to spend on a pc
A8:03:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh yeah, that
A8:03:55 <Nohbdy> but I understand that it's hard going back and forth from PDF to compiler
A8:03:56 <do0han> Libraries are good too
A8:04:02 <Nohbdy> maybe I'll just get 2 moniters xD
A8:04:21 <Quatroking> every programmer should have two monitors at least
A8:04:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> You still can't beat a real book
A8:04:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I disagree Quatroking 
A8:04:29 <do0han> I code with one
A8:04:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> 1 monitor with a tiling WM is plenty
A8:04:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> and of course four workspaces
A8:04:51 <Quatroking> Well yeah
A8:04:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> bound to alt+#... and vi.  Everyone who doesn't have vi fucking sucks
A8:05:02 <Nohbdy> actually I disagree with the real book part too... I hate keeping those pages open and I have to change my position to read it and I need proper lighting psh :P
A8:05:05 <do0han> Vi is for bearded wienies.
A8:05:07 <do0han> :P
A8:05:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh hell... no
A8:05:12 <Siiseli> vi is for linux nerds
A8:05:13 <Siiseli> :3
A8:05:21 <Quatroking> which button is the vi again

A8:06:21 <Quatroking> anyways, any suggestions besides the G5
A8:06:28 <Quatroking> the G5 is waaaaaaay too roundish
A8:06:42 <do0han> Quatroking, stick it under your desk
A8:06:45 <do0han> Don't look at it.

A8:07:41 <Quatroking> I'm not going to spend so much on a goddamn mouse
A8:07:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> do0han, you're right, but I have it anyway because I used it when I had OS X

A10:03:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I should be extremely dehydrated
A10:03:42 <PuyoDead> nah, I don't even need to be drunk for it to happen, it just takes almost nothing to give me a headache
A10:03:44 <Nohbdy> I've only experimented with alcohol like once or twice... never experienced a hang over despite it being late night... I also had a lot of control over myself, and I remember it all vividly. Very opposite to the stories I hear...maybe it's a one time thing
A10:04:03 <PuyoDead> ite depends on how much you drinl
A10:04:06 <PuyoDead> err, drink
A10:04:09 <AlexVMiner> wewt
A10:04:13 <AlexVMiner> PUYO
A10:04:14 <Nohbdy> I had half a pnt of vodka lolz
A10:04:17 <Nohbdy> pint*
A10:04:23 <AlexVMiner> me wantz you to sign meh wall in minecraft
A10:04:28 <PuyoDead> what?
A10:04:33 <AlexVMiner> you too allnaturalx
A10:04:40 <AlexVMiner> puyo, come to this server:
A10:04:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> alright, sure
A10:04:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm procrastinating work anyway
A10:04:55 <AlexVMiner> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=9788c16fac66c8a14342f35b3efce712 
A10:05:02 <AlexVMiner> sign your names on the wall
A10:05:04 <AlexVMiner> t:3
A10:05:14 <AlexVMiner> i'll be VERY happy if both of you do
A10:05:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> gawd, it'll take me an hour :P
A10:05:31 <Nohbdy> ironically... alcohol is one of my least favorite 'drugs'(I suppose you'd call it) in society, and yet it's the only thing close to a drug that I've tried...besides large amounts of caffeine :P
A10:05:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll sign natural or something
A10:05:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> piracetam ftw
A10:05:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> speaking of which, I need to buy more soon
A10:06:06 <gear> PuyoDead: i get hung over a lot too
A10:06:12 <gear> i also get migraines a lot
A10:06:19 <PuyoDead> yea, I get at least 2 a week
A10:06:22 <gear> mhm
A10:06:30 <gear> sometimes they're not so bad
A10:06:37 <gear> but sometimes they're horrific
A10:07:20 <Nohbdy> least favorite besides all the more hardcore drugs like meth of course... I've been around druggies like crazy but never meth, heroine, etc. Mainly just weed, cocaine, and ecstasy. I can't believe some can't handle 'sober people'.. psh, I act like a crazy person when I'm sober anyway ^.^

A11:43:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> new york evenings, and some parts of the night
A11:43:47 <citricsquid> I assume you were in bed during it PuyoDead or was it when you weren't here?
A11:43:48 <PuyoDead> generally from 12:00 or 1am to whenever you get up
A11:43:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> morning and afternoon citricsquid is usually up
A11:44:05 <PuyoDead> I wasn't actually here at the time
A11:44:21 <citricsquid> so what timezone do we need people from?
A11:44:37 <PuyoDead> well first off, having only 1 person on at a time isn't good
A11:44:39 <r4dio> antarctic
A11:44:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yup, antarctic
A11:45:00 <r4dio> yap
A11:45:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some US time will be good... PuyoDead is one of the few US ops.  I recommend Pacific so we can vary it up a bit
A11:45:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> So someone from western US would be ideal
A11:45:20 <r4dio> japan
A11:45:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=eb7d4dee427956c87d1ce46f79fdd8a0
A11:45:37 <PuyoDead> plus, I'll be working soon, so I won't be on every evening
A11:45:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> woops wrong pate

A11:46:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nobody pointed that out then
A11:46:20 <TheOne> hmm...
A11:46:54 <TheOne> it was around 11pm central time US
A11:46:57 <PuyoDead> having more ops than "needed" is far better than just enough
A11:47:20 <citricsquid> also, we can't give out AOP, so you'd have to be reopped whenever you connect (@ anyone that we would op)
A11:47:26 <citricsquid> only Notch can give it.
A11:47:36 <PuyoDead> and since generally only about half of us (at best) are actually on, we can't go by that number
A11:48:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> I recommend Snowman, Zombuster, and Darkebrz... Anyone but Quatroking :P
A11:48:20 <Darkebrz> Eh?
A11:48:24 <PuyoDead> hah
A11:48:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, well, we can have a central location with SSH that has op, so anyone who needs op can SSH there and op themselves
A11:48:32 <Darkebrz> What are we discussing about me?
A11:48:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sounds complicated, but with a little documentation it's possible

A11:49:10 <r4dio> i think mine master would be a nice op

A11:49:25 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: well, when I get paid I'm setting up a VM just for IRC, so I could set up a little script that manually OPs anyone when they join.
A11:49:36 <r4dio>  @ general guy : what?
A11:49:38 <r4dio> lol
A11:49:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can throw up a cheap VM for you citricsquid 
A11:49:50 <r4dio> everybody should love m1n3m4st3r.

P12:00:04 <Marach-playing> wut?
P12:00:06 <Nohbdy> Hard Drive question!!: Are there compatability issues with IDE vs EIDE? Simply because I heard SATA has some problems.
10P12:00:10 * Marach-playing is now known as Marach
P12:00:12 <r4dio> omg panic
P12:00:15 <r4dio> shutdown the internetz plz
P12:00:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Get.  SATA.
P12:00:31 <vede> SATA is bettarzorz.
P12:00:33 <Quatroking> Nohbdy: where did you hear that?
P12:00:37 <vede> Just do eet.
P12:00:47 <vede> (And make sure your motherboard can handle it.)
P12:00:54 <Quatroking> sAta works a lot faster than IDE and is also a lot easier to use
P12:00:59 <Nohbdy> Well you see, as I was tryign to download a torrent.. they had like different instructions or a different version for a SATA drive
P12:01:02 <Quatroking> I always keep on bending IDE pins

P12:01:20 <r4dio> randomcomment <inserted>
P12:01:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> No.  Modern HDs use SATA.  You use SATA.  Yay!
P12:01:25 <vede> ... I've never managed to bend an IDE pin.
P12:01:32 <PuyoDead> yea, SATA is pretty much the norm now
P12:01:33 <Quatroking> Well I did.
P12:01:39 <vede> The only pins I've ever managed to bend are PS/2
P12:01:42 <Nohbdy> Wait.. what about EIDE? There's IDE AND EIDE
P12:01:52 <Quatroking> Though I did notice that older motherboards are likely to bend than newer ones
P12:02:01 <Quatroking> Never heard of EIDE
P12:02:07 <vede> Never heard if EIDE either...
P12:02:10 <PuyoDead> they're pretty much the same
P12:02:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's an older technology
P12:02:15 <Nohbdy> That's weird.. this book mentions "only" EIDE and not IDE
P12:02:21 <vede> Oooh.
P12:02:21 <Nohbdy> and this is a 2009 book
P12:02:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's like saying.  maybe I should get a celeron; core 2 quads have issues
P12:02:26 <PuyoDead> yea, IDE is technically older, but every still says IDE
P12:02:29 <vede> Nohbdy, that's just a terminology difference.
P12:02:31 <PuyoDead> it's "enhanced" IDE
P12:02:40 <Nohbdy> oh okay
P12:03:09 <Nohbdy> Let me look at that torrent page again and check the SATA problem I heard of so hang on
P12:03:10 <vede> IDE and its variations (which have technically different names) are basically just referred to as IDE or something with IDE in it, it's all pretty much the same.
P12:03:21 <Quatroking> Appearantly its a bit faster than normal IDE
P12:03:29 <Quatroking> Just go for sATA.
P12:03:29 <PuyoDead> kind of like SD/SDHC
P12:03:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> ooh high capacity
P12:03:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> IT MUST BE BETTER
P12:03:44 <PuyoDead> people still call them SD
13P12:03:45 * AlLnAtuRalX gives them all my cash.
P12:04:01 <vede> The only SATA problem I can think of is trying to use SATA on a motherboard without ports for SATA, or which has ports, but doesn't support them without external drivers.
P12:04:16 <vede> Both of which can be fixed.
P12:04:28 <PuyoDead> unless you have a dated MB, you'll have SATA
P12:04:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nobody in their right minds would not use SATA for a build in 09
P12:04:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> especially one they want to last
P12:04:44 <Quatroking> There are motherboards with sATA that get shipped while they don't support sATA by default?
P12:04:53 <vede> Yes.
P12:04:58 <vede> My previous one was like that.
P12:05:01 <Quatroking> Thats just ripping people off
P12:05:12 <vede> I had to install drivers from a floppy before installing Windows to use it.
P12:05:23 <vede> It was stupid.
P12:05:24 <Quatroking> heh, floppy.

P12:08:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking, I meant what I said, relax.  I never said I was throwing you away for anything, just that your behavior here didn't exactly seem consistent with that of someone I would recommend for op

P12:09:55 <vede> Not unserious, but occasionally you get really trollish.
P12:10:21 <Quatroking> When was the last time that I trolled on this channel
P12:10:34 <citricsquid> ugh
P12:10:35 <citricsquid> guys
P12:10:40 <citricsquid> being silly != trolling
P12:10:42 <citricsquid> seriously.
P12:10:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, Quatro has trolled before
P12:10:51 <Quatroking> Whatever
P12:10:52 <vede> Trolling enough for me.
P12:11:07 <Quatroking> Nohbdy: don't forget to get a GPU, the p5n-d doesn't come with an internal one
P12:11:09 <citricsquid> I have never once seen quatro troll :|
P12:11:13 <mail2345> same here
P12:11:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well maybe he trolls when you're not here citricsquid ?  ;)
P12:11:23 <Nohbdy> GPU? Do you mean Graphics Card?

P12:11:30 <mail2345> hmm,i'll load up logger

P12:11:37 <vede> I believe.
P12:11:40 <mail2345> anyone care to mention an instance of quatro trolling
P12:11:41 <Nohbdy> Oh well pshyeahh I've never really heard of a built in one..that sounds silly
P12:11:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes, you'll read through 4 months of logs to find it
P12:11:54 <vede> Nohbdy, you've never heard of onboard video?
P12:11:56 <mail2345> no, ctrl-f

P12:12:13 <mail2345> onbioard vido is shit
P12:12:15 <Quatroking> Trolling = "guys how do I place a block" "guys where is notch this game sux" "is this the channel for hetereo people oh wait its full of gays nevermind"
P12:12:26 <vede> I know it's shit, but nohbdy said he didn't know what it was.

P12:12:34 <mail2345> or calling a wrapper a client when it is a wrapper
P12:12:39 <Evil-Ville> Most of them don't
P12:12:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> There was one OS war where he was vehemently defending Windows with ridiculous claims, and one where he was semi on the side of Linux...
P12:12:47 <mail2345> just so that people complain about the legalility
P12:12:49 <liq3> Evil-Ville: really? I thought it'd be pretty standard.
P12:12:50 <mail2345> of a client
P12:12:52 <Quatroking> Nohbdy: any other hardware you're getting?
P12:12:59 <mail2345> when it was actually a wrapper
P12:13:05 <mail2345> that was perfectly legal
P12:13:07 <Nohbdy> Oh heck yeah... I'm actually looking for some links for you guys right now :P
P12:13:15 <mail2345> instead of a illegal client based of notch's client
P12:13:31 <Quatroking> The Western Digital Caviar Green WD6400ACS is great
P12:13:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> The debate wasn't on legality, it was whether we should ban distributors from here.  At least all the ones I remember
P12:13:35 <liq3> mail2345: what are you talkin about?
P12:13:36 <Quatroking> I've got two of them
P12:13:43 <Nohbdy> My CPU is gonna be Intel Core 2 Duo
P12:13:49 <Quatroking> model?
P12:13:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> brb
P12:13:58 <mail2345> point is the troll knew perfectly well that if he had admitted it was a wrapper
P12:14:02 <mail2345> the whole debate would end
P12:14:02 <Nohbdy> uhh...er....um
P12:14:15 <Nohbdy> 2.66GHz
P12:14:22 <Quatroking> the E5300?
P12:14:32 <Nohbdy> no idea on that lol, may have to look into it more
P12:14:42 <Nohbdy> it includes a fan and heatsink
P12:14:52 <Quatroking> All CPU's include that these days :P
P12:15:19 <Quatroking> But I ordered an E5300 recently and that one had a clockspeed at 2,6GHZ
P12:15:25 <Nohbdy> As for RAM, two sticks of Kingston HyperX DDR2 800... 2gb each
P12:15:27 <Quatroking> pretty big chance its the same one
P12:15:37 <Quatroking> Kingston is always good.

P12:17:31 <mail2345> that is wayy too epensive

P12:18:03 <Quatroking> I never really got the point of trackballs :/

P12:18:38 <citricsquid> get a G9 and a G19 :D
P12:18:46 <Nohbdy> it's $30 I said.. how is that much? Just wait till I get to the keyboard

P12:34:06 <Quatroking> Yeah, they can hold a good 20GB or something
P12:34:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> I was in the SonyStyle store yesterday and in the basement they had an empty VIP room so I went in... and holy fuck
P12:34:24 <kryptn> lol
P12:34:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> In other news, they also had these ridiculously small laptops
P12:34:29 <Quatroking> you met THE GIMP

P12:34:32 <Quatroking> in that basement.
P12:34:41 <]ZomBuster> unless you want to watch movies on it
P12:34:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> True
P12:35:07 <vede> I don't really care about having special HD or Blu-Ray movies and stuff.
P12:35:12 <Quatroking> Now, explain to me, why should people get a blu-ray burner and buy blank blu-ray cd's while they can also just get a new external drive
P12:35:17 <vede> I'm pretty much good with standard defnition movies.
P12:35:21 <gear> High Def makes me uncomfortable
P12:35:27 <gear> its too clear
P12:35:29 <Quatroking> I'm pretty sure that the external drive option is a lot cheaper.
P12:35:30 <gear> i dont like watching it
P12:35:33 <liq3> Quatroking: Because they think it's "cool".
P12:35:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah

P12:36:02 <Quatroking> allnaturalx: isn't that normal for a movie
P12:36:03 <vede> Quatroking, not only is the external drive prolly cheaper, but I bet it's more widely compatible, since very few people actually have a blue-ray reader.
P12:36:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking, not really

P12:37:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I know vede... it's ridiculous how small and expensive they are

P1:04:41 <Quatroking> I see
P1:04:45 <Nohbdy> I guess I'll check a few more in the 9 series
P1:05:00 <Quatroking> Nohbdy: looking for a GPU now?
P1:05:01 <liq3> Nohbdy: 9 is basically the same as 8s... Not much better.
P1:05:09 <citricsquid> who'd lie about that?
P1:05:10 <citricsquid> ;)
P1:05:16 <liq3> Something like a 8800GTX is the best.
P1:05:19 <Quatroking> My GTX280 is great.
P1:05:19 <Nohbdy> ...well then why would I pay over $400 more?
P1:05:24 <Nohbdy> let me check the price for one
P1:05:25 <Quatroking> Costs a bunch but works great.
P1:05:34 <liq3> Nohbdy: because the X2 has 2 GPUs on it. :P
P1:05:49 <Nohbdy> there is no 8800 GTX only GTS
P1:05:50 <liq3> GX2*
P1:05:55 <liq3> Hmr?
P1:06:03 <Quatroking> no, GTX280
P1:06:18 <Quatroking> its a newer series
P1:06:19 <liq3> http://www.nvidia.com/page/geforce_8800.html
P1:06:25 <Nohbdy> price check?
P1:06:29 <Quatroking> eh
P1:06:30 <Nohbdy> I'm talking about cost now
P1:06:38 <liq3> yeh, the GTX is newer stuff.
P1:06:47 <Nohbdy> that's why I went to the series 8 section lol
P1:07:15 <Quatroking> Yeah the GTX280 is a handy dandy 420 dollars at least.
P1:07:22 <Quatroking> it works great tho ;D
P1:07:51 <Nohbdy> Heyyy a 9800 GT is only about $110
P1:08:05 <liq3> Nohbdy: If you don't mind ATI, this is pretty good. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150337
P1:08:12 <]Snowman> AAAAAAAAAH ATI
P1:08:33 <liq3> Snowman, what's wrong with ATI?
P1:09:20 <citricsquid> I have a ATI radeon 3400, worthless crap :D
P1:09:22 <Nohbdy> lmfao at comment "Double life-time warranty? Does that mean it'll be covered if I die, and my kids take use of this?"
P1:09:26 <]Snowman> They're not as good as nvidia
P1:09:34 <mail2345> @nohbdy yes
P1:09:35 <mail2345> indeed
P1:09:50 <mail2345> but only one of your kids
P1:10:00 <mail2345> if you have multiple kids it gets split amoung them
P1:10:20 <liq3> citricsquid: 3400? That's low end, of course it is.
P1:10:24 <Nohbdy> I don't know what's wrong with ATI but I don't hear about it as much as Nvidia so I think I might stick with the choices I have haha
P1:10:30 <liq3> citricsquid: 4870HD is just as powerful as a GTX260.
P1:10:34 <citricsquid> It's the lowest of the low end.
P1:10:38 <citricsquid> cost about 20
P1:10:53 <Nohbdy> but does it have compatibility issues? what's wrong with ATI?
P1:11:04 <liq3> Nohbdy: Get a GTX260 or ATI 4870HD imo. They're both about $150 on newegg.
P1:11:19 <liq3> Nohbdy: Nothing? >.> I use ATI and it works fine.
P1:11:32 <Nohbdy> GTX260 for $150 wtf?

P1:18:04 <Nohbdy> well I don't know what to pick! I don't get the difference in numbers and GT or GTS or whatever
P1:18:15 <Quatroking> different series
P1:18:22 <Marach> Aphex Twin has too many tracks named "Untitled"

P1:18:31 <Nohbdy> that doesn't mean anything to me... I don't know what different series do
P1:18:45 <PuyoDead> Marach, looking at the ambient album?

P1:19:38 <Quatroking> Now I want sli, there's no fucking store that sells them
P1:19:53 <Nohbdy> but you said that there's barely a difference in the 9 series vs the 8 series.. and the one you chose for me is the difference betweehn 800 and 600...how big is that difference?
P1:20:12 <liq3> Nohbdy: ACcording to that link, the 9800 GTX is about 30% slower then GTX 280. :P
P1:20:15 <Quatroking> 6 series are fucking old
P1:20:28 <kryptn> Quatroking, have you checked Newegg?
P1:20:29 <liq3> Nohbdy: Yeh. The only thing 9 series really did was add DX10 support.
P1:20:43 <liq3> Nohbdy: normally a series up adds quite a bit of power.
P1:20:44 <Quatroking> krypth: newegg doesn't ship internationally
P1:20:45 <Nohbdy> oh but... it says the 8 series has DX10 support?
P1:20:47 <Quatroking> I'm Dutch

P1:20:51 <kryptn> Oh, that sucks :(

P1:21:24 <Nohbdy> I'm NOT gonna use Vista anyway... maybe Windows 7 when it comes out
P1:21:31 <Quatroking> video games are always 50 to 70 euro's here

P1:21:51 <Quatroking> vat tax? lol no
P1:21:53 <liq3> Nohbdy: One thing to watch out for tho... XY00... The Y is important. a 8800GTX is waaaaaaaay more powerful then a 9200.
P1:21:58 <Quatroking> they just change the dollar into an euro
P1:21:59 <Nohbdy> very uncompatible with the things I wanted to do like older programs and 3D MOVIE MAKER >:O
P1:22:06 <kryptn> oh lol

P1:37:49 <Evil-Ville> Well probably but I can't be bothered going to a computer store
P1:37:52 <Evil-Ville> I do
P1:37:56 <vede> I don't need a mousepad.
P1:37:59 <liq3> vede: eh?
P1:38:05 <liq3> I use one too.
P1:38:12 <Evil-Ville> Some cheap 2 euro one
P1:38:13 <vede> Optical mouse -> no need for pad.
P1:38:25 <do0han> I need something my desk has a bit on it that causes my optical mouse to go a bit funky
P1:38:27 <liq3> vede: I'm using an optical... I need a mouse pad for it. :/
P1:38:27 <]Snowman> Both the box and the site dont show what DPI it is

P1:38:48 <liq3> my mouse pad is made of metal. <#
P1:38:49 <liq3> <3
P1:38:52 <]Snowman> Yeah agreed Evil, that's why I use a pad too
P1:38:53 <vede> If I were to use a mouse pad of any sort, I'd probably just use one of my D&D books.
P1:39:39 <liq3> Hrm. :/
P1:39:44 <Evil-Ville> Also my table is actually made of two smaller rectangular tables so there's a small crack where my mouse is
P1:39:53 <liq3> Evil-Ville: ditto.
P1:40:09 <vede> My desk has holes in it.
P1:40:11 <Evil-Ville> So if I didn't use a pad my mouse would get stuck on that crack

P5:55:15 <Darkebrz> Red guy is Kaidene
P5:55:27 <Darkebrz> ZomBuster: Doesnt help
P5:55:35 <Darkebrz> Huge maps make a TON of mobs
P5:55:36 <ZomBuster> oh must be all the mobs
P5:56:02 <Darkebrz> ...Have you done it yourself?
P5:56:08 <ZomBuster> no :P
P5:56:14 <ZomBuster> but it should be possible
P5:56:31 <Darkebrz> -.-
P5:56:44 <vede> I can usually run huge maps at full vision at 150fps.

P6:02:48 <AlexVMiner> immediatly exploded?

P6:03:20 <Darkebrz> ZomBuster: at the start of your map, I delete and take along a single stone block for the hardest jump
P6:03:32 <Darkebrz> But it makes it so you have to move a LOT faster

P6:15:09 <AlexVMiner> UGH
P6:15:20 <AlexVMiner> Zom's thing WON'T FRICKING SAVE
P6:15:33 <Dilt> Notch rewrote how 'mobs' were handled
P6:15:39 <Dilt> they basically spawn in groups
P6:15:46 <Dilt> after some time, they vanish, to respawn elsewhere
P6:16:01 <AlexVMiner> no duh
P6:16:03 <Dilt> now instead of constant lag, you get bursts of it as they're removed and respawned in large numbers
P6:16:10 <Dilt> well
P6:16:12 <Dilt> relatively constant lag
P6:16:14 <vede> Groups aren't removed.
P6:16:22 <Dilt> They are in my experience
P6:16:29 <vede> Individual enemies die when they're "too lonely".
P6:16:43 <AlexVMiner> it won't load the level!
P6:16:46 <Dilt> I made these observations on a small map, though
P6:16:47 <AlexVMiner> it says it saved
P6:16:51 <vede> The way it works is if an enemy is not around any other enemies for a long enough time, they die.
P6:16:51 <AlexVMiner> but it didn't!
P6:17:04 <vede> And I don't think enemies "respawn".
P6:17:11 <vede> I think they just spawn.
P6:17:13 <AlexVMiner> zom
P6:17:18 <Dilt> That's odd, vede, my observations suggest that they spawn for awhile, then vanish if I don't observe them directly (get close enough to see them) after some time
P6:17:23 <AlexVMiner> did you damage your map or something?
P6:17:30 <Dilt> and why do you people argue semantics
P6:17:32 <AlexVMiner> it refuses to save
P6:17:36 <Dilt> by 'respawn' i mean 'spawn'
P6:17:50 <vede> Because respawning and spawning are different things.
P6:18:03 <vede> Respawn inplies that it was removed then came back.
P6:18:08 <vede> Spawn is just it appearing.
P6:18:23 <ZomBuster> saving doesnt work in survival
P6:18:30 <vede> Yes it does, Zombuster.
P6:18:37 <vede> You just can't load it in Sandbox.
P6:18:39 <Dilt> you're now just trying to change the way i speak which is highly irrelevant to the conversation at hand
P6:18:46 <ZomBuster> oh then I dont know
P6:19:01 <AlexVMiner> awesome
P6:19:02 <Dilt> i use wrong words for things, fine, i'll correct them
P6:19:10 <AlexVMiner> i can play it in singleplayer with hax
P6:19:32 <Dilt> point is, i made the observation that mobs vanish in groups when the player doesn't go near them after some time
P6:19:39 <Dilt> this was tested with a dirt cage, at least
P6:19:51 <AlexVMiner> anyway
P6:19:56 <AlexVMiner> what can we delete?
P6:20:11 <Dilt> that being said
P6:20:14 <Dilt> the top wasn't sealed off.
P6:20:24 <Dilt> so did they all jump out when i wasn't looking or some crap?
P6:20:25 <Dilt> <_<
P6:20:35 <AlexVMiner> zombuster, what parts of the puzzle can we delete?
P6:21:16 <vede> I doubt it, but Notch said that enemies will die when they feel too lonely, so... :/
P6:21:18 <Droqen> ... oh. That's how you made it so laggy.
P6:21:31 <ZomBuster> delete?
P6:21:47 <Droqen> ZomBuster, I don't know if that was intentional or not
P6:22:16 <ZomBuster> as long as you get out of the dungeon alive there is nothing wrong

P6:23:38 <vede> Trying to play hueggg maps on my old PC.
P6:23:39 <Dilt> guys, what do you think of having non-transparent tree branches?
P6:23:48 <ZomBuster> Just see it as a time limit
P6:23:50 <Droqen> Unnecessary I guess
P6:24:11 <ZomBuster> if you dont get your ass there in time some creepers gonna blow and everything gets filled up with lava
P6:24:16 <Dilt> i'm starting to dislike the transparency - on my slower comps, I get a huge grunt of lag if I look in their general direction
P6:24:21 <Dilt> if I remove them then it's much more bearable
P6:24:25 <ZomBuster> and if your unlucky it does it imeedialty
P6:24:28 <vede> Dilt, I think that instead of trees like they are now, we should have a trunk, and a few random solid wood branches going in random directions for a few blocks.
P6:24:37 <vede> And the leaves should not be solid.

P6:25:05 <vede> This way, you could use leaves for trees AND bushes/other foliage.
P6:25:26 <Dilt> then how about my favorite
P6:25:30 <Dilt> 'have the transparency be optional'
P6:25:36 <Dilt> default on
P6:25:40 <ZomBuster> woudlnt that make trees really big vede
P6:25:44 <ZomBuster> with branches and stuff
P6:25:45 <vede> No, Zombuster.
P6:25:52 <vede> The branches would be small.
P6:25:56 <Droqen> I wonder if having leaves be not transparent would increase performance a lot
P6:25:57 <vede> Just a few blocks in length.
P6:25:59 <ZomBuster> smaller than a block.. ?
P6:26:00 <Droqen> I don't know how they're handled, though
P6:26:10 <vede> Zombuster, I'll make an example.
P6:26:13 <Droqen> A tree normally only goes 2 in each direction
P6:26:43 <Dilt> you do have a valid idea vede
P6:27:16 <Dilt> i just think the transparency effects performance thus it should given an option to be used minimally
P6:28:11 <potato> someone link me to a good survival level
P6:28:44 <Dilt> this being said
P6:29:00 <Dilt> when the generator supports alternative environment types (desert, plains, mountains, etc)
P6:29:12 <Dilt> i would be happy to see some thick undebrush with pathways cutting between them

P6:45:39 <vede> Instead of going to a site, downloading a package, and installing the package, the best thing to do is use Ubuntu's automated systems for downloading/installing things.
P6:45:55 <mooogle> automated?
P6:46:00 <vede> Automated.
P6:46:11 <AlexVMiner> heyo
P6:46:12 <mooogle> how so?
P6:46:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> sudo apt-get install firefox
P6:46:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> will install firefox
P6:46:22 <vede> Like, sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre and it'll download and install java.
P6:46:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> sudo apt-get install xchat will install xchat
P6:46:27 <mooogle> ah.
P6:46:29 <AlexVMiner> wewt, phil
P6:46:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> sudo apt-get install opera will install opera
P6:46:30 <AlexVMiner> :D
P6:46:37 <vede> And you don't even need to use the command line.
P6:46:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can use synaptic
P6:46:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> But that's a waste of time... Most GUIs are :P
P6:46:54 <vede> There's an application manager that has a huge list of stuff you can download.
P6:47:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, synapti
P6:47:04 <vede> Games, education tools, office tools.
P6:47:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> synaptic*
P6:47:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> And you can add more sources to install more things
P6:47:25 <vede> Allnaturalx, it's only a waste of time if you already know all the names of crap.
P6:47:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Cydia and Installer and Icy on the iPhone are based on the same system
P6:47:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, you can use sudo apt-cache search on the command line
P6:47:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> ex - sudo apt-cache search movie player
P6:47:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> actually just apt-cache

P6:47:56 <vede> Well, or I can click applications and type in the search bar.
P6:48:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Synaptic is just a GUI for apt-get.  Anything you can do on Synaptic can be done on apt-get
P6:48:23 <vede> I know.
P6:48:27 <vede> But it's far easier.

P6:48:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Depends on your level of comfort with the commandline
P6:49:24 <vede> Yeah, I've been actually USING Linux for about a day now.
P6:50:02 <vede> So... level of comfort is "Crap, I hope I can find a tutorial..."
P6:50:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P6:50:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> How're you liking it?
P6:50:28 <vede> I like it.
P6:50:54 <vede> Except for the stuff I can't download from Synaptic.
P6:51:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then you either add a source or find a .deb
P6:51:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> which installs through dpkg... sudo dpkg -i *.deb
P6:51:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P6:51:22 <vede> Pretty much anything I can't do automatically, goes to crap immediately.
P6:51:32 <vede> Why can't I just download a folder with stuff?
P6:51:38 <mooogle> sudo make me a sandwich
P6:51:44 <vede> I like downloading folders with stuff.
P6:51:50 <vede> It makes me feel good.
P6:51:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Downloading folders with stuff?  What do you mean?
10P6:51:58 * potato (potto@CPE000393e704cd-CM001bd71cdc30.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has left #minecraft
P6:52:27 <mooogle> like downloading for xp or mac
P6:52:30 <vede> Like, download an archive with files in it.
P6:52:32 <mooogle> without the command line
P6:52:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can do that on Linux....
P6:52:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's automatic?
P6:52:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ubuntu even comes with an unzipping program
P6:53:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, make sure you also sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
P6:53:14 <vede> Yeah, I did.
P6:53:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> It might have unrar in it, if opening rars is your issue... If not do sudo apt-get install unrar
P6:53:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> then it'll open automatically in ubuntu's default unzipping utilit
P6:53:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can do the same thing for 7zips
P6:53:59 <vede> But I mean, like, if I go to TIGSource and want to download a game from the feedback section, there is definitely no automatic way to download anything there.
P6:54:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Link me so I can see?
P6:54:26 <vede> So I have to manually download mygamelol.zip or mygamelol.rar or whatever, extract, and play from there.
P6:54:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> So you're complaining that Ubuntu doesn't automatically extract archives like Windows?
P6:54:58 <vede> No!
P6:55:28 <vede> I'm complaining that it's so god-awful difficult to do anything that can't be done with Synaptic or something.
P6:55:47 <vede> On Windows, what I normally did was "download, extract, open, run"
P6:55:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right... but those were executables right?
P6:55:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> .exes
P6:56:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> You can't run those in Linux... you need .sh, .so, etc...
P6:56:39 <vede> On Linux, it becomes "download, extract, open, try to run, look for help, try to get permissions, realize I'm missing some retarded dependencies, hope it runs..."
P6:56:53 <vede> I realize that I'd be downloading Linux-specific versions of things.
P6:56:58 <vede> Like, that aren't .exes.
P6:56:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Weird.  That only really happens when compiling
P6:57:02 <vede> I'm not a retard.

P6:58:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, if you can find a .deb or a source for Synaptic you're in
P6:58:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> You're using KDE?
P6:58:43 <vede> I'm using Ubuntu...
P6:58:48 <vede> Which is...

P6:59:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> GNOME.  But you're using Konversation for IRC, which while it's awesome, has a shitload of KDE depends :P
P6:59:17 <vede> Heh.
P6:59:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> BTW, give other DEs a spin (like KDE).  You might be surprised
P6:59:32 <vede> DE's?
P6:59:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> The new KDE is pretty nice
P6:59:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Unlike Windows, in Linux the user interface is separate from the core OS and interchangeable
P6:59:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are several different desktop environments and window managers
P7:00:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Each is like its own OS to the user

P7:10:49 <mooogle> lmfao
P7:11:16 <liq3> lolololol.
P7:11:20 <vede> How did it run on blenders or coffee makers?
P7:11:22 <liq3> i love the opening sentence.
P7:11:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_linux
P7:11:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Only the high-tech ones of course
P7:11:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Basically if it has a display
P7:11:52 <vede> Oooh.
P7:11:53 <vede> Okay.
P7:12:07 <vede> I was thinking, like standard run-of-the-mill blenders and coffee-makers.
P7:12:20 <mooogle> linux: will it blend?
P7:12:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> There'd be no point because you could never use it :P
P7:12:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P7:12:27 <liq3> "This is the third such occurrence for Linux developers since 1991." :D so funny.
P7:12:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P7:12:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> "It's pretty irresponsible of him and shows his lack of dedication to Linux and the open source movement," said Fred Simpson.  "If others try to emulate this behavior then a lot of projects could get derailed." FTW

P7:13:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh btw, vede, sudo apt-get install hotbabe
P7:13:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's a system monitor that's a hot babe, and as your computer gets hotter she takes her clothes off
P7:13:47 <AlexVMiner> :O
P7:13:49 <AlexVMiner> :3
P7:13:49 <AlexVMiner> :D
P7:13:53 <mooogle> hahahaha
P7:13:59 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: lol really?
P7:13:59 <mooogle> wow, that's interesting

P7:14:12 <AlexVMiner> SEXEH
P7:14:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which displays the system activity in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
P7:14:46 <mooogle> if i didn't have a mac right now, i'd definitely use ubuntu
P7:14:47 <liq3> lol i gotta see this.

P7:15:54 <liq3> mooogle: why?
P7:16:09 <mooogle> porn spam
P7:16:17 <vede> DUH
P7:16:41 <vede> Usually when people do searches with "hot babe" in the keywords, that's what they're looking for.
P7:16:46 <mooogle> lolol
P7:16:56 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: it says it couldn't find it. :(

P7:18:33 <mooogle> why would you?
P7:18:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Someone who ran the site with me got caught
P7:18:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> threatened to give them my info

P7:20:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> TorrentLeech for movies, What? for music
P7:20:20 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: rofl, what I love is according to a news article, Linux users objected not to the images, but the fact it was a non-free lincense. :P

P7:27:08 <vede> Yep.
P7:27:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> awesome
P7:27:18 <vede> That was... really easy.
P7:27:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P7:27:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> I love different DEs... it's one of the things keeping me off Windows, albeit one of the many
P7:28:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also, vede, once you try if you hate them you can remove them with sudo apt-get remove or from synaptic
P7:28:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P7:28:27 <vede> I think... by now, except for troubles with manually downloading things, this is about as functional as Windows for me.
P7:28:33 <AlexVMiner> wewt
P7:28:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> If only Linux had games... there would be no Windows :(
P7:28:47 <AlexVMiner> I AM ARCHANGEL AND I PROTECTED THE DRUNKARD
P7:28:51 <vede> Linux has games.
P7:29:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> True, but not as many, and not as many big titles
P7:29:12 <vede> That's actually one of the reasons I switched. I noticed nearly all the games I'd been playing were free open-source type games.
P7:29:19 <Droqen> But if there was no Windows... there would probably be more linux viruses
P7:29:26 <Droqen> (or at least attempted ones ;p)
P7:29:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Droqen, maybe, but nowhere near as many as Windows
P7:29:52 <Droqen> It'd be harder since there are so many different setups for Linux
P7:29:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linux is solid... Everything runs at the lowest possible level of access, requires admin password, has several other protective layers for the network
P7:29:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Windows just doesn't
P7:30:00 <Droqen> And more secure in that way too
P7:30:04 <vede> Sauerbraten, Blood Frontier...
P7:30:29 <vede> And there's a few other seemingly good FPS games to be found with Synaptic.
P7:30:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nexuiz?  I play UrbanTerror a lot
P7:30:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, and more on getdebs.net

P7:30:43 <Darkebrz> Im reading this Linux/Windows comparison, its pretty damn biased (obviously). But this just took the cake:
P7:30:44 <Darkebrz> Windows/cars are not safe from viruses/theft unless you install an antivirus/lock the doors. Linux/motorbikes don't have viruses/doors, so are perfectly safe without you having to install an antivirus/lock any doors.

P7:30:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> It kind of is true
P7:31:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't run an antivirus on Linux for example
P7:31:09 <Darkebrz> You dont have to
P7:31:20 <Darkebrz> Im just saying that the comparison to cars is horrible XD
P7:31:23 <Dilt> I don't run an antivirus on windows!
P7:31:23 <Dilt> :D
P7:31:25 <liq3> AlLnAtuRalX: All linux AV is only designed to rip you off (since linux doesn't need any).
P7:31:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly liq3 :P
P7:31:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Actually, there are some good Linux AV, but to scan windows partitions inc ase of an emergency or scan email and make sure you're passing nothing on to Windows friends
P7:31:50 <yoshibot> Unless it's free?
P7:31:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> True
P7:31:55 <Dilt> more like, liq3, most linux AV are designed to detect 'known viruses'
P7:32:00 <Darkebrz> But really, motorcycles are safe from theft because they dont have doors that can be locked?
P7:32:05 <Dilt> most known viruses, as a note, are for Windows
P7:32:13 <Darkebrz> That doesn't make any sense
P7:32:26 <Dilt> and 'linux viruses', while they exist, are usually quickly patched up
P7:32:26 <yoshibot> Linux isn't invincible, it's just more resistant.
P7:32:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> There have been a handful of linux viruses, ever
P7:32:43 <liq3> Darkebrz: You can steal the entire bike...
P7:32:49 <Dilt> not really, it's easy to write a virus
P7:32:49 <Darkebrz> Exactly!
P7:32:53 <liq3> But you can do that with cars too. ;]
P7:32:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Dilt, go for it
P7:33:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Infect me and you get $50
P7:33:04 <Dilt> the issue is what damage it can cause
P7:33:11 <Darkebrz> So, we have come to a conclusion, Linux does not prevent a burglar from taking your computer
10P7:33:13 * mail2345 is now known as mail2345|afk
P7:33:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> It has to be able to pass itself on
P7:33:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P7:33:25 <Dilt> if windows did what linux does (and most modern OSes should do) and run applications at the lowest level
P7:33:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> It does if you're me, since I never leave my computer
P7:33:32 <vede> Okay, imma reboot, since Ubuntu is telling me I got stuff that won't work right unless I reboot.
P7:33:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> alright vede 
P7:33:39 <Dilt> you may be suprised to find that the damage there might be limited as well
P7:33:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just updated I see :P
P7:33:53 <yoshibot> Put a bomb in your computer, write a driver for it, and a password challenge upon login
P7:33:56 <liq3> dilt: you wouldn't even be able to get the virus onto his computer.
P7:33:58 <yoshibot> fail it 5 times and kabewm
P7:34:05 <Dilt> and AlLnAtuRalX, if I knew you IRL, i'd win $50
P7:34:14 <Dilt> since i'm not good enough to remote exploit
P7:34:15 <Dilt> :(
P7:34:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well no virus writers would no me IRL
P7:34:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> and besides, I have no friends
P7:34:20 <Dilt> yeah liq3
P7:34:22 <Dilt> is the point
P7:34:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I'm secure
P7:34:27 <Dilt> unless i do one of two things
P7:34:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> know*

P7:34:46 <Dilt> but 2) do it when he's logged in and not watching
P7:34:51 <Dilt> and 3) remote exploit but i don't know how to do that
P7:34:53 <Dilt> anyway
P7:34:55 <liq3> dilt: thing is, with linux, you have to trick him into getting, downloading it, making it an exe, then running it. :P
P7:35:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Usually to do 2) you'll need my admin p/w
P7:35:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only way around that is to use an exploit in the kernel or an important piece of userland or get me to run it myself
P7:35:19 <Dilt> you said 'virus', you didn't say what type :D
P7:35:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, it has to pass itself on

P7:35:52 <Dilt> mail2345|afk: incorrect

P7:35:57 <Dilt> it is as equally likely to have bugss
P7:35:58 <liq3> dilt: no it's not.
P7:35:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> mail2345|afk, it has plenty of bugs but they're usually patched fast
P7:36:03 <Dilt> they're just checked more often and easier to patch yourself :P
P7:36:04 <mail2345|afk> yea
P7:36:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> because it annoys some people and they patch it
P7:36:06 <mail2345|afk> that's waht i meant
P7:36:12 <Dilt> don't get the two confused
P7:36:13 <mail2345|afk> kinda ill
P7:36:32 <Dilt> if, say, you didn't UPDATE your linux every so often, though
P7:36:35 <liq3> dilt: due to what you just mentioned, it'll have less bugs then windows at any one time. ;]
P7:36:45 <Darkebrz> AlLnAtuRalX: How should I install Linux?

P7:36:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> ubuntu.com, burn the disk, and run it in windows
P7:37:00 <Dilt> liq3: beyond bugs, linux is also simply more secure by design
P7:37:03 <liq3> Darkebrz: Make a disc, or use a VM.
P7:37:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> It'll install as a windows app Darkebrz, but fully run for you

P7:38:19 <Dilt> my old school had no AV on their server before i came
P7:38:21 <mooogle> me*
P7:38:32 <Dilt> and everyone was wondering why each computer kept getting viruses
P7:38:33 <Dilt> well
P7:38:45 <Dilt> all school administrators are required to have tech administrative access (god only knows why)
P7:39:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> sudo rm -rf /*
P7:39:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P7:39:04 <Dilt> one had an infected computer and access to all files for all users due to administrator access
P7:39:06 <Dilt> so it was propagating
P7:39:08 <Dilt> :(
P7:39:13 <liq3> dilt: lololololo.
P7:39:15 <Dilt> and each time any admin logged on bam
P7:39:17 <Dilt> new viruses
P7:39:21 <Dilt> it was messed up
P7:39:32 <vede> Alright, dammit, this just won't do.
P7:39:35 <Dilt> i was literally confused before I was a tech
P7:39:47 <Dilt> i noticed my files kept changing their modified dates

P7:40:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Are you using Sun's java or icedtea?  Anyway, Minecraft has issues with some of the more obsucre DEs, so maybe try it in KDE or GNOME
P7:40:54 <Darkebrz> Animator: I am an iffy mapper
P7:40:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know it's an issue for Openbox

P7:44:47 <Dilt> i've fixed so many adware-riddled windows problems that i know one thing
P7:44:57 <Dilt> linux viruses will be just as easy to get as windows ones if they become popular

P8:04:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah :P

P8:12:50 <potato> why would anyone pay for an urc client
P8:12:53 <potato> irc*
P8:13:05 <Darkebrz> So, you are beating on me for using xchat, while you use...Colloquy? It advertises on the site that it is about looking good >_>
P8:13:16 <Darkebrz> potato: A ton of people pay for mIRC
P8:13:17 <TheOne> ok stupid question, anyone know were to find a list of the ampersand color codes?
P8:13:31 <potato> colloquy is free and it works great
P8:13:38 <vede> TheOne, there's one in mail2345's forum sig.
P8:13:41 <potato> xchat costs money
P8:13:42 <Darkebrz> XChat 2 is free and it works great
P8:13:46 <TheOne> thanks vede
P8:13:56 <Darkebrz> Unofficial copying ftw!
P8:14:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes, there is an opensource edition for windows that's free
P8:14:18 <potato> what features does it have
P8:14:24 <potato> ah, gotcha

P8:14:35 <TheOne> vede, It's not there... But thanks any way
P8:14:37 <Darkebrz> Well, I don't have any special needs
P8:14:39 <Darkebrz> So it works fine
P8:15:01 <potato> i was talking about the real xchat, a free opensource version sounds better
P8:15:17 <potato> i would rather use telnet than pay for an irc client
P8:15:33 <PuyoDead> xchat anywhere else is free, except the windows version... which is total crap
P8:15:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes, that's true
P8:15:39 <PuyoDead> hence, xchat 2
P8:15:40 <Darkebrz> Wow, the reason I have no space on my computer is because I have over 9000 little applications that use like 50 mn
P8:15:41 <Darkebrz> mb
P8:15:49 <Darkebrz> Either that or something is really fucked up
P8:15:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Xchat aqua is free on OS X as is xchat on linux (ofcourse)

P8:16:10 <PuyoDead> for that reason alone, I refuse to give money to the windows version
P8:17:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P8:17:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> They do do a lot of work to get it seamless
P8:17:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it doesn't rely on cygwin, etc
P8:17:31 <PuyoDead> I really hate the state of IRC clients in windows
P8:17:45 <vede> Me too.
P8:17:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Linux has some incredible ones
P8:17:46 <Darkebrz> Honestly if I could, I would love to do a reformat
P8:17:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quassel for example
P8:18:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quassel is just incredibly good
P8:18:02 <PuyoDead> yea, I loved most all the ones I tried in ubuntu
P8:18:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quassel IRC is based on the client-server model: The core application can be placed onto a server which is connected to the Internet around-the-clock; one or more clients then connect to the core. This way, the connection to IRC can be kept up even when all clients have been closed. The combination of screen and WeeChat as well as IRC bouncers served as example for this architecture.[1]
P8:18:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> SO you can be on 10 computers on the same nick
P8:18:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> and type on any of them and it shows up
P8:18:33 <Darkebrz> Awesome
P8:18:34 <Darkebrz> Awesome
P8:18:35 <Darkebrz> Awesome
P8:18:39 <Darkebrz> But
P8:18:40 <vede> Awesome?
P8:18:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> Awesome./
P8:18:52 <vede> :/
P8:18:57 <Darkebrz> Then I would need to install Linux on everyones computers :P
P8:19:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P8:19:21 <vede> 16.7% of my RAM is being used just be Ubuntu and Konversation.
P8:19:26 <vede> That seems like a lot.
P8:19:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> orly?
P8:19:35 <vede> Yeah.
P8:19:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> how much do you have and what DE?
P8:19:46 <vede> I have 2GB.
P8:19:51 <vede> 332 is being used.
P8:19:55 <vede> My DE is xfce.
P8:20:03 <vede> (332MB)
P8:20:09 <PuyoDead> sad that I had to see ubuntu go, but hopefully I'll be able to give it another shot when I build a new computer
P8:20:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> no browser vede ?
P8:20:23 <vede> Nope.
P8:20:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's very weird
P8:20:33 <vede> Just Konversation and Ubuntu.
P8:20:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm running about 15 apps including a browser and WINE, and it's taking up 1gb
P8:20:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> oh wait, are you running system monitor?
P8:21:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> if you are, don't... it uses a shitload of resources just to run
P8:21:08 <vede> Yeah.
P8:21:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Use top or htop from the command line :P
P8:21:17 <PuyoDead> xchat 2 using the god damn pc speaker makes me want to scream, though
P8:21:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> sudo apt-get install htop && htop
P8:21:22 <vede> Uses... 11.8 MB...
P8:21:30 <vede> What about that conky thing?
P8:21:31 <Darkebrz> PuyoDead: xchat 2 uses the PC speaker?
P8:21:36 <PuyoDead> mine does
P8:21:37 <vede> I tried to install it, but it didn't do anything.
P8:21:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, you can install it but you need a configuration for it
P8:21:42 <Darkebrz> Mine doesnt
P8:21:47 <vede> :/
P8:21:47 <Darkebrz> Well, at least
P8:21:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> here ill show you
P8:21:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=.conkyrc&ei=UTF-8&fr=opera2
P8:22:04 <PuyoDead> if I hit backspace with nothing there, or arrow right to the end, it beeps with the repeat rate of the keyboard
P8:22:17 <Darkebrz> Your PC beeps
P8:22:20 <Darkebrz> Not the speakers >_>
P8:22:25 <PuyoDead> pc speaker
P8:22:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> The motherboard beep?  AHHHHH
P8:22:30 <Darkebrz> Hm
P8:22:32 <PuyoDead> yea, I hate that crap
P8:22:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> vede, http://lusule.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/how-to-4/
P8:22:44 <PuyoDead> I want it for boot, of course, so I don't want to just unplug it
P8:22:44 <Darkebrz> I like my motherboard beeping :D
P8:23:01 <vede> How much does conky use?
P8:23:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> very little
P8:23:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can tell you exactly, hold on
P8:23:30 <PuyoDead> and it seems I'm the only one with this issue, so I've never found a fix
P8:24:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> 0.2% of mine
P8:24:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I have an elaborate conky
P8:24:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> I can show you, hold one

P8:25:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> they're all borked
P8:25:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> no idea why... survivaltest works but it's newer
P8:25:44 <Darkebrz> Ubuntu looks fucking awesome
P8:25:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> ha, that's far from default ubuntu
P8:25:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not even sure if that was Ubuntu, I think it was
P8:26:00 <PuyoDead> quite far
P8:26:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Might've been Fedora
P8:26:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, it was Ubuntu
P8:26:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I rember when I took that now
P8:26:30 <PuyoDead> my ubuntu is dead

P8:27:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> And that snow actually moves :P
P8:27:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> it snows
P8:27:15 <PuyoDead> plus, the wireless issue made it non-usable
P8:27:17 <Darkebrz> Sweet
P8:27:25 <Darkebrz> AlLnAtuRalX: Does that use a lot of system resources?
P8:27:46 <Darkebrz> o_o
P8:27:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Darkebrz, a fair amount... Compiz isn't as bad as say Vista or a heavier XP, but it's not as nimble as XFCE, etc
P8:27:47 <Darkebrz> Okay
P8:27:50 <Darkebrz> Im mindfucked now
P8:28:00 <Darkebrz> My Program Files only uses 50 GB
P8:28:15 <Darkebrz> So there is a lot of space that something on my comp is eating
P8:28:18 <Darkebrz> Time to find out >_>
P8:28:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> o.O
P8:28:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> movies?
P8:28:35 <Darkebrz> Naw
P8:28:42 <Darkebrz> Im gonna check everything though
P8:28:49 <PuyoDead> http://w3.win.tue.nl/nl/onderzoek/onderzoek_informatica/visualization/sequoiaview//
P8:28:51 <PuyoDead> use that
P8:29:26 <PuyoDead> actually, I think someone sort of "picked up" that project and kept going with it. I'll be damned if I remember the name
P8:29:42 <Darkebrz> Woah
P8:29:47 <PuyoDead> aha! http://windirstat.info/
P8:29:50 <PuyoDead> WinDirStat
P8:30:06 <Darkebrz> PuyoDead: What does that do?
P8:30:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> visualization
P8:30:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> simiar to disk inventory x on os x
P8:30:32 <Darkebrz> Hm
P8:30:34 <Darkebrz> Looks interesting
P8:30:38 <liq3> Animator: You here?
P8:30:41 <PuyoDead> say you have a directory with a bunch of huge files, they'll show up... huge
P8:30:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.derlien.com/ Tell me they don't look the same PuyoDead 
P8:30:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P8:30:46 <Darkebrz> Okay, WINDOWS only uses around 9gb
P8:30:51 <Darkebrz> So now I do some sleuthing
P8:31:02 <PuyoDead> makes it very easy to tell where space is being taken up, or where a large amount of files are
P8:31:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> and for Linux: http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/

P8:33:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> seeing how it does

P8:34:12 <vede> How do I get conky to actually display?
P8:34:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> hit alt+f2 and type conky

P8:34:58 <Darkebrz> I have to give this to my friend

P8:35:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, i have the pacman also
P8:35:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> I guess it's the scan graphic

P8:36:09 <Darkebrz> Well then
P8:36:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> weird
P8:36:14 <Darkebrz> $clean_tmp is taking up 20gb

P8:36:29 <liq3> hehe, my Steam folder is 30gb so far...
P8:36:31 <vede> Am I just being really freaky about my RAM maybe?
P8:36:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> 85/90gb on /home for me
P8:36:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Possibly
P8:36:38 <Darkebrz> The tmp extension makes it look fairly unimportant
P8:36:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> You won't feel the use vede :P

P8:45:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have 250gb internal and over 1tb external
P8:45:39 <Darkebrz> If so, I will probably do that
P8:45:52 <liq3> Darkebrz: Replace? No you ADD HDDs. :P
P8:45:57 <Darkebrz> I have OVER 9000 mb
P8:46:02 <PuyoDead> as soon as my first paycheck comes in, I'm getting another external
P8:46:09 <Darkebrz> liq3: Where do they add them? O_o
P8:46:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Where are you working now PuyoDead ?

P10:45:00 <Dilt> you know your video game programmin' well
P10:45:10 <Dilt> they detect you if you're 'in a radius' of them

P10:45:41 <vede> Good luck Darke!
P10:45:45 <Colain> You walk close enought to them, they notice you, pure logic.
P10:46:03 <Dilt> no idea what you're trying to say
P10:46:15 <Dilt> they can 'see through dirt' because the detection method doesn't handle dirt

P11:09:23 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> I got that also
P11:09:28 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Then I died a few seconds later
P11:09:31 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> From an arrow trap
P11:09:32 <PuyoDead> it's just a pointless "look how difficult I made this" thing. much like the mario bros. hacks and such
P11:09:38 <Siiseli> PuyoDead, exactly
P11:09:57 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> WOW
P11:10:01 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Arrow trap just owned me
P11:10:04 <vede> Nope, didn't hate IWBTG.
P11:10:09 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> I had a good idea, run fast and activate the arrow trap
P11:10:14 <vede> IWBTG obviously lacked meaningful gameplay.
P11:10:17 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> I activate it, and it flies under me
P11:10:28 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Then, I go FASTER then the arrow, and run into it!
P11:10:30 <Colain> Setveen, is that a bot...?
P11:10:32 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Wait
P11:10:33 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> No
P11:10:35 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> I was ahead of the arrow
P11:10:42 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> And it caught up D:
P11:10:56 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Colain: No, it is actual human gameplay
P11:11:01 <PuyoDead> it's a person playing, but it's a recording done with slow motion and save states
P11:11:01 <vede> IWBTG was fun to inflict upon friends.
P11:11:15 <PuyoDead> so while it is a person, it's not actual gameplay
P11:11:16 <Colain> Thats insane.
P11:11:24 <Colain> ah.
P11:12:09 <PuyoDead> check the bottom of the info, there's a little blurb about it
P11:12:23 <vede> I've done a >6min Spelunky run, a no-damage-no-items-speed-run in Spelunky.
P11:12:34 <Colain> Not in youtube, I'm in mibbit, which brings up the video in chat.,
P11:12:40 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> vede: You sound like you like Spelunky
P11:12:45 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> If you have played it so much
P11:12:50 <vede> But overall, I'd say Spelunky is an awful game.
P11:13:02 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> I don't understand people who play something over and over, then say they hate it
P11:13:12 <vede> Because no matter what, I always wanted to actually DO CRAP, not go through everything like a robot with no sense of fun.
P11:13:27 <Darkebrz|Spelunky> Thats what I do :)
P11:13:41 <Siiseli> I think spelunky is great cos' it even makes dying fun
P11:13:53 <vede> It does not make dying fun.
P11:13:56 <PuyoDead> what the hell? how'd these get here?
