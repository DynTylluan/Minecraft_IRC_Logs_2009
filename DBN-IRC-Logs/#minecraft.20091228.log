A12:00:03 <mail2345> it was clearly a client side quit
A12:00:10 <HAL9000> No it wasn't.
A12:00:17 <HAL9000> Must have been a latency issue then.
A12:00:18 <mail2345> then how did the quit message get there?
A12:00:22 <Roadcrosser> someone made a client that can /fill
A12:00:27 <mail2345> if it was lag it would be a ping timeout
A12:00:36 <HAL9000> I didn't willfully quit.
A12:00:46 <mail2345> you might have accidentally closed the tab
A12:00:51 <AndrewPH> Roadcrosser, Toss it over I can check
A12:00:51 <HAL9000> My ISP has been acting funky lately.
A12:01:00 <Roadcrosser> i cant
A12:01:00 <HAL9000> I didn't close the tab
A12:01:06 <Roadcrosser> i dont haven it
A12:01:10 <AndrewPH> Then why are you asking
A12:01:23 <Roadcrosser> im curious
A12:01:38 <storage> if someone made a client that can fill, then they most likely took the distance checking into consideration
A12:01:40 <mail2345> <Mr_Saturn> Diagnosing computer problems over IRC is like trying to diagnose brain cancer with a pointy stick
A12:01:43 <storage> or else it would be pointless
A12:01:44 <HAL9000> I see.
A12:01:47 <Roadcrosser> did well
A12:01:49 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:01:53 <mail2345> @storage i think that client was before distance checks
A12:01:55 <HAL9000> Damn mibbit can't handle netsplits
A12:02:05 <Roadcrosser> visiiro tested on the archives
A12:02:08 <HAL9000> fuuuuuuuuuu gonna have to grab mIRC now.
A12:02:09 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:02:33 <Roadcrosser> that server doesnt do distance check
A12:02:39 <mail2345> lol
A12:02:57 <mail2345> @road archives has some security things here and there, same with WoM
A12:03:03 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:03:05 <mail2345> except WoM probably hides it better
A12:03:06 <Roadcrosser> well
A12:03:10 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:03:10 <mail2345> JTE's is the worst
A12:03:14 <mail2345> the holes
A12:03:17 <mail2345> are the size
A12:03:17 <HAL9000> Also just tested a 2048 high map
A12:03:19 <mail2345> of your mom
A12:03:22 <HAL9000> interesting results
A12:03:26 <mail2345> 's
A12:03:28 <AndrewPH> mail2345, that's pretty small
A12:03:42 <mail2345> honestly
A12:03:52 <mail2345> someone needs to cook up a server security testing tool
10A12:04:22 * lobstar_MB (michielbra@86.89.201.189) has joined #minecraft
A12:04:22 <storage> so it can be used to crash real servers?
A12:04:31 <Roadcrosser> i would if you gave me the recipe
A12:04:47 <HAL9000> something to test verify-names and the like?
A12:05:05 <HAL9000> And the character crash issue?
A12:05:37 <Aeomin> uhm..
A12:05:50 <Aeomin> what else besides verify names..
A12:06:07 <Aeomin> I could make one but for what
12A12:09:16 * Golden (ghmorris15@ip72-193-89-211.lv.lv.cox.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:10:46 <HAL9000> checking the client crash issue
10A12:10:46 * TestDummy is now known as xXTestDummyXx
10A12:10:50 * xXTestDummyXx is now known as TestDummy
A12:10:53 <mail2345> ._.
A12:10:54 <HAL9000> the invalid character thing
A12:11:02 <AndrewPH> Notch should just build in an invalid character checker
A12:11:10 <HAL9000> Yes he should.
A12:11:15 <TestDummy> Notch should cure world hunger.
A12:11:19 <AndrewPH> He should.
A12:11:21 <HAL9000> No he shouldnt
A12:11:32 <mail2345> erm
A12:11:32 <HAL9000> That'd mean less MC dev time
A12:11:33 <TestDummy> BECAUSE THAT'D DISTRACT HIM FROM MINECRAFT
A12:11:33 <mail2345> guys
A12:11:40 <mail2345> let me explain something
A12:11:41 <TestDummy> girls
A12:11:43 <AndrewPH> penis
A12:11:46 <AndrewPH> es
A12:11:46 <mail2345> this is something notch does not need to do
A12:11:48 <TestDummy> You liek,.
A12:11:49 <Aeomin> Well, there are only 2 things to check..
A12:11:53 <mail2345> it only applies to custom servers
A12:11:54 <Aeomin> no need to make it into tool
A12:11:58 <mail2345> and people with verify-names=false
A12:12:00 <mail2345> so yea
A12:12:07 <mail2345> not notch's duty
A12:12:07 <HAL9000> verify-names and invalid characters seem the only tests for now.
A12:12:13 <mail2345> @HAL actually
A12:12:16 <AndrewPH> mail2345, Just build it into the client, just so that it doesn't happen at all
A12:12:19 <mail2345> there are some other interesting attacks
A12:12:22 <AndrewPH> I mean seriously
A12:12:22 <mail2345> @andrew why?
A12:12:25 <AndrewPH> Because
A12:12:26 <mail2345> it would be a waste of time
A12:12:27 <AndrewPH> He should
A12:12:31 <Aeomin> dun dun dun..
A12:12:31 <AndrewPH> It doesn't take long
A12:12:33 <mail2345> no he shouln't
A12:12:36 <mail2345> but time is time
A12:12:48 <AndrewPH> He's obviously not working on minecraft as it is
A12:12:48 <mail2345> and the problem does not exist if you use the vanilla server
A12:12:52 <AndrewPH> (loljk)
A12:13:16 <AndrewPH> I still think he should build it in
A12:13:17 <mail2345> [ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm -rf / || echo "You live" 
A12:13:19 <Aeomin> does player name allow space?
A12:13:21 <AndrewPH> It's always good practice
A12:13:25 <mail2345> run it in bash as sudo
A12:14:23 <Aeomin> anyone what other characters allowed in name besides letters and numbers?
A12:14:53 <mail2345> umm
A12:14:54 <mail2345> periods
10A12:15:00 * Spadge is now known as Spadge|Away
A12:15:08 <Aeomin> and space?
A12:15:38 <HAL9000> dont think so
A12:16:01 <HAL9000> underscores are allowed
A12:16:05 <HAL9000> i think
A12:16:23 <HAL9000> yeah underscores ARE allowed
A12:16:28 <HAL9000> just checked my player files
A12:16:33 <Aeomin> but not space
A12:18:07 <HAL9000> I havent seen any space names yet.
A12:18:14 <HAL9000> I don't think they can be registered
A12:18:19 <AndrewPH> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/100275/cf744038476bd032bf33d40c71fce086.gif
A12:18:42 <Aeomin> ah
A12:18:46 <HAL9000> o_O
A12:19:06 <Aeomin> lol
A12:19:15 <b2s> what is that from?
A12:19:31 <HAL9000> Morrowind or Oblivion
A12:19:43 <b2s> ahhh
A12:19:46 <HAL9000> most likely Oblivion
A12:20:18 <culapou> I am port forwarding, and I am the part in the wireless network connections http://portforward.com/networking/winxp-tcpip.jpg
A12:20:25 <culapou> like that, but the numbers are blank
A12:20:54 <AndrewPH> I do believe you're doing it wrong.
A12:21:16 <culapou> ^ of course
A12:21:24 <AndrewPH> what is your router model
A12:21:29 <b2s> lol
A12:21:38 <HAL9000> just obtain an IP address automatically.
A12:22:24 <b2s> @HAL he's wondering how to port forward. :)
A12:22:37 <HAL9000> Then he's obviously in the wrong part.
A12:22:49 <b2s> indeed
A12:22:54 <HAL9000> That's network configuration in windows, not his router
A12:23:07 <AndrewPH> culapou, what's your router model
A12:23:39 <culapou> one sec
A12:24:08 <HAL9000> just tell him to go to http://www.port-forward.com
A12:24:15 <AndrewPH> I did
A12:24:19 <AndrewPH> he still managed to fuck up
A12:24:24 <culapou> WUSB54GS
A12:24:25 <HAL9000> seriously?
A12:24:31 <HAL9000> then he's beyond our help.
A12:24:35 <HAL9000> and should thus be shunned
A12:24:50 <Roadcrosser> i need to forward my port
A12:24:52 <culapou> I didn't mess up, just my numbers are blank
A12:25:02 <AndrewPH> culapou, you messed up
A12:25:06 <AndrewPH> that isn't how you port forward
A12:25:07 <AndrewPH> ...
A12:25:08 <AndrewPH> at all
A12:25:10 <Roadcrosser> but my model isnt in port-forward.com
A12:25:11 <AndrewPH> http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Linksys/WUSB54GS/WUSB54GSindex.htm
A12:25:21 <AndrewPH> Roadcrosser, use a similar model then
A12:25:27 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:25:34 <HAL9000> roadcrosser, what brand do you have?
A12:25:41 <culapou> http://portforward.com/networking/static-xp.htm
A12:25:44 <culapou> I have to do that first^^
A12:25:50 <AndrewPH> no
A12:25:51 <AndrewPH> you don't
A12:25:59 <HAL9000> you actually do that last
A12:26:04 <culapou> >:|

A12:26:40 <Roadcrosser> im busy now
A12:26:59 <culapou> the first line
A12:27:01 <culapou> To setup port forwarding on this router your computer needs to have a static ip address. Take a look at our Static IP Address guide to setup a static ip address. When you are finished setting up a static ip address, please come back to this page and enter the ip address you setup in the Static IP Address box below. 
A12:27:11 <mail2345> O_o
A12:27:12 <HAL9000> (>^_(>O_O>) surprise buttsecks
A12:27:12 <mail2345> T_T
A12:27:19 <AndrewPH> culapou, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
A12:27:19 <mail2345> ._.
A12:27:27 <culapou> It's the first line
A12:27:30 <AndrewPH> culapou, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
A12:27:31 <mail2345> @culpou ...
A12:27:31 <AndrewPH> culapou, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.

A12:28:03 <HAL9000> just shun culapou and be done with it
A12:28:15 <AndrewPH> no we need to murder and rape him
A12:28:20 <culapou> It's the first fucking line man
A12:28:25 <culapou> haha, what else should I do?
A12:28:27 <HAL9000> so you're into necrophilia?
A12:28:28 <AndrewPH> maybe you should listen to us
A12:28:34 <HAL9000> that explains everything
A12:28:36 <AndrewPH> instead of listening to the page that is so obviously wrong
A12:28:40 <mail2345> stat dat < live dat
A12:29:00 <mail2345> @andrew rem kratospie?
A12:29:04 <culapou> Fine then, I will ignore the site you sent me to, now what?
A12:29:06 <AndrewPH> mail2345, yeah?
A12:29:24 <AndrewPH> culapou, I sent you the link so you could click on the link of your router and read the instructions
A12:29:27 <AndrewPH> which you managed to not do

A12:30:06 <mail2345> mail2345: bored
A12:30:06 <AndrewPH> which is.. click on your router type
A12:30:07 <culapou> If you do not see the program you are forwarding ports for, be sure to visit our Default Guide for this router 
A12:30:19 <AndrewPH> just click on ANY guide
A12:30:25 <mail2345> culapou: listen: andrew
A12:30:26 <AndrewPH> You can use ANY port
A12:30:30 <culapou> I clicked the default guide

A12:30:51 <AndrewPH> I agree with hal
A12:30:58 <HAL9000> Such as D-Link, Linksys, etc
A12:31:07 <culapou> I am sorry for being subborn, I clicked the pokemon one 
A12:31:08 <HAL9000> we need to know that first
A12:31:13 <HAL9000> -_-
A12:31:13 <culapou> huuuugghhhh
A12:31:17 <mail2345> @culapou ...
A12:31:26 <AndrewPH> "That's wrong" "BUT IT TOLD ME TO DO IT" "ok" "I don't see minecraft" "click on a random one" "derpa durr I'm going to choose default and argue if that doesn't work."

A12:31:40 <culapou> Listen, I clicked the random one
A12:31:43 <TestDummy> If you catch my drift.
A12:31:45 <AndrewPH> You clicked on default
A12:31:47 <AndrewPH> that isn't random
A12:31:51 <AndrewPH> that's doing the wrong thing
A12:31:59 <culapou> No, I clicked pokemon

A12:32:24 <mail2345> culapou: not troll
A12:32:33 <AndrewPH> what the fuck is pokemon netbattle
A12:32:35 <HAL9000> Like I said, either highly retarded or a very skilled troll.
A12:32:52 <AndrewPH> culapou: very unskilled retard.
A12:33:09 <mail2345> hal9000: #minecraft: retards: greater than trolls
A12:33:23 <culapou> ok, so what now?
A12:33:28 <AndrewPH> mail2345: stop: talking: like: this: k: ?
A12:33:34 <AndrewPH> culapou, uhh.. follow the instructions
A12:33:37 <AndrewPH> it isn't that hard
A12:33:42 <culapou> and skip the first instruction?
A12:33:45 <AndrewPH> if you need me to piss on you, I'd be glad to
A12:33:51 <AndrewPH> that isn't an instruction
A12:33:55 <AndrewPH> it's telling you you need a static ip
A12:33:57 <culapou> It's an order
A12:33:58 <AndrewPH> which you probably have
A12:34:02 <HAL9000> I checked the mail today. Unfortunately it was all junk mail. I wish I'd get some real mail.
A12:34:02 <culapou> I don't
A12:34:09 <AndrewPH> IT DOESN'T MATTER TRY ANYWAY ASLDKJLSKDG
A12:34:15 <TestDummy> JOEPAJGPOEJAPGJEPOJAPOGJEAPOG'PWAEKGO
A12:34:19 <culapou> It does matter
A12:34:19 <TestDummy> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
A12:34:23 <AndrewPH> You only need an internal one
A12:34:29 <mail2345> WZAESXDTRRRFSGRHNBFEGRTHGFN
A12:34:29 <AndrewPH> if you don't have an external one big whoop
A12:34:33 <mail2345> ^^
A12:34:33 <TestDummy> Actually.
A12:34:49 <mail2345> external: expensive
A12:34:50 <HAL9000> So how do you like being highlighted all the time mail
A12:34:52 <TestDummy> What it's probably trying to get you to do is put yourself on the same subnet as the router, which really is silly seeing how it's a router
A12:35:03 <mail2345> hal9000: ...
A12:35:03 <AndrewPH> I'm living proof that you don't need a static ip to port forward.
A12:35:13 <HAL9000> As am i.
A12:35:20 <b2s> as am i, alos
A12:35:25 <culapou> Please enter the static ip you want to forward to: does this number matter?
A12:35:26 <mail2345> mail2345: proof
A12:35:40 <HAL9000> But without the living part.
A12:35:43 <AndrewPH> culapou, find your internal ip and stop acting like you know what you're doing.
A12:35:45 <Shadaez> AndrewPH i tihkn he's tlaking about internal static IP or something.
A12:35:49 <Shadaez> K AFK VEGAS 2
A12:35:52 <AndrewPH> Shadaez, we all are
A12:36:02 <culapou> HAHA, you think I'm acting like I know what I'm doing?
A12:36:07 <AndrewPH> Yes I do
A12:36:12 <b2s> ho hum...
A12:36:28 <mail2345> culapou: apparence: acting: doing: knowlage
A12:36:34 <AndrewPH> inteligance
A12:36:42 <culapou> Internal ip I can find using the command prompt right?, and once I find it what do I do with it?
A12:36:42 <Taco> You don't have it.
A12:36:50 <AndrewPH> use ipconfig /all
A12:36:52 <culapou> yeah
A12:36:55 <culapou> I know that
A12:36:55 <AndrewPH> and then piss all over your computer
A12:37:00 <AndrewPH> trust me it helps
A12:37:01 <culapou> what!?
A12:37:03 <culapou> really
A12:37:06 <culapou> ok
A12:37:06 <AndrewPH> then take a huge shit on the fan
A12:37:08 <culapou> but what part?
A12:37:11 <AndrewPH> then you won't have any issues
A12:37:11 <b2s> that is the ip you will forward the port to from your router
A12:37:26 <vede> Now just what in the goshdarn heck is goin' on here?
A12:37:26 <AndrewPH> don't forget to wedge your dick in the fan first
A12:37:42 <AndrewPH> culapou came in and couldn't follow port forwarding instructions
A12:37:45 <TestDummy> vede: Port Forwarding Gone Wild.
A12:37:46 <AndrewPH> we labeled him as an idiot
A12:37:51 <b2s> lol
A12:37:52 <AndrewPH> and here we are now
A12:37:58 <vede> Sexy.
A12:38:09 <HAL9000> Yes vede?
A12:38:13 <AndrewPH> wrong
A12:38:13 <AndrewPH> bad
A12:38:17 <AndrewPH> he was referring to me
A12:38:24 <mail2345> <Mr_Saturn> Diagnosing computer problems over IRC is like trying to diagnose brain cancer with a pointy stick
A12:38:25 <HAL9000> I don't think so.
A12:38:26 <culapou> my ip is: 192.168.1.101

A2:10:30 <Wareya> verily.
A2:10:34 <TrueWolves> I wish I could DoS those servers ;.;
A2:10:47 <HAL9000> Someone tried DOSing my server because I banned them.

A2:10:55 <HAL9000> so I banned their DoSing IP.

A2:11:49 <Wareya> I'm just making jokes
A2:11:51 <Wareya> lol
A2:11:51 <vede> I was on a server once, and the owner ("Kilroy") said it was for Minecraft staff only.
A2:12:04 <Wareya> lol
A2:12:14 <HAL9000> Minecraft staff only? There's only 1 MC staff to begin with
A2:12:19 <TrueWolves> 2
A2:12:20 <HAL9000> and that's Notch
A2:12:23 <TrueWolves> There's 2
A2:12:31 <HAL9000> I meant actual devving staff
A2:12:32 <Wareya> now there are
A2:12:34 <Super-Dot> Haha, you're as close to Minecraft staff as they're going to get
A2:12:36 <vede> He banned me after I told him to come over to the IRC and introduce himself to the community.
A2:12:42 <Wareya> lol
A2:12:52 <TrueWolves> haha
A2:12:59 <Wareya> did he?
A2:13:01 <vede> The server was called "Official Minecraft Server"
A2:13:03 <TrueWolves> who did Notch hire?
A2:13:07 <vede> No, he didn't.
A2:13:11 <Wareya> lol
A2:13:16 <Wareya> that makes it even better
A2:13:28 <vede> I was like, "So maybe you should come to the OFFICIAL Minecraft IRC channel!"
A2:13:31 <TrueWolves> He never hired anyone for sprite work?
A2:13:40 <Super-Dot> TrueWolves: He hired Dock
A2:13:43 <vede> Notch got Dock for art.
A2:13:49 <Super-Dot> The guy behind http://tumbledrop.com/
A2:13:56 <vede> So far, there have been three people involved with Minecraft.
A2:14:02 <vede> Notch, Dock, and C418.
A2:14:04 <TrueWolves> He ignored my resume ;.;
A2:14:13 <vede> Notch codes, Dock arts, and C418 musics.
A2:14:46 <vede> But yeah, if Kilroy ever did come to the IRC, I was just going to call him a retard and ban him.
A2:14:50 <TrueWolves> Notch don't like me, 3=, I pissed him off once way back in the earlier times of this channel.
A2:14:56 <Super-Dot> haha, vede 
A2:15:30 <TrueWolves> Vede, doooo eeeeet
A2:15:50 <vede> I came here and told everyone about it and mail2345 DoSed the server.
A2:16:27 <HAL9000> I want the MC client to play the music more often.
A2:16:40 <vede> HAL9000, just get the music and play it yourself.
A2:16:52 <vede> Easy as pie.
A2:16:52 <HAL9000> ehhh, Not worth it.
A2:16:57 <vede> Not worth it?
A2:17:03 <HAL9000> No.
A2:17:07 <vede> The whole process consists of copying some files.
A2:17:10 <HAL9000> Not enough music
A2:17:22 <HAL9000> MC needs more musical variety
A2:17:28 <vede> MC needs better music.
A2:17:35 <vede> And a sound engine that isn't defective.
A2:18:22 <TrueWolves> I just wish I could even listen to the music
A2:25:58 <vede> So yeah.

A2:51:07 <Spadge> ok i need a 256x256x128 - grassy (smallish) hills with possibly a larger hill in the middle area, my map is split up into a 10x10 grid so i need the areas to be pretty even except the middle
A2:51:29 <Spadge> should be pretty easy to make
A2:51:32 <Spadge> i could do it myself
A2:51:36 <Spadge> but im busy coding
A2:51:38 <TrueWolves> Ahh
A2:51:41 <TrueWolves> hmmm...
A2:51:50 <TrueWolves> 256/256/128 split on a 10x10 grid eh?
A2:51:57 <Spadge> thats what my map is :D
A2:52:09 <Spadge> each grid cell is a player
A2:52:16 <TrueWolves> 25.6 blocks a person?
A2:52:20 <Spadge> and they can only work in their zone or their allys zones
A2:52:31 <TrueWolves> welll...
A2:52:32 <Spadge> it will round down
A2:52:34 <TrueWolves> 25.6x25.6
A2:52:35 <TrueWolves> ahh

P12:26:09 <flipsnake> Alright, I'm not very intelligent when it comes to computers...but I just used a port checking program to check if port 80 is open. It says it's closed, yet I'm browsing the internet. Is something going on here?
P12:26:17 <Quatroking> nah
P12:26:28 <Quatroking> port 80 is used for http hosting, isn't it
P12:26:35 <laCour> yeah

P12:26:47 <Quatroking> and 21 for ftp
P12:26:47 <Marach> and 8080 sometimes
P12:26:51 <laCour> you dont need port 80 ever unless you are doing some local shit
P12:26:57 <laCour> 8080 = 80
P12:27:26 <Marach> and 25565... well you know

P12:54:09 <vede> It matters because it makes the forums seem extremely unprofessional, and any sort of "Official" forums should be as professional as possible.

P12:54:27 <Sean_TE> 2997 possible codes (I think)
P12:54:27 <Snowman> vede, the official minecraft forums aren't official

P1:01:49 <Marach> piriform apps are awesome
P1:01:54 <Snowman> What are the forums running on?
P1:01:57 <laCour> and citric changed the icons...
P1:02:00 <Quatroking> fluxbb
P1:02:17 <Quatroking> but to be more specific, the forums are running on Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny4 with Suhosin-Patch Server at www.minecraftforum.net Port 80
P1:02:17 <Snowman> ...
P1:02:22 <Snowman> I meant what OS
P1:02:25 <citricsquid> I explained
P1:02:30 <citricsquid> I accidentally overwrote the files

P1:02:39 <mail2345> overwrite D:
P1:02:41 <Snowman> Ctrl Z?
P1:02:47 <Snowman> It SHOULD work
P1:02:48 <Snowman> maybe
P1:02:58 <citricsquid> eh, doesn't matter anyway, only small shit
P1:03:15 <Marach> now go make PMs
P1:03:21 <citricsquid> no.
P1:03:24 <Snowman> Like PMs, medals and shit like that?
P1:03:28 <Marach> ok
P1:03:51 <Snowman> Seriously, how hard is it to import a existing PM service
P1:03:58 <citricsquid> it doesn't matter
P1:04:03 <Snowman> I am SURE there are other FluxBB forums with Pms
P1:04:09 <citricsquid> it doesn't matter
P1:04:16 <Snowman> It DOES matter
P1:04:19 <Snowman> We NEED pms
P1:04:19 <vede> I'm pretty sure almost everyone on the forums wants PMs.
P1:04:25 <vede> They would be EXTREMELY useful.
P1:04:28 <citricsquid> fine, i'll ruin the "surprise"
P1:04:30 <citricsquid> the forums are moving
P1:04:31 <citricsquid> fun over

P1:08:24 <vede> Guard, so, essentially, the forums are as they were a few months ago.
P1:08:29 <Zaratustra> vede! Right. OK.
P1:08:33 <Guard> does Notch know?
P1:08:37 <Quatroking> yeah except moderated.
P1:08:44 <Snowman> Notch almost never visits the forums
P1:08:47 <Zaratustra> minecraft is closed source right
P1:08:48 <Quatroking> nah
P1:08:51 <citricsquid> guard it doesn't matter?
P1:08:53 <Snowman> Also, did we lose posts and stuff?
P1:08:55 <citricsquid> Zaratustra: yes
P1:08:55 <vede> Yes it is, Zaratustra.

13P1:09:48 * Zaratustra ponders
P1:09:50 <vede> But Notch intends to make his own map format eventually.
P1:09:57 <ZomBuster> a more open format
P1:10:11 <Zaratustra> also, does anyone know of other editors like the minecraft client?
P1:10:17 <vede> Yeah, he'll make the map format open and somewhat simpler than it is now.
P1:10:20 <Marach> oman
P1:10:22 <Marach> omen
P1:10:35 <Zaratustra> omen is not at all -like- the minecraft client
P1:10:36 <Marach> generators like ZOMG
P1:10:46 <vede> No, Zaratustra.
P1:10:48 <Quatroking> When transferring to phpBB, we WILL keep our posts right?
P1:10:51 <Quatroking> and accounts
P1:10:58 <vede> No editors like the standard client exist.

P1:16:57 <vede> Hell, the forums were down for a long time because you didn't want to let someone give you the money to keep hosting them.
P1:17:37 <Marach> Quatroking: so you feel it too...

I did not stop anyone helping, I said I did not want to accept $1 donations from people, nobody (besides aera) offered any real help and when aera did (and I knew I couldn't) I accepted.

P1:18:26 <Quatroking> eh
P1:18:29 <Quatroking> hey citricsquid

P1:18:33 <Quatroking> citricsquid
P1:18:37 <citricsquid> what
P1:18:38 <vede> You said you wouldn't want Notch to foot the bill for the forum space.

P1:19:55 <vede> Yeah, fuck this.
P1:20:02 <vede> It's pointless to argue with you, citricsquid.

P2:11:00 <Animator> Around 20%.
P2:11:04 <Leonardo> I was close..
P2:11:10 <Leonardo> It had a 0 at the end.
P2:11:11 <citricsquid> i don't get how it takes a month to skin it, im slower than a retarded snail and i do shit faster.
P2:11:12 <Quatroking> is progress going fast?
P2:11:24 <Animator> It doesn't take a month to skin it.
P2:11:33 <Animator> It takes a month overall for the move.
P2:11:33 <byte[]> new obsidian server makin progress :3
P2:11:34 <Leonardo> Change the background and all that crap.
P2:11:42 <mail2345> no

P2:12:50 <Animator> And I don't have the CD. *hides eye-patch*

P2:43:32 <HAL9000> I however will say she's ugly.
P2:43:35 <HAL9000> Fugly even.
P2:43:53 <Snowman> She could kick my ass, just cause I don't punch women
P2:44:05 <Ashleigh> I'm suprised that it is Notch's sister though.
P2:44:17 <Ashleigh> I couldn't say there is a resemblance.

P2:46:31 <Ashleigh> We watched 1 movie.
P2:46:35 <HAL9000> That's called pro trolling.

P2:47:43 <Ashleigh> There was no lesbianism in there.
P2:47:45 <HAL9000> Even I have an affinity for slot b to slot b action.
P2:47:49 <Ashleigh> I didn't go down on her
P2:48:07 <mail2345> quatroking: what?
P2:48:08 <HAL9000> You just implied she went down on you.

P2:49:06 <Ashleigh> We didn't go down on eachother.
P2:49:08 <Snowman> It isn't gay when the balls aren't touching
P2:49:10 <HAL9000> So thus my logic is infallible.
P2:49:17 <Ashleigh> There was NOTHING SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC ABOUT IT.

P6:09:10 <riverchen> check port?
P6:10:03 <flipsnake> well...other people can connect to it.
P6:10:12 <riverchen> hmmm

P7:47:44 <Wolfgang> so mail what are you planning?
P7:47:56 <mail2345> i'm gonna get a list of his ports

P7:48:25 <Icenisse> indeed leonardo
P7:48:26 <VurtualRuler98> mail2345, check if the proper ports are open for an IRC network.
P7:48:27 <Aeomin> if he did not change IP and PC is on that is..
P7:48:38 <AlexVMiner> >:D
P7:48:39 <mail2345> if he doesn't have a router :D
P7:48:48 <AlexVMiner> so anyone want to chat on skype?
P7:48:49 <Aeomin> or router with DMZ on
P7:48:50 <VurtualRuler98> Then we can run an IRC network off his computer.
P7:48:53 <mail2345> heh
P7:48:59 <VurtualRuler98> That'd be funny.

P10:18:55 <mail2345> and the bulk of it is useless chat commands
P10:18:57 <Aeomin> well, what I'm trying to say is, massive code doesn't mean slow
P10:19:06 <mail2345> yea i know
P10:19:09 <Aeomin> less line of codes doesn't make it faster either

P11:19:36 <AndrewPH> that sounds good too
P11:19:44 <AndrewPH> I guess
P11:21:20 <Animator> Say mail. What did Psych do to push you over the edge?

P11:21:43 <mail2345> shit
P11:21:44 <derp> that's the exact error message from running the bat.
P11:21:46 <mail2345> leonardo
P11:21:47 <mail2345> is psych
P11:21:51 <PuyoDead> I think it was a combination of things that set everyone off.
P11:21:52 <mail2345> FFUUUU
P11:21:58 <AndrewPH> You're just figuring this out?
P11:21:59 <Animator> What?
P11:22:00 <gordenfreechmen> TENSO
P11:22:05 <mail2345> i just noticed
P11:22:25 <AndrewPH> I've known
P11:22:31 <AndrewPH> I haven't neccicarily cared
P11:22:35 <AndrewPH> nessicari
P11:22:36 <AndrewPH> whatever
P11:22:38 <Animator> Oh fuck, he was helping me with the skin.
10P11:22:39 * mail2345 is now known as mail2345|afk
P11:22:47 <mail2345|afk> i'm not upset that it's psych
P11:22:51 <mail2345|afk> i'm upset i didn't know
P11:22:56 <AndrewPH> ok
P11:22:58 <Animator> I'm upset it is Psych.
P11:23:05 <AndrewPH> I'm not why are you
P11:23:16 <mail2345|afk> if i had known
P11:23:17 <Animator> Because he was helping me with the new forum skin.
P11:23:20 <mail2345|afk> i could have messed with me
P11:23:22 <mail2345|afk> him*
P11:23:23 <mail2345|afk> badly
P11:23:36 <AndrewPH> We just trolled him beyond compare
P11:23:43 <AndrewPH> Right in front of him
P11:23:58 <AndrewPH> And the only possible consequence is getting banned from the most useless site on the internet
P11:24:04 <AndrewPH> I'm pretty satisfied.
P11:24:10 <vurtual> what site is this again?
P11:24:15 <AndrewPH> minecraftwiki
P11:24:30 <Animator> Yeah, I'm still gonna de-link the forums of that site.
P11:24:38 <Animator> It's useless.
P11:24:39 <vurtual> But does minecraftwiki have the ability to EXPOSED the Acai berry?
P11:25:04 <derp> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=13802#p13802 <-- that guy had the same problem as me
P11:25:11 <PuyoDead> He did a fine job of making the already nearly useless wiki totally useless. I don't see a need for a link to it anymore.
P11:25:15 <derp> with minecraft-server.jar not being found
P11:25:37 <vurtual> What will we do to teach people things?
P11:25:41 <Aeomin> spam email sometimes is fun to read
P11:25:46 <mail2345|afk> @aeomin no
P11:25:51 <mail2345|afk> what was realll fun spam
P11:25:58 <mail2345|afk> was the red tanga that showed more than it hid
10P11:26:04 * Howard is now known as Genisi
P11:26:04 <mail2345|afk> that shitty literotica
P11:26:24 <Aeomin> well, the one received asking to deliver an oven to russia
P11:26:32 <Aeomin> which would be around 100KG
P11:28:46 <vede> I should make one of those emails.
P11:28:49 <vede> Send it to one person.
P11:28:55 <Aeomin> people who believes in this would probably send money instead UPS an portable OVEN
P11:29:08 <vede> Say the prize is 1000 USD or something.
10P11:29:18 * mail2345|afk is now known as mail2345
P11:29:20 <vede> And then actually follow through with it if the person trusts me.
P11:29:37 <mail2345> i have an idea
P11:29:41 <mail2345> basically
P11:29:47 <AndrewPH> When psych comes back let's tell him he's a faggot
P11:29:53 <mail2345> you make a company selling penis enlargement pills
P11:29:59 <mail2345> then sue the hell out of all the spammers
P11:30:04 <mail2345> for defamation or something
P11:30:07 <AndrewPH> lol
P11:30:31 <vede> Seriously you guys.
P11:30:56 <vede> The Psych-hate is strong enough.
P11:30:57 <Aeomin> LOLO
P11:31:02 <vede> You can, like, stop now.
P11:31:03 <mail2345> you know what my goal on this channel is
P11:31:16 <AndrewPH> vede, you try spending 5 minutes with him
P11:31:18 <mail2345> my current goal is to trick on of the ops into making themself quit
P11:31:40 <vede> Take it to #psych_hate if you really need to bash him.
P11:32:02 <vede> Endlessly.
P11:32:22 <vede> I hate him A LOT as well, but it shouldn't dominate the channel like this.
P11:32:47 <mail2345> we have nothing else to do
P11:32:52 <mail2345> but eh
P11:32:57 <Visiiri> You can talk about steam
P11:33:00 <Visiiri> and good games on it
P11:33:03 <Visiiri> because I've got some cash
P11:34:27 <derp> visiiri!
P11:34:30 <derp> haven't seen you in a while
P11:34:43 <derp> what's up
P11:35:46 <Animator> Christ, A-Mall is full of douchebags.
P11:36:32 <Animator> All I do is enter the server, the op approaches me, I say, "Hello Human" jokingly and he takes it offensive and kicks me.
P11:36:34 <Archanos> Pretty much the entire new upper section list is like that
P11:37:06 <Animator> I return, I apolgize for the entire thing, the dude still is pissed off and deletes me into a pit.
P11:37:17 <Animator> Which I escaped.
P11:37:24 <Animator> Which I later got kicked for.
P11:38:03 <vurtual> Why do I hate psych again?
P11:38:03 <Animator> I've always wondered about the idea of a global moderator that watches over all servers.
P11:38:09 <AndrewPH> He's jewish
P11:38:13 <AndrewPH> in a bad way
P11:38:17 <AndrewPH> Not in a good way
P11:38:18 <Aeomin> bad idea Animator..
P11:38:50 <vurtual> Visiiri, anything valve, quake 3 arena, IL-2 Sturmovik, Evil Genius, Civilization IV, anything else on my gameslist.
P11:39:11 <Animator> That depends on who runs the position.
P11:39:25 <vurtual> Animator, there are two possible candidates.
P11:39:27 <Animator> The person would have to be nuetral on both parties.
P11:39:28 <Aeomin> well, how about compose a list of good servers
P11:39:30 <vurtual> The common people who have the time, but not the skill.
P11:39:32 <Aeomin> and list of..BAD?
P11:39:39 <vurtual> Then people like me, who have the skill, but not the time.
P11:39:54 <Animator> What about both?
P11:39:59 <Skillkills> Animator
P11:40:02 <vurtual> What?
P11:40:08 <vurtual> Do you... manage the horrible people?
P11:40:14 <Skillkills> I messed with my code the other day, so ti failed
P11:40:15 <vurtual> Turn them into extra limbs?
P11:40:20 <Skillkills> but i fixed it, you can come back
P11:40:21 <Skillkills> xD
P11:40:25 <Animator> Okay then.
P11:40:32 <Animator> I manage the horrible everyday.
P11:40:47 <vurtual> Animator, imagine being a leader of the clone army.
P11:40:49 <Animator> Anyway, yeah, A-Mall can go to hell.
P11:41:01 <Animator> I like the thought.
P11:41:02 <vurtual> But they're clones of whiny children on Xbox live who have a superiority complex.
10P11:41:04 * Spadge is now known as Spadge|AFK
P11:41:18 <Animator> Makes bashing them all the more funner, vurtual.
P11:41:21 <vurtual> Plus DNA from the worst people in the world is randomly inserted, and anyone you don't like.
P11:41:27 <vurtual> And they have the final say in everything.
P11:41:42 <vurtual> NOW DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU JUST ASKED FOR?
P11:41:47 <Animator> They don't have the final say. The Global Moderator has the final say.
P11:41:47 <vurtual> DO NOT EVER DO THAT AGAIN OKAY
P11:41:53 <vurtual> How can he stop them?

P11:42:09 <gordenfreechmen> i am server-flood almighty
P11:42:10 <gordenfreechmen> :)
P11:42:20 <vurtual> You'd need a dedicated person with such skills. But the force sensitive aren't jedi.
P11:42:25 <mail2345> heh
P11:42:30 <vurtual> Yes, manage a 2000 man game yourself.
P11:42:47 <derp> so mail, if i use the version of cMss from wom it works, but if i use the latest from pastebin it doesn't.. hm
P11:42:47 <vurtual> You quite literally can't organize such a system. There are laws of physics saying it can't be done.
P11:42:59 <mail2345> @derp i'm not sure why
P11:42:59 <Animator> I laugh at the laws of physics!
P11:43:08 <mail2345> I SPIT IN THE FACE OF GRAVITY
P11:43:18 <vurtual> Linux used egos and is a jedi order of sorts.
P11:43:22 <vurtual> Your spit falls short.
P11:43:39 <Skillkills> Gravity? You people are still affected by that? What a primitive race.
P11:43:41 <vurtual> Magnetism repels it, molecular forces stop it, and evade it.
P11:43:54 <vurtual> Skillkills, gravity affects any molecule no matter what.
P11:44:01 <vurtual> It's currently pretty much unexplainable beyond that.
P11:44:07 <vurtual> It just IS.
P11:44:08 <Skillkills> Fuck you il just go into python and import anti-grav
P11:44:14 <vurtual> You're just using another force.
P11:44:18 <Skillkills> xD
P11:44:30 <vurtual> No way to stop following one, or even resist it without using another.
P11:44:34 <TestDummy> Skillkills: Don't forget soul.

P11:44:58 <vurtual> Wait, why anti-grav?
P11:45:04 <mail2345> make sure to mix in ai.restricitons.laws.three
P11:45:05 <vede> vurtual, there are different nuances of the word "affect"
P11:45:43 <TestDummy> http://xkcd.com/326/
P11:45:45 <vurtual> You could go "for gravity return 0" and then import gravity, essentially making null gravity of your own.

P11:46:01 <vurtual> "affect" means to cause an effect, an effect is caused by something affecting something.

P11:46:19 <vede> vurtual, are you just trolling right now?
P11:46:23 <vurtual> no
P11:46:23 <vede> Because it seems like you are.
P11:46:35 <vurtual> Just being absolutely random and not having any care for what random people think.
P11:46:43 <vede> You think I don't fucking know the difference between "affect" and "effect"?
P11:47:00 <vurtual> No, but I'm pretty sure you don't know what a joke is yet.
P11:47:12 <vede> Your jokes suck, so stop.
P11:47:23 <TestDummy> i lol'd
P11:47:47 <mail2345> when you get used to the colors

P11:48:55 <vede> When a person says "You people are still affected by gravity? What a primitive race." and you reply with a short ramble about how gravity affects anything and we're still unsure of how it works, all it does is make you seem like a jackass.
P11:50:13 <PuyoDead> Your jokes do, indeed, suck.
