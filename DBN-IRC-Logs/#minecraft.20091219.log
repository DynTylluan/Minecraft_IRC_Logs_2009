P12:05:03 <mail2345> <eg0e> I saw the movie Hackers on tv last night and it was pretty impressive.  If I had any idea the file manager on a macintosh was a 3D city I would have bought one long ago!  Is there a similar file manager for XP that can do that?

P12:09:47 <Kratospie> Matrix? Realistic?
P12:09:51 <Aeomin> er...
P12:10:12 <Aeomin> movie is movie, I doubt it can be realistic
P12:10:35 <mail2345> well
P12:10:37 <bildramer> mail2345: sarcasm?
P12:10:42 <mail2345> closest to realistic
P12:10:45 <bildramer> oh :D
P12:10:47 <Kratospie> I guess the hacking was, but everything else
P12:10:52 <Ten_Tacles> yes
P12:10:54 <mail2345> yea
P12:10:57 <mail2345> they used nmap
P12:11:03 <bildramer> crap
P12:11:10 <mail2345> and some old ssh exploit

P12:12:42 <Visiiri> My hacks aren't working
P12:12:46 <Visiiri> I feel I have coded them right
P12:12:49 <Visiiri> but they crash java.
P12:12:50 <bildramer> I check the neighbors of the edge tiles...
P12:12:53 <Visiiri> I must've missed something.

P1:09:09 <bildramer> pretty much, yeah

P2:19:20 <mail2345> koit appears to think that he always judges right aparently
P2:19:33 <mail2345> unfortunatly he forgot that he is human
P2:19:37 <mail2345> and thus can make mistakes
P2:19:37 <Shadaez> And if he doesn't you could remove the name from the banlist
P2:20:28 <MonkeyDKS|COD4> Then it goes the other way and griefers get themselves a trusted name and remove their friends and alts from the list too
P2:21:01 <Shadaez> Nobody's making you use it.
P2:21:05 <Koitenshin> Use it or not, that's your choice.
P2:21:09 <mail2345> i know

P2:22:22 <Shadaez> Mail's just obnoxious.
P2:22:33 <MonkeyDKS|COD4> Except Mail's right

P2:34:41 <clone1018> But they were remodeling their structure
P2:34:42 <Koitenshin> It was a half-assed attempt then by people who never followed through.
P2:34:58 <PuyoDead> Yours won't be any different from the effort they tried.
P2:35:08 <PuyoDead> Simply because there's a flaw in the idea itself.

P2:38:27 <PuyoDead> Your list is working off the flawed idea that you and you only will be the one updating this list.
P2:38:31 <AndrewPH> This will crash and burn
10P2:38:32 * ecrider|away| is now known as ecrider
P2:38:34 <PuyoDead> People will not support that.
P2:38:40 <TheAlien> PARTY GOING ON HERE?
P2:38:43 <clone1018> Koitenshin okay.. a moderator(or admin idk) said no to post it on the forums. ANYWHERE. AgreE?
P2:38:44 <TheAlien> ... 
P2:38:47 <TheAlien> sorry for that
P2:38:51 <TheAlien> XD
P2:39:06 <AndrewPH> Koitenshin needs to shut up and go die in a hole.
P2:39:08 <clone1018> so how are you going to spread it
P2:39:17 <AndrewPH> Thank god for /ignore.
P2:39:22 <Koitenshin> Andrew, you really need to grow up.
P2:39:39 <clone1018> Koitenshin there is no way this will work
P2:39:54 <AndrewPH> Guys
P2:39:55 <clone1018> Because there is no way to spread it
P2:39:58 <AndrewPH> just stop feeding the troll
P2:39:58 <clone1018> to people
P2:39:59 <Koitenshin> Only because people will never realize that it should.
P2:40:18 <clone1018> I run 3 servers almost all the time
P2:40:26 <PuyoDead> There are fundamental flaws to the idea, in the way banned.txt works.
P2:40:26 <clone1018> I would never use it
P2:40:27 <Koitenshin> If a universal ban list is against the rules then a universal OP list should be as well.
13P2:40:30 * Marach agrees with AndrewPJ
P2:40:33 <Marach> PH*
P2:40:43 <serp> does the opencraft guys have an irc channel or a forum?
P2:40:45 <Marach> nope
P2:40:47 <clone1018> Koitenshin the UNIVERSAL OP LIST was making fun of you
P2:40:49 <PuyoDead> No idea.
P2:41:04 <Koitenshin> I meant Trusted Op list and you know it
P2:41:06 <Marach> its easier to say someone is griefer than trusted
P2:41:09 <PuyoDead> The op list is not the most supported/liked idea, but it's been there for many months with no problems.
P2:41:12 <clone1018> Okay
P2:41:16 <clone1018> The trusted op list
P2:41:35 <PuyoDead> And really, hardly anyone even bothers with it, for the same reason.
P2:41:36 <clone1018> is where you can check to see if a op could be trusted or not'
P2:41:59 <SMP> universal ban lists are silly, i got put on the first one that everyone took as gods word. Waay back at the beginning of MP. This leaves me banned on a load of servers for no reason.
P2:42:02 <Koitenshin> Why must you people be so naive?
P2:42:14 <PuyoDead> Why must you not think about the idea?
P2:42:24 <clone1018> Okay
P2:42:28 <TheAlien> a universal ban list is bad
P2:42:29 <clone1018> I have been banned before
P2:42:30 <Koitenshin> You mean why must I think about the idea
P2:42:34 <PuyoDead> Let me ask you this... who all will be contributing to the list?
P2:42:38 <clone1018> for trying to delete my own structure to remodel it
P2:42:41 <Marach> universal ban lists suck.
P2:42:48 <Koitenshin> PuyoDead, I am the only one compiling the list.
P2:42:49 <clone1018> I would be on that list
P2:43:02 <TheAlien> EVERYONE would be on the list
P2:43:04 <PuyoDead> Ok, so it's just you. Why should people trust you?
P2:43:05 <clone1018> and would not be able to play on 4/10 of the servers I love
P2:43:11 <clone1018> We would all be banned
P2:43:13 <TheAlien> bad OP's would put you on it
P2:43:14 <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, just get rid of the troll.
P2:43:16 <Koitenshin> I am only going by things personally eyewitnessed.
P2:43:24 <TheAlien> leaving everyone universaly banned
P2:43:24 <mail2345> actually
P2:43:25 <Koitenshin> I'm not trolling.
P2:43:27 <mail2345> i see his logic
P2:43:30 <PuyoDead> That doesn't answer the question.
P2:43:32 <clone1018> OKay
P2:43:35 <clone1018> OKay okay okay
P2:43:44 <mail2345> Koitenshin assumes he is a perfect eyewitness
P2:43:44 <clone1018> So we would have a ban list of what 15 people
P2:43:47 <mail2345> and is trustable
P2:43:58 <Koitenshin> I actually am trustable.
P2:44:01 <clone1018> Because its only made by Koitenshin
P2:44:03 <PuyoDead> But why?
P2:44:06 <clone1018> which is one man
P2:44:12 <PuyoDead> You can't just expect trust and respect.
P2:44:12 <mail2345> if he is perfect, then the banlist is a good idea
P2:44:14 <TheAlien> i sure think that there should be a list of *some* of the griefers
P2:44:20 <clone1018> I AM SORRY
P2:44:22 <TheAlien> but only the very bad
P2:44:25 <clone1018> YOU HAVE BEEN DEFEATED
P2:44:31 <TheAlien> the invisible and hacking
P2:44:32 <clone1018> PLEASE GO PLAY RUNESCAPE NOW
P2:44:43 <Koitenshin> I've never even played Runescape sorry
P2:44:46 <TheAlien> and by hacking i mean hacking into the server not flying
P2:44:51 <clone1018> Well its a stupid game
P2:44:54 <clone1018> for stupid people
P2:44:55 <PuyoDead> I'm still yet to get an answer.
P2:44:58 <clone1018> for you Koitenshin
P2:45:00 <Koitenshin> I'd rather play something like 4story, Gunz or laTale
P2:45:01 <clone1018> :D
P2:45:04 <Marach> woo Worms Armageddon on PSP ^_^
P2:45:04 <mail2345> @thealien ...
P2:45:10 <TheAlien> what?
P2:45:11 <mail2345> VANILLA SERVERS
P2:45:16 <mail2345> WITH VERIFY NAMES = TRUE
P2:45:17 <TheAlien> wha?
P2:45:17 <Koitenshin> An answer to what PuyoDead
P2:45:18 <mail2345> CANNOT BE HACKED
P2:45:20 <clone1018> okay go play anything other then minecraft
P2:45:22 <TheAlien> oh yeah i know
P2:45:23 <PuyoDead> Why should people trust your list?
P2:45:25 <mail2345> good
P2:45:29 <mail2345> k
P2:45:35 <mail2345> @puyo as i said
P2:45:41 <mail2345> the entire logic of his list
P2:45:46 <Koitenshin> They don't have to use it if they don't want to. It's up to them.
P2:45:53 <mail2345> is based off the assumtion that he is a perfect eye witness
P2:45:54 <Quatroking_> I smell drama
P2:45:58 <Quatroking_> also
10P2:45:59 * Quatroking_ is now known as Quatroking
P2:46:02 <PuyoDead> Quatro: stale drama.
P2:46:06 <Quatroking> fuck internet
P2:46:07 <Shadaez> Honestly, ban list is a good idea. There should be a way to appeal a ban, though, And if you are banned more than once, then the time between appeals should increase.
P2:46:12 <mail2345> honestly
P2:46:15 <mail2345> this debate
P2:46:16 <Koitenshin> Yeah quatro, a lot of people have ignored me for suggesting a ban list made of griefers
P2:46:16 <Shadaez> You don't have to use it, so get over it.
P2:46:17 <mail2345> cannot happen
P2:46:19 <TheAlien> hmm well yeah if the list is made by a single person it would work
P2:46:20 <PuyoDead> Shadaez, that's flawed.
P2:46:24 <Koitenshin> only on servers with verify-names=true
P2:46:30 <mail2345> as we both have diffrent beliefs as to how good of an op koitishin is
P2:46:34 <mail2345> both sides*
P2:46:43 <PuyoDead> If someone is unfairly added, and removed from the list, they don't get removed from everyone else's pasted list.
P2:46:43 <Quatroking> hmm
P2:46:48 <mail2345> ^^
P2:46:50 <mail2345> puyo is right
P2:46:53 <Marach> when people will understand universal ban lists never work as expected?
P2:46:55 <Shadaez> No he's not.
P2:47:01 <PuyoDead> Marach, never.
P2:47:03 <TheAlien> someone (can't remember who) had an idea some time back on the forum. A list of how many servers have you banned
P2:47:04 <Shadaez> I'm not just saying to just add the names to all your banlists.
P2:47:04 <mail2345> @shadez what is the issue with his reasoning?
P2:47:05 <Marach> univerdal ban list is like communism
P2:47:05 <Koitenshin> If I was allowed a forum post.
P2:47:12 <Koitenshin> I could update everyone with the news
P2:47:14 <mail2345> PEOPLE ARE GULLIBLE
P2:47:16 <Shadaez> I will be syncing mine to it if it's ever available.
P2:47:21 <mail2345> so they will add stuff
P2:47:21 <PuyoDead> Shadaez, that's what people do. Why else would this list exist?
P2:47:22 <mail2345> and then forget
P2:47:40 <PuyoDead> There is no built in way to sync at the moment.
P2:47:45 <Koitenshin> Well Marach, isn't a Community supposed to help each other?
P2:47:49 <Quatroking> you know what
P2:47:54 <Quatroking> let me sum this debate up
P2:47:55 <Quatroking> http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/12/35220481577-orig.jpg
P2:47:55 <PuyoDead> You have to take ideas like this at the very lowest vanilla level.
P2:47:56 <Marach> yes
P2:47:58 <Shadaez> DIdn't say there was. There is no built-in super-ban list either.
P2:48:04 <Marach> not ban each other
P2:48:09 <Shadaez> It's easily done with Winscp, though, and likely with other programs.
P2:48:15 <TheAlien> exactly quatroking
P2:48:19 <Koitenshin> No Quatroking I'm not trolling.
P2:48:22 <Koitenshin> I'm being serious
P2:48:30 <mail2345> hrm
P2:48:30 <Quatroking> Did I ever say I was
P2:48:32 <PuyoDead> Easily? Do you think everyone can do that?
P2:48:34 <mail2345> a sync tool is possible
P2:48:36 <Quatroking> or you were
P2:48:36 <mail2345> however
P2:48:37 <clone1018> Quatroking 3
P2:48:39 <Quatroking> eh
P2:48:41 <clone1018> <3*
P2:48:41 <Quatroking> thing
P2:48:42 <mail2345> a decently powerful server is needed
P2:48:45 <Nalok> Imma play Survival in the Archives :D
P2:48:49 <Shadaez> Lol
P2:48:50 <Marach> Quatroking: good job
P2:48:53 <Shadaez> No it isn't.
P2:48:57 <TheAlien> survival in the archives?
P2:49:04 <PuyoDead> Look, underlying point here being, if you want to go with this piss poor idea, don't do it on the forums.
P2:49:18 <Jat> a universal ban list can not work ever... it is not an opinion it is a fact...
P2:49:26 <AndrewPH> http://i49.tinypic.com/211s9b6.jpg
P2:49:27 <Shadaez> You guys are just throwing it out without thinking.
13P2:49:30 * PuyoDead points to the pile of attempted lists.
P2:49:34 <Jat> it has been suggested many times before
P2:49:35 <Nalok> Basically take the survival .jar and paste in the regular minecraft folder
P2:49:36 <Quatroking> we did think
P2:49:44 <Quatroking> hey guys
P2:49:51 <AlexVMiner> >:D
P2:49:55 <PuyoDead> I've lost count of how many times someone has tried this. And better, at that.
P2:49:55 <Quatroking> I PROPOSE WE PUT A BAN LIST UP FOR PEOPLE WHO KEEP DISCUSSING THIS SHIT
P2:49:55 <Koitenshin> Okay then....let's talk about this.
P2:50:07 <Shadaez> Okay, well if Koitanshin fails, I will do it better.
P2:50:10 <Koitenshin> What do you guys think it would take to make a universal ban list work?
P2:50:13 <Jat> lol
P2:50:17 <Jat> it can not work
P2:50:19 <Jat> ever
P2:50:20 <AndrewPH> Shadaez, no you won't This is exactly what happens every time.
P2:50:21 <Jat> it is impossible
P2:50:23 <SMP> there is nothing that can make it work
P2:50:24 <AndrewPH> Somebody tries
P2:50:24 <Marach> its impossible
P2:50:25 <AndrewPH> they fail
P2:50:25 <clone1018> oh my fucking god
P2:50:26 <Shadaez> I will host an FTP server and create a script that will syncronize the two, and there will be an appeal process.
P2:50:27 <Marach> i know
P2:50:27 <AndrewPH> somebody else tries
P2:50:28 <clone1018> I am leaving 
P2:50:29 <AndrewPH> they fail too.
P2:50:30 <clone1018> This is shit
10P2:50:38 * redk95 (Mibbit@ip72-218-63-83.hr.hr.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
P2:50:38 <mail2345> @sshades
P2:50:47 <mail2345> how well will the ftp server preform
P2:50:49 <Marach> vids of people griefing
P2:50:50 <Shadaez> I highly doubt anyone has done it that way. 
P2:50:54 <Marach> that would work
P2:50:58 <Quatroking> C418, Drakkar, PuyoDead, Siiseli, vede ding ding ding drama alert
P2:50:59 <Koitenshin> See, no one can discuss this without immediately throwing it out.
P2:51:00 <Shadaez> The idea is a good one, the way it is implemented is bad.
P2:51:03 <PuyoDead> It would take a change in how banned.txt works. It would need a built in syncing measure. But most of all, it would take a perfect method for detecting bannable offenses, which is impossible.
P2:51:12 <AndrewPH> redk95 nobody wants to play on your server. Don't advertise in here, it's annoying.
P2:51:13 <TheAlien> How about koitenshin go make the list... We'll all let it fail by itself (or have succes?) and then go all "I TOLD YOU SO I TOLD YOU SO I TOLD YOU SO"
P2:51:21 <clone1018> Any stupid fucker that uses a ban list
P2:51:24 <clone1018> Is lazy as shit
P2:51:31 <Quatroking> same goes for oplist
P2:51:42 <Koitenshin> If they would let me make a thread, and only update it myself. Then I might be able to.
P2:51:43 <AlexVMiner> anyone willing to host a server with 64 people?
P2:51:43 <PuyoDead> I'm not a fan of that op list, either.
P2:51:47 <mail2345> idea
P2:51:49 <Quatroking> I'm op on many servers without even knowing the servers let alone the people who made it
P2:51:51 <Koitenshin> Thank you Puyo.
P2:51:51 <AlexVMiner> mail
P2:51:52 <mail2345> we let koitshin make is thread
P2:51:53 <mail2345> and then
P2:51:54 <Koitenshin> We agree on something
P2:51:56 <PuyoDead> You will not make a thread.
P2:51:56 <mail2345> when it all fails
P2:52:01 <mail2345> we get to laugh at him
P2:52:05 <TheAlien> why can't you just make a thread koitenshin?
P2:52:06 <mail2345> and taunt him in the topic
P2:52:08 <clone1018> Koitenshin it is aginst the forum rules
P2:52:11 <clone1018> Deal with it
P2:52:11 <AlexVMiner> can you host a server for about 2 hours with room for 64 people?
P2:52:16 <clone1018> I can
P2:52:19 <clone1018> But I am full
P2:52:22 <Shadaez> Please learn to type in one sentance ffs, it's spammy enough in here.
P2:52:23 <clone1018> :(
P2:52:30 <clone1018> No thanks
P2:52:31 <mail2345> guys, what do you think of the idea of making a thread so we can laugh at him when it fails?
P2:52:38 <mail2345> letting him*
P2:52:39 <Koitenshin> See, Quatro would be a good eyewitness then
P2:52:40 <PuyoDead> Nope.
P2:52:41 <clone1018> I like the way
P2:52:45 <AlexVMiner> who fails?
P2:52:45 <clone1018> Shatner talks
P2:52:45 <TheAlien> exacly mail
P2:52:46 <Marach> good idea.
P2:52:49 <redk95> i need help on my servr i want to use hacks just to help me look for hackers no where else and when i try to use it i get a message java.lang.nullpointerexeption any help
P2:52:53 <Quatroking> what
P2:52:56 <Quatroking> what did I do now
P2:53:00 <AlexVMiner> who is gonna fail?
P2:53:01 <mail2345> @redk95 uhh
P2:53:06 <mail2345> you are having problems with
P2:53:07 <Quatroking> Koitenshin, what
P2:53:08 <Siiseli> what alert
P2:53:09 <Siiseli> where
P2:53:09 <mail2345> null pointers
P2:53:10 <PuyoDead> redk95, #wom
P2:53:11 <Koitenshin> You said you're an OP on many servers
P2:53:16 <Quatroking> siiseli, banlist discussion
P2:53:16 <AlexVMiner> bildramer
P2:53:18 <TheAlien> alex a banned list will fail
P2:53:19 <Jat> there are far too many dumb things going on in this channel at once
P2:53:19 <PuyoDead> Siiseli, no biggie.
12P2:53:22 * BananaBot (BananaBot@75-175-22-53.ptld.qwest.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
P2:53:24 <AlexVMiner> give me your server software bildramer
P2:53:28 <redk95> and im sorry i advertised i need to go somewhere i wondt again sorry i didnt know it bothered you
P2:53:30 <Quatroking> no biggie just ban half the channel damnit
P2:53:32 <AlexVMiner> zip it and put it on mediafire
P2:53:34 <PuyoDead> Just another ban list battle.
P2:53:44 <Siiseli> okay
P2:53:49 <AlexVMiner> don't ban me :3
12P2:53:52 * Marach (marach@188-93-163-103.home.aster.pl) Quit (Quit: Colloquy for iPhone!)
P2:53:53 <redk95> what do i do with the null pointers? what exactly are they
P2:53:54 <Siiseli> stop whining, ban list is how it is
P2:53:58 <Koitenshin> I asked everyone what they think it would take for a ban list to actually work
P2:54:02 <mail2345> @redk95 they are pointers
P2:54:03 <Siiseli> redk95, it's when you're trying to point nowhere
P2:54:03 <Koitenshin> and only PuyoDead answered
P2:54:05 <mail2345> that are null
12P2:54:08 * redk95 (Mibbit@ip72-218-63-83.hr.hr.cox.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P2:54:08 <Koitenshin> I'm not surprised about this
P2:54:10 <Siiseli> redk95, are you programming?
P2:54:16 <Jat> there is nothing that can make a universal ba list work
P2:54:18 <Jat> ever
P2:54:20 <mail2345> koit i answered that you would need controlls
P2:54:24 <PuyoDead> Nothing out of hand, just people unable to combine their statement into one sentence.
10P2:54:24 * redk95 (Mibbit@ip72-218-63-83.hr.hr.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
P2:54:24 <mail2345> lots of controlls
P2:54:25 <Siiseli> Jat, how come
P2:54:25 <AlexVMiner> why did notch make it so only 32 slots can be on a server?
P2:54:27 <Koitenshin> at least PuyoDead and I are taking this seriously
P2:54:28 <mail2345> tons of controlls
P2:54:35 <Siiseli> okay Jat now that I think about it
P2:54:37 <Shadaez> You're all throwing out the idea because the way it has been implemented before didn't work.
P2:54:38 <Siiseli> you're right
P2:54:49 <clone1018> AlexVMiner the memory would overload at more then that
P2:54:50 <Jat> no matter what people try to suggest there are more flaws
P2:54:56 <AndrewPH> Shadaez, It has happened a LOT before. It was a fail every single time.
P2:54:57 <AlexVMiner> ok
P2:55:01 <PuyoDead> Koitenshin, don't get me wrong, I would love such a list, if it were currently possible. But the way in which bans work now, it simply can't work correctly.
P2:55:03 <Jat> each thing people try to suggestt to fix the flaws introduyces more flaws
P2:55:05 <redk95> so what do i do sorry? if im bothering you ill leave
P2:55:11 <Quatroking> can we discuss something else
P2:55:19 <clone1018> Yes
P2:55:24 <Shadaez> @AndrewPH and how has it been implemented before?
P2:55:24 <clone1018> Lets discuss...
P2:55:29 <AlexVMiner> anyone have ANY server software that can hold 64 people?
P2:55:30 <Quatroking> I'm used to the usual 200% off-topic chat here
P2:55:32 <AndrewPH> Pretty similarly to this.
P2:55:37 <Koitenshin> I know Puyo, I won't post about it on the forums. But I'm not sure why I can't post that I'm working on one in my signature.
P2:55:38 <Quatroking> not some gay banlist shit that rages everywhere
P2:55:40 <clone1018> magical trevor
P2:55:42 <clone1018> :D
P2:55:43 <mail2345> guys
P2:55:43 <AndrewPH> "lol i maek banlist it am universal k"
P2:55:44 <mail2345> as i said
P2:55:46 <Shadaez> Was it synchronized with an appeal process?
P2:55:50 <Graham> opencraft could hold 64 AlexVMiner
P2:55:54 <mail2345> let koitishin do it, and watch everything fail
P2:55:59 <AlexVMiner> i know garham
P2:55:59 <mail2345> then we get to laugh at him
P2:56:00 <redk95> anyone?
P2:56:03 <TheAlien> Anyways: Have anyone seen iguana or animator around?
P2:56:04 <AlexVMiner> but i can't change the map
P2:56:06 <mail2345> and change his fourm title to banlist idiot
P2:56:11 <AlexVMiner> *graham
P2:56:12 <PuyoDead> Look, I'll make you a deal. Stick it in your sig. But the second I see a post of someone complaining about it, it goes.
P2:56:18 <Graham> yeah it doesn't have map support quite yet :P
P2:56:29 <clone1018> http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/magical+trevor/
P2:56:31 <clone1018> LISTEN
P2:56:31 <PuyoDead> Ban lists are like the worst kind of tender for flames,
P2:56:35 <clone1018> AND STOP THE FIGHTING
P2:56:37 <clone1018> :D
P2:56:42 <AlexVMiner> well i need a server with a flatgrass that can hold 64 people
P2:56:43 <Koitenshin> Puyo, someone would already complain about it just so my signature wouldnt be there
P2:56:46 <Koitenshin> and that would be mail
P2:56:53 <mail2345> by complain
P2:56:57 <redk95> allrite bye thanks for the help anyway
P2:56:57 <AlexVMiner> oh everybody just SHUT UP
P2:56:58 <mail2345> he means somboddy who was banned
P2:57:05 <mail2345> not theoretical complaints
P2:57:06 <PuyoDead> I mean complaining about them being unfairly banned across multiple participating servers.
P2:57:07 <Graham> I can get a version of opencraft that makes a flatgrass map to you if you give me a little bit of time
P2:57:18 <AlexVMiner> Graham, you have 2 hours
P2:57:20 <Shadaez> @puyoDead and then they can appeal it :)
P2:57:23 <Jat> i will only say one more thing
P2:57:29 <Jat> and who will handle the appeals? and how? and why should the people given the power to control such things have that power? and what about people who dont know about the appeal process or the fact that they can appeal or the existence of the banlist or why all of a sudden they cant join half of the minecraft servers they see?
12P2:57:31 * redk95 (Mibbit@ip72-218-63-83.hr.hr.cox.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P2:57:53 <PuyoDead> Looks like Koitenshin will be the only one doing appeals.
10P2:58:01 * TestDummy is now known as TD|Away
P2:58:03 <Ten_Tacles> WTF 600 fps?
P2:58:04 <AlexVMiner> I really want Notch to delete KNOWN griefer accounts
P2:58:12 <AlexVMiner> like eddeddy0
P2:58:14 <Shadaez> I'm pretty sure the appeal thing was my idea; I've been doing it on my server and it has been successful.
P2:58:14 <mail2345> @alex that acomplishes nothing
P2:58:19 <Ten_Tacles> yes
P2:58:22 <mail2345> as they get a new account
P2:58:27 <PuyoDead> Alex, if he makes some form of inactive account removal, that might work.
P2:58:28 <AlexVMiner> and ban their ips from the game
P2:58:30 <clone1018> Yes because... we need to make ONE person god of all of our servers
P2:58:37 <clone1018> capable of banning even us
P2:58:40 <clone1018> from out own servers
P2:58:41 <Shadaez> Never said anything about one person.
P2:58:41 <Koitenshin> No clone you don't.
P2:58:52 <Koitenshin> I would never add you guys to my ban list.
P2:58:56 <PuyoDead> Shadaez, that's the only way it can work.
P2:58:58 <Ten_Tacles> notch is op on every server i thinkl
P2:59:00 <Shadaez> If you don't like it, don't use it. It may or may not be successful.
P2:59:00 <Koitenshin> Unless I witnessed malicious griefing.
P2:59:00 <clone1018> What if I greifed
P2:59:06 <mail2345> okay
P2:59:09 <mail2345> lets let him do it
P2:59:10 <PuyoDead> Otherwise, you get conflicting opinions/reasons.
P2:59:12 <AlexVMiner> Graham , are you coding the thing?
P2:59:13 <mail2345> and watch it fail
P2:59:13 <Koitenshin> Tentacle grape, he isnt an OP on mine.
10P2:59:14 * emgmod (chatzilla@cpe-66-8-168-193.hawaii.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P2:59:19 <Graham> yeah I am alex
P2:59:22 <AlexVMiner> :D
P2:59:26 <Shadaez> Oh I guess the court system doesn't work either.
P2:59:29 <AlexVMiner> <3
P2:59:32 <Graham> i have a flatgrass in the version i'm about to commit anyway
P2:59:38 <Jat> actually the court system very often does not work
P2:59:40 <AlexVMiner> :D :D :D
P2:59:45 <clone1018> Why don't we just vote for a Minecraft god
P2:59:46 <Graham> plus i'll add something in to force your name to op since we don't have op support complete yet
P2:59:48 <mail2345> coruts in rl
P2:59:54 <Shadaez> Whatever.
P2:59:56 <mail2345> will work better than courts in internet
P3:00:02 <Koitenshin> -_-
P3:00:04 <Jat> but they still often work quite poorly
P3:00:07 <mail2345> due to various factors
P3:00:10 <Koitenshin> Why can't you people discuss this calmly?
P3:00:12 <mail2345> eg, actualy punishment
P3:00:15 <Shadaez> I just think you guys are basing the failure on past attempts, which have not been thought through as much.
P3:00:21 <PuyoDead> Koitenshin, look around you :/
P3:00:31 <TheAlien> yeah koitenshin... lot of hate in here
P3:00:34 <mail2345> i think you guys are baseing your idea on the assumption that you can't make mistakes
P3:00:40 <Koitenshin> Puyo, I'm glad you're discussing this calmly.
P3:00:43 <mail2345> and that people are aware of the list
P3:00:52 <PuyoDead> Shadaez, that's kind of the problem, they have been attempted very well before, and still got ugly.
P3:01:08 <vede> Pretty much *everyone* who tries something like a global banlist or something similar says that there way is better and will work.
P3:01:14 <vede> Seriously.
P3:01:19 <Shadaez> Links?
P3:01:20 <Koitenshin> mail, do you OP on any servers?
P3:01:24 <mail2345> @koit yes
P3:01:28 <vede> Go check the forums.
P3:01:28 <Koitenshin> besdies theones?
P3:01:33 <Koitenshin> *besides
P3:01:35 <Jat> koi when did you start playing minecraft?
P3:01:41 <mail2345> sometimes chariots
P3:01:44 <Koitenshin> from the beginning
P3:01:44 <AlexVMiner> Graham , can i have your babies?
P3:01:48 <TheAlien> well i'd say let koitenshin try... if it fails, then be it. if not, cool we got a working ban list
P3:01:48 <mail2345> i do maintaince work on evilgrim's
P3:01:48 <Jat> oh ok
P3:01:48 <PuyoDead> Someone gets banned unfairly (such as an op who bans for "he insulted us"), and they get banned everywhere.
P3:01:56 <Jat> i dont ermember seeing you around here much before recently
P3:02:02 <Koitenshin> I watched the other ban lists rise and fall
P3:02:05 <mail2345> anyway
P3:02:08 <Koitenshin> And I figured out why they did
P3:02:16 <mail2345> i'm convinced now that this debate will solve nothing
P3:02:24 <mail2345> let him make it and see what happens
P3:02:27 <Koitenshin> Too many people moderating a list, and too many people not actually witnessing
P3:02:36 <TheAlien> exactly
P3:02:37 <Koitenshin> only hearsay
P3:02:46 <vede> Ban lists are unnecessary anyway.
P3:02:47 <PuyoDead> And entirely too many people banning for "he was annoying".
P3:02:54 <Koitenshin> Like I said.
P3:03:02 <TheAlien> it should be a small respected group moderating the ban list
P3:03:05 <Koitenshin> The list I am working on is ONLY griefers.
P3:03:10 <Jat> :|
P3:03:18 <PuyoDead> Plus, you have to differentiate between griefing/trolling/spamming/etc.
P3:03:21 <AlexVMiner> I ban people for not being banned quick enough
P3:03:21 <AlexVMiner> jk
P3:03:22 <vede> Yeah, pretty much everyone says THEIRS is only griefers.
P3:03:24 <Koitenshin> banning idiots should be up to the server owner
P3:03:29 <clone1018> I ban idiots
P3:03:31 <emgmod> What if they decide not to grief anymore?
P3:03:34 <SMP> i think you're missing our point koit
P3:03:35 <Jat> lol clone
P3:03:36 <vede> I ban for lots of things.
P3:03:39 <mail2345> emgmod has an excelent point
P3:03:43 <mail2345> what if the griefer stops?
P3:03:44 <AlexVMiner> I ban who I feel like, mostly asshats and griefers
P3:03:49 <TheAlien> lol emgmod
P3:03:49 <Koitenshin> I actually have a notebook list beside me of names/IPs/reasonss they were banned
P3:03:56 <clone1018> CAN I BUILD (when the server says when you join "Register at our site URL to build")
P3:03:58 <mail2345> @koit what if the griefer stops?
P3:04:03 <Ten_Tacles> can someone ban koitenshin please?
P3:04:05 <TheAlien> oh wait like that
P3:04:05 <TheAlien> XD
13P3:04:07 * mail2345 bans people for not being banned
P3:04:10 <TheAlien> what?
P3:04:12 <Koitenshin> if they change, then they can be removed from list
P3:04:16 <vede> Stupidity, bad grammar/spelling, ugly buildings in some cases, even.
P3:04:25 <mail2345> @koit but past evidence
P3:04:29 <emgmod> vede: lol at ugly buildings
P3:04:31 <mail2345> will come back and haunt them
P3:04:43 <TheAlien> the ban list should only be for the VERY bad cases of griefers
P3:04:45 <Koitenshin> Ten_Tacles why do you want me banned?
P3:04:47 <TheAlien> not all griefers
P3:04:49 <vede> Sometimes, building ugly things is just as bad as griefing.
P3:04:52 <clone1018> Your annoying
P3:04:52 <Koitenshin> I'm being serious in my discussion
P3:04:53 <Shadaez> You guys win, it would fail because nobody would ever implement the system I'm thinking of - it would be thrown out.
P3:04:56 <TheAlien> tre strikes and you're on the list?
P3:04:58 <clone1018> You have clearly lost the fight
P3:05:03 <emgmod> How about a TOL like griefer list?
P3:05:03 <clone1018> Yet you continue on
P3:05:11 <mail2345> okay
10P3:05:11 * BL|jonnyabc is now known as jonnyabc
P3:05:13 <mail2345> guys
P3:05:18 <mail2345> debating will go nowhere
P3:05:20 <vede> I don't like TOL either.
P3:05:28 <Jat> i have a feeling notch would not like universal banlists
P3:05:29 <mail2345> lets just demonstrate to him why it;s a bad idea
P3:05:30 <Jat> just so you know
P3:05:32 <TheAlien> im starting to support koitenshin
P3:05:35 <AlexVMiner> how about we all shut up and solve my problems?
P3:05:38 <AlexVMiner> jk
P3:05:48 <Jat> whats your problems alex? theyre probably more interesting
P3:05:50 <AlexVMiner> I support koitenshin
P3:05:54 <Shadaez> eff I want to continue
P3:05:59 <vede> I still have only two ops. Myself and my friend, and he doesn't even have internet.
P3:06:03 <TheAlien> it w-o-u-l-d work... but trusted people needed to run the list
P3:06:04 <Jat> i have no problem with koitenshin trying what he wants to do
P3:06:12 <Jat> however i have no confidence that he will succeed
13P3:06:15 * mail2345 decides this debate is going nowhere
P3:06:19 <AlexVMiner> Jat, I am trying to find server software that can host 64 people, but Graham is making it i think
P3:06:24 <Jat> oh ok
P3:06:27 <Jat> whos graham?
P3:06:32 <emgmod> How about we keep separate banlists, and we share them only with people who want to exchange lists?
P3:06:33 <Koitenshin> Jat, I'm not sure it would succeed myself. But I think it is worth a try.
P3:06:33 <Quatroking> puyodead?
P3:06:33 <AlexVMiner> a user here?

P3:06:50 <Quatroking> puyodead you thererere
P3:06:50 <Jat> lol perl
P3:06:52 <mail2345> everything catches on fire
P3:06:54 <mail2345> and burns
P3:06:55 <mail2345> and dies
P3:07:01 <emgmod> Pretty much.
P3:07:03 <bildramer> ;/
P3:07:05 <Jat> anyway go ahead and try it if you want koi
P3:07:09 <Quatroking> ._.
P3:07:10 <AlexVMiner> I need it in less then 2 hours, and it has to be free and easy
P3:07:12 <TheAlien> whoever moderates the list should be someone who's "known" on the forum
P3:07:20 <Jat> but youll probably find it very difficult to get people to adopt your list
P3:07:22 <vede> How about the only way bans can be propagated is by word of mouth?
P3:07:22 <TheAlien> puyodead or someone like that
P3:07:23 <AlexVMiner> I say I should moderate the list
12P3:07:26 * SMP (SMP@68-114-62-5.dhcp.davl.vt.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P3:07:27 <AlexVMiner> Who votes me?
P3:07:27 <Quatroking> TheAlien, sasukecrafter
P3:07:31 <Koitenshin> I say you shouldn't
P3:07:34 <TheAlien> yeah
P3:07:34 <AlexVMiner> lul
P3:07:35 <bildramer> still talking about the list?
P3:07:36 <vede> So if you join a server and see someone join who you banned or saw banned, you can tell the ops.
P3:07:36 <Quatroking> woot
P3:07:43 <vede> So the ops can watch them and whatever.
P3:07:50 <vede> OHWAIT, that's how it is already.
P3:07:50 <emgmod> I do that.
P3:07:54 <TheAlien> sasuke, alexvminer, puyo, and quatro as startes
P3:07:56 <AlexVMiner> boxxy!
P3:07:57 <TheAlien> *starters
P3:08:01 <vede> We're okay the way we are.
P3:08:04 <TheAlien> and emg
P3:08:04 <Quatroking> don't forget bob ross
P3:08:11 <Jat> the only thing i would consider worth using as a universal banlist is a list of known proxy ips and those are already available online
P3:08:14 <emgmod> Who?
P3:08:14 <AlexVMiner> Wait, people whon are banned, or are watching it?
12P3:08:22 * Madrick (butts2@22-39.97-97.tampabay.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
P3:08:26 <Quatroking> and some random guy who only signed up to beg a premmy
P3:08:35 <AlexVMiner> Because if it is people who are banned, sasuke definitely
P3:08:42 <AlexVMiner> if it is watchers, not sasuke
P3:08:53 <PuyoDead> Whoa, wait, what?
P3:08:55 <Shadaez> All the servers, in the system I'm thinking of, would have a script / custom server. If you were banned on the server because of the banlist then you would be told "You are banned, if you feel you wre unfairly banned please appeal at *websitename*". This wouldn't be UNIVERSAL it would just be if you adopt it. There would still be plenty of available servers. All of the bans would have reasons as well.
P3:09:01 <Quatroking> puyodead, can I use this pic as siggie: sasukecrafter
P3:09:05 <Quatroking> lol copyfail
P3:09:09 <PuyoDead> I just went to make some PB&J, and I'm all notified.
P3:09:14 <Quatroking> this one: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/hax.png
P3:09:22 <Quatroking> its 700x150
P3:09:28 <Shadaez> Only trusted servers would be able to add to the list.
P3:09:29 <Quatroking> is that too big or just okay?
P3:09:30 <Jat> ive got such a filthy mind
P3:09:32 <Koitenshin> Shadaez I think that would require custom server software.
P3:09:34 <AlexVMiner> lol quatro
P3:09:37 <AlexVMiner> that is SO true
P3:09:39 <Jat> i rearranged those letters and came up with BJ&P
P3:09:40 <Shadaez> read the fist line.
P3:09:43 <vede> Koitenshin, no it wouldn't.
P3:10:01 <Koitenshin> I meant for the message they get
P3:10:03 <Shadaez> That is my idea, so stop saying "BUT WHAT IF THEY ISDNT KNOW ABOUT IT!!!"
P3:10:05 <vede> But either way, it's still pretty much useless.
P3:10:21 <PuyoDead> It'll trim it to 80 height.
P3:10:25 <TheAlien> actually everything about minecraft is typical the internet = A WHOLE LOT OF HATE, FLAMMING, TROLLING AND BULLSHIT
P3:10:28 <Quatroking> waat
P3:10:35 <Quatroking> 80 pixels height is a bullshit height D:
13P3:10:45 * Jat has a feeling someone will decide to adopt the list and then jus tban everyone from their server who joins to screw them over
P3:10:46 <Koitenshin> I don't troll, bullshit, hate or flame.
P3:10:50 <Koitenshin> About anything.
P3:10:57 <TheAlien> no but everyone does
P3:10:59 <PuyoDead> Don't yell at me, I didn't set it :/

P3:11:08 <Shadaez> 90 height is fine, you don't need a huge banner.
P3:11:10 <Shadaez> 80&
P3:11:10 <Quatroking> nuu it looks like crap now
P3:11:13 <Quatroking> D:
P3:11:17 <TheAlien> *we didn't start the flame war*
P3:11:25 <Shadaez> Then you post "hi" and your post is huge because of the giant sig.
P3:11:38 <Koitenshin> I'm not everyone, which is why I think it would work.
P3:11:49 <TheAlien> nvm
P3:12:02 <TheAlien> koitenshin... go make the thread on the forum
P3:12:09 <TheAlien> give it a shot
P3:12:10 <Koitenshin> Does anyone on this server OP beside me who wishes to contribute then?
13P3:12:12 * PuyoDead slaps TheAlien
P3:12:12 <Shadaez> Honestly I'd like to try the system out but I feel like you all would throw it out before it has been proven or unproven and it COUDLN't get anywhere because of the hate.
P3:12:15 <TheAlien> lets see how it ends
P3:12:17 <Jat> you mean channel?
P3:12:20 <Koitenshin> that was quick puyo
13P3:12:22 * TheAlien is hurt
P3:12:32 <Quatroking> k resized it
P3:12:34 <TheAlien> why puyo?
P3:12:45 <PuyoDead> Forums rules.
P3:12:50 <Koitenshin> because you told me to post a thread
P3:12:54 <Koitenshin> and he said not to
P3:13:03 <AlexVMiner> >:D
P3:13:11 <TheAlien> ehm i think i missed the part where puyo told you not to
P3:13:15 <vede> Too many have been tried and they're unnecessary in the first place.
P3:13:16 <TheAlien> ... oh i suck
P3:13:24 <Koitenshin> I am allowed to post about it in my signature however. so thats good.
P3:13:30 <PuyoDead> While it's not specifically against the rules to make a post -about- it, I can tell you now exactly how it will go.
P3:13:38 <Jat> i have an idea
P3:13:43 <Quatroking> ffs fluxbb doesn't even support the [center] bbcode
P3:13:54 <Ten_Tacles> what are you talking about now?
P3:13:56 <Quatroking> why the hell do we use this primitive pice of shit anyways
P3:14:01 <Quatroking> *pice
P3:14:05 <Quatroking> *piece
P3:14:05 <PuyoDead> It also doesn't support [img=sizexsize]
P3:14:12 <Quatroking> ._.
P3:14:14 <TheAlien> puyodead... thats now the point... the point is that he wants to try, and you won't let him 
P3:14:18 <TheAlien> amirite?
P3:14:25 <vede> Quatroking, because citricsquid fails at website.
P3:14:27 <Quatroking> code and quote tags are also not allowed in siggies
P3:14:29 <PuyoDead> The point is that ban lists are not allowed on the forums.
P3:14:33 <TheAlien> oh
P3:14:39 <TheAlien> i kinda missed that
P3:14:39 <Quatroking> oh look at me, i'm citricsquid, i'm so good at websites
13P3:14:48 * TheAlien slaps himself

P3:14:58 <TheAlien> yeah

13P3:15:19 * Quatroking slaps citricsquid
P3:15:26 <TheAlien> but allthough you know how it will end does it really matter?
P3:15:32 <Koitenshin> I made a post in a thread before about it
P3:15:34 <TheAlien> he wants to try.
P3:15:38 <Koitenshin> it was closed quickly
P3:15:39 <Koitenshin> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4594
P3:16:12 <derp> how do i disallow building on my server?
P3:16:19 <Quatroking> say
P3:16:30 <Quatroking> does anyone besides citricsquid have access to the forum admin panel
P3:16:46 <PuyoDead> I think ez.
P3:16:48 <TheAlien> aw man screw all this ban list stuff... its against the forums rules to suggest it so lets cut it out until more people like the idea
P3:16:58 <Quatroking> jawdrop if she doesn't have access
P3:17:31 <Jat> who is ez anway?

P3:20:22 <Quatroking> yeah
P3:20:35 <bildramer> of course I'm not gonna distribute anything about how to do it
P3:20:38 <PuyoDead> Because a lot of it is trashed for being straight illegal
P3:20:50 <bildramer> but really
P3:20:50 <Quatroking> then don't put the illegal shit in the hall of shame
P3:20:53 <Quatroking> helloooo
P3:20:56 <bildramer> all you need is a hex editor
P3:21:05 <Koitenshin> really bildramer?
P3:21:08 <PuyoDead> That would require work to be done on the forums... you know how that goes.

P3:21:54 <mail2345> or the trolling stuff
P3:21:58 <mail2345> but the stupid stuff
P3:22:01 <vede> Work on the forums means asking citricsquid to do anything which means that it's not only going to never happen, but citricsquid will become a massive dickbag for a few weeks.
P3:22:07 <Koitenshin> that will make OPping easier on servers with -hax but not +ophax
P3:22:16 <Snowman> ez owns the forums now, ask her
P3:22:21 <Koitenshin> I swear more servers need +ophax
P3:22:25 <Quatroking> she does?
P3:22:36 <Quatroking> I love the way we never get to hear about forum administration
P3:22:40 <Snowman> Yeah, he gave up on the community right?
P3:22:55 <Quatroking> well yeah
P3:22:57 <yeshyeshnosh> i want to hack but everytime i do i get a message- null.lang.pointerexeption whats wrong how can if fix it?

P3:27:14 <bildramer> just make hacks disabled by default anyway
P3:27:18 <clone1018> We can say it has NOCLIP hacks
P3:27:19 <TheAlien> theyre running the thing
P3:27:22 <bildramer> so, even in +hax
P3:27:27 <bildramer> no hax at all
P3:27:29 <clone1018> and it actually has KEYLOGGER hacks D:
P3:27:32 <clone1018> :D*

P3:28:07 <clone1018> :D
P3:28:11 <Snowman> I really want to make a hack client just to hide a virus in it
P3:28:19 <Snowman> And fuck up a lot of people's computers
P3:28:24 <clone1018> Oh I got it
P3:28:25 <bildramer> so, disable all hacks, distribute as default
P3:28:25 <Koitenshin> clone, have it instaly delete system32 silently
P3:28:28 <Ten_Tacles> how mean snowman
P3:28:30 <bildramer> e.g.
P3:28:32 <derp> can someone help me?

P3:28:37 <Koitenshin> then when they restart or shut down
P3:28:39 <bildramer> ANNOUNCEMENT: HACKS MANDATORY
P3:28:39 <clone1018> It adds a entry into the hosts file
P3:28:39 <Koitenshin> system fails
P3:28:40 <bildramer> :P
P3:28:40 <vede> Koitenshin, not everyone has a system32

P3:28:49 <Ten_Tacles> koitenshin SUCKS
P3:28:50 <TheAlien> nah man don't destroy hackers stuff... just make the file kill itself in 24 hours
P3:28:50 <mail2345> we make hacks
P3:28:51 <clone1018> That makes minecraft.net redirect to 127.0.0.1
P3:28:52 <mail2345> that modify
P3:28:52 <Koitenshin> fine vede
P3:28:58 <Koitenshin> sector by sector HDD wipe
P3:28:58 <mail2345> erm
P3:28:59 <mail2345> vede

P3:29:09 <bildramer> ....
P3:29:14 <bildramer> pay-per-minute? :D
P3:29:18 <mail2345> we should just make the hack

P3:29:23 <TheAlien> haha
P3:29:25 <mail2345> make the person unable to play minecraft
P3:29:28 <mail2345> maybe cripple java
P3:29:28 <Ten_Tacles> i think i miss something
P3:29:29 <TheAlien> yeah
P3:29:30 <bildramer> whatever, the point is just disabling hacks
P3:29:30 <clone1018> Ohh and we cam CHARGE for the virus hacks!
P3:29:33 <bildramer> so it's only a client
P3:29:40 <clone1018> can*

P3:42:28 <bildramer> WELL, DUH.
P3:42:30 <derp> well
P3:42:44 <vede> AlexVMiner, we answer!
P3:42:56 <vede> And cMss has a crapton of dependencies.
P3:43:02 <derp> i don't know why in such a community that is minecraft there would be such closed source software
P3:43:09 <derp> i mean, the entire idea of minecraft is working together
P3:43:11 <clone1018> Because
P3:43:13 <derp> calloborating
P3:43:15 <clone1018> Its in alpha
P3:43:17 <derp> sp
P3:43:29 <AlexVMiner> MineCraft isn't a collab
P3:43:33 <AlexVMiner> it is all made by Notch
P3:43:37 <PuyoDead> Because that's what the developer wants, perhaps?
P3:43:38 <vede> Honestly, that's because Notch seems to really, really not like the idea of anything in Minecraft not being something he made.
P3:43:38 <AlexVMiner> with smart people editing it
P3:44:04 <derp> hm
P3:44:08 <Shadaez> say dislike, that was confusing to read D:
P3:44:08 <PuyoDead> At this stage, I don't blame him.
P3:44:14 <vede> And this isn't about closed source or open source, derp.
P3:44:22 <PuyoDead> Later on, during/after beta, not so much.
P3:44:25 <vede> This is about Minecraft and not-Minecraft.
P3:44:29 <Shadaez> "not like the idea of not being something he made"
P3:44:47 <PuyoDead> Yea, crazy idea, huh Shadaez?
P3:44:47 <derp> alright
P3:44:53 <derp> so all i'm really getting out of this is
P3:44:54 <clone1018> So I tried to gift myself 
P3:44:55 <clone1018> :(
P3:44:59 <PuyoDead> Someone not like something they make to not be their own?
P3:45:00 <Shadaez> It's confusing to read.
P3:45:03 <derp> that i need to give this notch fellow a sexual favor
P3:45:10 <derp> and then i can disable building on my server
P3:45:13 <Shadaez> I agree with him, I was just saying its hard to read.
P3:45:14 <mail2345> notch is straight
P3:45:16 <mail2345> silly
P3:45:17 <derp> is that about the jist of it?
P3:45:54 <Shadaez> I don't use hacks and I only want a custom sever to make some scripts with... He's going to add plugin support someday anyhow, I thought.

P3:46:13 <PuyoDead> He plans on Lua support, but we've no idea how far it will cover.
P3:46:16 <vede> Shadaez, you don't need a custom server to do scripting.
P3:46:20 <PuyoDead> Nor when we'll get it.
P3:46:22 <bildramer> So...
P3:46:27 <derp> ok
P3:46:27 <AlexVMiner> there is no way I can successfully host a server with 64 people?
P3:46:29 <derp> disabling building
P3:46:33 <derp> doesn't seem like such a hard script
P3:46:41 <vede> I have my own server script, and I only use the standard server.
P3:46:41 <AlexVMiner> where there is banning and solid and ops and MAP SAVING?!
P3:46:45 <derp> i know a decent amount of programming
P3:46:45 <bildramer> If you want whatever custom features, make your own game
P3:46:48 <derp> where can i get started?
P3:46:54 <clone1018> AlexVMiner dude
P3:47:01 <Shadaez> vede, what how?
P3:47:07 <clone1018> Most clients can handle that much
P3:47:10 <bildramer> it's as simple as a 3D array with a function to change blocks :P

P4:37:58 <clone1018> paint.net
P4:38:00 <Koitenshin> photoshop
P4:38:06 <Koitenshin> version 7
P4:38:07 <AndyFm> fail
P4:38:09 <PuyoDead> Paint.net and GIMP are both free and powerful.
P4:38:11 <AndyFm> <.<
P4:38:11 <Koitenshin> none of this CS shit
P4:38:12 <clone1018> Free: paint.net 
P4:38:16 <clone1018> Paid: photoshop
P4:38:17 <Shadaez> photoshop, Gimp is the best free one.
P4:38:21 <Snowman> HIMP
P4:38:22 <Snowman> GIMP
P4:38:23 <bildramer> MS PAINT
P4:38:27 <clone1018> gimp has aids
P4:38:33 <Koitenshin> XD
P4:38:34 <Snowman> No it doesn; t
P4:38:40 <clone1018> Sure it does
P4:38:44 <Snowman> How so?
P4:38:48 <clone1018> Its ugly
P4:38:51 <PuyoDead> GIMP has a nasty case of fugly UI, but it works well.
P4:39:01 <clone1018> Exactly
P4:39:11 <Snowman> It isn't fugly, you just gotta learn how to use it
P4:39:17 <PuyoDead> No, no, it's fugly.
P4:39:23 <Quatroking> yep.
P4:39:30 <PuyoDead> Using it isn't really difficult.
P4:39:31 <Quatroking> flash ftw
P4:39:35 <Quatroking> well
P4:39:36 <bildramer> Gimp: needs a new UI
P4:39:39 <MarkF> isn't there a mod for the gimp that gives it an interface similiar to photoshop?
P4:39:47 <Quatroking> I've tried gimp many times and I still haven't figured out how to draw a line
P4:39:53 <bildramer> Paint.NET: needs MOAR
P4:40:01 <PuyoDead> I saw a screenshot of someone who made it have a single window, but that was a while ago.

P4:40:46 <TestDummy> lol gimp
P4:40:58 <Shadaez> Paint.net has terrible tablet support, theirfore it isn't as good as gimp.
P4:40:59 <Aexis> That's a rather interesting analogy...
P4:40:59 <Koitenshin> I like using GIMP myself.
P4:41:09 <Koitenshin> Anything I need, it's within easy reach.
P4:41:16 <TestDummy> Does anybody know what a gimp is?

P6:26:40 <derp> wait
P6:26:48 <derp> you're checking for ports in a timer loop?

P6:26:52 <clone1018|smacx> Yes
P6:26:56 <derp> why
P6:27:00 <clone1018|smacx> Because
P6:27:08 <clone1018|smacx> idk how to do it any other way lol
P6:27:20 <derp> what are you trying to do exactly?
P6:27:35 <clone1018|smacx> the program checks for open ports on x ip
P6:27:38 <clone1018|smacx> Well
P6:27:48 <derp> you know
P6:27:51 <derp> there are websites to do this
P6:27:53 <clone1018|smacx> Checks for open ports through a range
P6:27:57 <clone1018|smacx> I don't care?
P6:28:00 <derp> ok
P6:28:11 <derp> so why do you need a timer loop for this?
P6:28:19 <derp> why not just a single function call to check all available prots
P6:28:20 <derp> ports*
P6:28:38 <clone1018|smacx> Because it checks a range and it has a stop and start button

P6:29:23 <derp> alright

P8:23:56 <vede> This channel will not help you with custom servers.
P8:23:58 <LG_Legacy> So i can't remember why i banned you or when, or even if i did at all.
P8:24:08 <Skittles> I joined theone's and i yelled in caps "I JUST GOT ADMIN ON THE ARCHIVES!"
P8:24:11 <Skittles> and you banned me
P8:24:16 <Skittles> a friend sent me the log
P8:24:19 <LG_Legacy> Ah right..
P8:24:20 <Koitenshin> caps is bad
P8:24:22 <Skittles> LG_Legacy banned Skittles!
P8:24:22 <LG_Legacy> Advertisement i think
P8:24:23 <PuyoDead> Not familiar whatsoever.
P8:24:24 <Koitenshin> in ANY server
P8:24:28 <SMP> you got admin in the archives? oh my....
P8:24:32 <vede> Maybe if you weren't such a dumbass, you wouldn't have been banned.
P8:24:39 <LG_Legacy> You broke two of our rules
P8:24:43 <LG_Legacy> A. Advertisement B. Caps
P8:24:43 <Wolfram> The punishment hardly fits the crime.

P8:24:48 <LG_Legacy> However
P8:24:48 <Skittles> Advertisement?
P8:24:52 <LG_Legacy> Thats 'not' enough for a ban
P8:24:52 <Wolfram> No warning, no nothing? Banned for capslock?
P8:24:53 <Skittles> Please,
P8:24:56 <Skittles> kiss my ass.
P8:25:00 <LG_Legacy> You must of done something stupid to get banned
P8:25:05 <LG_Legacy> Cause i don't just ban automatically.
P8:25:06 <Skittles> must have

P11:31:31 <Zedd> Hey Cial
P11:31:36 <Zedd> You show me a PC game
P11:31:43 <Zedd> I'll show you a way to play it on OS X
P11:31:49 <AndrewPH> gta4
P11:31:50 <AndrewPH> go
P11:31:59 <Koitenshin> XD
P11:32:28 <Zedd> Is that available over the Steam store?
P11:32:29 <Koitenshin> Zedd you have your answer now go.
P11:32:46 <AndrewPH> Search for it
P11:32:51 <AndrewPH> if it doesn't turn up...
P11:33:03 <AndrewPH> Although it should matter.
P11:33:07 <AndrewPH> shouldn't, rather.
P11:33:34 <Zedd> Yep.
13P11:33:44 * Cial rolls eyes
P11:33:49 <Zedd> And it does matter, because one of the easiest ways comes through the Steam store
P11:33:54 <Zedd> CoG
P11:33:59 <Zedd> I run my steam games on Mac
P11:34:05 <Zedd> A titch buggy in some ways
P11:34:16 <Zedd> But I can run TF2, Max Payne, my Half Life games
P11:34:17 <clone1018> mac == :(
P11:34:22 <AndrewPH> It doesn't matter if it's on steam, you'd probably be able to run it either way.
P11:34:23 <Zedd> Et cetera
P11:34:27 <Zedd> mac == :D
P11:34:35 <clone1018> mac == :(
P11:34:40 <Zedd> No, steam just makes it easier, and is my first choice.
P11:34:54 <Zedd> clone1018, someone swapped your 1's & 0's
P11:35:11 <AndrewPH> if($mac==1) {echo "You should go die"} else {echo "Have a cookie!"};
P11:35:33 <Zedd> CoG, great software, works a little better than it might..
P11:35:38 <Zedd> Yah, your's too.
P11:36:04 <AndrewPH> What about my's?
P11:36:17 <Zedd> Your statement is wrong.
P11:36:34 <AndrewPH> I'm too lazy to fix it
P11:36:39 <AndrewPH> I don't care if it will run.
P11:36:43 <Zedd> That's a suitable answer.
P11:37:02 <AndrewPH> Have fun getting a gaming mac for under $5,000 :)
P11:37:11 <Zedd> My Mac cost $1,100.
P11:37:12 <Zedd> :D
P11:37:19 <AndrewPH> My computer costs $500
P11:37:25 <clone1018> My laptop costs 600
P11:37:26 <AndrewPH> $700 with OS
P11:37:32 <Koitenshin> My computer was free
P11:37:33 <clone1018> and can do everything yours can
P11:37:40 <clone1018> + more
P11:37:41 <Zedd> No, it can't, clone1018.
P11:37:45 <AndrewPH> My computer can do everything your mac can do except waaaay better
P11:37:47 <clone1018> Yes it can
P11:37:50 <Zedd> I can run anything Windows can.
P11:37:56 <Zedd> Plus I run my Mac stuff.
P11:38:01 <Zedd> I win. :D Thanks for playing.
P11:38:07 <clone1018> Your nto allowed to use a windows emulator silly
P11:38:08 <clone1018> :P
P11:38:12 <clone1018> not*
P11:38:13 <Zedd> I don't use an emulator!
P11:38:18 <Zedd> Well, yes for SNES
P11:38:18 <clone1018> Sure
P11:38:21 <Koitenshin> He probably has one of those new macs
P11:38:22 <AndrewPH> Zedd, macintosh. you just lost the game.
P11:38:22 <clone1018> EXACTLY
P11:38:24 <Zedd> But that has zip to do with windows
P11:38:27 <Koitenshin> that actually can run windows
P11:38:30 <Zedd> No.
P11:38:33 <Zedd> No boot camp.
P11:38:35 <Zedd> No thank you.
P11:38:39 <AndrewPH> Hey zedd
P11:38:41 <AndrewPH> the game
P11:38:43 <Zedd> No parallels, no emulation.
P11:39:00 <Zedd> AndrewPH, the game is about doing everything better, it's mine. :D

P11:39:34 <AndrewPH> Why I dislike macfags: They think they're smart and all, but they really know nothing.
P11:39:43 <Zedd> CoG isn't emulation. And that's baseless.
P11:39:45 <AndrewPH> Example: The Game isn't in reference to your fail.
P11:39:59 <Zedd> Linux fags, though, go attack them all you like. 
P11:40:15 <clone1018> Linux can whip the shit out of Mac
13P11:40:18 * Zedd yawns
P11:40:20 <Zedd> Yes it can.
P11:40:23 <AndrewPH> Linux can run anything windows can
P11:40:26 <Zedd> But it's an eyesore and it's terrible.
P11:40:27 <Visiiri> I think I've done it!
