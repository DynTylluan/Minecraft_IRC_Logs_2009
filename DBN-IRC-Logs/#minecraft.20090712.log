A12:00:22 <Adura> *Red balls
A12:00:25 <Kinhoshi> I've also heard that :P
A12:00:38 <Lmaoboat> If you finish painting, feel free to test it on the new version of my map :D
A12:01:10 <Lmaoboat> I'm always begg- ...looking for a host
A12:03:28 <Eagle> A host? You can't host your own?
A12:03:47 <Lmaoboat> No D:
A12:03:54 <Eagle> Butbutbut
A12:03:58 <Eagle> it's so eeeaasssyy
A12:04:22 <Lmaoboat> Lost router password, don't want to reset it because I don't know enough aabout networks to fix anyting that might go wrong
12A12:04:23 * Animator (Ohnoaspy@adsl-144-246-234.mia.bellsouth.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:04:35 <Eagle> linksys?
A12:04:47 <Eagle> the default password is admin, you know.
A12:05:01 <Adura> Rather than blank?
10A12:05:23 * Super-Dot (Super-Dot@adsl-76-236-71-94.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:05:24 <Eagle> Well, for some routers, the password is blank, and the username is admin
A12:05:34 <Eagle> For some, the password is admin, and the user is blank. :/
A12:06:02 <Lmaoboat> Password was changed from default
A12:06:15 <Eagle> Blasphemy
A12:06:35 <Lmaoboat> Aparently someone might have stolen our itnernet or something
A12:07:07 <Eagle> Egads!
A12:08:59 <Lmaoboat> SO I'm stuck begging for people to test my maps
A12:09:18 <JTE> Your innernets have been stolen? How terrible.
A12:09:26 <Eagle> No
A12:09:31 <Eagle> His itnernet was stolen.
A12:09:34 <JTE> :( I cannot use server_level.dat
A12:09:54 <Lmaoboat> what's-huh?
A12:10:27 <Eagle> Well, JTE, that's because you had to screw Notch and make your own server code!
A12:10:33 <Adura> It's part of his code being his own.
A12:10:34 <Eagle> ...XD
A12:10:51 <Lmaoboat> I changed my map so that gravel/sand and the top layer of wood is now grass
A12:11:26 <Adura> I changed my map so the grass and stone is random colour vomit.
A12:11:41 <Eagle> I remember that kind of map.
A12:11:48 <JTE> That's the big downside to my server, is that I haven't bothered to find a way of loading the necessary variables from the file representing a compressed instance of a Java class containing level data.
A12:12:06 <Eagle> Well then, bother to find a way. :P
A12:12:14 <JTE> I will. Eventually.
A12:12:16 <JTE> For now, paint.
A12:12:23 <Adura> I have most of the crap down on the file structure.
A12:13:15 <Adura> But, want to limit my script's scewing with level files with the amount of time it'd take.
A12:13:29 <Adura> Since everyone loves huge levels.
A12:13:29 <JTE> All I need are the blocks, the map size, and the spawn position and rotation. It's just easier for me to get those by logging into a server as a perl bot and totatlly stealing it all from the packets.
10A12:13:48 * Wolfram (Mibbit@host-208-82-42-143.energize.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:13:57 <JTE> And yeah, Perl is terrible for dealing with everyone's huge levels. X_x;
A12:14:09 <JTE> That's the ooone bad part. Just the one. :<
A12:15:07 <Wolfram> Ah, JTE. Nice work with that mega server script
A12:15:18 <yoshibot> what's the general sentiment about mega client scripts? bad? good?
A12:15:58 <Adura> If you piss off people, bad.
A12:16:21 <Wolfram> I think Notch's dev blog said it was fine to modify your own server
A12:16:38 <Wolfram> But he didn't want anyone doing anything so drastic that it took away from the original project
A12:16:39 <Adura> Flying around on other people's servers would be bad manners.
A12:17:11 <yoshibot> so, just a simple minecraft chatbot wouldn't be taken well?
A12:17:43 <Adura> Well, if you bring it to a server and it's spammy to the Ops...
A12:17:59 <Adura> It'd get banned, which isn't that bad.
A12:18:04 <yoshibot> i'm not in the business of spending hours on programming just to grief people. :|
A12:18:07 <Wolfram> If you do it on your own server exclusively, I don't think anyone would mind
A12:18:15 <Wolfram> But I can't really speak for anyone but myself
A12:18:20 <Adura> They'd just leave if they don't like it.
A12:18:42 <Adura> The concern would be a client  hack that does things that are generally considered hacking.
A12:18:51 <Adura> Flying, noclip...
A12:18:59 <Adura> Teleportation.
A12:19:01 <Wolfram> I'm really concerned about that kind of thing
A12:19:21 <Wolfram> I mean, it would be pretty easy for some asshole to essentially steal the project
A12:19:52 <Adura> Minecraft, sure.
A12:20:17 <Wolfram> If something like that happened and put a serious dent in purchases, it could derail the whole operation
A12:20:23 <yoshibot> yeah... it's only been in existence for a month so far.
A12:20:29 <Wolfram> Worst-case scenario, of course
A12:20:48 <Wolfram> Closer to two months, I think
A12:21:02 <yoshibot> still relatively young for a project of this scope.
A12:21:42 <Wolfram> First dev blog post is May 13
A12:22:04 <Wolfram> But yeah, young indeed
A12:22:13 <Wolfram> I'm still shocked by how fast it moves along sometimes
A12:22:42 <Wolfram> I came in at the four-blocks-floating-landmass stage, then I moved
A12:22:47 <Wolfram> Two weeks later my internet is finally installed in my new apartment
A12:22:54 <Wolfram> And it's like a new game
A12:23:23 <Wolfram> Multiplayer, water/lava/ore, trees and leaves

A12:24:50 <Lmaoboat> Remember the crappy looking plant he had in 4 block stage?
A12:27:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, that same exact plant as is still in the game?
10A12:28:35 * Parthon (cheeeese@124-169-82-40.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:28:55 <Lmaoboat> You think the plant we have now is ugly?
A12:28:57 <Lmaoboat> http://cubicworlds.net/museum/gallery/zolyx-49.png
A12:29:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, well, it's the same plant...
A12:29:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Just the color changed up.
12A12:29:38 * Eagle (BLELELEL@c-24-56-241-140.customer.broadstripe.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:29:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And I've actually kind of found myself wanting to play the first MC version I played (0.0.10 or 0.0.11 I think) where the level generator could make HUUUUUGE cliffs and mountains, and you could run off the edge of the map and such.
A12:30:02 <Lmaoboat> I even made a floating island in 40block version http://cubicworlds.net/museum/gallery/lmaoboat-2.jpg
A12:30:27 <vdgmprgrmr> And there was no water and mobs were randomly placed...
A12:30:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I made three or four of those classic precariously-perched-scary-castles back then.
10A12:31:41 * yihff (anonymous@99-184-199-115.lightspeed.wepbfl.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:31:53 <Lmaoboat> There should be map types that have no edge, like the early game, or something like a skybox
A12:32:18 <vdgmprgrmr>  /agree
A12:32:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, apparently Minecraft has reached the point where other games can be described as "like Minecraft".

A12:34:39 <vdgmprgrmr> In its infinite magesty.
A12:35:26 <Lmaoboat> I miss the "wood" blocks
A12:35:47 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't.
A12:36:51 <Daidoji> I thought they were tan bricks
A12:36:55 <Daidoji> I miss them too though

10A12:38:17 * avial (ewtakeasea@cpe-74-71-62-29.twcny.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
A12:38:47 <avial> can anyone help me with hosting my own server?
A12:38:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Mehbeh.
A12:39:13 <avial> i downloaded the .rar file and unzipped it
A12:39:32 <avial> i dont know what to do after i double click the star server icon
A12:39:42 <Adura> It wasn't a .rar file...
A12:39:49 <Adura> Where'd you get this file from?
A12:39:55 <avial> the website
A12:40:18 <Adura> Sounds like an unofficial site if it's a .rar file.
A12:40:21 <avial> the .zip file
A12:40:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Either way, before you start your server, you gotta forward ports.
A12:40:30 <avial> what ports
A12:40:32 <Adura> Oh, that's different.
A12:40:36 <vdgmprgrmr> http://portforward.com/
A12:40:50 <vdgmprgrmr> The port you're using.
A12:41:12 <avial> how do i know what port it required to host the server?
A12:41:23 <vdgmprgrmr> You forward whatever port your server's on (indicated in server.properties)
A12:41:40 <vdgmprgrmr> (Open server.properties in notepad or something)
A12:42:51 <avial> i dont see server.properties
A12:42:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Then after you forward the port, you run start server.bat, and you get the link in externalurl.txt and put that in your browser's url bar and then you're on your server. If the server's public, it should also be in the server list at the minecraft website.
A12:43:08 <vdgmprgrmr> There should be something with "properties" in the name.
A12:43:14 <avial> found it
A12:43:22 <avial> i cant get to my router though
A12:43:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Why not?
A12:43:30 <avial> not sure
A12:43:39 <avial> i put in my ip to a web browser but nothing happened
A12:43:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Did you use your router's ip, or your ip?
A12:44:06 <avial> my ip
A12:44:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Gotta use your router's ip.
A12:44:21 <avial> how do i find that
A12:44:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Start -> run -> cmd -> type "ipconfig" -> router's ip is the ip after "Default Gateway"
A12:45:18 <avial> ok i did that and its just a white screen
A12:45:26 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A12:45:31 <vdgmprgrmr> A white screen?
A12:45:34 <avial> yeah
A12:45:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
A12:46:00 <avial> its just a blank white screen
A12:46:06 <vdgmprgrmr> That's weird.
A12:46:09 <avial> i have roadrunner if that makes any difference
A12:46:17 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno what roadrunner is.
A12:47:29 <Adura> It's a bird/cartoon.
A12:47:35 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A12:47:38 <vdgmprgrmr> -_-

A12:48:26 <avial> i live in the US
A12:48:31 <vdgmprgrmr> There's more than one internet?

A12:49:32 <Adura> Just read the threads about this issue on the forums.
A12:49:45 <avial> about not being able to get into the router?

A5:00:39 <NiGMA> hello?
A5:02:05 <NiGMA> i know theres someone there...i can see the list
A5:02:17 <NiGMA> bloody hell, stop ignoring me!
A5:03:22 <Super-Dot> Just because we're online doesn't mean we're paying attention to the chat
A5:03:33 <Super-Dot> And no, haven't seen celysus
A5:04:36 <NiGMA> damn
A5:05:02 <NiGMA> he'd love to see the servers ive been doing... but he isnt around
A5:05:20 <NiGMA> how about rockman? or kodiak?
A5:05:43 <Super-Dot> nope nope
A5:06:03 <Super-Dot> I don't know any of those, so I'm probably not the person to ask
A5:08:25 <NiGMA> not asking just you, im asking the people who log in to irc then do nothing with it

A6:40:21 <08Notch> helloes
A6:40:29 <Adura> Yop.
A6:42:34 <citricsquid> I'm never going to get over how stupid http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=6790#p6790 that post is. 
A6:44:00 <08Notch> doesn't seem all that stupid to me. =)
A6:44:51 <Ausfriend> Notch, is the Pixel Format error something that is fixable? me and a lot of others are having the same problem.
A6:45:04 <08Notch> I mean, it's not like he said cows can fly
A6:45:18 <08Notch> Ausfriend: Is this via vmware? You need hardware acceleration to be able to play minecraft
A6:45:27 <Ausfriend> Yeah, it's enabled
A6:45:34 <Adura> Try Virtualbox?
A6:45:46 <08Notch> I think there might be some way to let it start even without accelerated graphics, but I've got a feeling it's going to be faaar too slow
A6:45:56 <08Notch> can you play other opengl games?

A6:46:17 <08Notch> hey C418. =)
A6:46:20 <citricsquid> Notch: He said minecraft isn't worth $15 because it's a java game, how is that not stupid?! The value of a game should be in the return you get from playing it, not the platform it's built on. :P
A6:46:29 <08Notch> oohhh
A6:46:36 <08Notch> hehe
A6:46:45 <08Notch> people get certain expectations from games run in browsers
A6:47:02 <Ausfriend> I reckon it's worth the $15. Afterall, Runescape is a java browser game that costs like $30 per month and millions play it
A6:47:23 <08Notch> it's $30/month? :-O
A6:47:43 <citricsquid> If a game involves me throwing a ball into a cup for 10 hours a day and I enjoy it I'd still pay for it, regardless of how simple it is.
A6:47:43 <Ausfriend> something like that
A6:47:48 <Ausfriend> for the pay to play aprt
A6:47:50 <Ausfriend> *part
A6:47:55 <C418> 30 dollar per month?
A6:47:57 <citricsquid> aus: it's $4.95 :P
A6:48:00 <C418> why is anyone playing it?
A6:48:04 <C418> ah
A6:48:06 <C418> that makes sense
A6:48:09 <C418> oh yeah
A6:48:11 <C418> you remind me
A6:48:14 <08Notch> that makes more sense. :D
A6:48:22 <C418> before I get to bed, I bought the tales of monkey island series
A6:48:23 <Ausfriend> im just kicking at the barrel here, i haven't played it in like 4 years
A6:48:25 <C418> I have to play someting now
A6:48:41 <08Notch> C418: As did I. It's not the original series for sure, but it seems ok
A6:48:51 <C418> it seems very okay
A6:49:00 <08Notch> i haven't gotten far, though
A6:49:09 <JTE> o.o
A6:49:33 <C418> I don't know about the original series though
A6:49:47 <C418> half the original monkey island team was working on it
A6:49:49 <Ausfriend> Notch, did anyone come to meet you down at the pub with those other Swedish indie game devs?
A6:49:53 <JTE> People don't expect you to use OpenGL in Java.
A6:49:56 <JTE> Clearly.
A6:50:02 <C418> oh, and ron gilbert gave a few days of help too
A6:50:10 <08Notch> Ausfriend: No, as expected. =)
A6:50:15 <Ausfriend> hehe
A6:50:15 <Cueball> HELLO
A6:50:16 <08Notch> then again, we were kinda hidden away in a corner
A6:50:32 <08Notch> i met with the guy who made You Have To Burn The Rope, and the guy making Love
A6:50:37 <Ausfriend> oh god
A6:50:38 <Ausfriend> that game
A6:50:41 <08Notch> both very interesting people
A6:50:41 <Ausfriend> what is the point of it seriously
A6:50:42 <Cueball> the guy making love
A6:50:43 <Cueball> uhoh

A6:51:28 <JTE> Thanks to the love making guy.
A6:51:28 <Cueball> yay
A6:51:37 <citricsquid> I'm going down to London next month to meet just over 60 members of a site I visit, there'll be people there who've made lots of awesome flash games :D
A6:51:39 <08Notch> i need to eat some food, I think, but it's a good thing I got an update out yesterday
A6:51:45 <Cueball> the guy who makes love - making notch a happy man
A6:51:56 <08Notch> My fingers are itching to write some more code now
A6:51:57 <Cueball> i like the new escape menu :D
A6:51:59 <Ausfriend> citricsquid: kidnap one of them and take them to Sweden
A6:52:11 <Cueball> you need some anti-itch powder for that!
A6:52:13 <08Notch> I started working on ragdolls, but then I realized that's really not top priority. ;D
A6:52:20 <Cueball> lol
A6:52:34 <JTE> Heh. I do that sometimes. oo;
A6:53:02 <Ausfriend> how about
A6:53:05 <Ausfriend> trees that grow
A6:53:14 <Ausfriend> with the leaf tiles spreading very slowly
A6:53:33 <Ausfriend> and the trunk growing even slower
A6:53:55 <Ausfriend> actually 
A6:54:07 <Ausfriend> Notch: ever thought about a ladder type block
A6:54:11 <Ausfriend> or climbable vine?
A6:54:31 <08Notch> there's something about ladder game mechanics that's always bothered me, so I'd rather develop around them
A6:55:17 <Ausfriend> or maybe 
A6:55:19 <Ausfriend> explosions?
A6:55:28 <Ausfriend> Like tnt type blocs
A6:55:30 <Ausfriend> *bloks
A6:55:33 <Ausfriend> *blocks, even
A6:55:48 <08Notch> yeah, that's planned, in some form. :D
A6:55:51 <08Notch> muoahaha
A6:56:12 <JTE> Ladder game mechanics that are bothersome ... Is probably that you have a tendancy to be clinging to a ladder when you mean to get off it, or let go of a ladder when you still need to be on it.

A6:59:21 <Cueball> well that doesnt show
A6:59:26 <Cueball> and besides
A6:59:36 <Cueball> you're too awesome to get any negativity
A6:59:41 <vdgmprgrmr> I suggest a Notch 1000 sales party server, complete with server-specific party meshes and such.
A7:00:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, party hats.
A7:00:13 <08Notch> awesome, I'm flattered, Cueball. :D
A7:00:16 <citricsquid> That would be so awesome.
A7:00:26 <08Notch> lol
A7:00:58 <Cueball> party hats would be so cool
A7:01:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Or give everyone on irc a free premium! Especially people with nicks that start with V!

10A7:02:58 * vaaaacitricsquid is now known as citricsquid
A7:02:59 <08Notch> i don't want to give away free premium as that takes away from the purity of the sales counter
A7:03:17 <08Notch> well.. hm.. there are 7 "fake" purchases there.. I've bought the game eight times
10A7:03:22 * cryzed is now known as V_cryzed
A7:03:24 <citricsquid> Does the counter just count how many accounts are premium, or how many sales go through?
A7:03:26 <08Notch> so really, it's sold 7 times less than it claims
A7:03:31 <V_cryzed> Yo what's up :D
A7:03:41 <08Notch> what's the difference between the two, citricsquid? It could premium accounts

A7:04:06 <vdgmprgrmr> So you could give out 7 free premiums and it would be fixed!

A7:04:29 <08Notch> i did pay, as I was testing the integration
A7:04:37 <citricsquid> oh :D
A7:04:45 <08Notch> I think they extra ones are Notch2 through Notch7 or something. :D

A7:28:41 <Cueball> Today, I gave my boyfriend a spontaneous blowjob while we were watching TV. After he finished, I tried to pull a sexy move I'd seen in a porno by zipping his pants back up with my teeth. His foreskin got caught in the zipper and we spent the next few hours in the emergency room. FML

A7:31:03 <Thi3f> Notch, tried with no success :(
A7:31:04 <Cueball> that would be horrible
A7:31:13 <Thi3f> It's worse than drunken coding
A7:31:21 <08Notch> druken coding is a baaad idea
A7:31:33 <08Notch> sure, you can write the stuff, but the design makes no sense at all
A7:31:44 <Cueball> see, i code best when im really tired
A7:31:45 <Thi3f> And understanding it the next day is a bitch

A7:32:39 <08Notch> once you're past it, you're golden
A7:32:43 <08Notch> but getting started can be a bitch
A7:33:19 <citricsquid> notch: I suffer that, I can go weeks without doing any work because I have no motivation to start, but once I start I do lots of work. 
A7:33:50 <08Notch> yeah me too. Like the last week and a half for me, but I think that was mostly me being sick
A7:33:55 <Ausfriend> lets play a game
A7:33:58 <Ausfriend> what does MAME stand for

A7:35:37 <slipperyjim8> yes and no
A7:35:37 <Ausfriend> Notch: are you one of those devs that always goes to public servers and ask people what they think/what should improve and base your patches on that?

A7:39:10 <Akai> Notch! Question?
A7:39:17 <08Notch> yeah, it's a small sample, but it's also a manageable sample that I can keep a personal relationship to. =D
A7:39:18 <Cueball> see notch, the trick is to release an upate, then die

A7:42:11 <Ausfriend> that costs like $10 ma
A7:42:12 <Ausfriend> x
A7:42:18 <citricsquid> yes, and inside the teddy bear is 72 virgins
A7:42:23 <slipperyjim8> lol
A7:42:30 <citricsquid> the only problem is shipping, they might not be able to breath.
A7:42:34 <citricsquid> breathe*
A7:42:36 <Ausfriend> or fit
A7:42:44 <citricsquid> Ausfriend: Midget virgins.
A7:42:59 <Ausfriend> even better;

A7:43:40 <Ausfriend> its not

A7:45:09 <slipperyjim8> ok...
A7:45:39 <citricsquid> Like those russian dolls?
A7:45:46 <citricsquid> So you open up 1 midget and there's a midget inside.
A7:45:50 <Ausfriend> sorta
A7:46:11 <Cueball> hahaha
A7:46:13 <Cueball> i know those
A7:46:18 <citricsquid> OR you could put a portal in the teddybear, then when notch opens it you stuff the midgets into the portal and notch isn't any the wiser!

A7:53:29 <prakCurie> I never realized that you stay logged in.  No way to log out is sort of annoying.
A7:56:13 <Akai> You log out of the server if you browse away from the page
A7:56:17 <Akai> just not if you close the window
A7:58:42 <prakCurie> Browsing away isn't really clearly logging out.  A side effect maybe.
A7:59:15 <prakCurie> I might just feel this way because I always close the window and have never browsed away.

A8:01:59 <C418> oh, and I believe it's as official as it can get, notch
A8:03:29 <C418> well, the music is not real recorded stuff like usual... but thats the only negative thing I can say
A8:05:03 <prakCurie> You would think that a simple hanging would be enough.
A8:05:25 <slipperyjim8> A note to notch or whomever. the music from this game is very very good. one of my personal fav for game music
A8:05:48 <C418> now thats something I rarely hear
A8:05:50 <Siiseli> C418 made the music
A8:05:52 <Siiseli> right?
A8:06:02 <slipperyjim8> well whomever
A8:06:03 <C418> psst
A8:06:19 <slipperyjim8> i really enjoy listening to it

A8:06:55 <Siiseli> Akai, mm?
A8:06:57 <citricsquid> The music goes perfectly with the game, it'd be better if it was death metal though. ;)
A8:07:04 <Akai> citric's link
A8:07:10 <Siiseli> death metal is godawful
A8:07:16 <slipperyjim8> amen
A8:07:19 <Siiseli> thankfully I don't have to listen to that stuff
A8:07:26 <citricsquid> death metal is brilliant, most of it is unlistenable though.

A8:14:41 <citricsquid> slipperyjim8: EVERYONE does that.
A8:14:58 <slipperyjim8> lol
A8:15:08 <slipperyjim8> but i only just realised... man im slow
A8:15:37 <Akai> I didn't :p
A8:15:48 <citricsquid> Akai: <3
A8:15:52 <Akai> and give me a day, citric, and I can probably get one

A8:16:08 <Akai> Just have to write a check to my parents, and convince them to let me use their card
A8:16:10 <JTE> Hi chrstfer :3
A8:16:15 <chrstfer> notch, i replied to the thing on the dev blog, but i dont know if its possible.
A8:16:21 <chrstfer> Hey JTE
A8:16:25 <citricsquid> akai: I'll just ask notch when he gets back :P ty anyway.
13A8:16:25 * Akai hasn't gotten her own card yet
A8:16:34 <citricsquid> her?!
A8:16:40 <ZomBuster> citricsquid you could do it like the Datarealms forums
A8:16:43 <Akai> I'll laugh if he goes "I dunno"
A8:17:00 <ZomBuster> where prem have these badges
13A8:17:03 * chrstfer is laughing so hard at citricsquid response!
A8:17:11 <ZomBuster> but you would need acces to the paid user database
A8:18:19 <citricsquid> ZomBuster: That's what I'm trying, but I worked out that only premiums have a skin, so I can just check if that exists, if it does then they're premium, but I don't want people complaining that it's broken when they don't get premium listed because they didn't add a new skin :D
A8:18:44 <ZomBuster> he true
A8:19:10 <ZomBuster> let me check.. whats the link to a users skin?
A8:19:41 <citricsquid> http://minecraft.net/skin/username.png
A8:19:58 <slipperyjim8> ?
A8:21:26 <ZomBuster> and you havent found anyone with the basic skin I guess
A8:21:38 <citricsquid> nope
A8:22:08 <ZomBuster> just do it, I don't think it will bother those ~20 people
A8:22:14 <slipperyjim8> pay for my premium and ill do it :)
A8:22:26 <slipperyjim8> pay for some spelling lessions would go better
A8:22:38 <Akai> Citric... you're piiiiink
A8:22:40 <slipperyjim8> and some grammar ones
A8:23:03 <ZomBuster> he's a squid Akai

A8:24:04 <citricsquid> I have no idea if it'll work with new premium without changed skins though =\
A8:24:24 <JTE> ... Can be helpful to JTE's server too.
A8:24:54 <vdgmprgrmr> But I also gotta sleep.
A8:25:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Good morning, everyone.
A8:25:05 <citricsquid> Good morning!
A8:25:13 <chrstfer> i are to pay next wek!
A8:25:13 <ZomBuster> too much contrast JTE
A8:25:27 <ZomBuster> pure red on black D:
A8:25:29 <vdgmprgrmr> At 8:26am, I go to bed...
A8:25:32 <JTE> Yeah, I know.
A8:25:45 <JTE> That's part of the point of it, though. It represents an '8-bit' character. Only 4 colors. :P
A8:26:21 <peerkoel> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=Peerko&id=4 it's very hard to make houses diagonally
A8:26:22 <JTE> Later I'm gonna take a bajillion photos of myself and scale it down ridiculously tiny and put it on my character, but I doubt it would be distinguishable.
A8:26:25 <Cueball> Today, I was completely wasted at my bachelor party, and my friends thought it would be funny to put sodium nitrate on my penis. Sodium nitrate makes your skin dark purple for a couple of weeks. My wedding is next week and my fiancee has never seen me naked. FML
A8:26:27 <Cueball> rofl
A8:26:42 <ZomBuster> lol
A8:26:57 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/userexists.php?user=citricsquid yay
A8:27:12 <ZomBuster> im sure there is something to compensate for the sodium nitrate
A8:27:21 <peerkoel> a knife
A8:27:34 <ZomBuster> oh here
A8:27:45 <ZomBuster> you need to heat it to 538 C to make it decompose
A8:27:52 <JTE> ..
A8:27:58 <JTE> That's a lot of heat on your penis, man.
A8:28:24 <Cueball> haha
A8:28:28 <Cueball> i had some on my finger before
A8:28:33 <Cueball> it went black for like a week
A8:28:36 <Cueball> it was good fun
A8:28:41 <ZomBuster> citric you got the applet workin ?

A8:29:20 <ZomBuster> ah too bad
A8:29:26 <chrstfer> JTE in response to later im going to... you dont have to scale it down, its that size already
A8:29:35 <chrstfer> is notch here yet?
A8:29:44 <ZomBuster> can't JTE reverse engineer it  :D? 
A8:30:17 <citricsquid> mebe, is it possible to decompile java?
A8:30:20 <JTE> Reverse scaling size what?
A8:30:44 <citricsquid> notch is buying food.
A8:30:49 <ZomBuster> I mean you wrote a custom server
A8:30:54 <slipperyjim8> citricsquid ur skin looks weird...
A8:30:56 <JTE> Yes, I wrote a custom server.
A8:31:04 <JTE> ... What of it? What are you asking or saying?
A8:31:09 <JTE> @.@; I dun follow this conversation.
A8:31:23 <ZomBuster> the skin preview applet
A8:31:32 <ZomBuster> citric wants it on the skins site
A8:31:36 <slipperyjim8> ok...
A8:31:37 <citricsquid> JTE: We want a skin preview applet that can take URLs :D
A8:32:24 <slipperyjim8> well ima go play some minecraft
A8:32:33 <JTE> URLs to like the skin file ...?
A8:32:39 <citricsquid> yeah
A8:32:50 <citricsquid> right now you give it "citricsquid" and it grabs "citricsquid.png" from minecraft site
A8:32:51 <Siiseli>  haha
A8:33:03 <Siiseli> jte, the unofficial minecraft developer
A8:33:07 <JTE> ... I'm not too hopeful considering it involves Java, and I don't see much purpose in it, but okay I'll see what I can do...
A8:33:08 <citricsquid> haha
A8:33:25 <citricsquid> JTE: Doesn't matter if you can't, just would be cool :D

10A8:35:39 * LayZ (owa@78.84.125.146) has joined #minecraft
A8:35:46 <ZomBuster> or maybe making minecraft is that good
A8:35:46 <slipperyjim8> and thats the end of my awesome suggestions
A8:36:01 <08Notch> but I've made enough money already to work on minecraft for three months without selling another copy
A8:36:17 <slipperyjim8> wow
A8:36:20 <Ausfriend> 3 month long holiday?
A8:36:24 <citricsquid> Notch: What about that $5,000 you owe me? ;);)
A8:36:31 <08Notch> that's three very poor months, but still.. it's doable
A8:36:39 <C418> what about that trip to san fran you owe me
A8:36:51 <08Notch> if I keep my costs down.. and working on it full time will let me implement stuff faster
A8:37:03 <08Notch> so sales SHOULD go up or at the very least not decrease
A8:37:03 <ZomBuster> and you'll still sell some copies
A8:37:36 <Malcovent> well, everytime a new feature is added to the bought version, sales will obviously rocket up...
13A8:38:00 * JTE compiles a new .jar file
A8:38:07 <08Notch> I think I'm going to do this.. It's a scary step, but life is risk
A8:38:32 <Ausfriend> we're here for ya :D (Not that we offer any sort of moral support though)
A8:38:43 <C418> now how do I get on that ship...
A8:38:48 <citricsquid> Notch: goodluck :D
A8:39:23 <08Notch> C418: Sell stuff!
A8:39:41 <08Notch> if you charged for your albums, I would buy them.
A8:40:03 <ZomBuster> you could do it like 
A8:40:18 <ZomBuster> someone can download your album for free
A8:40:18 <C418> there are a few complications with taxes though
A8:40:19 <citricsquid> I'd also buy them, if the music is as good as the minecraft music :D 
A8:40:25 <C418> a friend and me are trying to get over that currently
A8:40:25 <ZomBuster> and then pay 5 bucks if they want
A8:40:40 <ZomBuster> you could just write it down as "donations"
A8:40:56 <C418> I always could, but I want to do it more legally
A8:41:07 <C418> in german law, you can get 17k euros without taxes if you do everything right
A8:41:23 <Siiseli> what
A8:41:23 <08Notch> taxes are crazy.. I'm paying like 55% on minecraft income
A8:41:23 <citricsquid> Here in the UK you can do 6k/year without taxes I think
A8:41:23 <Siiseli> how
A8:41:29 <C418> in the first year at least...
A8:41:39 <C418> in the next year it's 50k
A8:42:03 <C418> it's aimed for artists wanting to have a decent life without nasty taxes killing them
A8:42:11 <citricsquid> I need to register as self employed, lol.
A8:42:32 <Rroff> heh
A8:42:44 <Rroff> for some reason I'm being paid back taxes atm
A8:42:48 <Rroff> instead of paying
A8:42:52 <citricsquid> =o
A8:42:57 <Rroff> I thought usually you had to claim to get it back

A8:43:46 <08Notch> so if I buy a new computer and put it down as a company expense, it's 50% off.
A8:43:51 <Rroff> true

A8:46:46 <Cueball> boob hair is normal right?
A8:46:51 <08Notch> yes, Cueball
A8:46:53 <Cueball> for your girlfriend to have boob hair
A8:47:00 <08Notch> around the nipples? yes
A8:47:00 <Cueball> cause all the girls ive been with have had a little
A8:47:09 <citricsquid> Notch: Put it as a business expense, "I bought these games for research! :D
A8:47:12 <Cueball> and this dude is all like she had boob hair fml
A8:47:13 <Rroff> I thought you only get charged at the higher rate for anything you earned over 34.6K in the UK?
A8:47:18 <08Notch> oh yeah!! that'll actually work, citricsquid!
A8:47:19 <Cueball> and im like what
A8:47:20 <ZomBuster> there is hair everywhere

A8:51:08 <08Notch> well, server mods could change that..
A8:51:23 <Akai> good point
A8:51:35 <Akai> any plans for blocks to carry water upwards?
A8:51:42 <08Notch> i don't personally like it, though, so I don't want to make it part of the core game
A8:51:47 <08Notch> yes, better water dynamics are planned
A8:51:57 <citricsquid> I want proper waterfalls, game will be perfect then :D
A8:52:01 <08Notch> Very very difficult to get right, but it's going to be fun. =D
A8:52:15 <08Notch> yeah, I want waterfalls too
A8:52:25 <08Notch> preferrably naturally occuring ones on level generation. :D
A8:52:33 <ZomBuster> I want DF style situations :3
A8:52:38 <08Notch> me too
A8:52:48 <citricsquid> i'd buy another copy of the game if naturally occuring waterfalls happened.
A8:53:01 <08Notch> yaaaay! the saaales!
A8:53:04 <Adura> How'd that work with finite water though? :P
A8:53:11 <08Notch> 1000 sales is aproaching fast..
A8:53:17 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> Wait
A8:53:21 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> there's going to be finite water?
A8:53:22 <citricsquid> the forum registered users is almost over taking sales, yay :D
A8:53:24 <Malcovent> ooh, does the thousand'th buyer get anything?
A8:53:43 <08Notch> no, probably not. =)
A8:53:53 <Malcovent> damn... *puts wallet away* x_x
A8:53:58 <Akai> hrm
A8:54:02 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> If it were a free minecraft copy I'd totally camp for that spot.
A8:54:03 <C418> oh yes. he gets a warm hug
A8:54:04 <ZomBuster> Adura there would be a water emitter at the top and a water uuh hole at the bottom
A8:54:05 <C418> virtually
A8:54:13 <Akai> Question... are there any official rules for Minecraft, considering servers are hosted by the players?
A8:54:21 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> Snow in mountains are real life water emitters
A8:54:28 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> That's how rivers and waterfalls are made IIRC.
A8:54:28 <08Notch> Akai: Rules how?
A8:54:30 <citricsquid> Rule 1: When notch says Dance, you dance.
A8:54:35 <ZomBuster> there are rules

A8:54:44 <ZomBuster> you can only move a t a certain speed
A8:54:51 <ZomBuster> and you cant fly
A8:54:54 <08Notch> brb, making food!
A8:55:00 <08Notch> I'm making burgers =D
A8:55:02 <iPope> Notch, with api will you be able to.. damn it
A8:55:03 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> Snow blocks that generate water!
A8:55:16 <ZomBuster> mhh burgers good idea
A8:55:16 <citricsquid> if we had ducks that went on water, that'd be awesome.
A8:55:19 <08Notch> iPope: Probably LUA, but I'm looking into alternative scripting languages for java now
A8:55:25 <JTE> Okay done.
A8:55:31 <Malcovent> in all fairness, most of us can agree to sharks...
A8:55:36 <iPope> i mean will you be able to make custum blocks?
A8:55:37 <Malcovent> nothing would clear out greifers like sharks in the water
A8:56:00 <08Notch> oh, well.. kinda, I think. Not really at first, but you can cheat
A8:56:05 <08Notch> not custom graphics, though
A8:56:22 <iPope> yay :P
A8:56:35 <ZomBuster> you could add some graphics for custom block
A8:56:36 <08Notch> but in the long run, possibly. =) I don't want all servers to look different and have custom graphics
A8:56:40 <citricsquid> oh, Notch, I forgot to ask: When someone buys premium is username.png for a skin created, or does it only get created when they upload a new skin?
A8:56:44 <ZomBuster> like with CUSTOM on it or something
A8:56:49 <08Notch> at upload, citricsquid
A8:57:03 <iPope> zom thats a good idea
A8:57:13 <citricsquid> notch: poop, okay :D
A8:57:18 <08Notch> a couple of custom tile graphics per server could possibly be supported later on
A8:57:22 <08Notch> but I don't want all the art to be replaced
A8:57:28 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> But you guys know that custom graphics blocks can only lead to PENIS BLOCKS, right?
A8:57:40 <08Notch> like there aren't enough penii already. ;)
A8:57:44 <iPope> just have custom blocks have white with custom on them
A8:57:46 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> True that.
A8:57:53 <iPope> in red letters
A8:58:10 <08Notch> wait, I'm not making burgers
A8:58:13 <08Notch> *poof*
A8:58:13 <Arf|Promptly_Proceeding> But then how do you differentiate them if there are many with different behaviours.
A8:58:29 <Malcovent> could just allocate them a certain colour?
A8:58:36 <Malcovent> and all have the same texture x_x just different colours
A8:59:02 <iPope> Or, or when you get close they have stuff hovring over them
A8:59:06 <iPope> with a predefined name
A8:59:20 <JTE> I like the idea of each server's owner being able to replace the png file containing all the block textures with its own.
A8:59:35 <ZomBuster> nah
A8:59:39 <iPope> notch doesnt want to original art being replaced
A8:59:41 <JTE> Maybe even adding completely new blocks of a mix of the existing types, i.e. new decoration blocks that fall like sand blocks.
A8:59:43 <ZomBuster> just like a few extra
A8:59:59 <citricsquid> I don't like the idea of custom graphics, that's the worst thing about CSS/TF2, downloads =\

A9:00:31 <iPope> how would you know what custum block is what?
A9:01:01 <iPope> unless you made a plugin with the api that told you if you said something like /look
A9:01:11 <iPope> and it reutrns the block name
A9:01:15 <iPope> returns*
A9:01:23 <prakCurie> I say allow any sort of graphics mods but don't allow them to be listed on the public list if they are.
A9:01:40 <prakCurie> Everyone can be sort of happy.
A9:01:55 <iPope> or just have a seperate image file for custom blocks
A9:01:56 <ZomBuster> citricsquid if you would have ~10 blocks that's a 32*320 image

A9:02:13 <ZomBuster> that's not even 100 KB
A9:02:18 <iPope> so you can have original art and custom
A9:02:41 <JTE> Like press B for the original blocks, press N for the server's custom set?
A9:02:52 <JTE> And you can mix and match both of them anywhere in the map? :3
10A9:02:53 * Jack is now known as jprice
A9:03:52 <citricsquid> haha oh wow JTE, I love you, it worked.
A9:03:59 <Malcovent> i dont see custom blocks as that necessary tbh x_x
A9:04:04 <JTE> Wonderful, citricsquid.
13A9:04:12 * citricsquid hugs JTE
A9:04:35 <iPope> Malcovent: Custom blocks would be awesome
A9:04:36 <prakCurie> No.  That seems like rather a lot of work for what, ultimately, rather few servers will take much advantage of.
A9:04:48 <Malcovent> part of the fun of Minecraft is making what you can out of what your given.
A9:04:57 <iPope> Well it would be just part of the API
A9:04:57 <Malcovent> if you allow people to just put in new blocks, kind of cripples that fun.
A9:05:00 <JTE> What I mean is mostly in the direction of art where every pixel isn't a block nearly half as big as your whole entire body. And new kinds of plants. I love plants. :3
A9:05:16 <prakCurie> Perhaps much later in the game's lifecycle to breath a little more life into it.
A9:05:21 <JTE> But okay, few people would use it. JTE's server of awesomeness would surely use it.
A9:05:27 <Cueball> alright fellas
A9:05:29 <Cueball> im gonna go
A9:05:35 <Cueball> have a great night :D

A9:06:41 <prakCurie> You are rewriting Minecraft?
A9:06:43 <JTE> I just wonder why citricsquid wants to get skins by URL ...
A9:06:51 <iPope> Most would use the API for new commands, wonder if it would be possible to have an automated op bot
A9:06:51 <prakCurie> Before it has even hit beta?
A9:06:54 <citricsquid> minecraftskins.net :D
A9:07:01 <JTE> It's easier before it has even hit beta, prak.
A9:07:07 <JTE> You gotta start your hacking early, nya.
A9:07:11 <citricsquid> I want to replace the user uploaded screenshots with the pretty spinning thing
A9:07:29 <JTE> Ah
A9:07:32 <JTE> :3 Pretty spinny thing.
A9:07:37 <Malcovent> :3
A9:07:38 <iPope> asked notch for the java applet on that page?
A9:07:41 <citricsquid> :3
A9:07:49 <JTE> I hacked it, iPope.
A9:08:00 <JTE> Now it can get skins from minecraftskins.net URLs.
A9:08:04 <prakCurie> What is the point though?  Why not write your own game?
A9:08:13 <JTE> prakCurie, that is essentially what I'm doing.
A9:08:13 <iPope> cause thats for gays
13A9:08:27 * citricsquid goes to bring the washing in
A9:08:42 <JTE> But nobody would care about my own game, so I'm riding on minecraft's popularity and my own awesomeness.
A9:08:52 <prakCurie> Why assume that?
A9:09:12 <JTE> Because making my own games from scratch is what I've been doing for years.
A9:09:13 <prakCurie> There is a decent cult following for any available sandbox game.
A9:09:14 <JTE> Nobody cares.
A9:09:25 <prakCurie> Link please.
A9:09:49 <JTE> You haven't even heard of me. :P meh.

A9:10:09 <Malcovent> i havent heard of anyone minus notch and i think C418 x_x
A9:10:16 <prakCurie> That would be what the link might help with.

A9:10:52 <C418> eh?
A9:11:00 <iPope> First link in google
A9:11:04 <iPope> after googling JTE
A9:11:30 <prakCurie> If you are writing sandbox games I would like to add you to my list of possible sources of games.
A9:12:36 <iPope> I make games, well in the process of
A9:13:12 <JTE> No, you can google JTE and you'll never find me.
A9:13:21 <08Notch> leeching off other people's work is pretty lame
A9:13:27 <JTE> And I have not written a sandbox game before anyway.
A9:13:29 <08Notch> making competing games is cool
A9:13:32 <08Notch> leeching, not so much

A9:32:17 <Rroff> the ads and stuff do get annoying tho
A9:32:24 <citricsquid> I like the adverts, just not sex adverts.
A9:32:30 <Rroff> especially the slide up ones at the bottom of the playlist
A9:32:48 <Rroff> if you've got a big playlist and want to select a tune at the bottom the ad almost always slides over it as you go to click
A9:33:08 <Rroff> annoying people with ads isn't gonna get them to subscribe - its more likely to drive them away

A9:33:12 <prakCurie> Write them and as for a paid version that allows you to disable certain ads/ad types.
A9:33:14 <Rroff> dumb strategy imo
A9:33:26 <citricsquid> Their advertising is flawed anyway, "...click the link to see our latest album, bye!" and then the links gone by the time you open the program and go to click it. 
A9:33:34 <citricsquid> I've missed about 6 ads I liked because of it.
A9:33:38 <Rroff> I'd be happy to pay 10 a month for it if they bothered to make a windows mobile version tho heh
A9:33:57 <08Notch> citricsquid: yeah, I've noticed that too.. who has spotify running as the main program?
A9:34:04 <Rroff> yeah their whole advertising strategy seems dumb to me
A9:34:15 <citricsquid> I might email them, "You have to fix it, notch agreed!"
A9:34:57 <citricsquid> oh, they have a getsatisfaction account, I'll do it there.
A9:34:59 <prakCurie> They need to add an ad history so you can go back and look at old ads you missed.

A9:51:31 <ZomBuster> copyright on screenshots.. whut
A9:51:33 <princepsregulus> I personally vote for lua, by the way

A9:51:55 <chrstfer> what if you dont want simple, what if you want CRAZY mods.
A9:52:03 <SteGriff> Cheersios
A9:52:10 <DoctorDick> you could probably do that in lua too.
A9:52:11 <ZomBuster> I dont think anyone would pay for screenshots lol

A9:58:38 <Quatroking> So anyways Notch, how many votes does the java api have and how many notch?
A9:58:41 <Quatroking> *how many LUA
A9:58:57 <ZomBuster> problem is half of the votes dont get trough
A9:59:08 <ZomBuster> should disable the bloody confirmation email
A9:59:11 <JTE> >_>; Problem is a Lua API wouldn't make any goddamn sense.
A9:59:14 <iPope> lau won
A9:59:25 <iPope> its a spinoff of lua
A9:59:28 <iPope> much cooler
A9:59:29 <prakCurie> Why wouldn't it make sense?

A10:00:15 <iPope> gmod is c++, lua makes sense
A10:00:21 <iPope> why not java and lua
A10:00:25 <peerkoel> this is not gmod
A10:00:29 <Quatroking> nope
10A10:00:32 * Zolyx is now known as Zolyx[lurk]
A10:00:34 <peerkoel> indeed pope, both would be good
A10:00:36 <Ausfriend> this
A10:00:36 <JTE> Because the whole of the website, the server, the client, and EVERYTHING is already written in JAVA, which is bad enough in itself. Adding other languages will just add more layers of unnecessary complexities on top of that.
A10:00:36 <JTE> And the dude who programmed gmod hates Lua and wishes he could've used something else.
A10:00:37 <Ausfriend> is
A10:00:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Please don't talk about G-Mod
A10:00:43 <Quatroking> OH NO MINECRAFT IS GOING OT USE LUA NOW ITS A FAR CRY CLONE OMGGG
A10:00:48 <Quatroking> (far cry uses lua)
A10:00:56 <Quatroking> I hate stupid people
A10:01:02 <princepsregulus> I actually agree a/ JTE 
A10:01:03 <Ausfriend> World of Warcraft uses lua
A10:01:04 <JTE> And with a Java API, there will BE a Lua API, as well as I can use what I want too.
A10:01:05 <Ausfriend> true story
A10:01:07 <iPope> nearly as bad as the guy on the forum saying lua turns into a roblox clone
A10:01:18 <princepsregulus> *w/
A10:01:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hey guys... I have a quick question.  http://redditpublic.com ;; Anyone have any idea about Reddit Public #2 or Reddit Public Smallspace Server?  I think they're knocking us off for traffic, as there's nothing on Reddit about them
A10:01:23 <Quatroking> with a java api we would have even more languages
A10:01:27 <JTE> Lua wants to be Perl. :<

A10:04:24 <citricsquid> whitespace looks awesome
A10:04:47 <prakCurie> I'm not sure one guy not liking Lua is a very convincing reason to not use it.  And a clear divide between the server and the exposed API is not a bad thing.
A10:05:51 <Minerman> Brainfuck looks like what I originally thought C++ was.

A10:21:05 <iPope> ive only played it once, but ive played the developers other games alot
A10:21:06 <08Notch> and now, a bit over two months later, I've got this huge project going. =D
A10:21:07 <Minerman> But I seriously prefer Minecraft though

A10:21:32 <08Notch> yay Quatroking =D
A10:21:33 <Minerman> Speaking of which, what's an ETA on that?
A10:21:39 <JTE> I get inspired to make things I play too.

A10:21:47 <08Notch> there's no official eta, I've blown past two of them already, haha
A10:21:49 <Minerman> Yeah
A10:21:57 <peerkoel> this game does bring out the creativity in people
A10:21:57 <Minerman> I made a tiny 2D minecraft-ish game
A10:22:03 <Minerman> But it sucks
A10:22:07 <08Notch> i'm a bit nervous seeing how popular creative mode is
A10:22:08 <peerkoel> for me too that means code
A10:22:11 <Minerman> And it uses the GameBoy's color palette
A10:22:19 <citricsquid> you should mention in the TOS that you don't guarantee any sort of deadlines, so people don't buy the game and get bitchy when you miss another deadline :D
A10:22:20 <08Notch> I think that's slowing me down a bit. it's scary
A10:22:29 <08Notch> good idea, citricsquid!
A10:22:33 <peerkoel> there is nothing to fear but fear itself
A10:22:50 <Ausfriend> australian people have no fear
A10:22:52 <Ausfriend> scientific fact
A10:22:56 <peerkoel> cool
A10:22:57 <iPope> i want survival more than creative
A10:23:03 <iPope> but api more than survival
A10:23:07 <Minerman> Notch, survival mode will be epic.
A10:23:17 <Minerman> As much as Sandbox may be fun
A10:23:21 <Minerman> Survival can only be ten times better
A10:23:38 <Ausfriend> what about fort wars or something
A10:23:38 <peerkoel> I want quests
A10:23:43 <Minerman> Have you ever thought that it's not the mode, but the framework you've made it on that is drawing players/
A10:23:46 <Ausfriend> where you collect ore to build walls and everything
A10:23:47 <iPope> if we keep complementing hmm maybe hell start work now
A10:23:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, we NEED a graceful server shutdown.  Every time I kill the server (about 20 people on it), at least 6 sockets get stuck in FIN_WAIT1 and I have to kill the whole box
A10:24:10 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I've found waiting ~300 seconds fixes it
A10:24:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I tried waiting 8 hours once
A10:24:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nothing
A10:24:22 <citricsquid> I can shut down a server, wait a few mins and boot back up on the same port.
A10:24:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> I was in the city, ssh'd from my phone
A10:24:29 <citricsquid> Maybe it's your server config?
A10:24:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, what's yer average traffic?

A10:57:49 <08Notch> if/when I do this fulltime, development speed will go up as well, so it's a bit of a positive feedback loop

A11:00:11 <iPope> 3285.76
A11:00:14 <iPope> agh
A11:00:20 <citricsquid> 145 is server cost, 40 is percentage he makes after tax and paypal
A11:00:25 <citricsquid> I think
A11:00:33 <08Notch> the server cost is before tax
A11:00:37 <Resetting> yeah but i was working it out gross. =D
A11:00:37 <08Notch> it's a business expense
A11:00:40 <Ausfriendissleeping> 42
A11:01:07 <Resetting> i prefer to put things in gross rather than net. it makes it sound bigger.
A11:01:16 <08Notch> and the 55% tax is an estimate. It might be less, it might be more. I'm going to contact some tax firm thingie
A11:01:22 <citricsquid> :D
A11:01:29 <Minerman> I find it unnerving that the formula to how much money Notch makes resembles one of those "Figure out your age using your month of birth" equations
A11:01:32 <peerkoel> you want to pay more tax
A11:01:33 <08Notch> might cost some money, but it's less work and risk than me doing it myself
A11:01:36 <peerkoel> that means you made more :)
A11:01:45 <Resetting> ...i know my age already though?

A11:03:24 <08Notch> lol, the limit might be a bit low, especially for multiple sentences
A11:03:24 <Resetting> minecraft teaches you to type in shorter sentences. =D
A11:03:27 <LKA> in minecraft I type the sentence as far as I can because of the mute filter

A11:04:17 <08Notch> ok, I'll make it a bit nicer
A11:04:28 <LKA> An option to just plain disable it in the server config would be best
A11:04:37 <LKA> like "auto-mute=on/off"
A11:04:40 <citricsquid> could base it on the length of the previous message, like, if it's over 40 characters than the limit is skipped.
A11:04:40 <Resetting> its only because i have a lot to say and 90WPM
A11:04:41 <08Notch> then everyone would disable it?
A11:04:48 <08Notch> and then it'd serve no purpose
A11:04:58 <LKA> If they want it on their server, they can keep it
A11:04:58 <08Notch> i'd rather have it at a level where nobody but spammers even notice it
A11:05:04 <LKA> It's nice for public servers
A11:05:07 <prakCurie> Shouldn't that be up to the person running the server?

A11:06:12 <08Notch> not yet, hehe
A11:06:13 <LKA> http://i26.tinypic.com/2vcdb3k.jpg if you're hyper-sensitive to swears, don't look
A11:06:26 <Minerman> You NEED to add paste
A11:06:32 <citricsquid> SWEARS :O:O:O
A11:06:34 <Minerman> I've had to resort to using su.pr for URLs
A11:06:34 <LKA> but basically anybody that can type about 65+ WPM would probably hit it regularly
A11:06:43 <08Notch> Resetting: About the same as me then
A11:06:48 <prakCurie> Sure; and if it there is a problem with people doing it the server admins have a tool to prevent people from doing it if they want.
A11:06:50 <LKA> I think I average around 75-80
A11:06:50 <08Notch> i don't run into the chat limit, but I don't chat much
A11:07:01 <Resetting> no, average is actually much slower than that LKA.
A11:07:03 <08Notch> i mostly type one or two sentences, and then jump around for ten minutes
A11:07:05 <prakCurie> But why force it on them?
A11:07:07 <iPope> my wpm is about 55 or something
A11:07:23 <Resetting> yeah typical WPM is closer to iPopes, 50-60
A11:07:26 <citricsquid> I can type at 100WPM when I want to type as fast as I can, but it takes effort :o
A11:07:32 <LKA> Resetting: I mean I usually type around that
A11:07:35 <LKA> Not that I type at average speed
A11:07:36 <08Notch> Resetting: I think it's even lower..
A11:07:44 <prakCurie> I could see forcing servers on the public list to have certain settings.  That makes sense.  You want to be able to control how the public face of your game looks; but private servers?
A11:07:47 <citricsquid> My mums WPM is <8 :D
A11:07:48 <08Notch> wikipedia says 33 wpm average
A11:07:57 <Resetting> wow, THAT bad?
A11:08:07 <LKA> But I type, on average, somewhere between 75-80, so it's frustrating
A11:08:10 <Resetting> now i know what my friends are doing when it takes them so long to type then.
A11:08:17 <Resetting> theyre actually typing...
A11:08:28 <iPope> no way
A11:08:33 <LKA> Well, most people chicken-peck their keyboards IIRC
A11:08:34 <08Notch> prakCurie: i agree in theory. it's just that I can't really see any reason for people wanting to turn it off if it works well (ie better than now), and I'd rather not clutter the config file too much
13A11:08:38 * iPope is suprised at this fact
A11:09:06 <citricsquid> on the topic of typing, anyone want a typing race?
A11:09:06 <Minerman> Why is the man on TV attempting to sell me a particularly normal knife by showing me what I can do with any other knife?
A11:09:21 <Resetting> removing the spam blocker, or allowing it to be turned off, would be a step backwards, yeah.
A11:09:33 <Minerman> It chops food!! WOW!!

A11:10:33 <Minerman> Notch: You need to add some way to make hats.
A11:10:38 <Minerman> in Minecraft.
A11:10:45 <ZomBuster> hats?
A11:10:46 <Resetting> OR OTHER ACCESSORIES =D
A11:10:58 <LKA> but yeah.. gonna go back to slaving over a silly pixel thing I really shouldn't be doing, but I am because I hate myself oh-so-much <3
A11:11:10 <Minerman> Its a pain needing to draw a hat on a block and it ends up looking ridiculous
A11:11:12 <Resetting> oh god if we all had .gif skins
A11:11:15 <citricsquid> haha, 90WPM, fucked up twice :|
A11:11:27 <08Notch> damnit, 77

A11:11:42 <iPope> 98.9
A11:11:47 <iPope> i pause when i make mistakes :(
A11:11:53 <prakCurie> I agree that the default config file should be short and simple since most people will just want to get a basic server up and running; but why not also let people who love to fiddle with everything have the massive confusing config file you know they will want.
A11:11:59 <citricsquid> I can do 105WPM until I get to the words I don't type normally.
A11:12:01 <iPope> recognized the wuote straight away
A11:12:20 <prakCurie> Can you tell I hit the character limit in Minecraft chat all the time?
A11:12:45 <Resetting> oh yeah thats another thing i should add, my 90wpm is when i have to put in things such as apostrophes and full stops, capitals etc.
A11:12:47 <citricsquid> Congrats, you just typed 101 wpm! We have to ask everyone who gets over 100 wpm in a race to take a short typing test. This is done to discourage cheaters. Why?

A11:17:35 <LKA> I sent him my login cookie from IE so he could be logged in as me without knowing my pass

P4:40:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, someone is ripping off our server, insulting me when I ask them to rename... Any idea what I can do besides a forum boycott?  Official channels?
P4:40:40 <Zuriki> That Reddit #2?
P4:40:50 <08Notch> i'm not entirely sure, AlLnAtuRalX.. Perhaps something like tying a server to a player account could work
P4:40:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yessir
P4:41:00 <Zuriki> Organised raid tiem :D
P4:41:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, he's running Reddit Public #2
P4:41:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> getting a lot of traffic
P4:41:05 <Malcovent> mail them anthrax.
P4:41:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> he just renamed it to "Not Reddit Public Server #2"
P4:41:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> so I may have one... but he was being an ass
P4:41:21 <Zuriki> Lawl
P4:41:24 <Malcovent> sounds like a troll tbh x_x
P4:41:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> Saying I have no right to ask him to rename his server, and that he needs an owner of Reddit to come and talk to him
P4:41:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> He's also not a Redditor, which I find to be a slap in the face
P4:41:43 <Zuriki> Lol
P4:41:51 <Akai> Famous last words: "OWNED!!!!!!!!!!"
P4:42:17 <Zuriki> If he renames it back, organised raid will do just fine.
P4:42:19 <Zuriki> :]
P4:42:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll keep you guys informed ;)
P4:42:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> He told me I was begging, and that I don't have a monopoly on Reddit
P4:42:47 <Zuriki> Arm everyone with autoclickers and speedhax
P4:42:51 <Malcovent> =D
P4:42:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I basically just said Reddit Servers are fine, just not "Reddit Public"
P4:43:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup... Will do
P4:43:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Griefing for great justice?  :P
P4:43:23 <Zuriki> Yeah.
P4:43:29 <Malcovent> ooh o.o, thats a new concept!
P4:43:31 <Zuriki> It's officially supported.
P4:43:40 <Zuriki> Admin approval.
P4:43:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> He took the server down, probably to go to sleep
P4:43:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> He did the same thing @ the same time lastnight
P4:44:00 <Malcovent> pph x_x
P4:44:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> When it was named "Reddit Public Smallspace Server"
P4:44:29 <Angrybanana> "Not AlLnAtuRalX's Reddit Public"
P4:44:31 <Angrybanana> Is it that one?
P4:44:31 <Angrybanana> Lol
P4:44:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P4:44:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Most people think it's a guy named Phil's
P4:44:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> because of the e-mail....
P4:44:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> (My name is Phil, but it gets kind of annoying when people don't believe I'm the admin)

P5:03:03 <peerkoel> I don't know why I payed any more, but I felt compelled
P5:03:13 <Akai> is there a way to ban somebody when they're not on the server without knowing their IP?
P5:03:17 <Malcovent> i like supporting indie developers x_x

P5:10:26 <Akai> I suggested the ability to turn invisible

P5:12:09 <Malcovent> i'd love to have illusion blocks..

P5:15:14 <Zuriki> Ladder block?
P5:15:14 <Eagle> You can place it in the editor.
P5:15:34 <Eagle> Just  call it an elevator block and color it black
P5:16:39 <Malcovent> hmm
P5:16:47 <Malcovent> make a ladder block x_x <3
P5:19:38 <Akai> question... after three griefing attacks in 10 minutes, would you say it's reasonable to lock down a server with a spawn prison?
P5:19:53 <Malcovent> id say so
P5:19:58 <Malcovent> personally if someone asks to be let out, i let them out
P5:20:05 <Malcovent> as greifers tend not to take time to ask/make effort.
P5:20:11 <Akai> Bodenslammer did
P5:20:18 <Akai> so I'm not even letting them out if they ask
P5:20:20 <Malcovent> some do, yes =P
P5:20:24 <Malcovent> i still follow people around

P5:44:31 <Malcovent> indeed
P5:44:38 <Malcovent> well you know what i mean
P5:44:42 <PuyoDead> "why is everyone in the sky?"
P5:44:44 <Malcovent> think of how weird

P9:11:16 <Malcovent> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=1025
P9:11:19 <Malcovent> i decided to anger the mappers
P9:11:19 <Malcovent> =D
P9:13:12 <chrstfer> look at my post
P9:13:36 <PuyoDead> that wouldn't be hard, but I have a question
P9:13:52 <PuyoDead> "although would it be possible to have it about 5-10 layers above the land"
P9:13:58 <chrstfer> ill make it right now
P9:14:06 <PuyoDead> you mean the op block wall would be hovering above the land?
P9:14:07 <chrstfer> yeh that part confused me
P9:14:30 <Malcovent> ah sorry ill edit that
P9:14:34 <PuyoDead> if it goes all the way to the floor, people can't spawn through it, hence, even more protection
P9:14:36 <Malcovent> i meant the wall 5-10 blocks higher than the land
P9:14:39 <Malcovent> should of stated x_x
P9:14:41 <PuyoDead> ahh
P9:15:05 <chrstfer> ill make in OME now and share with you. k?
P9:15:05 <PuyoDead> so you don't want the area completely op block protected?
P9:15:12 <Malcovent> not completely
P9:15:16 <Malcovent> just a 10 or so high wall
P9:15:16 <PuyoDead> weird
P9:15:20 <Malcovent> to 'deter' people =P
P9:15:26 <Malcovent> and ill leave a op to guard it xD
P9:15:28 <PuyoDead> oh yea right :P
P9:15:35 <PuyoDead> you know what will happen
P9:15:37 <chrstfer> y not all the way up?
P9:15:49 <Malcovent> meh, looks uglier,
P9:15:59 <Malcovent> going to turn it into a castle wall
P9:16:01 <PuyoDead> "hey, there's something on the other side of this wall... but you can't see it!" unless you climb a couple blocks.
P9:16:03 <Malcovent> and leave a spare op on it
P9:16:13 <Malcovent> xD like i said <3 we'll make a bridge and open it at times
P9:16:18 <Malcovent> when theres not 16 or so people wandering about
P9:16:25 <PuyoDead> just saying, it's like an invitation
P9:16:32 <Malcovent> meh, we'll see =P
P9:16:41 <Malcovent> if they hop it theyll have multiple op's running after them madly.
P9:17:03 <PuyoDead> you can just add more manually if it becomes a problem
P9:17:09 <Malcovent> can even force my op's to dress up in policeman outfits! x_x!
P9:17:11 <PuyoDead> but that's an easy one to make, heh
P9:17:17 <Malcovent> ah ok =P
P9:17:19 <Malcovent> im useless with ome
P9:17:24 <Malcovent> (the fact it wont even work anymore..)
P9:17:31 <Malcovent> (on my computer*)

P9:18:09 <chrstfer> 512x512x128?
P9:18:14 <Malcovent> sounds about right
P9:18:36 <Malcovent> =p thanks for this

P9:33:57 <Malcovent> not that i know x_x this is a fun problem with ome
P9:34:06 <Malcovent> the inability to draw in a straight line without hours of work xD
P9:35:18 <PuyoDead> I used photoshop, myself
