A1:36:59 <Quatroking> I think there is
10A1:37:02 * Redshift_ is now known as Redshift
A1:37:18 <Quatroking> two maps of 256x256x64?
A1:37:53 <Trashman> um
A1:38:02 <Quatroking> standard server map
A1:38:02 <Trashman> diff size maps
A1:38:12 <Quatroking> :/
A1:38:22 <Quatroking> then I don't really know if its possible
A1:38:32 <Trashman> hmm
A1:38:46 <Quatroking> you'd have to manually hex an empty file and throw in the bytes of the two maps
10A1:38:57 * Gaviarctica (teemuc_93@a91-154-241-80.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
A1:39:01 <Quatroking> at least thats the only way I can think of
A1:39:06 <Quatroking> not even sure if that would work
A1:40:11 <Trashman> well i wanted something from a smaller map into a bigger one
A1:40:41 <Trashman> thinking i could hex it in.  then us a map editor ounce the size it right
A1:40:55 <Quatroking> Should be possible in some way
A1:41:16 <Quatroking> mape an empty map using OME that meets the sizes then hex it in?
A1:41:33 <Trashman> yah, thats what i was saying
A1:41:47 <Trashman> or what i meant atleast
A1:41:57 <Quatroking> and then just finish it up a little in OME again
A1:42:03 <Quatroking> don't see why that wouldn't work
A1:42:19 <Trashman> well can i just resize the existing smaller map? :\
A1:42:47 <Trashman> that would be the easy fix, but i dont think so
A1:42:57 <Quatroking> don't think so
A1:43:17 <Quatroking> you'd have to edit the header and change the bytes so it matches
A1:43:21 <Quatroking> which is probably a bitch

A2:00:18 <Quatroking> hai
A2:01:06 <Quatroking> I just downloading this program called UltraMon, and now I've got two taskbars :D
A2:02:15 <Quatroking> *downloaded
A2:03:29 <Punx_Work> def gotta check that out
A2:03:46 <Punx_Work> o long as I can install it without needing admin priviledges im set
A2:03:58 <Quatroking> i dunno
A2:04:06 <Quatroking> it adds two extra buttons to all of your windows
A2:04:30 <Quatroking> so you can quickly maximize the window over two screens and switch from screen
A2:04:34 <Punx_Work> i like buttons
A2:04:56 <Quatroking> what Ireally like about this is that the taskbars each show the programs on the monitor they're on
A2:05:11 <Quatroking> for example I've got xChat on monitor two, so taskbar two shows it there
A2:05:24 <Quatroking> firefox on monitor one, taskbar one is showing firefox
A2:05:26 <Quatroking> pretty neat
A2:07:21 <Punx_Work> oh nice
A2:07:25 <Punx_Work> u need admin to install it :(
A2:07:32 <Quatroking> I guess
A2:07:45 <Quatroking> why don't you have admin access
A2:07:47 <Punx_Work> lamesauce
A2:07:52 <Punx_Work> I'm at work
A2:08:06 <Quatroking> your work is gay
A2:08:31 <Quatroking> at least I get to have admin access over at my job
A2:08:38 <Quatroking> which is pretty natural..

A4:57:56 <Lukeybatman> We might if we do earn money from this though...
A4:58:57 <Lukeybatman> which will probably mean donations into my business and probably if notch gets more traffic due to this
A4:59:23 <Quatroking> eh
A4:59:35 <Quatroking> why would notch get more traffic from spleef competitions
A5:00:17 <Lukeybatman> I don't know, maybe people could stumble on the competition before Minecraft...?
A5:00:30 <Lukeybatman> I'm just thinking, this competition thing could work

A5:49:07 <Lukeybatman> What would be the url if I chose to side with you?
A5:49:13 <Punx_Work> well unless you bought a domain it would be www.whateveryouwant.leetfish.com
A5:49:39 <Punx_Work> unlimited hosting with mysql, php, ftp and no ads.
A5:50:23 <Lukeybatman> interesting.
A5:50:33 <Lukeybatman> I'll talk to Joat about it

A6:05:09 <Punx_Work> I probably add to that verdict liq.. I apologize.. I'm very lonely at work..
A6:05:11 <doohan> What are they using?
A6:05:15 <citricsquid> phpbb is the most disgustingly bloated software ever.
A6:05:17 <Punx_Work> ooohhhhh
A6:05:17 <liq3> I don't know, but it sucks. :/
A6:05:26 <doohan> You kids and your forums.
A6:05:26 <liq3> "New Posts" doesn't work properly.
A6:05:31 <Punx_Work> I thought you meant the content, not the forum itself
A6:05:39 <liq3> Nah, the forum code is terrible.
A6:05:42 <Punx_Work> yeah the new posts is annoying when it shows my posts..
A6:05:50 <citricsquid> liq: I agree that sucks, but besides that the forums are fine. I have a potential fix for that anyway, just need to finish my work before I can impliment it :D

A6:06:28 <liq3> Basically.
A6:06:45 <liq3> If I visit the forums, then come back 10 minutes later (i.e. refresh the page), it'll think I've checked every thread. :/
A6:06:47 <Punx_Work> i spam thi shit out of the New Posts button
A6:06:53 <liq3> It's annoying as hell.

A7:16:23 <Enthernalcz> get some fertilizer then no?
A7:16:37 <Lukeybatman> Its just one patch I'm waiting on...
A7:16:49 <Sheezy> Basically my shitty nvidia 8600 decided to die and refuse to render anything 3d and my motherboard is too shitty
A7:16:54 <Sheezy> So i'm building a new computer
A7:17:07 <Sheezy> Got the motherboard, the RAM, the case, the power supply, and the graphics card
A7:17:10 <Sheezy> but no CPU ):
A7:18:03 <Enthernalcz> ok
A7:18:26 <Lukeybatman> YAY THE GRASS GREW
A7:19:34 <Enthernalcz> lol
A7:19:36 <Sheezy> Hey I have a computer question
A7:20:08 <Sheezy> Is it possible to have two different models of RAM in one DIMM channel on the motherboard?
A7:20:12 <Sheezy> or do they have to both be the same
13A7:24:24 * Enthernalcz slaps akuryo around a bit with a large trout
A7:25:00 <akuryo> YAY
A7:25:01 <Sheezy> So I guess nobody knows?
A7:25:19 <akuryo> its possible
A7:25:25 <akuryo> but it will auto set to the lowest frequence
A7:25:44 <akuryo> i used to use old ram found i dunno where on my old computer
A7:26:10 <Sheezy> You mean like if I had 800 mhz RAM and 1066 nhz RAM on the same DMM the 1066 would go down to 800?
A7:26:19 <Punz> lol 5fps
13A7:26:44 * Enthernalcz slaps akuryo around a bit with a large trout

A7:28:06 <akuryo> yeah
A7:28:08 <akuryo> sorry
A7:28:11 <akuryo> that's what i meant
A7:28:33 <akuryo> actually... you can change the frequency
A7:28:38 <akuryo> but you risk some over heating
A7:29:00 <Sheezy> Yeah
A7:29:24 <Sheezy> Let me check the mhz of the RAM I am wanting to add along with the G.SKILL 1066 mhz I have
A7:29:40 <akuryo> k
A7:29:47 <akuryo> g skills are cheap anyway
A7:29:50 <Sheezy> If its over it I think the G.SKILL would handle it fine due to the heat spreaders
A7:29:50 <Lukeybatman> I wonder how I should do the writing "War of the colours"
A7:30:12 <akuryo> you mean pixely?
A7:30:16 <akuryo> i can do it for you
A7:30:16 <Sheezy> 800 mhz
A7:30:19 <Testvan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_zL2fb4vAQ
A7:30:19 <Sheezy> ://
A7:30:33 <Sheezy> I'll just stick with only the G.SKILL
A7:30:50 <Sheezy> Since if I added the new RAM it would only add 2 gb total
A7:30:58 <Sheezy> So meh
A7:31:21 <akuryo> testvan lol
A7:31:26 <Sheezy> Well thanks
A7:32:00 <akuryo> np
10A7:32:01 * xetam (zzzz@177-goc-17.acn.waw.pl) has joined #minecraft
A7:32:45 <Testvan> wazap w/ u?
A7:33:26 <Sheezy> Oh and another newbie question
A7:33:39 <Sheezy> is there any difference between PCI x16_1 and PCI x16_2
A7:33:50 <Sheezy> Physically they look exactly the same
A7:34:03 <Testvan> its it just the slot numbers?
A7:34:18 <Sheezy> It has two _2s and two _1s
A7:34:26 <Sheezy> I'm wondering if its just something to do with SLI or what
A7:34:53 <akuryo> in this vid
A7:34:59 <akuryo> mj looks more like a woman
A7:35:07 <akuryo> very strangely gayish =C
A7:35:14 <Lukeybatman> Agreed
A7:35:25 <Testvan> mj went from black man --> white woman
A7:35:29 <akuryo> xD
A7:35:30 <Testvan> ultimate transformation
A7:35:44 <Enthernalcz> mj?
A7:35:45 <akuryo> but he's still a good singer
A7:35:51 <akuryo> michael jackson
A7:35:59 <Enthernalcz> oh
A7:36:05 <Enthernalcz> he was*
A7:36:12 <Sheezy> for some reason I think the heat spreader on this RAM is pretty
A7:36:33 <akuryo> erm, i'll say he's still a good singer in our memory =)
A7:36:50 <Enthernalcz> and what about the modes?
A7:36:56 <Lukeybatman> I liked Mj before he changed.
A7:37:01 <akuryo> they are fucking blurry
A7:37:07 <Lukeybatman> I lost respect for him when he did change
A7:37:08 <akuryo> i can't really understand most
A7:37:09 <akuryo> i mean
A7:37:14 <Testvan> when MJ was black he was unstoppable
A7:37:15 <akuryo> i understood the sumo thing
A7:37:21 <Sheezy> Is it possible that PCI express x16_2 is PCI express 2.0 x16?
A7:37:27 <Testvan> no
A7:37:42 <akuryo> no lol
A7:37:56 <Testvan> do you have the manual?
A7:37:59 <akuryo> you probably have two ports
A7:38:07 <akuryo> but this is trange...
A7:38:14 <Sheezy> Theres four PCI express x16 total
A7:38:15 <akuryo> is your mb made for dual card or whatever?
A7:38:21 <Sheezy> two are _1 and two are _2
A7:38:29 <akuryo> wtf lol
A7:38:29 <Sheezy> It said SLI ready so i'd think so
A7:38:32 <akuryo> no wait
A7:38:37 <akuryo> you can't have two pci express
A7:38:46 <akuryo> i probly have two PCI
A7:38:47 <Sheezy> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131361
A7:38:49 <akuryo> and two PCI E
A7:39:00 <akuryo> are you sure the other are not simple PCI ports?
A7:39:09 <Sheezy> Yeah theres two other simple PCI ports
A7:39:14 <akuryo> so
A7:39:15 <Sheezy> Theres 6 ports total
A7:39:18 <akuryo> erm
A7:39:19 <akuryo> wtf
A7:39:21 <akuryo> no
A7:39:23 <akuryo> i see lol

A10:34:42 <citricsquid> I'm tempted to build a grief report system
A10:34:47 <citricsquid> where admins can add their server
A10:34:52 <citricsquid> then users can enter a server ID
A10:34:59 <citricsquid> and then if they submit a report it sends it to the server admin
A10:35:02 <citricsquid> through forums
A10:35:03 <citricsquid> =o
A10:35:43 <Roras> uh
A10:35:47 <Roras> too complicated
A10:36:13 <citricsquid> ='(
A10:36:14 <Rroff> would be nice if there was such features ingame
A10:36:20 <Rroff> another reason for implementing RPC
A10:36:33 <Enthernalcz> first we need axis movement and movable objects
A10:36:36 <Roras> how bout just make a system that logs anyone who updated more than 5 chunks a second
A10:36:39 <Enthernalcz> then importing and exporting
A10:36:48 <Enthernalcz> and then anti-grief
A10:36:53 <Roras> how bout just make a system that logs anyone who updated more than 5 chunks a second
A10:37:01 <Rroff> I realised the other night
A10:37:08 <Rroff> you can't really have moving blocks
A10:37:22 <citricsquid> chunkrape =D
A10:37:28 <Enthernalcz> it could be like droping
A10:37:46 <Enthernalcz> sand drops=instantly on the place
A10:37:52 <Rroff> its voxel based so they can only move in steps the size of the block
A10:38:00 <Enthernalcz> we atleast need a tool to move a bulk of blocks

A10:38:38 <Enthernalcz> yes
A10:38:39 <Rroff> yeah but you'd move in jumps
A10:38:41 <Mikesword221> I need to know something.
A10:38:42 <citricsquid> they could become a single entitity and update position at speed.

A10:38:59 <Roras> god its impossible to find this file

A10:39:09 <Mikesword221> If I buy the game on 1 computer, could I put it on other computers for free?
A10:39:10 <Enthernalcz> better then something
A10:39:18 <Enthernalcz> that doesnt do nothing
A10:39:23 <Rroff> which would work, but limit the number of moving blocks you could have

A11:41:44 <citricsquid> oh, good point =D
A11:41:48 <citricsquid> arrow keys? :P
A11:41:55 <08Notch> and Mikesword221.. I'd LOOOVE to get on steam
A11:41:55 <Jeramy> Maybe enable cursor while tab is held?
A11:42:02 <08Notch> I could do that
A11:42:08 <08Notch> and let people click names
A11:42:08 <Roras> what is noclip
A11:42:14 <Resetting> Implement a cursor popping up when you press tab? =D
A11:42:15 <ZomBuster> noclip = flying
A11:42:20 <Enthernalcz> going through matter lol
A11:42:21 <Roras> ...
A11:42:25 <Rroff> no collision between player and world
A11:42:26 <Roras> flying ruins the game
A11:42:29 <citricsquid> notch: that'd be best, simple to use, not overly complicated.
A11:42:32 <Rroff> along with no gravity interaction
A11:42:41 <08Notch> ok, I'll add that
A11:42:43 <Enthernalcz> flying in a frozen mode with the ability to go through objects
A11:43:01 <Roras> how bout spectator mode...
A11:43:01 <PuyoDead> ooo, arrow keys to select names?
A11:43:07 <Resetting> do what? cursor while tab or arrow keys?
A11:43:13 <Roras> and allow one to set area by spectating
A11:43:16 <Enthernalcz> we need a MINIMAP
A11:43:18 <08Notch> which one do you want?
13A11:43:30 * ZomBuster slaps his forehead
A11:43:32 <ZomBuster> of course!
A11:43:34 <Rroff> actually that would be kinda cool - tho a lot of work
A11:43:45 <Rroff> minimap which you can put landmarks on and teleport to those landmarks heh
A11:43:46 <PuyoDead> I imagine arrow keys would be easier
A11:43:47 <citricsquid> Mouse would probably be best, so we don't have to scroll through lots of names if server has 32 players :D
A11:43:48 <Resetting> hmm, idk, i think the arrow keys would suit the game better tbh.
A11:43:52 <Jeramy> I vote for cursor
A11:44:04 <Jeramy> Although i wouldnt hate arrow keys
A11:44:10 <Enthernalcz> i for cursor
A11:44:12 <Roras> spectator mode... works like noclip except you dont see people flying around, because there is no sprite..
A11:44:22 <Mikesword221> I vote for blocky cursor!
A11:44:25 <Roras> lol
A11:44:25 <Resetting> back later, off for food

A11:45:14 <Roras> ok ill leave you guys to the ideas
A11:45:17 <Enthernalcz> and the minimap would have these functions:a COMPASS,top view with scrolling through layers,view of only specified blocks and the the landamark to teleport to

A11:49:27 <akuryo> yeah
A11:49:28 <Arzock> or bulding.
A11:49:34 <akuryo>  /noalter command
A11:49:39 <Jeramy> Why would you want to pause the server?
A11:49:46 <Rroff> Are you using sparse octrees Notch?
A11:49:54 <peerkoel> world freeze is good
A11:49:55 <Enthernalcz> mainly we need sounds and music and then importing and exporting,THEN survival mode prototype
A11:50:00 <peerkoel> especially when ops are off
A11:50:04 <08Notch> no, octtrees slowed down rendering
A11:50:12 <Arzock> How come citric isn't an admin anymore?
A11:50:13 <Rroff> ah
A11:50:15 <Enthernalcz> pause server if you want to repair something or work peacefully

A11:50:39 <citricsquid> akur: I just didn't log in.
A11:50:43 <akuryo> ok =C
A11:50:51 <Zararara> what would 'pause server' do exactly

A11:51:01 <Arzock> Pause the server?
A11:51:03 <akuryo> like massive flooding
A11:51:05 <Arzock> =P
A11:51:05 <akuryo> you pause
A11:51:11 <akuryo> yeah
A11:51:19 <Rroff> thinking of making a tool to repair griefing from 2 different versions of a level... but I think the preview is gonna have my upto my ears in code I don't understand
A11:51:20 <akuryo> it will just stop the movements
A11:51:21 <Arzock> Are we ever gonna get to put down liquids?
A11:51:25 <Enthernalcz> pause server,everybody loged off exept OPS and you

A11:51:41 <akuryo> no
A11:51:45 <akuryo> not this way
A11:51:49 <Rroff> prolly just go with raycasting into the block array to check vis

A11:57:20 <dillon> i compile it, but says that com.mojang.minecraft.level does not exist
A11:57:31 <dillon> which I guess means that notch changed the class names?
A11:57:42 <peerkoel> did you expand the classpath?
A11:57:56 <dillon> i tihnk so
A11:58:00 <Zararara> minecraft wiki is missing admincrete blocks
A11:58:27 <Rroff> request changing map format to simplified XML :P
A11:58:46 <peerkoel> 4MB of bytes in XML? no way
A11:58:56 <akuryo> lol
A11:58:59 <akuryo> peerk is right
A11:59:05 <Rroff> what?
A11:59:12 <akuryo> rrof
A11:59:12 <Rroff> did you miss the simplified bit

A11:59:36 <dillon> thats what i'm doin
A11:59:40 <Rroff> the world lump would still be a char array
A11:59:50 <peerkoel> ok, on windows the classpath separator is ; not :
A11:59:52 <Zararara> runlength encode it then
A11:59:56 <Zararara> do I have to think of everything
P12:00:09 <dillon> so...
P12:00:16 <Rroff> just making the header easier to process and level editor can store info in there withoyut breaking the format
P12:00:20 <dillon> C:\>javac -classpath .;minecraft-server.jar LevelEditor.java Blocks.java ?
11P12:00:27 <DBN> ultimate anti-griefing tool would be to have the server save all the actions of each player to a file and have a /undo <player> command that completely reverts them

P12:00:50 <dillon> ty peerkoel

P12:04:22 <Super-Dot> Hoy Notch!
P12:04:34 <Super-Dot> I have two bug report/feature requests.
P12:04:43 <akuryo> tell the,
P12:04:46 <akuryo> now
P12:05:02 <Super-Dot> One! Can custom skins' arms and legs be mirrored?
P12:05:15 <Super-Dot> It's tricky to do shoulders the way they work now.
P12:05:25 <Super-Dot> Two! Tab has never worked on Macs.
P12:05:35 <Super-Dot> It'd be cool if it, y'know, did.
P12:05:39 <Resetting> Two! get a real computer. =D
P12:05:55 <Super-Dot> yes thank you that is helpful
P12:06:00 <akuryo> lol
P12:06:06 <Resetting> ^^
P12:06:10 <akuryo> superdot
P12:06:18 <akuryo> im waiting for keymapping too...
P12:06:37 <akuryo> but he says it's not very important
P12:06:46 <Super-Dot> Yeah, keymapping would be nice.
P12:06:48 <akuryo> i have to move using ZQSD instead of WASD
P12:06:52 <akuryo> ...
P12:06:54 <Mikesword221> So, Notch, what level converters do you have planed and how will they work?
P12:07:16 <Super-Dot> I play Minecraft in QWERTY, then switch keyboard layouts every time I type.
P12:07:31 <ZomBuster> Why would Notch make level converters, make them yourself :D
P12:07:37 <Resetting> akuryo, what kinda keyboard do you have? D=
P12:07:43 <akuryo> azerty
P12:07:43 <Super-Dot> It'd be neat if I could just stay in Dvorak the whole time.
P12:07:48 <Resetting> oh you poor thing.
P12:07:50 <peerkoel> arrow keys still work, no?
P12:07:51 <Mikesword221> I mean map importers.
P12:07:58 <Resetting> yeah keymapping for akuryo then please.
P12:07:58 <akuryo> yeah
P12:08:03 <akuryo> but
P12:08:05 <liq3> Super-Dot: Just learn both QWERTY and Dvorak, what I've done.
P12:08:07 <akuryo> JUMP?
P12:08:10 <akuryo> space only
P12:08:16 <peerkoel> I see your point
P12:08:18 <akuryo> xD
P12:08:26 <akuryo> how am i supposed to move and jump with the same hand
P12:08:33 <peerkoel> grow a third
P12:08:41 <akuryo> you see =/
P12:08:43 <Super-Dot> But I learned Dvorak because I was too lazy to learn QWERTY D:
P12:08:44 <peerkoel> I see your point
P12:09:12 <liq3> Well.
P12:09:17 <liq3> Super-Dot, I think there's another way.
P12:09:30 <Super-Dot> :O
P12:10:06 <akuryo> keymapping
P12:10:06 <liq3> You can make an AHK script to convert ,aoe (dvorak wasd) into QWERTY WASD, and when you press T switch back to normal, I think.
P12:10:13 <akuryo> super dot
P12:10:15 <liq3> And then back to other when you press enter.
P12:10:16 <liq3> o.O
P12:10:19 <akuryo> you want me to program so soft for you?
P12:10:20 <liq3> Or keymapping.
P12:10:29 <akuryo> just tell me the key you want
P12:10:41 <akuryo> you want or not?
P12:10:49 <Super-Dot> I'm on OS X, so AHK isn't available
P12:10:53 <Super-Dot> so soft huh?
P12:10:55 <akuryo> ho
P12:10:57 <akuryo> but in .exe
P12:11:20 <akuryo> but if you can compile C++
P12:11:24 <akuryo> i can give you sources
P12:11:34 <Rroff> why do people use Dvorak?
P12:11:53 <Super-Dot> Sources for what? I'm confused
P12:12:09 <liq3> Rroff: Because it's superior to QWERTY for actual typing.
P12:12:13 <Rroff> how so?
P12:12:19 <liq3> Google it. :/
P12:12:19 <Super-Dot> Less finger movement
P12:12:35 <Rroff> I'm not convinced
P12:12:41 <Rroff> I barely move my fingers as it is
P12:12:42 <Super-Dot> Some people claim speed gains, but most of them are lying
P12:12:46 <liq3> Dvorak isn't even a problem, it's silly programmers not using key positions.
P12:13:01 <Rroff> well true

04P12:13:09 Haggle has the same ISP district as chewy.
P12:13:09 <Rroff> but I still dunno why anyone would use Dvorak
P12:13:13 <Super-Dot> It's used by old people to prevent RSI
P12:13:20 <akuryo> xD
P12:13:25 <Super-Dot> My dad uses it for that reason
P12:13:30 <liq3> Or cure RSI.
P12:13:49 <Rroff> only way I could see it helping with RSI is if you switched between layouts regularly
P12:13:54 <liq3> I know I've read reports of people with wrist pain, and it goes away after they switch from QWERTY to Dvorak.
P12:14:03 <Rroff> yeah but
P12:14:10 <Rroff> if they carried on using it for awhile
P12:14:13 <Rroff> pain would come back
P12:14:22 <Rroff> its the switching that helps
P12:14:25 <liq3> Rroff: Please explain your WONDERFUL logic.
P12:14:37 <Super-Dot> Wuh? No, it's not the switching that helps
P12:14:47 <Super-Dot> It's that your fingers move less
P12:14:49 <akuryo> yeah
P12:14:54 <akuryo> it's also used to be faster
P12:14:56 <akuryo> when typing
P12:15:03 <Super-Dot> And when they do move, they move short distances most of the time
P12:15:05 <liq3> Record typing speed was and is set on Dvorak.
P12:15:19 <Rroff> much of RSI comes from holding the arm/fingers in teh same way and doing the same actions over and over
P12:15:23 <Super-Dot> In QWERTY, your fingers are constantly bouncing around on the keyboard
P12:15:33 <Rroff> change layout and you change the orientation of your fingers
P12:15:34 <Super-Dot> In Dvorak, they spend most of their time on the home row
P12:15:56 <Rroff> reduced movement will help a bit
P12:15:56 <Zararara> I have to write in portuguese and english
P12:15:59 <Zararara> your argument is invalid.
P12:16:05 <Rroff> but the major effect comes from changing orientation
P12:16:08 <liq3> Rroff: RSI is only a problem when your body can't keep up. :/
P12:16:10 <Rroff> it WILL come back after awhile
P12:16:21 <Rroff> and then changing back to QWERTY could have benefits
P12:16:27 <liq3> Rroff: Define "while"? 
P12:16:32 <Rroff> indeffinate
P12:16:35 <Rroff> depends on person to person
P12:16:36 <liq3> rofl.
P12:16:54 <Rroff> god theres some dense people in here
11P12:17:10 <DBN> i think he means when you switch you're not used to it at first and so you go slower
P12:17:14 <liq3> No longer suffering from RSI Guy - "So yeh, been 20 years since I changed to Dvorak, think I'll get RSI again before I die?" Joe - "Nah probably not. You might get it in the afterlife though."

P12:22:09 <peerkoel> there's just so many proxies in this world..
P12:22:13 <Rroff> as there is less movement then some people might never have a problem again in theory

P12:25:16 <liq3> Roras: Hardly.
P12:25:21 <Roras> yes
P12:25:31 <Roras> too much hassle switching between the two modes
P12:25:36 <liq3> Uh, no....
P12:25:40 <liq3> 1 - pickaxe
P12:25:47 <liq3> ... You did read the survival blog?
P12:25:56 <Roras> no
P12:25:58 <liq3> ...
P12:26:09 <liq3> Ok basically, those 9 slots we have now for blocks... They'll be an inventory.
P12:26:15 <liq3> First  slot always pickaxe.
P12:26:20 <Roras> ok
P12:26:22 <liq3> When you destroy blocks, they'll drop bricks.
P12:26:26 <liq3> You have to pick the bricks up to create. :P
P12:26:35 <Roras> hm
P12:26:49 <liq3> bricks of the same type will stack in a single inv slot up to a max amount.
P12:26:50 <Roras> tedious, unless you can auto-pickup
P12:27:00 <ReaperSWE> pickaxe, shovel, dynamite?, plant-shovel...

P12:27:48 <Roras> okay
P12:28:07 <Roras> how much space allocated for dirt? how much for stone
P12:28:13 <liq3> Still, the kind of stuff people are gonna do in CTF. :D

P12:28:34 <Roras> i think kicking shovel out would be nnice

P12:28:39 <Roras> pointless
P12:28:47 <liq3> pointless?
P12:28:49 <peerkoel> "When you destroy a block, most blocks will release resources. In the case of stone, they will spawn small stone blocks. You can pick these up by walking over them if you‚Äôve got an empty inventory slot..." http://notch.tumblr.com/post/123343045/my-vision-for-survival

P12:28:52 <Roras> yes
P12:29:01 <liq3> yes, hitpoints.
P12:29:04 <Roras> you can just hit the ground with a pickaxe
P12:29:07 <liq3> In survival they'll be restored by food.
P12:29:11 <Roras> and it will do the same thing
P12:29:13 <Rroff> can imagine a lava mode where you only get a certain number of blocks to play with and gotta stay ahead of the lava flow
P12:29:26 <Roras> unless we are focusing on having tons of dirts

P12:41:51 <AlexVMiner> i like kicking myslef when I am an op
P12:42:20 <AlexVMiner> you can still delete it all and bar it off with op blocks
P12:42:24 <Resetting> you can sponge up all the water on the level and put opblocks infront of the edge of the map so no more can be created, yes.
P12:42:31 <AlexVMiner> yup

P1:41:04 <AlexVMiner> what is the point?
P1:41:14 <AlexVMiner> ip bans are long term
P1:41:15 <citricsquid> Why? If someone deserves a ban you shouldn't want them back...
P1:41:18 <AlexVMiner> or forever
P1:41:27 <liq3> citric: ban their nick, and tempban their ip.
P1:41:42 <liq3> their ip is probably going to change anyway, and no point having a ip banned for no reason.
P1:41:44 <citricsquid> but why? If someone is willing to register a new account to grief
P1:41:51 <citricsquid> they'll be willing to make a new account and change their IP
P1:41:53 <liq3> not to mention some innocent person may get the banned ip. :P

P1:42:36 <liq3> It's just not possible.
P1:42:58 <citricsquid> I don't see the need for multiple ban types, if someone is so desperate to grief they'll get past ANY measures
P1:43:04 <citricsquid> just over complicating it.
P1:43:36 <citricsquid> If you get to the point where you need to ban their IP, I'd rather not have them near my servers again, it's silly to use IP ban as anything but a last measure.
P1:43:46 <AlexVMiner> i wish I could stick all griefers of the world in a box and stuff a bomb in with them
P1:43:51 <AlexVMiner> a hydrogen bomb

P1:44:55 <citricsquid> So why do you need temp IP bans?
P1:45:04 <ReaperSWE> that's just stupid.
P1:45:09 <AlexVMiner> ?
P1:45:13 <liq3> Because, 90% of the griefers probably have a dynamic IP, which will change within a week.
P1:45:14 <citricsquid> "Oh, well, you only griefed a bit you can come back!"
P1:45:20 <citricsquid> so?

P3:41:42 <Batosai3591> lol sli computers <.<
P3:41:52 <ZomBuster> nice nice
P3:41:56 <Rroff> current spec is only x8 PCI-e 2.0 which is more than enough but still feels gimped
P3:42:25 <Rroff> current spec for I5 that is
P3:42:33 <Batosai3591> so whats up with the whole 300 core things comin out for commercial use.... anyone know?

P3:52:25 <Rroff> meh if you think SQL is simple
P3:52:28 <Siiseli> (that site is semi-wip)
P3:52:35 <Siiseli> Rroff, it's super simple
P3:52:36 <Rroff> you should try some of teh databases I used to develop back in teh day
P3:52:41 <citricsquid> SQL is ridiculously easy, it's just like HTML.
P3:52:47 <Siiseli> Rroff, do tell
P3:52:51 <Rroff> with some really silly complex relationships
P3:52:52 <Snowman> yeah html was the easiest thing i ever learned
P3:53:04 <Siiseli> citricsquid, tell me exactly what you did
P3:53:07 <Siiseli> so I can fix the site
P3:53:08 <Drakkar> its closer to php really
P3:53:11 <Drakkar> but still fairly easy
P3:53:12 <Snowman> only thing hard bout SQL are subqueries, which arent too hard
P3:53:14 <citricsquid> went to search page, clicked submit
P3:53:14 <Rroff> I'm talking SELECT stuff thats like 1-2KB long
P3:53:22 <Siiseli> nah they're not
P3:53:42 <Siiseli> Rroff, that's not sql being hard that's bad database design/tedious work
P3:53:47 <Snowman> they just require thinking, but im lazy for it :p
P3:53:52 <akuryo> what meants IT
P3:54:03 <Rroff> that wasn't bad design
P3:54:08 <Rroff> thats what was necessary
P3:54:12 <Siiseli> then it's just tedious work
P3:54:14 <Rroff> tho
P3:54:19 <Siiseli> we had a course on sql at school
P3:54:20 <Rroff> thats partly coz the client was an ass
P3:54:27 <Rroff> and insisting on silly things that didn't make sense
P3:54:28 <Siiseli> .. it was so simple I decided to fuck it and learn it on my own
P3:54:36 <Siiseli> so I basically did all the assignments
P3:54:44 <Siiseli> including this big database design thing at the end
P3:54:53 <Siiseli> in the following lessons
P3:54:54 <citricsquid> school has never been for learning.
P3:54:58 <Siiseli> 2 hours of work
P3:55:02 <Siiseli> citricsquid, sure hasn't.
P3:55:11 <Rroff> yeah but have you ever supported multiple sites and 300+ users and 30,000 odd client records?
P3:55:19 <Siiseli> so I attended 2 classes of sql and had the course done
P3:55:41 <Siiseli> Rroff, oh but the users don't matter?
P3:55:51 <Siiseli> but yeah I can imagine managing that is a pain in the ass
P3:56:00 <Rroff> well you gotta create a whole lot of different sets of reports and stuff
P3:56:04 <Rroff> for different users
P3:56:17 <Siiseli> what kind of reports

P3:57:26 <citricsquidtimeoutplx> most of Database work is more the design and functionality than the actual programming, in fact most programming is how to approach a solution than actually "make code".

P4:02:26 <betasword> Indeed, sound of some sort would be nice. I actually like that sound preview that was posted on Notch's blog a while ago.
P4:02:49 <betasword> Bah, I just want to be able to grow stuff in my underwater bunker.
P4:03:03 <Syndlig> One thing I didn't like about the sound preview was... the sound.
P4:03:05 <Syndlig> :P
P4:03:21 <CheeToS> 8 bit versions of songs :>
P4:03:23 <Syndlig> Digging in the ground sounded like you were swiping at grass.
P4:03:29 <CheeToS> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqYPFEXbbUo
P4:04:08 <Siiseli> damn you
P4:04:11 <Zuriki> I too disliked the SFX
P4:04:26 <Syndlig> The running around was fine.
P4:04:28 <Syndlig> So was the swimming.
P4:04:30 <Zuriki> I told C418 and he had a go at me and said he doesn't normally get it.
P4:04:33 <betasword> Well... Ok, I'll give you that. Some sounds could've been a bit more... Well, deep.
P4:04:34 <Syndlig> And the background music was really nice.
P4:04:35 <Zuriki> I was like
P4:04:39 <Zuriki> Arrogant.
P4:04:43 <Zuriki> -.-
P4:04:56 <Syndlig> The digging was all pretty terrible.
P4:04:59 <Siiseli> Zuriki, you know c418?
P4:05:00 <Siiseli> how
P4:05:01 <Syndlig> And the increasing pitch was annoying.
P4:05:06 <Siiseli> I don't think you're in tigirc
P4:05:09 <Syndlig> C418 is in IRC frequently.
P4:05:24 <Siiseli> oh he's here too?
P4:05:25 <Syndlig> Or he was.
P4:05:31 <Syndlig> For like, a tiny bit.
P4:05:35 <Syndlig> And inexplicably had OP powers.
P4:06:10 <Batosai3591> interesting
P4:06:20 <Syndlig> I'm waiting for light diffusion.
P4:06:24 <Syndlig> To make caves more awesome.
P4:06:30 <Syndlig> And pitch fuckin' black.  :P
P4:06:46 <Zuriki> We all want dynamic lighting at some point.
P4:07:01 <Syndlig> Well dynamic lighting won't likely happen.
P4:07:08 <Syndlig> Diffusion can be handled pretty easily in a basic sense.
P4:07:18 <Syndlig> Any block adjacent to a "fully lit" block is "x% lit"
P4:07:24 <Zuriki> Diffusion + Lanterns
P4:07:26 <Syndlig> Any block adjacent to that block is less lit.
P4:07:45 <Zuriki> The only problem is shadows.
P4:07:50 <Syndlig> So light wouldn't have to be "well it diffuses this much"
P4:07:52 <citricsquid> Installing centos from command line is fun.

P4:08:04 <Syndlig> It's just "this lantern projects a 5x5x5 area of light"
P4:08:19 <Zuriki> Shadows would... glow with darkness.
P4:08:31 <Syndlig> "so you have full light in that cube and half light 2 tiles out
P4:08:38 <Syndlig> Don't bother with shadows :P
P4:08:45 <Syndlig> This isn't a complex game and doesn't need complex things, really.
P4:08:45 <Zuriki> That doesn't work then.

P4:09:07 <Zuriki> A block emits a linear shadow atm.
P4:09:12 <Zuriki> If you had diffusion
P4:09:18 <Zuriki> it would be something like:
P4:09:30 <Zuriki> 00:33:66:100:66:33:00
P4:09:37 <Syndlig> Diffusion just means the further away from the source the darker it gets.
P4:10:02 <Syndlig> A single pinpoint of light can "light up" a pitch black room.
P4:10:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch has said how he plans to do lighting.
P4:10:20 <Zuriki> Hows that then.
P4:10:32 <Syndlig> Do share
P4:10:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Blocks basically "bleed" light.

P4:10:43 <vdgmprgrmr> To adjacent blocks.
P4:10:55 <vdgmprgrmr> It won't be exact, but it'll work.
P4:10:59 <Syndlig> So basically
P4:11:01 <Syndlig> What I said :D
P4:11:11 <Syndlig> Adjacent blocks are dimmer than the blocks they're touching.
P4:11:13 <Zuriki> So on a 3x3 grid. with a shadow in the center.
P4:11:17 <Syndlig> Until you get to pure darkness.
P4:11:19 <Zuriki> There would be no shadow.
P4:11:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Not necessarily.
P4:11:31 <vdgmprgrmr> It would be a very light shadow.
P4:11:38 <Syndlig> Which makes sense.
P4:11:47 <Syndlig> Shadows aren't just this pure black area on the ground.
P4:11:54 <Zuriki> No I know.
P4:11:59 <vdgmprgrmr> It really depends on how many "levels" of darkness there are.
P4:12:07 <Zuriki> Just one.
P4:12:13 <Zuriki> from a single block.
P4:12:34 <Syndlig> The only question is really, how is it going to handle obstructions?
P4:12:39 <vdgmprgrmr> No, wrong "levels" you're thinking of.
P4:12:57 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying, will there be a scale from 1 to 5, or a scale of 1 to 20.
P4:13:02 <vdgmprgrmr> On how dark it is.
P4:13:16 <Zuriki> Oh I see.
P4:13:19 <Syndlig> Question:  Has Notch said anything on how light will function when faced with a physical obstruction?
P4:13:31 <vdgmprgrmr> If there's very few, there very well may not be a shadow in that situation.

P4:13:35 <Syndlig> Like say you've got something that projects light and makes a 9x9x9 area of light.
P4:13:41 <Syndlig> And you stick a block right beside it.
P4:13:58 <Syndlig> that should prevent a huge amount of light.

P4:14:17 <Rroff> that could be very performance heavy
P4:14:21 <Syndlig> The entire area behind the block in a 90 degree arc would be dim or nonexistent depending on the intensity of the source.

P4:14:43 <Arzock> Yoyo
P4:15:02 <peerkoel> can anyone code something that saves the level you log in to?
P4:15:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Syndlig, he hasn't said that, but the way I figure light-sources would work (if I were in control) is this: A light source sends a ray out in each direction, and figures the distance to the nearest block in that direction, and then figures out how bright that block would be based on the distance, then the standard block-light-bleed process takes over from there.
P4:15:05 <Syndlig> Or is light going to simply say "screw physics" and just illuminate the area behind the block regardless?
P4:15:29 <peerkoel> a friend of mine built this single player level but we want to run around in it on multiplayer
P4:15:30 <Syndlig> Also what the hell is No More Sweden?

P4:16:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Did that explanation make sense?
P4:16:06 <Syndlig> I hope when he adds proper lighting it makes underground really fuckin' dark.  :D
P4:16:12 <Arzock> xD I keep trying to reload my sword in oblivion.
P4:16:13 <Evil-Ville> Me too Syndlig
P4:16:13 <Syndlig> It sorta did.
P4:16:32 <Syndlig> I'm assuming the light's gonna have a point where it simply stops.
P4:16:38 <Infinity> lolwut diffusive light in minecraft
P4:16:43 <Syndlig> A torch only illuminates so far.
P4:16:45 <Infinity> hard to imagine
P4:16:50 <Infinity> dynamic light in minecraft
P4:16:50 <ReaperSWE> When will op commands work with PARTIAL names?
P4:16:54 <Zuriki> How so?
P4:17:02 <Infinity> i've never seen dynamic light in a flash game

P4:17:06 <Infinity> java
P4:17:07 <Infinity> lol
P4:17:09 <peerkoel> tab nick completion ftw
P4:17:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Syndlig, because it figures the distance, and figures how brigh it would be from the distance, if the distance is too far, it will round down to 0 if it's too far.
P4:17:10 <Zuriki> o.o
P4:17:13 <Syndlig> You odn't play much java do you?
P4:17:18 <Infinity> runescape is probably the best java game in terms of graphics currently
P4:17:20 <Zuriki> I've seen dynamic light in a flash game.
P4:17:25 <Rroff> if you have opengl access you can do depth fail easy
P4:17:27 <ReaperSWE> There's dynamic light in Wurm Online
P4:17:28 <Infinity> yes but that's 2d
P4:17:28 <Rroff> but
P4:17:33 <Zuriki> No
P4:17:34 <Rroff> that wouldn't work with minecraft
P4:17:36 <Zuriki> 3D as well.
P4:18:07 <Evil-Ville> Why do people think java is some sort of gimped flash clone
P4:18:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Are there seriously people who think that?
P4:18:24 <ReaperSWE> flash is fail.
P4:18:34 <peerkoel> <ReaperSWE> flash is fail.  <-- 2nd that
P4:18:41 <Zuriki> Were you point to me Evil?
P4:18:43 <Zuriki> Cause I never said that.
P4:18:48 <Evil-Ville> Yes vdgmprgrmr
P4:18:56 <vdgmprgrmr> <peerkoel><ReaperSWE> flash is fail.  <-- 2nd that <-- 2nd that
P4:19:00 <Syndlig> Who would even think that?
P4:19:02 <Infinity> Evil i don't have that impression
P4:19:07 <Infinity> Java can do a lot more than flash
P4:19:14 <Syndlig> I mean, Java's been around longer.
P4:19:24 <Syndlig> And aside from being inefficient it's a pretty decent coding language.
P4:19:26 <Syndlig> Flash is, uh...
P4:19:27 <Syndlig> Flash.
P4:19:43 <ReaperSWE> I really don't like flash running in the background when not used
P4:19:46 <ReaperSWE> err Java
P4:20:38 <Rroff> I hate stuff that puts a million entries in my startup/processes

P4:33:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I guess you are.
P4:33:57 <citricsquid> evil: I don't, never come into contact with it :D
P4:34:12 <Evil-Ville> People get too attached to their buildings
P4:34:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Why not? They built it, and they like it.
P4:34:52 <vdgmprgrmr> It's pretty easy to see why someone would not want it destroyed.
P4:35:03 <peerkoel> that's what private servers are for
P4:35:05 <peerkoel> and...
P4:35:10 <peerkoel> the minecraft museum :)
P4:35:18 <ReaperSWE> If you spend hours on something, wouldn't you be mad if someone ruined it in a couple of seconds?
P4:35:21 <citricsquid> I only build seriously when I'm either an op or on private. 
P4:35:23 <Evil-Ville> No
P4:35:33 <ReaperSWE> You're weird.
P4:35:36 <Evil-Ville> All of the things I've built so far have been destroyed
P4:35:37 <peerkoel> you'd be a foor to build it in a public server
P4:35:44 <Evil-Ville> It's not like I am doing anything with the stuff I've built
P4:35:48 <peerkoel> if you care to keep it, that is
P4:36:08 <vdgmprgrmr> What if you're still building it?
P4:36:15 <vdgmprgrmr> What if you like the way it looks?
P4:36:16 <fydo> yeah! don't be a foor
P4:36:44 <Evil-Ville> That's just a risk you have to take when building on a public server
13P4:36:47 * peerkoel hands fydo a cookie
P4:36:52 <Evil-Ville> If it happens the only person you can blame is yourself
P4:37:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, using that same logic (not using it, who cares if it's destroyed), then it shouldn't be a big deal for major pieces of art to be destroyed, either.
P4:37:42 <peerkoel> if you make art with chalk in the streets, then yeah
P4:37:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't matter what art.
P4:37:57 <peerkoel> it does
P4:38:08 <peerkoel> paintings go in museums or private collections
P4:38:13 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not being used, thus, if the Mona Lisa was burned, it shouldn't matter.
P4:38:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Museums, like, public places.
P4:38:58 <Evil-Ville> You're comparing something that exists in a videogame to an actual painting
P4:39:05 <vdgmprgrmr> It's still work.
P4:39:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Someone made it.
P4:39:11 <Evil-Ville> The biggest difference is that destroying the other is a crime and destroying the other isn't
P4:39:23 <vdgmprgrmr> That's not the point.
P4:39:29 <Evil-Ville> I don't care what the point is
P4:39:32 <vdgmprgrmr> By your logic, it shouldn't be a crime.
P4:39:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Just because it exists in a video game doesn't mean people can't like it.
P4:40:03 <peerkoel> the mona lisa is not out on the streets, for anyone to touch
P4:40:05 <Evil-Ville> Have I said that admins shouldn't kick people if they catch them griefing
P4:40:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Well why should they?
P4:40:26 <vdgmprgrmr> If it doesn't matter?
P4:40:32 <peerkoel> they should when people complain
P4:40:32 <Evil-Ville> It doesn't matter to me
P4:40:36 <peerkoel> to keep the game fun for all
P4:41:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Why does griefing make it less fun?
P4:41:15 <Super-Dot> Why do people want a /bring command?
P4:41:20 <vdgmprgrmr> It shouldn't, if people shouldn't care.
P4:41:35 <Evil-Ville> shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't
P4:41:37 <vdgmprgrmr> If anything they create is destroyed.
P4:41:40 <Super-Dot> I'm not against it, I just don't see what it's for
P4:41:52 <Super-Dot> And how it differs much from /kick or /tp
P4:42:29 <Prime_2> Building a great structure takes a lot of tiem and effort.
P4:42:42 <vdgmprgrmr> And it tends to look pretty good when it's done.
P4:42:59 <Prime_2> Ruining it can take less than a minute
P4:43:00 <Super-Dot> Though on a similar note, I think /expelliarmus would be terrific
P4:43:08 <Evil-Ville> So build it in a private server or single player
P4:43:23 <Prime_2> You build it to show to other people.
P4:43:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, what you're suggesting is that public servers are for destruction.
P4:43:32 <Prime_2> and much of the time, these things are joint projects
P4:43:38 <Prime_2> people work together to make stuff.
P4:43:46 <Evil-Ville> They are aren't they
P4:43:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Not exclusively.
P4:43:57 <Prime_2> I've worked with other people to create really cool shit that could easily be completely ruined by a single griefer in an instant
P4:44:03 <Evil-Ville> They're filled with people sitting around whining about griefing
P4:44:08 <Prime_2> stuff that took hours to make
P4:44:37 <Prime_2> Evil-Ville, are you a griefer?
P4:44:43 <peerkoel> haha
P4:45:00 <Evil-Ville> Who knows
P4:45:19 <Prime_2> What would you do if something you spent hours making was destroyed by a griefer, huh?
P4:45:32 <Prime_2> to have all that work undone because some asshole wants to have shits and giggles at your expense
P4:45:32 <ReaperSWE> if I see Evil-Ville in a server I'm op in, he'll get banned.
P4:45:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Agrees ^^^
P4:45:53 <ReaperSWE> ...and I'm op in quite a few.
P4:45:56 <Evil-Ville> Prime_2: I'd do nothing
P4:46:04 <Evil-Ville> You see it has already happened to me many times
P4:46:34 <Prime_2> and did you like it when it happened?
P4:46:41 <Evil-Ville> I didn't care
P4:46:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Then why did you build, if you didn't care about what you were building?
P4:47:02 <Prime_2> Bullshit.
P4:47:02 <Super-Dot> I don't grief, but I have to say that it is pretty fun to destroy stuff
P4:47:20 <Prime_2> You don't work on something for multiple hours and not care about it
P4:47:24 <vdgmprgrmr> If you fail to care, I don't see what could motivate you to work on it at all.
P4:47:24 <Evil-Ville> The worst thing you can do is throw some temper tantrum
P4:47:26 <peerkoel> even more fun to modify stuff
P4:47:35 <Super-Dot> If you're providing stuff for people to destroy, that's kinda nice
P4:47:38 <Prime_2> I'm not suggesting you do
P4:47:46 <Super-Dot> And it means your building wasn't pointless
P4:48:07 <Prime_2> but being angry with someone for destroying your hard work isn't a temper tantrum
P4:48:15 <Evil-Ville> I built things before there was saving in the game
P4:48:29 <Evil-Ville> So basically that was all about building something only for it to be destroyed in an instant
P4:48:36 <vdgmprgrmr> So did I.
P4:48:46 <vdgmprgrmr> But I still didn't want to have to get rid of it.
P4:49:03 <Prime_2> speaking of
P4:49:10 <Prime_2> somebody needs to build a falling lava server
P4:49:16 <Prime_2> you know, like the ones lilrobot had
P4:49:17 <Super-Dot> Falling lava?
P4:49:21 <Prime_2> yeah
P4:49:34 <Prime_2> a lava block in the sky, and you try to build a shelter before the whole place floods with it
P4:49:43 <Super-Dot> Haha, neat
P4:50:28 <Prime_2> So
P4:50:37 <Prime_2> I've discovered that Turkey Cheddar brats go good with Mayonaise
P4:50:39 <peerkoel> wouldn't that kill off all clients?
P4:51:26 <Super-Dot> Hooray food
P4:51:41 <Super-Dot> So why do people want a /bring command?
P4:51:57 <Super-Dot> Nobody answered last time I asked
P4:52:05 <Evil-Ville> By the way ReaperSWE, if it makes you feel better being a childish prick then by all means ban me from servers you're an on on
P4:52:07 <vdgmprgrmr> peerkoel, not if the level's small enough.
P4:52:08 <Evil-Ville> *op
P4:52:19 <peerkoel> sounds like fun
P4:52:30 <Prime_2> somebody host a falling lava server
P4:52:46 <peerkoel> you'd have to start the lava manually
P4:52:58 <Prime_2> what are you talking about?
P4:53:08 <Prime_2> You'd insert the lava with the map editor
P4:53:11 <peerkoel> well, otherwise you have to log in while the lava is flowing
P4:53:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, I can see a clear reason to not want you on a server.
P4:53:16 <peerkoel> that's hard to time right
P4:53:17 <Prime_2> yeah
P4:53:23 <Prime_2> That's right, vdgmprgrmr
P4:53:25 <Evil-Ville> What is that vdgmprgrmr?
P4:53:33 <Prime_2> err
P4:53:34 <Evil-Ville> Not caring about my buildings being destroyed?
P4:53:37 <Prime_2> *peerkoel
P4:53:39 <vdgmprgrmr> The fact that you don't care about your, or anyone else's work.
P4:53:39 <Evil-Ville> That's a real good reason
P4:53:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, it is a good reason.
P4:54:01 <peerkoel> wat also would be good on a flowing lava server, is random blocks everywhere
P4:54:13 <peerkoel> so that you have to find a nice spot to build a shelter
P4:54:18 <Evil-Ville> It's a shit reason
P4:54:26 <vdgmprgrmr> No it's not.
13P4:54:30 * peerkoel agrees with Evil-Ville 
P4:54:32 <Evil-Ville> Explain why it isn't
P4:54:46 <Prime_2> peerkoel> wat also would be good on a flowing lava server, is random blocks everywhere
P4:54:47 <Prime_2> <peerkoel> so that you have to find a nice spot to build a shelter
P4:54:53 <vdgmprgrmr> If you fail to care about anyone's work, then you don't care if the whole server goes to shit.
P4:54:56 <Prime_2> I just had in mind a flat rectangular area
P4:55:04 <peerkoel> it's about your own work
P4:55:06 <Evil-Ville> So what?
P4:55:11 <Prime_2> one block of destroyable ground underneath you
P4:55:16 <Evil-Ville> I am sure other people notice if someone starts griefing the server
P4:55:36 <Prime_2> Anything more, and you could just burrow into the ground for your shelter
P4:55:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I would not want someone on any server of mine that doesn't respect other people's things.
P4:55:59 <Evil-Ville> Who are you to say I don't respect other people's things
P4:56:20 <vdgmprgrmr> The fact that whether or not they stay in perfect condition or are utterly destroyed doesn't matter at all to you.
P4:56:29 <peerkoel> Prime_2, how do you get players on all kinds of different blocks?
P4:56:30 <Evil-Ville> Doesn't mean I don't respect them
P4:56:38 <vdgmprgrmr> It means you don't respect them enough.
P4:56:48 <Evil-Ville> No it doesn't
P4:56:53 <Prime_2> <peerkoel> Prime_2, how do you get players on all kinds of different blocks?
P4:56:57 <Prime_2> what do you mean?
P4:57:16 <peerkoel> well, I think you'd all want to be on different blocks?
P4:57:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Anyone on any server who does not care if the server is suddenly filled with griefers does not care enough about the server to stay there, if you ask me.
P4:57:29 <Super-Dot> With one flat block of destructible ground, you can build a shelter pretty quickly and easily
P4:57:45 <Prime_2> it's just a small-ish rectangular map with high walls, a block of lava in the sky, and one block of dirt beneath you before the indestructable stuff
P4:57:53 <Evil-Ville> You take this game way too seriously I am sorry
P4:58:04 <Super-Dot> You just burrow one block and build a short wall around
13P4:58:06 * peerkoel still agrees with Evil-Ville 
P4:58:08 <vdgmprgrmr> How am I taking it too seriously?

P4:59:01 <peerkoel> you're saying you don't want Evil-Ville on your server, and you're almost (!) comparing him to a griefer
P4:59:03 <vdgmprgrmr> It doesn't matter if it's in a game or not, you spent time on it, you worked on it, and it has an effect on people in the server by just being there.
P4:59:09 <peerkoel> who doesn't care about other peoples creations
P4:59:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Whether or not it's in a video game, it's still a creation that someone spent time and effort on.
P5:00:20 <vdgmprgrmr> And having people on a server who don't care about anything there can make the server less fun for others.
P5:00:20 <Evil-Ville> Yes and I respect that people put time and effort into something that could be wiped out by a griefer anyways
P5:00:26 <Super-Dot> He cares about other people's things
P5:00:31 <vdgmprgrmr> No he doesn't.

P5:00:43 <Evil-Ville> You're a prick vdgmprgrmr
P5:00:49 <Evil-Ville> That's the end of this argument
P5:00:52 <Super-Dot> He doesn't stage a protest every time the server gets reset
P5:00:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Awesome ad hominem.
P5:01:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I care lots about Debra Flugels in Montana, but I don't care if she dies or lives or any of that.
P5:02:43 <Super-Dot> The important part is that you made something, not that the thing you made is sitting there
P5:02:50 <Evil-Ville> Now you're comparing life of a person to some minecraft buildings

P5:03:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I can make another one if you'd like.
P5:03:36 <Evil-Ville> Maybe you think griefing is as bad as molesting a baby
P5:03:44 <peerkoel> <Evil-Ville> That's the end of this argument   <-- ;)
P5:03:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said that.
P5:03:50 <Evil-Ville> I know shut up
P5:04:21 <vdgmprgrmr> How about this: I care lots about that building down the street, but I don't care if it gets burnt down or any of that.
P5:04:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Better?
P5:04:43 <Super-Dot> That abandoned building which nobody lives in, sure
P5:04:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't matter what building.
P5:04:56 <Evil-Ville> Yes it does
P5:05:01 <Super-Dot> That building which those guys are living in, not so much
P5:05:05 <Evil-Ville> It could be a people many people live in

P5:05:09 <Evil-Ville> It could be a hospital
P5:05:23 <Super-Dot> Minecraft is a chalk drawing
P5:05:24 <vdgmprgrmr> How about this: I care tons about x, but I don't care if x ceases to exist or any of that.
P5:05:30 <Evil-Ville> I agree Super-Dot
P5:05:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Does that make it easier to understand?
P5:05:37 <Super-Dot> If somebody sprays it with a hose, you say "oh well"

P5:06:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Super-Dot, what if you make a huge mural on a parking lot that takes a week to finish?
P5:06:11 <Super-Dot> (shading a chalk drawing is really hard)
P5:06:19 <Super-Dot> Out of chalk?
P5:06:22 <Evil-Ville> You made it with chalk in the first place
P5:06:28 <vdgmprgrmr> And then some kids come and destroy it, with their only reasoning being that it was there.
P5:06:28 <Evil-Ville> You know it's going to go away
P5:06:40 <Super-Dot> It's going to get rained on anyway
P5:06:46 <Super-Dot> Be sure to take photographs
P5:06:54 <Super-Dot> Those are permanent
P5:06:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, but you'd much rather it goes away from natural causes than some kids getting rid of it because they want to.
P5:06:59 <Evil-Ville> Rain in the case of minecraft could be server reset or crash
P5:07:24 <vdgmprgrmr> One is uncontrollable, the other is malice.
P5:07:31 <Super-Dot> It's not malice
P5:07:36 <Super-Dot> It's fun
P5:07:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Right, so if something is fun, there's no way it can be mean?
P5:08:03 <Super-Dot> It can be destructive, but it's not necessarily mean
P5:08:20 <fydo> sweet. I'm going to go steal money from my friends because it's fun

P5:08:51 <Evil-Ville> Hey Siiseli what's your opinion
P5:09:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Hmm... Destroying other people's work for fun. Sounds pretty damn mean to me.
P5:09:19 <Siiseli> my opinion is to have some pie and chill out
P5:09:23 <TrueWolves> and a waste of time.
P5:09:24 <Siiseli> it does
P5:10:08 <Super-Dot> Spraying a chalk drawing with a hose the day before it rains is pretty fun, yeah
P5:10:33 <vdgmprgrmr> What if the person who made it doesn't want it sprayed?
P5:10:49 <TrueWolves> I really don't see a point at all
P5:10:54 <Evil-Ville> That's too bad then
P5:11:06 <Super-Dot> Well they shouldn't have made it out of chalk in a public parking lot then
P5:11:19 <vdgmprgrmr> That doesn't make it any less mean.
P5:11:37 <Siiseli> I don't see a point either
P5:11:51 <peerkoel> then the person who doesn't want it sprayed shoudn't have made it in a public sprayable place
P5:11:57 <TrueWolves> why waste your time ridding of something when you could proubly find something to do that would be not only easyer for ya but if you knew where to look funner
P5:12:11 <TrueWolves> Why waste a part of your life doing the oppaset of nothing =/
P5:12:50 <vdgmprgrmr> And you guys are trying to suggest that people should not care about the things they make.
P5:13:00 <peerkoel> not on public servers, no
P5:13:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Which sounds pretty ridiculous to me.
P5:13:02 <peerkoel> because
P5:13:08 <peerkoel> they are going to go away..
P5:13:09 <Super-Dot> They should care, but they shouldn't expect them to stay there permanently
P5:13:13 <peerkoel> at some point
P5:13:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not saying they should expect them to stay there permanently.
P5:13:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Eventually they will HAVE to be removed.
P5:13:31 <peerkoel> well there you go
P5:13:44 <Super-Dot> They should also not care how they get destroyed
P5:13:44 <peerkoel> that's all I'm saying
P5:13:57 <vdgmprgrmr> But people would care if their creations were destroyed, before they had to be destroyed, for fun.
P5:13:57 <TrueWolves> vdgm: Heres a way of putting it: We all have to die, but do we have to die now?
P5:14:12 <peerkoel> the fun is in creating
P5:14:15 <peerkoel> not the keeping
P5:14:24 <Evil-Ville> Yes
P5:14:34 <Siiseli> of course people should keep the stuff
P5:14:38 <vdgmprgrmr> What if people like looking at whatever you made?
P5:14:41 <Siiseli> you make stuff you wanna kepe it there
P5:14:49 <Siiseli> not have some dickface remove it
P5:14:49 <TrueWolves> Everything I create I create to use rather then just iuld and snapshot, though I'm odd like that.
P5:14:50 <vdgmprgrmr> What if YOU like looking at whatever you made?
P5:14:59 <Evil-Ville> Take a screenshot or make a video
P5:15:06 <TrueWolves> biuld*
P5:15:10 <Siiseli> Evil-Ville, that's silly
P5:15:14 <Siiseli> your attitude is silly
P5:15:24 <TrueWolves> oh great -.-
P5:15:31 <TrueWolves> Lets not go directly to flaming
P5:15:38 <Siiseli> me? not flaming
P5:15:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, yeah, so let's build whatever we want, screenshot, then get rid of it.
P5:15:54 <peerkoel> no
P5:15:55 <Evil-Ville> Good boy
P5:16:06 <peerkoel> just wait for it to get built over
P5:16:08 <vdgmprgrmr> That is the most logical option, obviously.
P5:16:10 <peerkoel> or destroyed
P5:16:14 <08Notch> now, i sleep. tomorrow, update.
P5:16:15 <TrueWolves> one thing I can say for any argument is don't acuse someone's opionion directly with out saying /why/

P5:17:16 <peerkoel> right, don't die

P5:17:33 <Syndlig> In 1 sentence.  :P
P5:17:34 <Super-Dot> Okay, code until you fall _almost_ dead
P5:17:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah yeah before you sleep can you tell us how you plan on doing things like torches or stuff?
P5:17:42 <08Notch> well, it's nothing I think is required for the game
P5:17:45 <Evil-Ville> Siiseli it wasn't originally an argument about breaking what others make
P5:17:46 <08Notch> but I do think it would be nice
P5:17:53 <Siiseli>  Evil-Ville what was it about originally
P5:17:57 <Evil-Ville> It was an argument about not caring if things you make are destroyed
P5:17:59 <TrueWolves> #ArgueHere
P5:18:00 <TrueWolves> =D
P5:18:00 <Syndlig> It'd make being underground cooler, I think.
P5:18:06 <08Notch> i agree. =)
P5:18:12 <Syndlig> Not bringing in a light source and you're going through what is essentially inky blackness.
P5:18:12 <Super-Dot> Notch, did you see my messages earlier?
P5:18:18 <08Notch> probably not
P5:18:20 <Siiseli> Evil-Ville, well that's not nice either
P5:18:25 <Evil-Ville> Which according to vdgmprgrmr is just as bad as destroying things other people make
P5:18:34 <08Notch> or rather, no, I didn't. At least I don't remember them. =D
P5:18:34 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I never said that.
P5:18:51 <Evil-Ville> Well you said you would ban me for it
P5:19:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I said that if you don't care if people's work is destroyed, you don't deserve to be on the server with it.
P5:19:16 <Super-Dot> Notch: I said that 1) could custom arms and legs be mirrored? and 2) Tab has never worked on Macs
P5:19:18 <Evil-Ville> Still doesn't make any sense
P5:19:20 <Siiseli> I agree with vdgmprgrmr 
P5:19:23 <Siiseli> sure it does Evil-Ville 
P5:19:29 <Evil-Ville> Shut up Siiseli I thought you were less stupid than that
P5:19:38 <Siiseli> whatever do you mean

P5:20:58 <Super-Dot> ReaperSWE, please don't shout
P5:21:09 <Evil-Ville> You also insulted me by saying I don't respect the work of other people
P5:21:17 <peerkoel> Evil-Ville, the way I understand it, vdgmprgrmr thinks you don't even care about building things, because you don't care about keeping them
P5:21:22 <Siiseli> my opinion is others work is important and so is your and anyone who destroys stuff others make should not expect to be welcome
P5:21:30 <mezo> what's /bring supposed to do? teleport to you?
P5:21:32 <peerkoel> but building stuff is the fun
P5:21:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you are seeing it wrong.
P5:21:38 <ReaperSWE> bring people to you.
P5:21:47 <peerkoel> oh, am I?
P5:21:57 <Super-Dot> Why do people want /bring?

P5:22:08 <Super-Dot> I don't see how it differs from /kick or /tp
P5:22:08 <ReaperSWE> to teleport friends to places?
P5:22:15 <Super-Dot> Ah, for friends
P5:22:19 <vdgmprgrmr> If you don't care what happens to other people's work, then I don't want you on my server.
P5:22:19 <ReaperSWE> ...without oping them
P5:22:20 <Super-Dot> I thought it was for griefers
P5:22:29 <Evil-Ville> Then I don't want to be on your server
P5:22:33 <mezo> ops can teleport?
P5:22:34 <peerkoel> well that's probably why you want a private server

P5:22:59 <ReaperSWE> we've got a plauge guy on our server...
P5:23:07 <ReaperSWE> he keeps changing ip and making new account.

P5:23:12 <mezo> it's only halfway justifiable for ops, Super-Dot
P5:23:20 <vdgmprgrmr> What, mezo?
P5:23:21 <mezo> letting anyone port around would be corny
P5:23:27 <vdgmprgrmr> It's completely justifiable for ops.

P5:23:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Why not?
P5:23:36 <mezo> you could argue that ops need it to check on reported griefin
P5:23:40 <Evil-Ville> Why bother
P5:23:42 <Super-Dot> Ah, that makes sense
P5:23:48 <Evil-Ville> It's like arguing about religion

10P5:24:57 * Zuriki (Zuriki@5ad476ed.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
P5:25:00 <peerkoel> you Could just agree to disagree, you know
P5:25:04 <08Notch> i mostly added it because it helps against griefing as ops can follow people around
P5:25:05 <vdgmprgrmr> It doesn't matter how "easily insulted" I am.
P5:25:07 <Syndlig> Who cares if someone doesn't care about other people's stuff?
P5:25:12 <vdgmprgrmr> He's still insulting people.
P5:25:14 <Syndlig> I mean, obviously vdg.
P5:25:15 <Siiseli> Syndlig, how so? Evil-Ville thinks others work can just be destroyed and we don't
P5:25:21 <peerkoel> well that's your opinion
P5:25:23 <ReaperSWE> You see a greifer breaking stuff in the distance, but by the time you get in range to read his nick, he's gone.
P5:25:25 <08Notch> why are you guys arguing?
P5:25:29 <Siiseli> I wouldn't know
P5:25:35 <Zuriki> There's been so much drama lately.
P5:25:47 <Siiseli> that's irc for you
P5:25:49 <peerkoel> vdgmprgrmr likes to discuss the matter
P5:25:51 <08Notch> hehe
P5:25:51 <peerkoel> that's ok
P5:25:54 <Siiseli> what else kind of drama has there been here?
12P5:26:00 * Zuriki (Zuriki@5ad476ed.bb.sky.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P5:26:01 <vdgmprgrmr> We WERE arguing over whether or not griefing mattered.
P5:26:03 <08Notch> you can argue if you want to. I just think life is easier if you don't
P5:26:15 <Siiseli> what is this griefing anyway
P5:26:20 <Siiseli> Notch, absolutely
P5:26:22 <mezo> i would argue with you about that view notch
P5:26:24 <peerkoel> I thought you WERE arguing wether caring about your own creations mattered
P5:26:26 <mezo> since i disagree
P5:26:28 <08Notch> hehe mezo
P5:26:28 <citricsquid> irc always turns into arguments about irrelevant silliness, at least 3 times a day.
P5:26:30 <mezo> but i don't think you'd be down
P5:26:31 <Super-Dot> Notch: Evil-Ville said that he doesn't care when his or anyone else's stuff gets griefed
P5:26:32 <Siiseli> and well for me its not arguing it's conversating
P5:26:32 <vdgmprgrmr> But then it turned into Evil-Ville calling people stupid babies.
P5:26:42 <Syndlig> It's true, though.
P5:26:44 <Super-Dot> Notch: And vdgmprgrmr thinks that makes Evil-Ville a bad person
P5:26:49 <peerkoel> did you call anyone a stupid baby, Evil-Ville?
P5:26:50 <08Notch> heh
P5:26:50 <ReaperSWE> Hey notch, can I have +v? :-)
P5:26:55 <Syndlig> If you whine about your stuff getting wrecked in MINECRAFT which has no grief protection whatsoever
P5:26:56 <Evil-Ville> Yes I did but it was a joke
P5:26:57 <Syndlig> You're a baby.
P5:27:01 <Siiseli> Notch, and Evil-Ville thinks that makes vdgmprgrmr a bad person
10P5:27:07 * Zuriki (Zuriki@5ad476ed.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
P5:27:07 <Super-Dot> Haha
P5:27:11 <Syndlig> Especially since most servers get wiped daily or bi-daily.
P5:27:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Jokes and argument stay far, far away from each other.
P5:27:12 <Zuriki> Whoopsie.
P5:27:16 <08Notch> the way I see it, if someone hold that view, that's entirely up to that person. But when you join someones server, you're expected to play by their rules or risk getting banned
P5:27:25 <Zuriki> 	<Zuriki>	Well, there was the one between me vdg and mezo
P5:27:27 <Zuriki> 	<Zuriki>	There was one with me and Lmao something... Pentaclam.
P5:27:29 <Zuriki> 	<Zuriki>	And Pentaclam with someone else too.
P5:27:36 <Zuriki> Those were the ones that didn't get through.
P5:27:41 <Siiseli> ah
P5:27:44 <Evil-Ville> This is an internet argument I can joke all I want
P5:27:44 <ReaperSWE> I take it you've given up on Wurm Online ?
P5:27:46 <Super-Dot> "Play by the rules" is a good way of thinking about it
P5:27:54 <Super-Dot> If there's a "you should report griefing" rule
P5:27:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Well then you're a terrible arguer, Evil.

P5:28:09 <08Notch> ReaperSWE: Yes, years ago.
P5:28:10 <Zuriki> There's an irc for this.
P5:28:11 <Siiseli> what IS griefing?
P5:28:16 <Zuriki> #minecraftdrama
P5:28:18 <Zuriki> :P
P5:28:19 <Evil-Ville> It's wrecking shit
P5:28:23 <Super-Dot> Haha, Zuriki 
P5:28:24 <Foe> Destroying someone's work
P5:28:25 <08Notch> I wouldn't phrase it "giving up" though
P5:28:29 <citricsquid> Servers are private, while I dislike having to put up with silly admins it's ultimately up to them and complaining about it is silly :D </poop>
P5:28:29 <Syndlig> That's not true.
P5:28:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Siiseli, destroying people's stuff for fun.
P5:28:42 <Syndlig> Griefing is the ruining of other's enjoyment for your own personal enjoyment.
P5:28:46 <Siiseli> oic
P5:28:50 <mezo> the concept of wurm still needs to be ressurrected by someone
P5:28:51 <Siiseli> thanks
P5:28:52 <Foe> Or doing
P5:28:58 <Syndlig> Could be anything from destroying their stuff.
P5:28:59 <Foe> it purposely
P5:29:02 <peerkoel> that's a nice definition Syndlig 
P5:29:07 <Syndlig> To standing in the way of where they're building so they can't.
P5:29:21 <Zuriki> Basically it's pissing someone off.
P5:29:26 <peerkoel> or spleefing them without your consent
P5:29:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty much.

P5:29:44 <Zuriki> Or being rude somehow.
P5:29:44 <peerkoel> oh :)
P5:29:47 <Super-Dot> I spleef people without their consent all the time :D
P5:29:51 <Zuriki> Like building giant penises.
P5:29:52 <Syndlig> I love dumping people into pits and then rebuilding what I broke.

10P5:30:10 * Rosetta (Rosetta@78.145.206.206) has joined #minecraft
P5:30:10 <vdgmprgrmr> If someone asked me to not spleef them outside of a game, I would stop. A person who doesn't stop would be griefing.
P5:30:11 <08Notch> haha, i actually find it funny when that happens to me
P5:30:17 <08Notch> I'm standing on some bridge, chatting
P5:30:20 <Zuriki> Sorry, I'm no familiar with that frase...
P5:30:24 <Zuriki> phrase*
P5:30:27 <Evil-Ville> I causes me great grief when people stare at me in Minecraft
P5:30:27 <ReaperSWE> http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a100/ReaperSWE/screenshot-17.jpg
P5:30:27 <08Notch> then someone with a weeird skin runs up to me and drops me
P5:30:28 <Zuriki> It's late -.-
P5:30:31 <Evil-Ville> Why can't the admins listen to me
P5:30:37 <ReaperSWE> That was awesome before an unknown greifer ruined it
P5:30:37 <Deiz_> Notch: Fix keyboard focus please
P5:30:43 <Super-Dot> I like digging someone to the bottom of the map when they go AFK
P5:30:45 <08Notch> I can't reproduce it!
P5:30:53 <mezo> spleefin' dudes is pretty much the goal in minecraft
P5:30:53 <08Notch> so I don't know what's wrong
P5:30:55 <citricsquid> notch: I did that :D I dug a big hole below you :P
P5:31:06 <Deiz_> Notch: Minecraft steals focus but discards input
P5:31:14 <08Notch> huh, weird
P5:31:15 <Deiz_> Such that you can't hit escape to bring up the menu
P5:31:19 <Deiz_> Hafta kill the java process from a VT
P5:31:25 <08Notch> vt?
P5:31:28 <Deiz_> Virtual terminal
P5:31:35 <08Notch> what os?
P5:31:36 <08Notch> browser?
P5:31:37 <ReaperSWE> Notch, another bug
P5:31:40 <Deiz_> Linux/Firefox
P5:31:45 <peerkoel> oh I have to try then
P5:31:50 <ReaperSWE> New ops have to reconnect to remove solid blocks
P5:32:00 <08Notch> after getting opped?
P5:32:02 <ReaperSWE> yes
P5:32:05 <08Notch> it's always been like that
P5:32:08 <08Notch> OOOH
P5:32:09 <08Notch> misread
P5:32:13 <08Notch> I thought you said "NOW ops"
P5:32:20 <Zuriki> I wish films didn't take so long to download.
P5:32:23 <Zuriki> -.-
P5:32:28 <08Notch> I'm lacking a "hey, you're an op now" command in the protocol
P5:32:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, I think ops should not be able to remove blackrock if they're not in /solid mode.
P5:32:47 <mezo> opsidian*
P5:32:48 <ZomBuster> I am sad
P5:32:57 <ZomBuster> I was on a custom server
P5:32:57 <vdgmprgrmr> it's blackrock!
P5:32:59 <08Notch> lol opsidian =D
P5:33:00 <Eagle> We're calling it obsidian now?
P5:33:03 <mezo> opsidian*
P5:33:07 <ZomBuster> and the dumbass made the whole map below sea level
P5:33:08 <Eagle> ...
P5:33:11 <08Notch> i like that =D
P5:33:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I like blackrock.
P5:33:12 <Eagle> XD
P5:33:21 <ZomBuster> but they build a wall of blackrock around it D:
P5:33:34 <Evil-Ville> Someone called it admincrete
P5:33:43 <ZomBuster> lol admincrete
P5:33:44 <ReaperSWE> how about a public message that states "[name] is now op!
P5:33:46 <mezo> adminite i think
P5:33:48 <Syndlig> opsidian > *
P5:33:49 <Super-Dot> I prefer admincrete to blackrock
P5:33:50 <mezo> but then i corrected them with opsidian
P5:33:51 <vdgmprgrmr> It's been called blackrock, opsidian, and admincrete that I know of.
P5:33:58 <vdgmprgrmr> And I prefer blackrock to all of them.
P5:33:59 <Super-Dot> Ooh, adminite is nice
P5:34:00 <08Notch> haha adminite
P5:34:07 <ReaperSWE> I call em solids
P5:34:08 <Zuriki> I usually called it black rock.
P5:34:13 <Syndlig> Notch I have one final suggestion!
P5:34:15 <Zuriki> Ha, good one Notch.
P5:34:15 <mezo> those are the only two real competitors for the title so far
P5:34:18 <mezo> opsidian vs adminite
P5:34:24 <Deiz_> Notch: I think you should add comments to the ban lists
P5:34:25 <Eagle> blackrock is the easiest to roll off the toungue.
P5:34:27 <Syndlig> When you finally get around to survival mode, please don't make the only form of clothing metal armor.
P5:34:28 <ReaperSWE> Another problem, you can't place blocks directly on the map floor
P5:34:28 <Eagle> *tongue
P5:34:35 <Zuriki> Technically it's just called rock.
P5:34:37 <Zuriki> BECAUSE
P5:34:39 <Deiz_> # <op who banned> such that abuse can be tracked
P5:34:41 <Syndlig> Killing wild creatures and using their leather to make leather armor would be nice as well.
P5:34:49 <Zuriki> In the JAR the texture for it was called rock.png
P5:35:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree with Syndlig.
P5:35:04 <Super-Dot> rock.png is the new name
P5:35:11 <Zuriki> :P
P5:35:16 <Syndlig> So you'd have 3 tiers of armor then, I guess.
P5:35:17 <Super-Dot> step aside, adminite and opsidian
P5:35:23 <08Notch> ooh yeah
P5:35:26 <Syndlig> Leather, Iron, whatever-is-higher.
P5:35:27 <Eagle> Cloth, Leather, and Metal?
P5:35:29 <Evil-Ville> opsidian armor
P5:35:29 <vdgmprgrmr> We should have leather, iron, and steel for armor, instead of just iron and steel like you said.
P5:35:30 <08Notch> leather would be fairly easy to get early on
P5:35:30 <peerkoel> Deiz_ do you have that problem with client 0.0.21a_01?
P5:35:36 <Syndlig> Right
P5:35:37 <Deiz_> peerkoel: Yes.
P5:35:38 <08Notch> i like that
P5:35:40 <peerkoel> I don't
P5:35:41 <ReaperSWE> Cloth, Leather, Iron, Steel
P5:35:43 <Deiz_> I've had it for several releases.
P5:35:45 <peerkoel> also Linux/Firefox
P5:35:47 <08Notch> I'm still not sure what level of complexity I'm going for
P5:35:49 <Syndlig> Cloth wouldn't really be that easy.
P5:35:55 <Eagle> Or useful
P5:35:56 <Syndlig> I mean, you'd have to grow the plants.
P5:35:57 <08Notch> I'm thinking cloth for cloaks. =D
P5:35:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I think the level of complexity should be very, very low.
P5:36:02 <Syndlig> It'd be easier to just kill an animal.
P5:36:02 <Zuriki> Anyway. I'm gone. Watching a film whilst my other films download.
P5:36:06 <08Notch> yes, vdgmprgrmr
P5:36:07 <Syndlig> Right.
P5:36:11 <Eagle> Bye Zuriki
P5:36:14 <Syndlig> Low-mid complexity.
P5:36:15 <Zuriki> Ciao
P5:36:17 <08Notch> at least in game mechanics
P5:36:17 <Deiz_> peerkoel: Do you have any keyboard shortcuts for applications?
12P5:36:21 * Zuriki (Zuriki@5ad476ed.bb.sky.com) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.0.11/2009060215])
P5:36:27 <Syndlig> I'm requesting multiple weapon types.
P5:36:29 <vdgmprgrmr> You can make amazing things with lots of simple mechanics.
P5:36:32 <Syndlig> Well, 3 melee.
P5:36:36 <Super-Dot> Emergent gameplay is fun times
P5:36:37 <peerkoel> ehm, I think KDE has those, yes
P5:36:38 <Syndlig> Because I've been playing Overlord too much.
P5:36:40 <08Notch> but then if the game itself gets all complicated because you're trying to build a wooden flammable bridge over lava.. well, that's fine. =D
P5:36:40 <Deiz_> I can trigger it by using a shortcut for an application
P5:36:41 <Syndlig> Sword, Axe, Mace.
P5:36:42 <peerkoel> but I don't use them
P5:36:43 <Eagle> Crossbow or longbow?
P5:36:44 <Deiz_> E.g. pausing Amarok playback
P5:37:02 <Deiz_> It'll momentarily give focus to Amarok then grant it to Firefox/Java again
P5:37:08 <mezo> reminded of dungeon keeper
P5:37:10 <Deiz_> At which point Minecraft discards input
P5:37:13 <Deiz_> And I'm screwed
P5:37:20 <peerkoel> which key is that?
P5:37:21 <08Notch> oh, ok.. Thanks
P5:37:42 <08Notch> hopefully it's not an lwjgl bug
P5:37:55 <Syndlig> You should also be able to tame evil creatures!
P5:37:57 <08Notch> i used to make it always release the mouse when it didn't have focus
P5:37:59 <peerkoel> it's hard to keep your stuff compatible :)
P5:38:00 <Syndlig> And make them live in lairs underground!
P5:38:00 <vdgmprgrmr> God that's a terrible acronym.
P5:38:02 <Syndlig> <_< >_>
P5:38:09 <08Notch> but that caused it not to be able to get focus at all on mac for some reason
P5:38:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Neither saying the letters nor saying what it stands for sounds good.
P5:38:12 <Eagle> Make them guard dogs!
P5:38:18 <Deiz_> Notch: Mouse is usable when keyboard isn't
P5:38:19 <peerkoel> oh yeah Notch, it still doesn't work in appletviewer
P5:38:26 <peerkoel> when I click the menu pops up
P5:38:29 <Syndlig> Actually I was joking in a "Dungeon Keeper!" way
P5:38:40 <Eagle> Still
P5:38:40 <peerkoel> all keyboard action is fine
P5:38:41 <ReaperSWE> How about scrolling the chat?
P5:38:43 <Eagle> :/
P5:38:44 <Syndlig> Minecraft with animal taming would be dungeon keeper :D
P5:38:51 <Deiz_> I still think you should drop keyboard focus unless the applet has mouse focus
P5:38:57 <08Notch> i tried to play dungeon keeper again recently
P5:38:58 <Syndlig> And then we could ride around on troll mounts.
P5:39:02 <08Notch> it wasn't as fun as I remembered it, hehe
P5:39:06 <Syndlig> what
P5:39:07 <Eagle> Will the B key be in survival?
P5:39:09 <Syndlig> You take that back, right now.
P5:39:22 <Syndlig> I will not have you defiling the good name of Bullfrog!
P5:39:22 <08Notch> Deiz_: I used to do that, but then it didn't work at all on mac
P5:39:43 <Deiz_> Perhaps detect platform?
P5:39:48 <08Notch> there's no separate kb and mouse focus, though
P5:40:08 <08Notch> well, there kinda is. there's JUST kb focus
P5:40:15 <08Notch> the mouse is done manually via robot and awt
P5:40:28 <08Notch> (because lwjgl has a mouse grab bug in applets)
P5:40:45 <08Notch> (more specifically, it doesn't.)
P5:40:51 <08Notch> ((grab it))
P5:40:59 <peerkoel> (((we got it)))
P5:40:59 <Syndlig> Hm.
P5:41:14 <Syndlig> Notch, do you have any actual drawn out plans in regards to Minecraft?
P5:41:16 <08Notch> I hate so called "unterminated strings
P5:41:25 <peerkoel> :P
P5:41:27 <Eagle> I read that as "Drown"
P5:41:30 <Eagle> which reminds me
P5:41:35 <Syndlig> I remember a couple weeks ago people were telling me you'd said Survival mode would be out "in a week".  Which would've been plast week.  :I
P5:41:36 <08Notch> no Syndlig. =)
P5:41:40 <Eagle> How long do we have until we drown?
P5:41:44 <Syndlig> Oh.
P5:41:46 <Eagle> And how do we die? :/
P5:41:47 <Syndlig> You... probably should.
P5:41:53 <08Notch> No, I shouldn't. =)
P5:41:57 <Evil-Ville> Why aren't you sleeping Notch
P5:42:09 <08Notch> design documents are waaay overrated and totally pointless for one man projects
P5:42:24 <peerkoel> well you do have a TODO list
P5:42:29 <08Notch> i do
P5:42:31 <08Notch> and a bug list
P5:42:34 <peerkoel> I call that documentation
P5:42:37 <08Notch> and some mental visions of what I want
P5:42:58 <08Notch> and, yes, survival is overdue
P5:43:01 <Deiz_> Notch: I think admin transparency should be a top priority

P5:43:25 <08Notch> He's been patient enough, hehe
P5:43:25 <Super-Dot> Hooray for Internet
P5:43:30 <Deiz_> "Kicked by $op.", ban list has banning op's name too, etc
P5:43:31 <08Notch> admin what now?
P5:43:42 <08Notch> that's far from top priority
P5:43:48 <Deiz_> It's simple enough
P5:43:48 <08Notch> people can grab that from the logs if they really need it
P5:44:20 <Deiz_> I saw a case the other day
P5:44:34 <08Notch> yeah, it might be simple, but I don't agree it being top priority
P5:44:35 <Deiz_> There were several ops in a several, one was banning everyone who joined, the owner wasn't around
P5:44:43 <Deiz_> *in a server
P5:44:54 <08Notch> so the owner can check the log file when he gets back
P5:45:03 <ReaperSWE> and then we have ops kicking ops -.-
P5:45:16 <ReaperSWE> poor choice of ops.
P5:45:23 <Super-Dot> Minecraft should be built on top of IRC
P5:45:24 <Deiz_> In general I think transparency is very important
P5:45:33 <Deiz_> As it keeps ops honest
P5:45:34 <Super-Dot> Then people could stop asking for IRC features :D
P5:45:36 <08Notch> i do agree there, deiz.
P5:45:46 <08Notch> just adding player names reduced greifing a lot, for example
P5:46:01 <08Notch> plus it's more personal and friendlier
P5:46:09 <peerkoel> the name-check is very good
P5:46:36 <08Notch> but i'd much rather try to get some work done on survival than spend more time on admin tools
P5:46:36 <Deiz_> Unrelated, but I want smooth reloads

P5:47:16 <Deiz_> Then if it gets destroyed you can /restore foo

P5:47:32 <Deiz_> No server_level.dat swap/restart
P5:47:56 <peerkoel> downloadable single player levels
P5:47:59 <peerkoel> that's what I want
P5:48:05 <peerkoel> shouldn't be hard
P5:48:18 <Deiz_> So you could host a singleplayer map?
P5:48:23 <peerkoel> yes
P5:48:28 <peerkoel> build it, then share it
P5:48:39 <Super-Dot> More singleplayer/serverlevel interplay would be nice
P5:48:47 <Deiz_> Oh, Notch: How is map data sent?
P5:48:54 <peerkoel> in chunks :)
P5:49:00 <Deiz_> I mean initially
P5:49:15 <Deiz_> It's compressed to ~150 kB in server_level.dat
P5:49:23 <Deiz_> Yet it takes time to populate a map from the client's perspective
P5:49:24 <08Notch> I can't comment on the protocol!
P5:49:34 <Deiz_> Well
P5:49:46 <peerkoel> do you mind reverse engineering it?
P5:49:48 <Deiz_> I'm mostly wondering if it's client or server limited
P5:50:01 <08Notch> the map loading is the progress bar you see
P5:50:03 <trullz> so who is going to nomoresweden?
P5:50:13 <08Notch> after that, it's chunk rebuilding
P5:50:16 <Deiz_> Ah, so
P5:50:49 <08Notch> ah, I'll just make a simple level downloader now

P6:02:47 <cryzed> when I purchase it?
P6:04:01 <peerkoel> not yet
P6:04:15 <peerkoel> you can run your own server now
P6:04:25 <peerkoel> but it's an applet
P6:04:32 <peerkoel> so no stand-alone client

P6:04:55 <cryzed> "# Once you've bought the game, it's yours. No DRM, you can do whatever you want with it." ?
P6:05:02 <cryzed> I thought that basically meant
P6:05:07 <cryzed> that I get a local java file
P6:05:10 <cryzed> or something
P6:05:18 <citricsquid> It means you're not limited to where you can run it =D
P6:05:19 <peerkoel> I'm not sure what that means

P6:05:24 <08Notch> no, it just means I don't believe in the drm crap companies are doing

P6:05:55 <peerkoel> can I fork it? :)
P6:05:58 <08Notch> well, you're not allowed to distribute modified versions of it

P6:06:23 <cryzed> and yours is just cool
P6:06:28 <cryzed> A very cool idea

P6:27:44 <peerkoel> and not die
P6:27:50 <Adura> So, what's the Win32:*nix server software host ratio?
P6:27:53 <tesseract> For the free build mode, do you plan on implementing the ability to build with brushes larger than 1 block?
P6:27:54 <Prime_2> because you take pleasure in knowing that easily reversible griefing involving depth charges can't happen
P6:28:07 <08Notch> i don't log that, Adura.  :-(
P6:28:32 <08Notch> deiz_: I've been considering some pre-calculated PVS solution for occlusion culling
P6:28:35 <Adura> I was going to imply you did, but didn't. :P
P6:28:50 <Adura> It was more a general question of the channel.
P6:28:53 <08Notch> but it gets very complicated very fast, and the rendering is plenty fast on most hardware anyway
P6:29:14 <ReaperSWE> 500 fps on my pc, 5 on my netbook.
P6:29:14 <Deiz_> Notch: The problem is with really big maps.
P6:29:15 <Adura> I perl'd up some server admin-ing code.
P6:29:20 <08Notch> ahh
P6:29:30 <ReaperSWE> I have a wish, I'd like more fog levels.
P6:29:36 <Deiz_> As in, I get 100 FPS on this 256**3 map
P6:29:43 <Adura> But, Windows requires more effort, perl installation-wise.
P6:29:45 <Deiz_> Whereas I normally get 500-800
P6:29:47 <08Notch> I'll make it a slider when the options get in, ReaperSWE. =)
P6:29:51 <ReaperSWE> :-D
P6:29:52 <Testvan> i got all of new mexico banned from the wurm irc channel :(
P6:29:59 <ZomBuster> lol
P6:30:06 <08Notch> I'm only going to optimise the game for the standard level sizes.
P6:30:12 <08Notch> it's a bit of a slippery slope otherwise
P6:30:15 <Adura> It does work with cygwin, though.
P6:30:33 <ZomBuster> I did noticed a lot of improvement even on big maps tough
P6:30:46 <CheeToS> do you think you'll implement some kind of scripting, Notch?
P6:30:56 <Adura> I can give you my Perl script.
P6:31:01 <08Notch> yes, I do. But that's an advanced feature, so I'm waiting with it
P6:31:06 <CheeToS> nifty
P6:31:14 <ZomBuster> would be cool
P6:31:15 <08Notch> you can script the server already though
P6:31:18 <ZomBuster> scripted blocks!
P6:31:19 <08Notch> read stdout, write on stdin
P6:31:31 <Adura> Actually..
P6:31:31 <dexter> correction:
P6:31:33 <Adura> read stderr
P6:31:34 <dexter> stderr
P6:31:35 <Adura> Yeah.
P6:31:39 <08Notch> it's stderr? lol
P6:31:39 <tesseract> Notch, would the game run terribly slowly if you octubpled the resolution of the voxels? 8 in the space of one? I ask because I read you were going to do half size blocks for stairs, and I think Increasing the voxel resolution would be a good way of adding things like furnature and such to the game.
P6:31:40 <ZomBuster> you probably would need to limit the amount of them then
P6:31:43 <dexter> Java is fun like that
P6:31:50 <Zaratustra> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a07122bd5f12be5a5beef9ccbc59c2d4
P6:32:01 <TrueWolves> BLOCK FURNATURE
P6:32:05 <Boinciel> Voxels are awesome
P6:32:06 <08Notch> tesseract: It'd run at the same speed, but levels would get MUCH smaller
P6:32:14 <tesseract> that would make me sad
P6:32:16 <peerkoel> more materials would be good
P6:32:18 <08Notch> yes, me too
P6:32:23 <peerkoel> more brick, more wood, more metal
P6:32:26 <ZomBuster> he can just make models for the furniture!
P6:32:34 <ZomBuster> its not a real voxel engine
P6:32:43 <tesseract> What if all the world were built with regular size voxels, but people could add 1/8 size voxels?
P6:32:55 <Deiz_> Then you're heading in the direction of Sauerbraten
P6:33:03 <08Notch> what if they do that over the entire level?
P6:33:05 <CheeToS> can you create water as well, or does it have to flow in from somewhere it already exists?
P6:33:10 <Adura> I was reminded of http://voxelstein3d.blogspot.com/2008/04/v-o-x-e-l-s-t-e-i-n-3-d.html while playing Minecraft.
P6:33:21 <ZomBuster> that is a real voxel engine
P6:33:24 <tesseract> Then it would get slow, but the built out servers are already slow.
P6:33:26 <Zaratustra> boom gone
P6:34:02 <Boinciel> Hahahaha, I remember Voxelstein
P6:34:08 <08Notch> mmm, yes. voxels. :D
13P6:34:10 * Notch drools
P6:34:12 <Boinciel> It was totally awesome editing the config files
P6:34:16 <Adura> Alright, how many people with Perl knowledge here?
P6:34:21 <Boinciel> I turned the knife into a rapidfire chainsaw
P6:34:23 <Zaratustra> flooding large areas crashes the server very fast
P6:34:25 <08Notch> ken silverman's been doing some pretty neat voxel stuff as well
P6:34:26 <Boinciel> That could cut holes in the ceiling
P6:34:36 <Zaratustra> notch: wasn't that like 10 years ago
P6:34:37 <tesseract> Are you going to do models for things like furniture then? I assumed that since people can do custom skins, and the whole game is custom building that you would leave it to the players to create things like chairs and stuff.
P6:34:44 <08Notch> er, yeah, probably, haha
P6:34:50 <Testvan> i know perl 
P6:35:03 <Adura> Making more detailed things to place kind of defeats the purpose of the game to me. :P
13P6:35:04 * Roras explodes

P6:35:26 <08Notch> it's not new. ;)
P6:35:27 <Adura> Well Testvan, perhaps posting my code would be useful to more than 0 people.
P6:35:31 <Roras> Fez isnt new
P6:35:32 <Super-Dot> Did you hear about that new 2D voxel engine
P6:35:42 <08Notch> Adura: Yeah, I think so too.
P6:35:44 <Boinciel> I remember learning about voxels half a year ago
P6:35:48 <Roras> Fez has been in the making for 2 or so years ago
P6:35:51 <Boinciel> And now they're everywhere I go
P6:35:58 <Roras> correct me if im wrong
P6:35:59 <08Notch> now i sleep for reals

P6:39:22 <tesseract> MEMORIES!!!!
P6:39:24 <Adura> So, one person that knows Perl.
P6:40:11 <Rroff> ?
P6:40:16 <ZomBuster> I know a little perl
P6:40:19 <Zaratustra> from american game magazine GamePro
P6:40:22 <Testvan> he means me scrub back up
P6:40:35 <Roras> free will is gods gift to humans.
P6:40:35 <Roras> idle minds are human's gift to satan.
P6:40:35 <ZomBuster> got my first programming lessons in perl
P6:40:38 <Rroff> I know enough perl to um
P6:40:51 <Adura> Zaratustra is old or a good googler.
P6:40:59 <Rroff> somehow managed to loop a while loop and completely ignore the conditional statement
P6:41:02 <Rroff> not quite sure how
P6:41:14 <Testvan> while(1)
P6:41:16 <dexter> What does the script do, Adura?
P6:41:20 <Rroff> nah I mean
P6:41:32 <Rroff> while (time < $timeout)
P6:41:35 <Adura> It can do many things...
P6:41:47 <Rroff> where $timeout was time+10 before the statement
P6:41:49 <Testvan> ask the q
P6:41:55 <Adura> Right now it does little though.
P6:42:00 <Rroff> and come back 2 hours later and its still looping
P6:42:02 <Zaratustra> adura: How old are you, may I ask.
P6:42:06 <Adura> Responds to things chat'd.
P6:42:11 <Roras> -57
P6:42:15 <Adura> A timer for saying things.
P6:42:18 <Adura> I'm 26
P6:42:29 <Zaratustra> hm
P6:42:37 <Roras> no i am not old
P6:42:59 <Adura> It could certainly do more, I'm just light on ideas.

P6:43:39 <Infinity> cool
P6:44:00 <Roras> but nobody here really cares anyway
P6:44:20 <Adura> It also keeps the ability to issue commands from the commandline.
P6:44:27 <dexter> Do you pipe the server output through perl or by shell script | thing
P6:44:53 <ZomBuster> hey redshift
P6:44:54 <Adura> Through Perl.
P6:45:37 <Adura> Posting the code is one thing, adding comments and explaining how to get it to work on Windows... quite another.
P6:46:08 <dexter> I think I've (finally) found a way to do the same in Java
P6:46:16 <TrueWolves> wow

P6:46:28 <Adura> I doubt that, granny.
P6:46:30 <Roras> i dont even know how to program
P6:46:31 <TrueWolves> How come I never heard of splief before? I got to play it now
P6:46:45 <ZomBuster> its splEEF
P6:46:47 <Roras> this is not where i should be
P6:46:55 <Roras> what do you think
P6:47:07 <Syndlig> I'd rather you call it splief, at least that way it sounds alot less like queef.
P6:47:14 <Adura> Spleen Queef.
P6:47:18 <Infinity> lol wut
P6:47:24 <Roras> spleef is when a man ejaculates and farts at the same time
P6:47:29 <Roras> apparently
P6:47:38 <Eagle> well then
P6:47:39 <Infinity> that's disturbing
P6:47:53 <Roras> i dont even wnna think about it

P6:48:37 <Adura> Guess I'll add some comments to the code, hope I don't get too many Perl questions.
P6:48:52 <ZomBuster> its what spleefing  makes you do
P6:49:05 <ZomBuster> ejeculate and fart at the same time

P6:53:03 <Roras> testvan, spleef is a variation of spliff
P6:53:30 <Testvan> they sound completely different

P7:38:43 <Prime_2> I was going to suggest that he make a sign block

P7:40:30 <Eagle> It was like my second day here.
P7:40:44 <ez> and I am happy now living without you oh oh oh
P7:40:46 <vdgmprgrmr> But they were discusses quite a lot in the earlier versions.
P7:40:50 <Prime_2> I could use it to explain the mechanics behind a room's anti-griefing/accident measures

P7:41:18 <Prime_2> I've got this room that makes use of a lava ceiling, and artwork made with lava behind glass
P7:41:32 <vdgmprgrmr> The ability to show an image on a server's pre-load screen, instead of the line of text that we currently get.
P7:41:35 <Prime_2> the only way to get to it is with a water-vater that I made, that has glass paneling
P7:41:43 <Eagle> I'm sure anybody that was going to grief it would grief it no matter what was on the side.

P7:42:00 <Prime_2> the key point here is that in the event of a lava flood, you can quickly get to the water-vater and bust one of the top glass panels to flood the room, and stop the lava
P7:42:20 <vdgmprgrmr> That is an ingenius lava-flood prevention system...
P7:42:21 <Eagle> Break in case of emergency?
P7:42:25 <Prime_2> exactly.
P7:42:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Good work.
P7:42:29 <Prime_2> and I would have a sign to explain that.
P7:44:28 <Eagle> So anyways we need some shenanigans.
P7:44:53 <vdgmprgrmr> What sort of shenanigans?
P7:45:00 <Eagle> Hm...

P7:45:34 <Prime_2> if a griefer were to come into the room, I could foil his plot doing the same thing

P8:08:29 <tesseract> to see if it worked
P8:09:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you put it into the same folder as MCTool.jar, and either renamed it to configFile.txt, or changed configFile.txt in the command to the name of the file.
P8:09:29 <CH> Any of you know "Magic" ?

P8:21:00 <tesseract> i was paraphrasing
P8:21:10 <vdgmprgrmr> So it's the second?
P8:21:11 <tesseract> mctool.MCTool
P8:21:49 <tesseract> i think i know the problem
P8:21:58 <tesseract> doesn't this program require the .net framework?
P8:22:01 <tesseract> i uninstalled it.
P8:22:08 <vdgmprgrmr> ... I don't think it does...
P8:22:11 <tesseract> oh

P8:24:10 <tesseract> yay
P8:24:20 <vdgmprgrmr> You gotta get to the directory with the files in it first.

P8:24:39 <vdgmprgrmr> You know how to do that, yes?
P8:24:52 <tesseract> cd
P8:25:00 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P8:25:10 <vdgmprgrmr> So you DO know how to do that?
P8:25:32 <tesseract> cd D:\Documents and Settings\tesseract\Desktop\aarons things\games\pc\minecraft\my servers\Copy of test
P8:25:36 <tesseract> yes?
P8:25:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P8:26:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay.
P8:26:13 <tesseract> same probleeeeeeeeeem
P8:26:17 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
P8:26:25 <tesseract> could not find the main class
P8:26:26 <Testvan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yoIkQFuF6g
P8:26:30 <tesseract> but i cd'd
P8:26:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, get to the directory again, and then type "dir" and tell me what it says.
P8:27:15 <vdgmprgrmr> And make sure MCTool.jar is in it, and minecraft-server.jar is in it.
P8:27:45 <tesseract> confirmed, it never left c
P8:27:50 <tesseract> what i want is on d
P8:28:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, then before you cd, type "D:\"
P8:28:11 <vdgmprgrmr> (without the quotes)
P8:28:24 <vdgmprgrmr> then do "cd Documents and Settings\tesseract\Desktop\aarons things\games\pc\minecraft\my servers\Copy of test"
P8:28:31 <tesseract> ok
P8:28:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Did that work?
P8:29:11 <tesseract> D:\ doesn't work.
P8:29:19 <tesseract> neither does cd D:\
P8:29:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Try just "D:"
P8:29:34 <tesseract> THERE!
P8:29:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Awesome.
P8:30:07 <tesseract> garf
P8:30:12 <tesseract> now i can't get it to cd
P8:30:19 <Roras> spesta
P8:30:19 <tesseract> too many paramaters.
P8:30:24 <tesseract> do i use underscores?
P8:30:31 <tesseract> instead of spaces?
10P8:30:31 * Prime|TF2 is now known as Prime|Portal
P8:30:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah, use underscorse for spaces.
P8:30:37 <tesseract> ok
P8:30:39 <vdgmprgrmr> *underscores
P8:31:49 <Roras> hmm
P8:31:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Working now?
P8:32:05 <tesseract> this is rediculous
P8:32:06 <Roras> what should i be doing right now
P8:32:24 <Roras> fack i hate summer
P8:32:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Ridiculous wha?
P8:32:28 <tesseract> cd Documents_and_Settings
P8:32:34 <tesseract> invalid directory
P8:32:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Try doing it one folder at a time.
P8:32:47 <tesseract> cd D:\Documents_and_Settings
P8:32:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And do it like this "cd Docume~1"
P8:32:51 <tesseract> invalid directory
P8:32:56 <tesseract> wha?
P8:33:01 <tesseract> ok
P8:33:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Do "cd Docume~1"
P8:33:24 <tesseract> WTF is that!!?
P8:33:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Then cd tesser~1
P8:33:29 <Roras> what are you trying to do
P8:33:31 <tesseract> that is OLD SCHOOL
P8:33:33 <tesseract> it works
P8:33:52 <vdgmprgrmr> It is indeed old school.
P8:34:18 <Roras> once again, what are you trying to do
P8:34:20 <tesseract> it has to be 6 characters?
P8:34:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, it has to be 8 characters, but the ~# part takes two of them.
P8:34:49 <vdgmprgrmr> For file names over 8 characters you gotta do that.
P8:34:57 <Roras> second time, what are you talking about
P8:35:03 <tesseract> i NEVER knew that!
P8:35:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Isn't that the third time?
P8:35:19 <Roras> yes it is
P8:35:19 <vdgmprgrmr> And we're trying to get Rosetta's Tool working.
P8:35:27 <Roras> lemme see
P8:35:29 <vdgmprgrmr> For him.
P8:35:37 <citricsquid> 22002 registered
P8:35:42 <tesseract> also we must contend with my considerable stupidity
P8:35:47 <tesseract> so it is no easy task mind you!
P8:35:59 <tesseract> slowly navigating to the folder
P8:36:16 <Roras> you are not stupid
P8:36:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I suggest that you make a .bat file in the folder with all the stuff, and put that command in it.
P8:36:28 <Roras> its only in your mind
P8:36:49 <Punx> i ate 12 goats
P8:36:59 <Roras> what kind of goats?
P8:37:01 <vdgmprgrmr> You know how to make a .bat right?
P8:37:02 <tesseract> I don't know how to make a .bat file.
P8:37:09 <Eagle> Goasts
P8:37:12 <Eagle> Zombie Goasts
P8:37:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, go to the folder, and right click in an empty space.
P8:37:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Then click "new..."
P8:37:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Then click "Text Document"
P8:37:33 <Roras> what kind of zombie goasts lol
P8:37:50 <Eagle> You know what zombie goasts are?
P8:37:51 <Roras> what is rosettas tool?
P8:37:55 <vdgmprgrmr> And then rename the text document to "fixmeup.bat" or something like that.
P8:37:56 <tesseract> ok
P8:38:11 <tesseract> done
P8:38:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Then edit the bat (right-click -> Edit) and copy-paste the command into it.
P8:38:25 <Roras> um i think they look something like this? http://www.imeem.com/groups/vnLMwppv/photo/Rd-bqLOiHs/
P8:38:32 <vdgmprgrmr> And put a "pause" on the next line.
P8:38:54 <tesseract> right now it's set to not recognize user input in the file type
P8:39:00 <Roras> what is rosettas tool?
P8:39:00 <tesseract> .bat doesn't change the type
P8:39:03 <tesseract> it's still a txt
P8:39:07 <tesseract> i can't remember where that is
P8:39:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Hm, alright.
P8:39:39 <vdgmprgrmr> When you right-clicked and made a text file, you know how it automatically had the rename box open, and it was "New Text Document.txt"?
P8:39:50 <tesseract> mmhmm
P8:39:52 <vdgmprgrmr> You should rename it to fixmeup.bat in that rename box.
P8:39:55 <Roras> ... what is (stated before)
P8:39:58 <vdgmprgrmr> At least that's what I did, and it worked.
P8:40:10 <tesseract> It is a program used to edit maps.
P8:40:16 <Roras> hmm
P8:40:21 <Roras> i dont see it in the forum
P8:40:44 <tesseract> I know!
P8:40:50 <tesseract> I had to get it from some guy.
P8:40:53 <Roras> oh
P8:40:57 <tesseract> no, that doesn't work.
P8:40:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, it's on the forums.
P8:41:15 <tesseract> there some setting that makes it not recognize user input into the file extension
P8:41:20 <vdgmprgrmr> tesseract, okay, try just copying start server.bat and editing the copy of it.
P8:41:32 <tesseract> i turned it off, because i didn't want to write .exe after everything
P8:41:47 <Roras> nvm
P8:41:59 <Roras> ima just not go into it
P8:42:00 <Roras> ok
P8:42:08 <tesseract> ok, that works
P8:42:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P8:42:20 <tesseract> i'm putting the command in here?
P8:42:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P8:42:57 <vdgmprgrmr> And a "pause" on the next line, so it doesn't close.
P8:42:57 <Roras> oh this is not an editing application
P8:43:15 <Roras> its a map
P8:43:18 <vdgmprgrmr> No you have to write a config file, Roras.
P8:43:40 <vdgmprgrmr> It's primitive, but I've become attached to it.
P8:43:50 <Roras> ._. why not use Osici's Map Editor
P8:43:51 <tesseract> Fucking WORD!
P8:43:55 <tesseract> lol
P8:44:05 <tesseract> Thank you so much vdgmprgrmr!
P8:44:06 <vdgmprgrmr> You got it working, tesseract?
P8:44:09 <tesseract> yes.
P8:44:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Awesome.
P8:44:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Now you can just edit the config and run fixmeup.bat.
P8:44:22 <tesseract> that was an adventure into the land of dos.
P8:44:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Mucho easy.
P8:44:29 <tesseract> yes, that is what i will do
P8:44:43 <tesseract> that was cool though to learn that ~1 thing
P8:44:52 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not always ~1...
P8:44:55 <tesseract> i'd always seen that, but never understood why i couldn't cd sometimes
P8:45:08 <Roras> because part of the file name is wrong
P8:45:22 <vdgmprgrmr> What, Roras?
P8:45:27 <tesseract> When would it not be ~1
P8:45:28 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not a filename thing...
P8:45:37 <Roras> it moves to a file doesnt it?
P8:45:52 <vdgmprgrmr> tesseract, it wouldn't be ~1 if there's two different files that have the same six characters as the beginning.
P8:46:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Those two files would end up both being abcdef~1.
P8:46:17 <tesseract> then would one be ~1 and the other ~2 alphabetically?
P8:46:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Not alphabetically, but yeah, they get different numbers.
P8:46:46 <Roras> i procrastinate too much
P8:46:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, it may be alphabetically.
P8:46:56 <tesseract> I must say again thank you so much for being so patient with me.
P8:47:24 <tesseract> I wouldn't have figured it out without you or a similarly knowlegable and patient person.
P8:47:33 <vdgmprgrmr> No probs.
P8:47:50 <Roras> hes only patient if you make sense
P8:47:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Indeed. :)
P8:48:10 <tesseract> Roras i will never forget what you told me.
P8:48:14 <tesseract> I'm not stupid.
P8:48:20 <tesseract> It's only in MY MIND!
P8:48:25 <vdgmprgrmr> When people stop making sense I learn profanities.
P8:48:26 <Roras> well neither am I
P8:48:39 <Roras> nobody is stupid
P8:48:44 <vdgmprgrmr> There's stupid people.
P8:48:47 <tesseract> except for dummies.
P8:48:49 <tesseract> yeah.
P8:48:58 <Roras> depends
P8:49:08 <tesseract> yes, most people who wear depends are dummies.
P8:49:11 <tesseract> erm
P8:49:39 <Roras> you could be stupid in math and smart in english
P8:49:58 <vdgmprgrmr> There's people that are stupid in that is difficult for them to learn anything.
P8:50:05 <tesseract> Roras, I have had several jobs working with severely disabled people.
P8:50:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Stupid is an overarching term.
P8:50:14 <tesseract> Severly autistic boys.
P8:50:16 <Roras> hmm
P8:50:20 <CH> Hi Roras  :D
P8:50:23 <Roras> hi CH
P8:50:25 <vdgmprgrmr> What you're saying is good and bad, not stupid and smart.
P8:50:29 <tesseract> And I loved them and all, but they were stupid.

P8:50:37 <tesseract> There's no two ways about it.
P8:50:43 <tesseract> I agree with your point though.
P8:50:52 <tesseract> My definition of intelligence is very broad.
P8:51:05 <tesseract> I agree that most people are gifted in some way.
P8:51:18 <CH> What have you been up to?  :)
P8:51:21 <ez> hey hey
P8:51:28 <Roras> severely disabled people are not stupid though... they are just disabled
P8:51:29 <ez> Im gifted in being up too late!
P8:51:34 <tesseract> thanks again vdgmprgrmr
P8:51:40 <CH> So am I
P8:51:42 <Roras> CH i have not done anything
P8:51:43 <tesseract> you have made my dreams come true.
P8:51:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Being mentally disable makes them stupid.
P8:51:45 <CH> ok
P8:51:51 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not their fault they're stupid, but they are.
P8:51:56 <tesseract> mmhmm
P8:51:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Just like babies are stupid.
P8:52:01 <tesseract> mmhmm
P8:52:15 <Roras> hmm... but severely disabled people doesnt just mean mentally disabled
P8:52:19 <CH> Babies are secretly intelligent..
P8:52:22 <tesseract> It's not their fault, and we don't haveto dislike them, or consider them as subhuman.
P8:52:24 <Roras> they could be missing a limb
P8:52:29 <tesseract> or a lobe.
P8:52:33 <vdgmprgrmr> That's why I said disabled, Roras.
P8:52:37 <Roras> an earlobe
P8:52:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Er...
P8:52:44 <vdgmprgrmr> That's why I said MENTALLY disabled, Roras.
P8:52:59 <tesseract> My little brother has severe cerebral palsey, but he is very smart.
P8:53:00 <Roras> but tessaract said severely disabled
P8:53:12 <vdgmprgrmr> And followed it up with "autistic boys"
P8:53:16 <tesseract> I said severely disabled and gave an example.
P8:53:23 <Roras> okay, thats another thing
P8:53:24 <tesseract> of very autistic people.
P8:53:41 <vdgmprgrmr> And there are normal, every day people who are stupid.
P8:53:49 <CH> Our neighbours had an autistic son who liked tossing his teddybear up in the trees all day long.
P8:54:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Because stupid is a relative word, there has to be every day stupid people.
P8:54:03 <Roras> okay, you gave an example, but that doesnt mean that disabled means just autistic
P8:54:04 <tesseract> I know that disabled does not mean dumb. My little brother gets judged constantly because he is quadrapalegic.
P8:54:08 <EmpireBane> hey guys!
P8:54:14 <CH> HEY  :D

P8:57:28 <CH> ok
P8:57:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, it is.
P8:57:32 <CH> That makes sense.
P8:57:36 <tesseract> I looked through all his posts, but i didn't see it.

P8:59:20 <tesseract> yeah, there it is.

P9:02:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, all the cool people have readmes that just say "You can figure it out!'
P9:02:05 <citricsquid> they're too busy doing the programming!
P9:02:08 <CH> Hmm.  I never do documentation, but,  er...
P9:02:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Or don't even have a readme.
P9:02:23 <CH> I spend lot of time  thinking.  :\   -.-
P9:02:51 <CH> Probably because of my lack of sleep..  
P9:02:51 <tesseract> Whats wrong with creativity unbound?
P9:03:05 <CH> ... Err. yeah.. Bye folks.  :)  Ttyl.. Sleep time.
P9:03:22 <vdgmprgrmr> There was people here before saying Creativity Unbound had stupid, childish ops.
P9:03:36 <EmpireBane> it does
P9:03:50 <tesseract> I heard on the forums that in CO they put you in a prison and tell you rules.
P9:03:57 <EmpireBane> yep
P9:04:00 <tesseract> Which I also do on my servers.
P9:04:05 <EmpireBane> you spawn there
P9:04:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I would totally do that...
P9:04:07 <tesseract> With amazing results.
P9:04:17 <EmpireBane> well they take forever to let you out
P9:04:24 <tesseract> it's a test
P9:04:29 <tesseract> if you act like a spaz
P9:04:29 <EmpireBane> I sat there for 5 minutes
P9:04:33 <tesseract> and can't sit there for a bit
P9:04:44 <EmpireBane> it's retarded
P9:04:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Has anyone tried having the spawn in an indestructible maze, so people have to actually TRY to get into the server?
P9:04:49 <tesseract> you might not be the kind of person they want building there.
P9:04:57 <tesseract> i thought of that yesterday!
P9:05:04 <tesseract> i want to make one
P9:05:11 <EmpireBane> I've spawned in a maze
P9:05:19 <tesseract> just a massive maze, and the server will be called ESCAPE THE MAZE>
P9:05:25 <EmpireBane> I saaid it was gay and I got IP ban
P9:05:26 <CH> :D
P9:05:31 <CH> :\
P9:05:32 <tesseract> LOL
P9:05:41 <vdgmprgrmr> EmpireBane, you just sound like some sort of jerk.
P9:05:42 <tesseract> That is funny.
P9:05:51 <tesseract> That's the sort of thing I would do.
P9:05:52 <EmpireBane> What? Why?
P9:06:02 <tesseract> I would probably ban you if you said my servers rules were gay.
P9:06:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Calling people's servers gay and such.
P9:06:11 <CH> I got IP ban for talking in CAPS a few minutes.  Dam.  you P_Cat.
P9:06:17 <tesseract> OMG
P9:06:21 <EmpireBane> I was joking around
P9:06:22 <tesseract> I hate party cat.
P9:06:34 <tesseract> When the guy who runs the server starts griefing your stuff.
P9:06:40 <EmpireBane> I was typing 'jk' when I got banned
P9:06:43 <tesseract> You have reached a whole new level of grief.
P9:06:51 <vdgmprgrmr> When that happens to me I just calmly ask what-is-up-wit-dis-yo and they're either like "lol" and I leave or like "You gotta do dis to get in!" and I'm like "coo"
P9:07:11 <CH> He seemed random and funny at first, and said I could join the testing server..  And there I went again.. Trying to build stuff with him raping everything.

P9:07:45 <vdgmprgrmr> You should go to Redshift's server or nerditu.de
P9:07:48 <tesseract> He thinks that because he runs the server he can do anything to anyone no matter what.
P9:07:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty cool places.
P9:07:52 <CH> Although they are a little too jaggy.
P9:07:56 <tesseract> And it's true, he CAN.
P9:08:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, you around?
P9:08:05 <tesseract> But it is a whole new breed of griefing.
P9:08:09 <Zaratustra> I think I was locked with admincrete on redshift's spawn once
P9:08:12 <citricsquid> all: yo
P9:08:15 <Zaratustra> then kicked.
P9:08:21 <Redshift> huh
P9:08:22 <vdgmprgrmr> That's weird.
P9:08:23 <CH> ' SUP SIR?  :D  YO
P9:08:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Any chance to get a forum section where we can share level .dats?  Or would that be in mapping:
P9:08:31 <Zaratustra> then I infiltrated his adminsphere and wrote COCK in it as a feeble revenge.
P9:08:36 <Zaratustra> (also I flooded it)
P9:08:41 <Roras> i remember
P9:08:41 <CH> HAHAH
P9:08:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Natural: That'd be mapping.

P9:09:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I SUDDENLY GET IDEA HOW TO INFILTRATE SPHERE
P9:09:22 <citricsquid> may 10th

P9:09:25 <Roras> some month ago

P9:09:35 <CH> ok

P9:10:14 <tesseract> .................. yes.
P9:10:18 <Roras> im not sure
P9:10:20 <CH> AAnyway..  Kind of funny thing:   I began making a "game" long time ago, with the same concept as Minecraft sandbox-mode has.
P9:10:24 <EmpireBane> use respawn glitch to enter the sphere
P9:10:31 <CH> But I never finished it.  :D
P9:10:33 <EmpireBane> I do it all the time
P9:10:34 <tesseract> what is respawn glitch.
P9:10:48 <Roras> CH i never finish my  stuff
P9:10:57 <Roras> unless its art
P9:11:01 <CH> Hmm
P9:11:02 <Roras> or school work

P9:11:58 <CH> hm
P9:12:00 <Roras> maybe im adicted
P9:12:06 <HolyCrusade> I can't even walk around a server without being followed.
P9:12:08 <Roras> yess i know i spelled it wrong
P9:12:13 <HolyCrusade> And then when I speak up about it, the pricks ban me.
P9:12:14 <Roras> i dont care
P9:12:16 <CH> Same here
P9:12:24 <tesseract> What's wrong with being followed?

P9:12:41 <tesseract> They don't know if you're going to grief.
P9:12:53 <HolyCrusade> I ask what he wants, he says nothing, and then kicks me.
P9:13:01 <Roras> being followed... its like tailgating
P9:13:05 <HolyCrusade> I go to a corner of a map and start building, he continues to follow me.
P9:13:07 <tesseract> well, maybe he was a prick then.
P9:13:08 <HolyCrusade> Then bans me.

P9:16:01 <CH> You bet

P9:20:56 <CH> Well, if you focus on INDENTING your code and keeping it clean and proper,  you can reach far.  Maybe the 3D aspect of GM will be your thing.
P9:21:06 <CH> bye
P9:21:10 <Roras> indenting?
P9:21:15 <CH> Yes.
P9:21:19 <Roras> uhh
P9:21:21 <mib_8vxfdo> I know some Delphi so it's a little easier for me
P9:21:22 <Roras> imprinting?
P9:21:36 <Roras> importing
P9:21:40 <Roras> creating?
P9:21:41 <mib_8vxfdo> no indenting
P9:21:53 <mib_8vxfdo> you know... TAB
P9:22:00 <Roras> uh
P9:22:03 <Roras> why indenting
P9:22:14 <mib_8vxfdo> Makes it easier to read
P9:22:20 <CH> Pressing Ctrl + I  on a line, or TAB  is you have "smart tabs" enabled, but   Ctrl + I is from what I have learned, the best and cleanest solution.

P9:22:36 <Roras> intersting
P9:22:39 <tesseract> How tall are the default maps?

P9:25:35 <TrueWolves> C++ is hard?
P9:25:42 <Roras> a language
P9:25:52 <TrueWolves> I am in the middle of making a whole rpg/semistratagy with it
P9:25:58 <CH> Rapidshare some how-to's  about the C languages.
P9:26:07 <mib_8vxfdo> if you know C++, you can do most object-oriented language
P9:26:15 <CH> And how does the graphics look, TrueWolves?
P9:26:17 <Roras> i can barely understand spanish even, and ive taken two classes on it.
P9:26:26 <TrueWolves> The graphics are crap, XD
P9:26:30 <CH> :D
P9:26:34 <mib_8vxfdo> programming is different
P9:26:44 <mib_8vxfdo> It's logical
P9:26:44 <Roras> both are languages however
P9:26:44 <TrueWolves> I'm not focusing on the graphics for a loooong while
P9:26:54 <CH> ASCII, 2D side-view / top-down,  3D?

P9:27:40 <TrueWolves> ASCII, then I'm going to make it old school FF style with 2D side view battles and top down world viewishness

P9:28:38 <Roras> but i mean... its the same thing
P9:28:49 <mib_8vxfdo> just take some time to learn it and you'll see the difference

P9:29:51 <Roras> same thing for me
P9:30:01 <Daidoji> perhaps you should persue some other thing.
P9:30:03 <Roras> or, did you quote that
P9:30:10 <CH> I will make my own scripting language called LOLCAT 1.0   and it will be very  objective..
P9:30:12 <Roras> what other things
10P9:30:32 * AwaySpazzo is now known as Spazzo
P9:30:39 <Roras> i just need to get a gist
P9:30:42 <TrueWolves> There is a language called LOLCAT I think.
P9:30:42 <mib_8vxfdo> try Delphi to learn programming
P9:30:48 <Roras> Delphi?
P9:30:50 <Daidoji> if java seems to hard then I'm afraid coding isn't your thing
P9:30:53 <Daidoji> too
P9:30:55 <mib_8vxfdo> then move to C++
P9:31:06 <mib_8vxfdo> or java

P10:12:03 <vdgmprgrmr> No, there things which are impossible.
P10:12:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I assure you.
P10:12:12 <Roras> i can shrink to the size of an atom if i wanted
P10:12:13 <Super-Dot> Oh, of course
P10:12:19 <Super-Dot> It's a 1-up mushroom
P10:12:20 <Roras> simply build a machine that does it
P10:12:28 <Jat> yeah did you find the image star?
P10:12:37 <Super-Dot> But it should be yellow, not orange
P10:12:39 <Roras> the only way to discover is to imagine
P10:12:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, but it is impossible to shrink to the size of an atom without any external forces. (eg. a machine)
P10:12:54 <Roras> or to have it given to you purposely
P10:12:59 <Super-Dot> Image star?
P10:13:05 <Roras> who says
P10:13:10 <Roras> nothing is impossible
P10:13:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Things are impossible.
P10:13:20 <Roras> who says vdgm
P10:13:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Says the universe.
P10:13:27 <Roras> give proof
P10:13:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> also beda is a pretty lame name
P10:13:52 <Roras> the universe doesnt say it, logic says it
P10:13:55 <vdgmprgrmr> It is impossible to create matter.
P10:14:01 <Roras> how do you know
P10:14:11 <EmpiresBane> shrink to the size of an atom using only your brain
P10:14:14 <Jat> sorry i meant "image, star"
P10:14:15 <Roras> and is it possible to create matter?
P10:14:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> everything is
P10:14:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> pants
P10:14:20 <Roras> i mean
P10:14:26 <Roras> to take it away
P10:14:34 <Rroff> what is matter?
P10:14:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> baby don't hurt me
P10:14:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait no
P10:14:49 <Roras> whatever facts say it is
P10:14:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I say there are things which are impossible, Roras disagrees.
P10:14:56 <EmpiresBane> solid energy?
P10:15:05 <Roras> yes its possible
P10:15:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> is roras possible?
P10:15:17 <CH> Pants is in my pants in my pants.  :O

P10:15:35 <CH> You are a neural net, a computer program.
P10:15:37 <CH> :)
P10:15:37 <EmpiresBane> It is impossible to destroy energy
P10:15:42 <Roras> so i do exist
P10:15:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, Roras, I take your logic, and reveal a paradox! If everything is possible, then it is impossible for something to be impossible, thus making being impossible ONE THING that IS impossible, rendering the statement "Nothing is impossible" invalid.
P10:16:05 <vdgmprgrmr> :o
P10:16:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> everything is pants
P10:16:13 <Roras> well it is possible to be impossible
P10:16:15 <CH> YES
P10:16:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> the impossible is pants
P10:16:17 <CH> Pants.
P10:16:25 <EmpiresBane> This statement is false.
P10:16:27 <Roras> but its possible
P10:16:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> this satement is pants

P10:18:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> thank you global
P10:18:43 <Roras> but that doesnt mean that its impossible
P10:18:57 <Roras> the thing is
P10:18:57 <CH> Dumb discussion is now dumb.
P10:19:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> really?
P10:19:04 <CH> I like pie.
P10:19:05 <Daidoji> did someone mention pants
P10:19:05 <Roras> you think too logically
P10:19:13 <CH> yes
P10:19:13 <Roras> thats jsut one point of view
P10:19:23 <Daidoji> because calling your main character my pants in any rpg is the best thing you can do
P10:19:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I think too logically?
P10:19:30 <Roras> yes
P10:19:36 <CH> :D
P10:19:48 <Daidoji> swordcraft story 1 and 2 had the most amazing results
P10:19:50 <Roras> you need to be able to see other persons points of view if you are to learn anything
P10:19:56 <Roras> other than what is logic
P10:19:56 <CH> Nicee
P10:19:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> Got a =Life Capsule=!
P10:20:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Mmhmm, and how do you judge if something is "too logical" or not?
P10:20:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i have a life guys
P10:20:17 <CH> No.
P10:20:19 <Roras> not relevant
P10:20:23 <CH> You only have pants.
P10:20:32 <vdgmprgrmr> We're not even arguing.
P10:20:35 <Roras> i know
P10:20:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I just wanna know how you judge if something is "too logical".
P10:20:53 <Roras> you cant

P10:21:05 <Daidoji> http://ilm.johnnythemidget.com/image/sn2_mypants01.jpg

P10:23:57 <Roras> okay, but i think you are logical
P10:24:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, I think I am logical as well.
P10:24:10 <Roras> thats what you seem to convey to me
P10:24:16 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Okay.
P10:24:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I guess that's... a good thing... or something.
P10:24:35 <vdgmprgrmr> People thinking I'm logical and such.
P10:24:41 <CH> Ma'gaash.   You are human, your brain is complex as [ ? ]   and to me, it seems like you think deeply and are very self-analyzing and perhaps depressed.  That is all.

P10:24:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Me?
P10:24:55 <CH> Roras
P10:24:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, okay.
P10:25:10 <Roras> but i was just saying, from what i know, that you may or may not want to look at things from a different perspective
P10:25:19 <Roras> see how its like on the other side of the wall
P10:25:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> you sure do
P10:25:34 <Roras> logic only goes as far as it is
P10:25:36 <vdgmprgrmr> I have tried to see things from a different perspective, and I saw lots of contradictions.
P10:25:46 <CH> I look at things from different perspectives all the time.
P10:25:47 <Roras> because you compared them to logic

P10:26:12 <Roras> thus you are referring two completely different things to eachother
P10:26:14 <CH> Logic is relative.
P10:26:16 <vdgmprgrmr> There's a reason people compare things to logic all the time, you know.
P10:26:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> do you look from a different perspective etc
P10:26:30 <vdgmprgrmr> It's because logic makes sense.
P10:26:38 <Roras> but logic is not emotion
P10:26:38 <Daidoji> shut up
P10:26:39 <Daidoji> goddamn
P10:26:50 <Roras> they are two different things in all ways
P10:26:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
P10:26:53 <vdgmprgrmr> What, who should shut up, and why?
P10:26:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> i love you
P10:26:57 <Daidoji> both of you
P10:27:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Why?
P10:27:07 <mezo> daidoji hows your zelda map
P10:27:08 <Daidoji> because you're ruining my boner
P10:27:10 <vdgmprgrmr> This is, as far as I can tell, a friendly discussion.
P10:27:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> because the chatroom needs some quietness
P10:27:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> lolol
P10:27:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> also beta is better than beda clearly
P10:27:31 <vdgmprgrmr> And emotion can be explained by logic.
P10:27:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> clearly
P10:27:38 <Roras> but it is not logic
P10:27:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> and that is a fact/logic
P10:27:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> can't counter it
P10:28:02 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, emotions necessitate a mind.
P10:28:05 <Eagle> God I can't even figure out what this discussion is about.
P10:28:13 <Syndlig> Haha
P10:28:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's not about pants
P10:28:18 <Daidoji> it's about waxing poetic
P10:28:28 <Syndlig> Hey everyone shut up and figure out what the argument is and then you can start arguing again.  :D
P10:28:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Logic does not necessitate a mind.
P10:28:33 <Roras> religion cannot compared to logic
P10:28:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> this would be the newest low if it were about pants though
P10:28:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Sure it can.
P10:28:42 <Eagle> I am SO confused.
P10:28:44 <Roras> okay then explain god
P10:28:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'd hate to see pants in so much shame
P10:28:58 <vdgmprgrmr> God is a fictional character.
P10:29:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you follow me f
P10:29:05 <Roras> are you sure
P10:29:08 <Eagle> Really, I should just call Eagle's Law here.
P10:29:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure.
P10:29:14 <Daidoji> frankly I enjoy a pleated pant for work as opposed to denim jeans.

P10:29:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Ugh. We've been down this road before, Roras.
P10:29:57 <Roras> which is why i said you need to look at things from different perspective
P10:30:05 <Eagle> Equal and opposite reactions would not help in an argument
P10:30:08 <Roras> not everything is in concrete
P10:30:10 <vdgmprgrmr> It basically ends with you saying tons of things that don't make any sense at all.
P10:30:28 <Roras> you seem to look at everything in a logical way
P10:30:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep, I do.
P10:30:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> you do indeed
P10:30:40 <Roras> try looking at it from an autistic way
P10:30:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's why i see you two arguing
P10:30:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Why would I look at things in an autistic way?
P10:30:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> why am i talking
P10:31:06 <Roras> because its not the same as what you know
P10:31:12 <Roras> therefore it is something you can learn
P10:31:32 <vdgmprgrmr> It is something. I can learn that it does not make sense.

P10:31:39 <vdgmprgrmr> It does not line up with reality.
P10:31:42 <Roras> that is logic thinking for you
P10:31:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> hello punx at work welcome to the most nsfw chatroom ever
P10:31:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, there's a reason for all this logic.
P10:32:05 <Roras> autistic people do not have logic
P10:32:15 <Roras> so it msut be foreign to you
P10:32:17 <vdgmprgrmr> It's because logic is based on things which happen.
P10:32:26 <Roras> alot of thingshappen
P10:32:30 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, reality and such.
P10:32:33 <Roras> but what about the things that dont happen
P10:32:43 <Roras> are they not important?
P10:32:48 <vdgmprgrmr> The things that don't happen obviously do not happen.
P10:32:59 <vdgmprgrmr> And thus, we cannot factor them into logic.
P10:32:59 <Roras> but are they not important?
P10:33:07 <vdgmprgrmr> It depends on the context.
P10:33:17 <vdgmprgrmr> And what you mean by "does not happen".
P10:33:39 <Roras> it does not exist, not put into concretion, not fully understood
P10:33:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Surely you can give me an example of what you're specifically saying "does not happen"?
P10:33:53 <Eagle> Oh my god
P10:33:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, those things are very different.
P10:33:59 <Eagle> what are you people talking about
P10:34:08 <Punx_Work> dead babies
P10:34:09 <Roras> you asked for a context
P10:34:12 <Roras> i gave you three
P10:34:16 <Eagle> No seriously.
P10:34:19 <vdgmprgrmr> You just tried to mix "does not exist" and "not fully understood" into the same word.
P10:34:20 <Eagle> What are they talking about
P10:34:21 <Punx_Work> DEAD
P10:34:23 <Punx_Work> BABIES
P10:34:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Which does not work at all.
P10:34:28 <Roras> logic
P10:34:32 <Daidoji> they are verbally masturbating themselves
P10:34:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah we're talkin' about logic.
P10:34:41 <Eagle> Logic.
P10:34:42 <vdgmprgrmr> I say it works.
P10:34:44 <Roras> try thinking the other way
P10:34:44 <Eagle> Are you serious
P10:34:46 <Punx_Work> daidoji.. I think ur right
P10:34:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras says... I'm not really sure.
P10:35:00 <Punx_Work> VDG, stand upside down and thing

P10:35:08 <Roras> well
P10:35:14 <Daidoji> RAMBLE ON
P10:35:16 <Eagle> Because scrolling up, I cannot find one thing that is logical that you have said.

P10:35:30 <Roras> try to think like me... is it possible for you to think like me?

P10:36:19 <Roras> im just trying to say, think with a different perspective.
P10:36:23 <vdgmprgrmr> And vague does not mean illogical.
P10:36:24 <Roras> try it
P10:36:39 <Roras> and you will see if you really can or not
P10:36:39 <Daidoji> that's a strawman
P10:36:54 <Roras> if you are stuck to one idea
P10:36:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, all the other perspectives end with things that don't line up with what ACTUALLY HAPPENS.
P10:37:19 <Eagle> What I meant is that puking vague descriptions at each other is not arguing about logic.

P10:38:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, Punx has something to say.
P10:38:30 <Punx_Work> dude

P10:38:46 <vdgmprgrmr> What, no.
P10:38:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said that.
P10:39:02 <Punx_Work> however if i dont care about anything i eventually die

P10:39:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, if you care about nothing you die faster than you normally would.
P10:39:20 <Punx_Work> i coul go out and fuck a herd of sheep tomorrow
P10:39:24 <Syndlig> Not necessarily.
P10:39:25 <Roras> okay so what is the point of learning

P10:42:10 <Punx_Work> the fact that you're trying to cinvince us of anything, or even voice an oppinion is proof you care
P10:42:11 <Roras> is it really, its interesting to live
P10:42:15 <Eagle> YES
P10:42:16 <Roras> when you know your going to die
P10:42:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I know I'm going to die.
P10:42:29 <Eagle> It is interesting, since you don't know what will happen.
P10:42:40 <Punx_Work> im gonna blow myself up
P10:42:41 <vdgmprgrmr> (At least, I'm pretty sure... humanity so far has 100% record on that...)
P10:42:47 <Punx_Work> lol
P10:42:49 <Punx_Work> tru tru
P10:42:56 <vdgmprgrmr> But I still would like to live.
P10:43:01 <Roras> for what
P10:43:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it's interesting.
P10:43:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I like it.
P10:43:11 <vdgmprgrmr> (Most of the time.)
P10:43:16 <vdgmprgrmr> (Sometimes.)
P10:43:17 <Roras> so you live because you like it.
P10:43:21 <Roras> does that make sense?
P10:43:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Mmhmm.
P10:43:25 <Punx_Work> meh, i dont care about wether im dead or not, but im just gonna have fun in whatever state im in regardless
P10:43:29 <Eagle> Roras, the thing you don't seem to get is that "It is interesting" doesn't need a reason.
P10:43:33 <Eagle> IT IS a reason
P10:43:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Eagle is also correct.
P10:44:00 <Punx_Work> *me hands roras a loaded gun...
P10:44:04 <Punx_Work> fucking fail
P10:44:06 <Punx_Work> ignore that
P10:44:07 <Roras> but does it make sense to live if your gonna die
P10:44:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh uperfail.

P10:45:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> what cologne
P10:45:27 <Roras> only the outer part of me that you can actually sense makes sense

P10:46:50 <Roras> its only in your head
P10:46:55 <vdgmprgrmr> There are people who are wrong.

P10:48:23 <Drakkar> nothing really to show yet anyway
P10:48:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> move on with life
P10:48:26 <Roras> but i dont need to be logical to be myself
P10:48:28 <Drakkar> I have to handle all the nitty gritty
P10:48:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, if it's impossible for ANYONE to be wrong, then why do you argue?
P10:48:46 <Drakkar> its hard scifi so lots of research
P10:48:58 <Punx_Work> aahh the boring part :(
P10:49:10 <Daidoji> I'll answer for you
P10:49:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> the fun part you mean
P10:49:16 <Daidoji> because arguing is fun
P10:49:17 <Drakkar> kind of fun for me actually
P10:49:17 <Roras> logic is based on everything compared to WHAT A SUBJECT (person/s) KNOWS
P10:49:18 <Drakkar> but
P10:49:24 <Drakkar> for others its pretty boring
P10:49:28 <Roras> therefore if you dont know it, it doesnt exist
P10:49:30 <vdgmprgrmr> If it's impossible for anyone to ever be wrong, then I'm obviously CORRECT when I say "people can be wrong".
P10:49:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> science
P10:49:47 <Punx_Work> whats the theme?
P10:49:50 <vdgmprgrmr> But... whoops, that's contradictory.
P10:50:04 <Drakkar> its transhumanist near-future space colonizationness
P10:50:05 <Roras> hmm based on logic
P10:50:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Based on YOUR logic, even.
P10:50:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> hmmm
P10:50:28 <Roras> i dont think logically therefore you consider me not intelligent
P10:50:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Everyone is correct, thus any person who says that people can be wrong is also correct.
P10:50:42 <Punx_Work> sweet deal
P10:50:46 <Roras> i dont think logically therefore you consider me not intelligent
P10:50:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I consider you illogical.
P10:50:49 <Punx_Work> what view is it in?
P10:51:03 <Roras> okay
P10:51:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Which you... obviously are.
P10:51:05 <Drakkar> going to be quasi-isometric
P10:51:08 <Roras> i dont need to make sense
P10:51:14 <Roras> for people to understand me
P10:51:15 <Punx_Work> i have no clue what that even is?
P10:51:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, if you don't make sense, no one will actually understand you.
P10:51:30 <Eagle> If I go up to Drakkar and say to him "You are vdgmprgrmr", am I correct? No. Probably not.

P10:52:33 <Daidoji> you've been stranded on an island for several days. one day two villagers from opposing tribes approach you. they both ask you to come to their village. you know that the one of them belongs to the village of headhunters who will always lie, whereas the other belongs to a village of peaceful fishermen who always tell the truth.
P10:52:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Is what I am saying REAL when I say that you are wrong?

P10:52:42 <Daidoji> you may only ask one question from one villager. woot.
P10:52:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> my law states that i am awesome and you are all jealous

P11:02:04 <Roras> brainwashing
P11:02:16 <Daidoji> fakeposting
P11:02:18 <Eagle> Brainwashing doesn't work over irc
P11:02:20 <Roras> i do what i want though
P11:02:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Hey Roras.
P11:02:24 <Roras> hiya
P11:02:30 <Eagle> Hello.
P11:02:32 <Roras> better yet
P11:02:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> hi.
P11:02:33 <Roras> goodbye
P11:02:36 <Eagle> :D?
P11:02:43 <Punx_Work> Good riddance
P11:02:48 <Roras> ever played earthbound?
P11:02:53 <Eagle> All day
P11:02:59 <Roras> ever been to moonside?
P11:03:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> no.
P11:03:03 <Roras> no you havent
P11:03:03 <Eagle> Yeah
P11:03:05 <vdgmprgrmr> If nothing has to be logical, then why are you trying to convince anyone that things don't have to be logical, because, if nothing at all is logical, then no one can ever be really correct.
P11:03:07 <Roras> i thoughht so
P11:03:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i haven't played that game.
P11:03:12 <Eagle> I've been to Moonside.
P11:03:12 <Daidoji> guys here's something illogical and minecraft related: notch's mindnumbing use of y for elevation.
P11:03:18 <Roras> ive not
P11:03:21 <Daidoji> DEAD HORSE. COMMENSE THE BEATING.
P11:03:25 <Roras> YES
P11:03:27 <Roras> lol
P11:03:29 <Eagle> Everything is black and all the outlines are multicolored
P11:03:34 <Roras> lmao
P11:03:34 <Eagle> Moonside.
P11:03:41 <Roras> its just amusing
P11:03:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Daidoji, not everyone uses Z for elevation!
P11:03:48 <Roras> moonside is bad
P11:03:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I use Y for elevation.
P11:03:52 <Roras> but technically its good
P11:03:52 <Daidoji> everyone in the world of 3D gaming does
10P11:03:53 * Armonte (Monte@c-69-245-121-44.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P11:03:54 <Eagle> Moonside is fun.
P11:03:58 <Daidoji> except for notch
P11:03:59 <Roras> no it isnt
P11:04:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Blitz3d uses Y for elevation.
P11:04:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what y isn't used for elevator?
P11:04:11 <Roras> btw............ MOOONSIDE IS BACKWARDS.
P11:04:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> ion
P11:04:15 <Roras> yes means nio
P11:04:20 <Daidoji> WHAT IS BLITZ3D
P11:04:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> pants
P11:04:27 <Daidoji> since I never heard of it it's nothing of note I'm sure
P11:04:28 <Roras> pants
P11:04:31 <Eagle> Yes it is. You talk to a person and he says "Can I sharpen you?" That was hilarious when I read it.
P11:04:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Blitz3d is a 3d game programming language.
P11:04:34 <Eagle> It was fun.
P11:04:37 <Roras> lol
P11:04:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> then when he actually does sharpen you
P11:04:52 <Daidoji> thanks for pointing that out though
P11:04:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> you discover it is no longer just a game
P11:04:56 <Roras> i have a pencil eraser
P11:05:00 <Daidoji> I'll never even think about using that as a base.
P11:05:04 <Roras> and an eraser eraser
P11:05:07 <Roras> in my inventory
P11:05:08 <Eagle> Beta you just rocked my mind
P11:05:11 <Roras> RIGHT NOW
P11:05:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, I don't care, but that doesn't make it any less existent.
P11:05:22 <Daidoji> and yes I would write an entire engine off for that alone.
P11:05:35 <vdgmprgrmr> And it proves there ARE people in the 3d game world that use Y for elevation.
P11:05:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I do, Notch does, probably everyone who uses B3d do.
P11:05:46 <Daidoji> yes but that's a like one right
P11:05:46 <Roras> thoughts are illogical? OH BUT I THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS LOGICAL?
P11:05:51 <Daidoji> out of 10,000 game engines
P11:05:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> what would happen if someone used z for 2d games
P11:05:55 <Eagle> Thoughts aren't the world.
P11:05:59 <Roras> then thats obviously contradictory
P11:06:04 <Eagle> What?
P11:06:05 <Daidoji> I would be equally angry
P11:06:06 <Eagle> No it's not.
P11:06:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, why do you try to argue?
P11:06:28 <vdgmprgrmr> You've said it yourself that you don't make any logical sense.
P11:06:28 <Roras> anything pertaing to thoughts of man is part of the world
P11:06:30 <Eagle> Thoughts aren't the world, because if they were, THINGS WOULD SPONTANIOUSLY APPEAR IN THIN AIR
P11:06:36 <Eagle> Or
P11:06:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Eagle: Thoughts are parts of the world.
P11:06:51 <Eagle> People would be constantly dying because people think of murdering.
P11:06:57 <Daidoji> thoughts are a part of your brain you fucking retard.
P11:06:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> we are all parts of a thought
P11:07:00 <Eagle> Thoughts are part of your mind.
P11:07:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> if we all think equally
P11:07:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> then it would happen
P11:07:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> WHAT
P11:07:13 <TrueWolves> thoughts ARE part of the world, they are pulses of sorts in your brain
P11:07:22 <Roras> but
P11:07:32 <Daidoji> but they don't exist physically.
P11:07:40 <Eagle> I always thought those were pulses in your brain, or chemicals flowing around. Sure they caused thoughts
P11:07:41 <vdgmprgrmr> And thoughts can be ILLOGICAL, but they become ILLOGICAL by LOGICAL processes, like how an at least semi-random number is generated by purely non-random methods.
P11:07:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> they exist SPIRITUALLY
P11:07:42 <Roras> then how do thoughts work
P11:07:51 <Daidoji> they exist cause our brain says they do
P11:07:53 <Roras> if thoughts are illogical then whats to say
P11:07:59 <Roras> they are different then the world
P11:08:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> we worship pants
P11:08:03 <Punx_Work> roras, I'd like to meet you for the sole purpose of kicking you in the head
P11:08:07 <Eagle> Because you can think anything
P11:08:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh my gosh Punx, I agree with you on almost everything, it seems.
P11:08:20 <Eagle> You can picture an impossible object in your head
P11:08:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> ... i can't
P11:08:29 <Roras> but is this world logical if one thing in it is illogical
P11:08:30 <Eagle> So what, that means nothing about the world
P11:08:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> how do you imagine 4d in your head
P11:08:39 <Roras> but is this world logical if one thing in it is illogical
P11:08:45 <Eagle> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_uwsynVdRG0A/SWgbpcEw06I/AAAAAAAAAIE/RxCHHxr-3BA/s400/ImpossibleObject.jpg
P11:08:46 <vdgmprgrmr> You can't, AnnihilatorBeta.
P11:08:49 <Eagle> Think about that.
P11:08:56 <Punx_Work> omg its a box
P11:08:57 <Infinity> lololol blogspot
P11:09:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
P11:09:03 <Eagle> lololol googled it
P11:09:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Not looking close enough, punx?
P11:09:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> it is an image in the form of a .jpg file
P11:09:11 <Daidoji> but I'll humor you and suggest that if they did exist as part of the world they have absolutely zero influence on anyone but yourself.
P11:09:12 <Roras> well, its there, so it exists
P11:09:15 <Eagle> Picture that in your head
P11:09:31 <Roras> okay
P11:09:36 <Eagle> That does not mean you can build it in real life
P11:09:36 <Roras> did
P11:09:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Eagle: I can picture that image in my head.
P11:09:39 <vdgmprgrmr> It's 2d.
P11:09:49 <Roras> but it exists
P11:09:54 <Roras> because it is there
P11:09:55 <Punx_Work> wait
P11:09:56 <Daidoji> you could bullshit argue that and say a thought is put into words and technically that thought affects people but that's silly.
P11:09:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> as a .jpg file
P11:09:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes
P11:09:59 <Roras> it is a physical picture
P11:10:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I cannot imagine the object pictured in 3 dimensions, though. And it does not exist, no.
P11:10:03 <Punx_Work> did you say that object really exists?
P11:10:13 <Eagle> A picture of that object really exists
P11:10:17 <Eagle> Not the actual object
P11:10:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, that object does not exist.
P11:10:19 <Punx_Work> correct
P11:10:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> what object
P11:10:29 <Punx_Work> i wanna fucking set you on fire
P11:10:38 <Roras> vdgmprgrmr have you ever heard of the saying "if one is ignorant, let them be ignorant"?
P11:10:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes I have.
P11:10:46 <Daidoji> but yeah by that ~logic~ haha look at that there.
P11:10:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> the image of the object or the object of the object in the image
P11:10:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I also think that statement is stupid.
P11:10:53 <Punx_Work> which is what we're letting you be..
P11:10:56 <Roras> then DO SO AND STOP FUCKING CORRECTING ME
P11:11:07 <Eagle> THEN STOP FUCKING CORRECTING US
P11:11:10 <Roras> I DONT WANT TO THINK LIKE YOU
P11:11:14 <Roras> I AM NOT
P11:11:14 <Punx_Work> THEN MAKE GODDAMN SENSE
P11:11:17 <Roras> NO
P11:11:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Roras, did you not read my next message?
P11:11:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> THEN STOP USING CAPS
P11:11:27 <vdgmprgrmr> <vdgmprgrmr>I also think that statement is stupid.
P11:11:31 <Roras> yes i read that
P11:11:37 <Eagle> Roras, god, you're like some ignorant brat who wants everything his way
P11:11:39 <Punx_Work> THESE ARENT CAPS THESE ARE SIMPLY PICTURES OF OBJECTS THAT REALLY EXIST
P11:11:42 <Eagle> You don't want to think like us
P11:11:46 <Roras> i dont want to
P11:11:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> i also think that statement is pants.
P11:11:48 <Eagle> yet we HAVE to think like you?
P11:11:53 <Roras> but i dont want you to think like me
P11:11:57 <vdgmprgrmr> It seems...
P11:11:59 <Eagle> then why are you arguing?
P11:12:02 <Roras> because then you are like me
P11:12:06 <Eagle> Go away if you have nothing to say
P11:12:06 <Punx_Work> If I thought like you I'd cut my dick off
P11:12:08 <Roras> because I GUESS I LIKE TO ARGUE
P11:12:10 <Eagle> and by that I mean go away
P11:12:13 <Eagle> like seriously
P11:12:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I suddenly feel less guilty for using tons of caps with Roras.
P11:12:33 <Punx_Work> vdg i hate your name
P11:12:38 <Roras> because its fun to me to argue
P11:12:41 <Daidoji> it will take a thousand years before anyone can hook a computer up to someones brain and then visually put that on a monitor or a holgram or whatever the hell they have by then
P11:12:41 <Punx_Work> it makes my head hurt
P11:12:48 <Roras> uh
P11:12:51 <Roras> they already did
P11:12:53 <Eagle> Roras, well too bad. Go argue with people who also like to argue
P11:12:55 <Roras> check the news
P11:12:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Punx, I've thought of changing it to "Veedee" since that name has less connotations.
P11:13:07 <Roras> Daidoji they already did...
P11:13:14 <Daidoji> no they goddamn didn't
P11:13:17 <Eagle> You can't make sense out of it
P11:13:17 <Roras> its on 60 minutes
P11:13:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I like to argue, but I gotta say, I absolutely hate arguing with Roras.
P11:13:29 <Eagle> All you get is like some retarded patterns and such
P11:13:32 <Daidoji> yes
P11:13:34 <Punx_Work> VeeDee = Venereal Deisease? 
P11:13:34 <Daidoji> it's noise
P11:13:43 <vdgmprgrmr> What, no!
P11:13:44 <Daidoji> the brain puts out HOLY SHIT brainwaves
P11:13:49 <vdgmprgrmr> NOT VENEREAL DISEASE
P11:13:55 <Roras> moo
P11:13:58 <vdgmprgrmr>  >.<
P11:13:59 <Daidoji> but I'm talking about a computer translating that into actual imagery we can plainly fucking see.
P11:14:06 <Eagle> vdgmprgrmr change your name to vdgm
P11:14:07 <Roras> yes
P11:14:11 <Roras> they already have that
P11:14:15 <Eagle> I'm used to typing that. :{
P11:14:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Why would I change it to vdgm?
P11:14:17 <Eagle> *:P
P11:14:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't wanna be "videogame"
P11:14:27 <vdgmprgrmr> That would be dumb!
P11:14:28 <Eagle> XD
P11:14:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> so we can make acronyms out of it
P11:14:33 <Daidoji> what laboratory has this thing you speak of
P11:14:34 <Infinity> lol
P11:14:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> because it's easier that way
P11:14:38 <Daidoji> I demand links in 5 minutes or less
P11:14:40 <Punx_Work> arguing with Roras is like arguing with a mentally challenged kid...
P11:14:44 <vdgmprgrmr> try making acronyms out of vdgmprgrmr!
P11:14:44 <Roras> yes
P11:14:48 <Daidoji> otherwise calling bullshit
P11:14:50 <Roras> because its fun
P11:14:54 <Eagle> Arguing with Roras is like arguing with a cat
P11:14:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> hm

P11:15:05 <Daidoji> I'd google it myself, but hey back up your own claims.
P11:15:13 <Roras> okay
P11:15:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Eagle: Cats make way more sense.
P11:15:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> ok roras
P11:15:36 <Eagle> XD
P11:15:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you are a cat
P11:15:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait
P11:15:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Cats, and other animals, tend to be pretty damn logical.
P11:15:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> well you are a cat
P11:15:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> but
P11:16:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait no you're not

P11:20:58 <Roras> lol
P11:21:00 <Eagle> I am just thinking "What a retard."
P11:21:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> not soon before they are back
P11:21:11 <Roras> but i made you mad right?
P11:21:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
P11:21:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> why would i be mad

P11:23:02 <Roras> If you find yourself doing illogical things just to feel better about yourself, feel free to look inward and be comforted by the distinct humanness of your actions. People are not logical creatures--the constant fight of science against pseudoscience is but an embodiment of this. A person will not only do things which are bad for humanity, he or she will do things which are bad for him or herself, simply to prove
P11:23:02 <Roras>  that he or she is human and capable of doing so.
P11:23:23 <Punx_Work> nor am I
P11:23:45 <Punx_Work> also
P11:23:49 <Punx_Work> pics or it didnt happen
P11:23:54 <Eagle> Illogical things to feel better about myself
P11:23:55 <Roras> ?
P11:23:56 <Eagle> such as?
P11:24:05 <Roras> im not talking to you
P11:24:09 <Roras> im talking to me
P11:24:12 <Eagle> ...
P11:24:13 <Eagle> Um
P11:24:15 <Eagle> Okay
P11:24:15 <Punx_Work> ...
P11:24:19 <Punx_Work> then fuck off
P11:24:25 <Punx_Work> and dont fucking talk to yourself here
P11:24:26 <Roras> im just putting it for all to see
P11:24:32 <Eagle> We don't want to see.
P11:24:41 <Roras> nobody said that
P11:24:45 <Eagle> Okay then
P11:24:51 <Roras> before
P11:25:01 <Eagle> You should just assume, you idiot.
P11:25:09 <Roras> but then i assume illogical
P11:25:12 <Roras> dont i?
P11:25:19 <Eagle> Yeah, apparently.
P11:25:21 <Eagle> You know this
P11:25:22 <Roras> because apparently i am deemed illogical
P11:25:36 <Roras> so then i wouldnt be able to follow your command
P11:25:45 <Punx_Work> no you're deemed annoying
P11:25:57 <Eagle> You know that you think illogical (apparently), so you should know that what you think we want to hear is wrong
P11:26:23 <Roras> then i guess i am intent on doing this
P11:26:28 <Eagle> Okay so
P11:26:29 <Eagle> troll
P11:26:39 <Roras> but now anything i say will make you say STFU in some variation
P11:26:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> i won that
P11:27:06 <Eagle> Roras if you said something that made sense, I wouldn't tell you to STFU
P11:27:30 <Roras> would you do that to retarded people irl
P11:27:35 <Eagle> No
P11:27:36 <Punx_Work> yes
P11:27:39 <Eagle> You aren't retarded.
P11:27:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe
P11:27:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> well unless they're super annoying
P11:27:47 <Eagle> You're just an idiot.
P11:27:50 <Punx_Work> i punch reatards in their heads
P11:27:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> but i would just walk away
P11:27:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> but then you see
P11:28:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> i haven't experience with a specifically 'retarded' person
P11:28:11 <Roras> just shows what kind of person you are Punx
P11:28:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> i mean i've seen them
P11:28:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what
P11:28:58 <Roras> ok
P11:29:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> bionic arms are possible
P11:29:12 <Roras> then what is impossible
P11:29:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> expect to see bionic commandos soon
P11:30:00 <Eagle> Roras that was actually a good watch.
P11:30:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> 12 minutes up?
P11:30:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah that's an interesting video yeah yeah
P11:30:32 <Roras> who is to say, just because something doesnt exist doesnt mean its not impossible. it just means its, improbable?
P11:30:58 <Eagle> Okay, that made sense.
P11:31:04 <Eagle> And I'd have to agree on that.
P11:31:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> awesome
P11:31:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> let's end the argument
P11:31:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> because we can lay an agreement
P11:31:14 <Roras> im not arguing
P11:31:19 <vdgmprgrmr> There are things which are logically impossible.
P11:31:22 <Eagle> Let's end the discussion.
P11:31:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> stop asking so many questions
P11:31:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> when i say argument it usually means discussion ok
P11:32:00 <Roras> what else is there to talk about
P11:32:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I say we give up on communicating extensively with Roras.
P11:32:05 <Daidoji> gay porn
P11:32:07 <Daidoji> tits
P11:32:10 <Daidoji> dongs
P11:32:12 <Roras> ...
P11:32:13 <Eagle> pants
P11:32:16 <Daidoji> kittens
P11:32:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> whoa whoa
P11:32:20 <Roras> uh
P11:32:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> eagle
P11:32:21 <Daidoji> minecraft?
P11:32:23 <Daidoji> haha1
P11:32:27 <Eagle> Pff
P11:32:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> what's a minecraft
P11:32:38 <Roras> minecraft?
P11:32:42 <Daidoji> think you guys wandered into the wrong channel
P11:32:45 <Daidoji> I think you want #mindcraft
P11:32:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh yeah
P11:32:51 <Roras> hmm
P11:32:52 <Eagle> oh oh
P11:32:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> thanks daidoji
P11:32:53 <Roras> good call
P11:32:58 <mezo> ro
P11:33:03 <Roras> too bad it doesnt exist
P11:33:04 <Eagle> i was looking for @#gayporn
P11:33:07 <Roras> hey mezo
P11:33:08 <mezo> vdgmprgrmr
P11:33:08 <Eagle> I overshot
P11:33:10 <Eagle> a lot
P11:33:14 <mezo> you're a ____________
P11:33:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> roras
P11:33:19 <Roras> i didnt read that book cuz i couldnt buy it
P11:33:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> you will discover that it does exist
P11:33:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> but it is empty
P11:33:28 <mezo> which book
P11:33:33 <Roras> cosmos
P11:33:39 <Roras> oh wait that wasnt you
P11:33:43 <Roras> that was some other guy
P11:33:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually it's not empty!
P11:33:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Is it?
P11:33:55 <Roras>  dont know
P11:34:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Can someone test it for me?
P11:34:05 <Roras> so its improbable
P11:34:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm in #mindcraft
P11:34:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> well let's go back to the argument since it doesn't exist it's not there but if you go inside it actuall does see logic ablarbkg
P11:34:30 <vdgmprgrmr> So if someone clicks on that will that work?
P11:34:39 <Daidoji> yes
P11:34:45 <vdgmprgrmr> That's really cool.
P11:34:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> technically speaking
P11:34:55 <Daidoji> unless they have an illogical irc client
P11:34:56 <Roras> we craft our minds by testing our mental accuracy on everything
P11:34:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> they don't technically exist when you technically join the channel
P11:35:07 <mezo> dont say illogical around vdgmprgrmr
P11:35:08 <Daidoji> and therefore do not deserve the crafting of ones mind
P11:35:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> waut
P11:35:17 <mezo> or we'll have to listen to some star trek vulcan quotes
P11:35:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I always thought there was some kind of process you had to go through to make an irc channel.
P11:35:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> did i say not?
P11:35:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> i mean
10P11:35:21 * Rydia (Haruhi@68.186.97.143) has joined #minecraft
P11:35:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> fuck
P11:35:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh hi rydia
P11:35:34 <Roras> strufms
P11:35:35 <Daidoji> the only process it REGISTERING a channel
P11:35:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> that wasn't pointed at you rydia
P11:35:40 <Daidoji> which gives you permanent ops
P11:35:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> ignore that!

P11:36:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> speaking of which this channel needs more ops
P11:36:14 <Daidoji> yes like me
P11:36:16 <Daidoji> I was here first
P11:36:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> or me
P11:36:20 <Roras> but wait...
P11:36:22 <vdgmprgrmr> No not Daidoji.
P11:36:22 <Daidoji> I was here before notch, I rule.
P11:36:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes me
P11:36:36 <Punx_Work> roras how old are you
P11:36:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> i've been here since the beginning
P11:36:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> elitism ftw
P11:36:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I was here around the same time you were, Daidoji!
P11:36:51 <vdgmprgrmr>  :D
P11:36:55 <Eagle> I've been here a while too. :P
P11:36:58 <Daidoji> yeah well I'm 31 you're 13
P11:36:59 <Daidoji> deal with it
P11:37:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> but i have been here every day 
P11:37:09 <Punx_Work> roras ur 13..
P11:37:18 <Punx_Work> everything you say is irrelevant 
P11:37:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're 31?
P11:37:34 <Daidoji> yes, what of it
P11:37:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure Roras is 16, but he is also 13, and he also doesn't have an age that can be represented by a number. He's B years old.
P11:37:38 <Roras> another dimension = logic illogical?
P11:37:39 <Roras> another dimension = improbable
P11:37:39 <Roras> logic illogical in other dimension = IMPROBABLE
P11:37:50 <Eagle> He is triangle years old.
P11:37:54 <Daidoji> can an older gamer not play with blocks
P11:37:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep.
P11:38:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> what size of triagle
P11:38:07 <Roras> is that right vdgm
P11:38:08 <vdgmprgrmr> He's triangle years old, and B years old at the same time, but B does not equal triangle.
P11:38:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> triangle
P11:38:15 <Eagle> Every size
P11:38:16 <Roras> is that right vdgm
P11:38:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> will it give me 1+ for my polar star
P11:38:20 <Roras> another dimension = logic illogical?
P11:38:20 <Roras> another dimension = improbable
P11:38:20 <Roras> logic illogical in other dimension = IMPROBABLE
P11:38:21 <Infinity> i'm /b/ years old too :D
P11:38:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes it is.
P11:38:30 <Roras> what i just said
P11:38:30 <Eagle> Roras we saw that the first time
P11:38:32 <Roras> using logic
P11:38:44 <Punx_Work> SPAM, KICK HIM
P11:38:48 <Roras> >.>
P11:38:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> i thought we agreed to end this discussion
P11:38:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree!
P11:38:54 <Eagle> Also that isn't logic.
P11:38:57 <Infinity> i disagree
P11:38:58 <Roras> it isnt?
P11:39:00 <Punx_Work> no
P11:39:04 <Eagle> Since you don't know the existance of other dimensions
P11:39:07 <Eagle> or their logic
P11:39:10 <Infinity> therefore
P11:39:11 <Roras> so its Improbable
P11:39:13 <Infinity> you can make no conclusions
P11:39:16 <Eagle> No
P11:39:16 <Roras> because you dont know
P11:39:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> exactly
P11:39:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> only mythbusters make conclusions
P11:39:28 <Eagle> It's not probable or improbable
P11:39:31 <Roras> its highly improbable because you dont know about it
P11:39:35 <Punx_Work> upvote annh
P11:39:35 <Eagle> No
P11:39:36 <vdgmprgrmr> No...
P11:39:36 <Eagle> No
P11:39:37 <Eagle> No
P11:39:41 <Eagle> It's not probable or improbable
P11:39:44 <Infinity> ajdlk;fjasdkfasdf
P11:39:48 <Roras> so...
P11:39:50 <Daidoji> the funny part about probability is that it's improbable
P11:39:59 <Roras> same thing
P11:40:02 <vdgmprgrmr> We don't know it thus we don't know if it's probable or improbable or if it even exists.
P11:40:09 <Eagle> Exactly what I said.
P11:40:24 <Roras> well i got vdgm talking like me
P11:40:26 <Eagle> Roras, you aren't using logic. You are stringing false assumptions and random words together.
P11:40:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Well everything has to be said twice, and everything has to be said three times too.
P11:40:38 <vdgmprgrmr> But it has to be both, not one or the other.
P11:40:46 <Eagle> And making sentences that we have to read a couple of times to freaking understand you
P11:40:49 <Roras> lol
P11:40:54 <vdgmprgrmr> (I'm mocking you, if you didn't catch it, Roras.)
