12P4:43:45 * Awol10 (Awol@206.173.165.111) Quit (Quit: Trillian (http://www.ceruleanstudios.com)
P4:44:16 <Azjherben> Back
P4:45:07 <Azjherben> Worked
P4:45:18 <citricsquidSLEEP> I'm not asleep
10P4:45:20 * citricsquidSLEEP is now known as citricsquid
P4:45:24 <citricsquid> @zuriki
P4:45:27 <LKA> citric you lied to us
P4:45:30 <LKA> or something like that
P4:45:37 <Zuriki> D:
P4:45:38 <citricsquid> irc keeps changing my name >:(
10P4:45:54 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
P4:47:41 <Azjherben> Hi citricsquid
P4:48:17 <citricsquid> yo
P4:48:32 <Azjherben> I think I added the security you suggested.
P4:48:42 <citricsquid> How do you check file type?
P4:48:52 <Azjherben> It
P4:49:02 <Azjherben> 's already in PHP
P4:49:08 <Azjherben> All you have to do is
10P4:49:09 * Themage (richyates1@24.149.92.110) has joined #minecraft
P4:49:22 <Azjherben> $type = $_FILES["name"]["type"]
P4:49:25 <citricsquid> ugh
P4:49:25 <citricsquid> no
P4:49:27 <Azjherben> ?
P4:49:27 <citricsquid> that's mimetype
P4:49:29 <Themage> CAn someone help me with my problem luanching a server?
P4:49:32 <citricsquid> the mimetype is given by the browser
P4:49:33 <Azjherben> Oh?
P4:49:37 <Azjherben> Okay
P4:49:37 <citricsquid> so I can "give" the mimetype for .dat
P4:49:40 <citricsquid> when uploading php
P4:49:51 <citricsquid> and then destroy the site.
P4:49:57 <Azjherben> I'll keep looking for the best way
P4:50:15 <Azjherben> For now it rejects anything with a minetype of .dat and that dosn't have ".dat" in it.
P4:50:27 <citricsquid> Open the file and read the first 64 characters (I think that's it?) with PHP and check what it gives there
P4:50:28 <Azjherben> Do you know? Before I start looking?
P4:50:35 <Azjherben> Okay
P4:50:42 <Azjherben> Sounds good
P4:50:47 <Azjherben> Or
P4:50:52 <Azjherben> Scan the whole file for "php"
P4:50:58 <Azjherben> if it's anywhere in there
P4:51:02 <Azjherben> Reject it
P4:51:04 <citricsquid> no
P4:51:11 <Azjherben> Why not?
P4:51:12 <Adura> Minetype, hah.
P4:51:17 <citricsquid> you check if it is dat, if it isn't then refuse.
P4:51:20 <citricsquid> Not the other way around
P4:51:29 <citricsquid> .php, .php5 etc
P4:51:30 <ZomBuster> aagh more overflow
P4:51:35 <ZomBuster> I don't get it :(
P4:51:45 <Adura> You can confirm if it's a good map if you know what makes a good map.
P4:52:07 <Azjherben> Right now we are just making they olny upload maps
P4:52:09 <ZomBuster> what makes me a good map
P4:52:15 <Azjherben> We aren't even talking about quality control yet
P4:52:31 <Adura> I mean legit map, hah.
P4:52:40 <Themage> Can someone help me?
P4:52:45 <Azjherben> I guess
P4:52:59 <Themage> when I try to execute the jar file it comes up with "Failed to load Main-Class Manifest attribute 
P4:53:00 <Azjherben> Anyway
P4:53:03 <Azjherben> Yup
10P4:53:04 * Themage (richyates1@24.149.92.110) has left #minecraft
P4:53:07 <Azjherben> Get the latest java
P4:53:10 <Azjherben> Instal in C:\
P4:53:16 <Azjherben> then go into start menu
P4:53:20 <Azjherben> click "run"
P4:53:23 <Azjherben> type in "cmd"
P4:53:26 <Azjherben> and type this
P4:53:43 <Azjherben> (Saying you have your minecraft folder on the desktop)
P4:53:51 <Azjherben> cd Desktop/minecraftstuff
P4:54:06 <Azjherben> c:\javafolderhere\bin\java -jar OME.jar
P4:54:19 <Azjherben> I renamed my minecraft folder with OME a
P4:54:23 <Azjherben> and my java folder j
P4:54:29 <Azjherben> So I can do it quickly.
P4:54:57 <Azjherben> C:\j\bin\java -jar Desktop\a\OME.jar
P4:55:03 <Azjherben> In the command prompt.
P4:55:22 <Azjherben> Back to my maps site thing
P4:55:31 <Azjherben> So I have to read the first 64 bits
P4:57:25 <Azjherben> And what am I checking for exactly?
P4:57:28 <ZomBuster> damnit
P4:57:31 <Azjherben> ?
P4:57:35 <ZomBuster> I managed to create a map
P4:57:37 <ZomBuster> so complex
P4:57:43 <Azjherben> ya?
P4:57:47 <ZomBuster> it creates overflow
P4:57:52 <citricsquid> I made 64 bits up, but it's a certain part of the file header that includes the real file type.
P4:58:06 <Azjherben> Okay
P4:58:17 <Azjherben> BRB
P4:58:45 <citricsquid> http://pastebin.ca/1502511
P4:58:55 <citricsquid> That's part of a .png, as you can see at the top it conaints the filetype
P4:58:57 <citricsquid> contains*

P4:59:57 <Azjherben> So what makes a .dat file uniqute, that I could search for?
P5:00:03 <Azjherben> I know it dosn't have %dat
P5:00:11 <Azjherben> Wait
P5:00:18 <Azjherben> Isn't there a wiki page on that
P5:00:44 <ZomBuster> try to connect http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cfe8b64d8aeca7fb61c20060840bb0b5

P5:01:36 <Azjherben> How do I check for four hex bytes in a file?
12P5:01:57 * citricsquid (sam@client-81-97-76-212.mcr-bng-013.adsl.virginmedia.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P5:03:43 <Adura> Some sort of PHP beginner?
P5:03:52 <Azjherben> Not really
P5:04:02 <Azjherben> I just never needed to read that kind of stuff
P5:04:34 <Azjherben> In fact
P5:04:42 <Azjherben> My question is more with the .dat format
P5:05:24 <citricsquidSLEEP> aren't minecraft maps zipped or something but with .dat filetype?
10P5:05:30 * citricsquidSLEEP is now known as citricsquid
P5:05:38 <cryzed> they are gzipped
P5:05:50 <citricsquid> so not actually .dat?
12P5:06:04 * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5E49C.versanet.de) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
P5:06:30 <Azjherben> Ya
P5:06:37 <Azjherben> I just read about it
P5:06:41 <Azjherben> They are gzipped
P5:10:46 <Azjherben> Hmm
P5:11:10 <Azjherben> I don't see how checking bytes can be possible with out requiring people to decompress files first
P5:11:45 <Adura> You extract it on your end.
P5:11:51 <ZomBuster> I dont get it.. the level loads fine in any 3rd party level editor, there is no water/lava or even sand/gravel.
P5:12:19 <ZomBuster> and still it doesnt work
P5:13:09 <Azjherben> Hmm
P5:13:33 <Azjherben> Even compressed they still have the same first few bytes
P5:13:44 <Azjherben> So, I just check for those bytes.
P5:15:16 <Azjherben> I GTG do something
P5:15:23 <Azjherben> But I think I figured out a way.
P5:18:22 <JTE> o.o
P5:18:37 <JTE> Silly...
P5:18:44 <Rroff> you can use zlib to read/write gzip on the fly
P5:19:08 <JTE> Any awesome application ever uses zlib.
P5:19:17 <Rroff> ?
P5:20:16 <JTE> It's true. Name one application which is awesome and doesn't use zlib.
P5:20:34 <Rroff> wasn't quite sure what you were saying
P5:20:55 <Rroff> I started work on a grief repair tool but got bored of parsing the java serialisation into a struct long before I got anywhere much :(

P5:21:55 <Ush> actually
P5:21:55 <JTE> Heh.
P5:22:18 <Ush> dont you just hate it when an op on a server goes nuts and bans all other ops?
P5:22:41 <Rroff> :O
P5:22:52 <Rroff> my trusted OPs have web control panel access too
P5:22:56 <Rroff> so they could over-ride
P5:23:15 <Ush> oof
P5:23:19 <Ush> so much trust
P5:23:20 <Darkebrz> Ush
P5:23:26 <Ush> ?

P5:23:38 <Ush> it wasnt my server

P5:24:27 <Rroff> http://aten-hosted.com/images/mcadmin.jpg
P5:24:28 <Ush> the map owner had just left, so they were obviously biding their time
P5:24:37 <Rroff> old version as I've now moved everything into catagories
P5:25:00 <Ush> so they have access to that?
P5:25:07 <Darkebrz> What should I make a skin of?

P5:27:10 <Ush> *a map
P5:27:29 <UnknownX> only if the computer ip's differ
P5:27:31 <Rroff> aslong as your not username banned and the other PC has a different external IP

P5:28:11 <Darkebrz> What should I make a skin of?
P5:28:24 <Ush> hmm would it say "You've been ip banned!" or just a general "You've been banned!"?
P5:28:34 <Darkebrz> You've been banned!

P5:54:44 <Ush> How is it running?
P5:58:43 <Ush> I may as well ask this: if anyone is on the map I mentioned, and a player with meteo in his name is there, would you mind asking him to unban Ush and BallinStalin (rogue op banned us)? You would be making a stranger on the internet happy...

P9:00:41 <citricsquid> :3
P9:01:35 <fleshBasedProcessor> I made a big stalactite and a long twisting path along a wall leading up to it. Then a guy named sqwigly made a shitty looking one right next to it

P9:04:14 <citricsquid> not really, i can make you an op though so you can kick them if you want :D
P9:04:22 <fleshBasedProcessor> Did anyone grief my rebuilt Satan yet?
