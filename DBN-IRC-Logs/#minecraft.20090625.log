A3:47:50 <Flyboy> Cool.
A3:48:05 <Flyboy> So what's going on?
A3:48:29 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm resisting the temptation to throw my drink on my computer...
A3:50:15 <Parthon|ENLIGHTENED> why?
A3:50:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it angers me.
A3:50:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Just tryin' to watch some TV shows.
A3:51:05 <vdgmprgrmr> And it insists on freezing.
A3:51:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, it's consistent.
A3:51:36 <vdgmprgrmr> At least. It happens exactly after one episode ends.
A3:51:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Any episode.
A3:51:48 <vdgmprgrmr> It ends, computer freezes, I reboot.
A3:52:05 <vdgmprgrmr> But every time it happens I just want to beat the living shit out of it.
A3:53:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I tried another video player, but when I did that it froze mid-episode, screwing up my whole download-next-while-watching-current system, since Firefox refuses to pick up where it left off.

A4:02:08 <vdgmprgrmr> The OS-switch came at the same time as moving hardware from a dead computer to mine.
A4:02:29 <Evil-Ville> Maybe it's a combination of both
A4:02:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Although it seems XP 64-bits only differences are small negatives.
A4:03:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Everything's the same, except it can't play DOS games, and standard 32-bit applications seem to use more CPU than before...

11A11:30:46 <DBN> Rroff: seen this? http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Map_Editing_(hex)
A11:31:02 <Rroff> I've read the wiki
A11:31:08 <Rroff> doesn't really tell me anything thats not obvious tho
11A11:31:23 <DBN> http://www.javaworld.com/community/node/2915 this helped me understand the first part of the headers
A11:31:24 <ZomBuster> isnt the first part all java'd
A11:32:04 <Rroff> theres a header then an array of key/pairs with some extra bits for the key title length, etc.
A11:32:08 <Rroff> then the main level lump
A11:32:23 <Rroff> but theres a few bytes relating to how java stores the data that I'm not sure of
11A11:32:41 <DBN> at the start of the level array is a number saying how large it is
10A11:33:07 * Enthernalcz (vyo.rad@gw.i2net.cz) has left #minecraft
11A11:33:09 <DBN> if you make a small level with the editor it's easier to analyze

A11:34:00 <Rroff> is default java serialisation
11A11:34:03 <DBN> yea
A11:34:03 <Rroff> so that won't change
11A11:34:17 <DBN> most of the first part shouldn't change
A11:34:33 <Rroff> then you have the size of
A11:34:35 <ZomBuster> anyone got good level ideas
11A11:34:51 <DBN> the data is seperate from the part that defines the object
A11:34:54 <Rroff> is the size part 16bit or is that a token + sizeof
11A11:35:36 <DBN> not sure yet how many bytes the size is
A11:36:46 <Rroff> it has null, 20 (32 bytes), then com.mojang... (which is 32 bytes long)
A11:37:25 <Rroff> I'm not sure if the 00, 20 is a token + sizeof (8bit) or a 16bit size

11A11:38:22 <DBN> the strings are probably 16bit
A11:39:21 <Rroff> hard to tell unless theres any 257+ byte entries
A11:39:22 <Rroff> heh
11A11:40:51 <DBN> doesn't really matter to me, i'm just gonna hardcode the headers
A11:41:10 <Rroff> thats ok until something changes heh
11A11:41:26 <DBN> yea but when something changes you have to update either way :P
11A11:42:08 <DBN> wish notch would've used a real format
A11:42:11 <Rroff> thats why I prefer an XML style format
A11:42:25 <Rroff> still retains backwards compatibility with all but the most extreme changes
11A11:42:28 <DBN> xml would be kinda wasteful here
A11:42:37 <Rroff> simplified version would be ok
A11:43:01 <Rroff> but then you can just chuck anything in
A11:43:08 <Rroff> without worrying about breaking compatibility
A11:43:17 <Rroff> even editor specific entries that would be ignored by the game
A11:44:32 <ZomBuster> Notch did say something about changing level formats at some point

A11:45:32 <Zuriki> to 2048bit RSA encrypted format.
11A11:46:01 <DBN> if the client can decrypt it then so can we
A11:46:01 <Rroff> meh

P1:07:34 <Zuriki> Ah
P1:07:41 <Rroff> Moddington its not the server not dying
P1:07:53 <Rroff> theres a problem where sockets will stall in FIN_WAIT1 forever

P1:11:57 <Rroff> when I got back there was 100 of the damn processes looping
P1:14:19 <Moddington> Hmm, the only way to switch from public to private is by restarting the server?
P1:14:26 <Moddington> Or vice-versa?
P1:14:57 <Rroff> think so
P1:15:00 <Rroff> same with unbanning
P1:15:07 <Rroff> I think you have to restart for it to have effect
P1:15:25 <Moddington> Hmm, the port didn't stay open this time.
P1:15:37 <Rroff> your using linux?
P1:15:45 <Moddington> Aye, Ubuntu.
P1:15:55 <Rroff> netstat | grep -v grep | grep FIN_WAIT
P1:16:05 <Moddington> And hey, there's money in my pocket I didn't know about.

P1:16:20 <Rroff> theres money in my pocket I did know about :P
P1:16:27 <Moddington> $20 in bills?
P1:16:31 <Rroff> was my birthday yesterday and no one seemed to know what to get me
P1:16:35 <Rroff> so they all gave me money
P1:16:42 <Moddington> Heh, same happens with me.
P1:16:53 <Zuriki> Zuriki has submitted a new skin called Spleef! Blue!

P1:17:23 <Moddington> So, any ideas why I can't connect to my own server?
13P1:17:31 * Moddington hasn't done much networking stuff. Ever.
P1:17:37 <Rroff> do you have a route to your wan IP?
P1:17:40 <wingboy> you on vista?
P1:17:48 <Rroff> otherwise you will need to use the local IP+port in the URL
P1:18:03 <Moddington> Okay.
P1:18:45 <Zuriki> Note: Turn off verify names
P1:20:13 <mezo> anyone here a master of the internet?
P1:20:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> has anyone seen Ale on their server lately?
P1:22:05 <Moddington> Hmm, local IP+port didn't work.
P1:22:28 <Moddington> Said "You cannot connect to the server with this address anymore" or similarily.
P1:22:39 <Zuriki> You obviously didn't listen to me
P1:22:43 <Zuriki> TURN OFF VERIFY NAMES
P1:22:45 <Moddington> I did turn it off

P1:22:57 <Zuriki> Wrong IP then
P1:23:04 <Zuriki> 127.0.0.1 = IP
10P1:23:05 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
P1:23:09 <Zuriki> Then whatever port you used
P1:24:00 <Moddington> Nope.
P1:24:05 <Moddington> "You can't connect to the server via this url any more!"
P1:24:12 <Zuriki> Then you have some foooked computer
P1:24:40 <Zuriki> Try restarting the server app
P1:24:44 <Zuriki> Then doing that IP again
P1:24:48 <ZomBuster> if 127.** doesnt work try your local ip
P1:24:59 <ZomBuster> like 192.168.136 or whatever
P1:25:13 <Zuriki> 192.168.x.x
P1:25:15 <Rroff> or try localhost
P1:25:18 <Rroff> might map back
P1:25:28 <Zuriki> Mines 192.168.0.2 :D
P1:25:37 <Rroff> or does minecraft need a dotted IP?
P1:25:43 <Zuriki> Needs IP
P1:25:43 <Moddington> My IP is 209.91.102.54
P1:25:50 <Zuriki> That's not local
P1:26:19 <Rroff> thats either your WAN IP or you have a badly configured network

P2:29:41 <ZomBuster> ill look into it
P2:30:21 <Rroff> gzread(gzFile,buffer,filelen) would read the entire decompressed file into memory

P2:41:42 <ZomBuster> uuh whatever that is :P *googles it*
P2:42:45 <Rroff> but I think for map sizes atleast upto 2048x2048x2048 theres a quicker way to do it
P2:42:52 <Rroff> tho I think it would break above that
P2:43:40 <Rroff> but then...

P2:44:18 <ReaperSWE> how large is a single cube?
P2:44:26 <ZomBuster> I thought minecraft only supports up to 512x512x512
P2:44:30 <ReaperSWE> a byte?
P2:44:44 <Rroff> currently in the map each block is 1 byte
P2:44:50 <Rroff> I dunno what the limits are
P2:45:04 <Rroff> but anything over 512x512x512 is gonna get silly fast
P2:45:12 <Deathbat> Dear Minecrafters, Im getting a error called "Pixel Format Not Accerated" Ive searched your wonderfull forums and have tried the solutions posted on there, Im using a Rather old Intel 82815 Graphics card, (32MB) On a brand new copy of XP) I belive my drivers are updated, im using the latest JAVA and have tried it through 3 browsers, Opera, Firefox, Internet explorer.    Any Help Guys?
P2:45:47 <Rroff> GPU prolly doesn't do 32bit color in 3D
P2:46:03 <Rroff> those old i8 series IIRC struggled to do 16bit as it was
P2:46:24 <Rroff> think highest my i810 supported was 24bit
P2:46:30 <PuyoDead> I get the same error when I boot into win7 on this same machine
P2:46:40 <PuyoDead> yet XP is fine. same hardware, so it's not the GPU
P2:46:47 <Rroff> aero
P2:46:58 <PuyoDead> yea, I've read that
P2:47:05 <PuyoDead> haven't tried it yet, though
P2:47:14 <Deathbat> So, My GPU is the problem?
P2:47:20 <Rroff> most likely
P2:47:30 <Rroff> even with newer drivers I don't think it supports the color depth minecraft needs
P2:47:35 <Quatroking> Probably, after all it's an intel card

P3:24:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe if the player skins had a bigger resolution we could make more things
P3:24:36 <LF> A resolution selection would be nice
P3:24:43 <LF> like double and quadruple
P3:24:47 <LF> that'd easy be enough
P3:24:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I feel like making a server, where the whole map is 64x64x128 and 64x64x118 of it is just dirt.
P3:24:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> but when you think about it
P3:24:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> it doesn't fit with everything else
P3:25:01 <LowBatt-Dot> But low-res is cooltimes
P3:25:06 <vdgmprgrmr> And hidden throughout the dirt, are random chunks of gold.
P3:25:19 <vdgmprgrmr> And people are supposed to dig, and find the gold.
P3:25:26 <mezo> yea keeping player resolution flush with environment textures is good
P3:25:27 <Droqen> You could do that normally :O
P3:25:33 <LowBatt-Dot> vdgm, I would enjoy such a map
P3:25:47 <mezo> why don't you just dig for gold on regular maps
P3:26:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> if gold actually meant something then yeah it would be fun
P3:26:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Because regular maps have VEINS of gold.
P3:26:06 <LF> It'd be nice if each arm and leg had their own skin
P3:26:14 <vdgmprgrmr> This is random single blocks of it.
P3:26:17 <LF> so the person can have different arms

P3:26:46 <vdgmprgrmr> And when two people find the same piece of gold, ownership is decided via a spleef game.
P3:26:47 <LowBatt-Dot> Yeah, that'd be useful for pirate mobs
P3:26:55 <Droqen> Hehe'

P3:27:23 <LF> also alpha channel support on skins
P3:27:28 <vdgmprgrmr> A peg leg in MC would look so ridiculous...
P3:27:51 <LowBatt-Dot> I would like alpha channel support, but it lends itself to abuse
P3:27:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> how would alpha channel work when there's no actual lighting except shades
P3:27:58 <LF> yeah
P3:28:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait
P3:28:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh
P3:28:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> i mean etc
P3:28:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> fads
P3:28:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> i read somethnig wrong
P3:28:18 <LF> yeah
P3:28:28 <LF> It'd be cool to say make a floating robot or something
P3:28:35 <LF> but it's easily exploitable
P3:28:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> it would be even better if we could change the player's size/shapes
P3:28:54 <LowBatt-Dot> You could make the legs fire-blasts
P3:29:10 <LowBatt-Dot> From the robot's hover-rockets
P3:29:12 <LF> changing the size/shape is also exploitable as hell
P3:29:15 <LF> also hard to implement
P3:29:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> i mean preset shapes and sizes?
P3:29:40 <LF> ah
P3:29:44 <LF> Like a selection?
P3:29:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> sure
P3:29:55 <LF> yeah that could be cool
P3:30:07 <LowBatt-Dot> It would be nice to be able to make an egg mob
P3:32:38 <Droqen> There needs to be a way to make long hair ;p

P3:36:54 <wingboy> i have a notch on mah server :D
P3:36:55 <Droqen> What do you mean?
P3:37:15 <LowBatt-Dot> Like current heads, but with a thin block attached to the bottom of the head
P3:37:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe they could be sprite based hmm
P3:37:19 <LowBatt-Dot> At the back
P3:37:21 <Droqen> - I was thinking there could be flat bits that you could add coming straight down from the back/sides, or straight out from the back/sides
P3:37:36 <LowBatt-Dot> Sprite based would probably work best
P3:37:38 <Droqen> Not an actual block, just a flat surface
P3:37:48 <Droqen> I think that would be 'sprite based'?
P3:37:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> let's go back to infiniminer
P3:38:00 <LowBatt-Dot> That's one area that DOES benefit from alpha-transparency

P3:39:16 <Droqen> sometimes they're nice

P3:39:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> trixels?
P3:39:25 <LF> 9x9
P3:39:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> what?
P3:39:33 <LF> would be nicer since it'd add a center grid
P3:39:38 <LowBatt-Dot> Voxels would take up too much space
P3:39:42 <LowBatt-Dot> Memorywise
P3:39:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes but
P3:39:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> trixels?
P3:40:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> trixels are the future :>
P3:40:17 <LF> (For instance two of my skins look weird because central stuff is obset
P3:40:22 <LowBatt-Dot> Trixels are just a data structure and method for displaying voxels

P3:40:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> but trixels are nice hm
P3:40:53 <Droqen> LF: but then people who want symmetry might have messed up skins
P3:40:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> whatever that has ntohing to do with this
P3:41:14 <LF> Symmetry is easy to do with a central line
P3:41:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> why would that be?
P3:41:26 <LF> just add a single pixel in the middle of whatever colour that is
P3:41:27 <LowBatt-Dot> The problem with 9x9 is that the whole game has a powers-of-two aesthetic
P3:41:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> true
P3:41:34 <LF> Yeah I know
P3:41:49 <LF> But eh, I like to put a bit more detail in to my sprites
P3:41:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wanted to make a karoshi skin but his eyes are too big
P3:42:01 <Droqen> Lf: for central stuff in 8x8, just add an extra pixel to the side. ;p
P3:42:11 <Droqen> You can always do some fix but it doesn't mean it won't look weird.
P3:42:11 <LF> then it gets too big

P3:53:07 <mib_na37pi> single player works
P3:53:07 <mib_na37pi> but i just tried another server
P3:53:09 <mib_na37pi> and that doesnt work
P3:53:15 <mib_na37pi> it just connects forever, and if i click or do anything it crashes
P3:53:22 <Evil-Ville> Try this one http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=656b5887cbf258166109cdde6b09a653

P5:26:51 <Rroff> ^^
P5:27:00 <Rroff> even the big new sites are picking up on the TMZ story
P5:27:10 <Rroff> atleast the BBC says "Unconfirmed reports from TMZ"
P5:27:14 <Misterangry> and now tab isin't working either

P7:35:37 <CheeToS> the code guarantees you a preorder
P7:35:42 <Miclee> Windows 7 is just Vista.
P7:35:49 <Eagle> But a little better
P7:36:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> i keep hearing that it's faster than xp?
P7:36:08 <CheeToS> in some benchmarks, yeah
P7:36:20 <CheeToS> it's definitely speedier
P7:36:25 <CheeToS> (i'm using the RC right now)

P8:37:58 <Rroff> its heaven for programming
P8:38:01 <Infinity> damn
P8:38:02 <Infinity> nice
P8:38:10 <Rroff> 4 full size code pages side by side
P8:39:01 <Daidoji> honestly the only thing I'd use a second monitor for would be irc
P8:39:07 <Rroff> just wish there was a way to play games on both monitors without the bezel in the middle
P8:39:08 <Infinity> lolwut
P8:39:11 <Infinity> i use my second monitor for everything
P8:39:24 <Daidoji> alt-tab 4 lyfe
P8:39:31 <Infinity> ...
P8:39:34 <Quatroking> I use my main monitor for gaming and internet and my second for chat and music
P8:39:35 <Infinity> just try it out
P8:39:41 <Quatroking> and monitoring stuff
P8:39:48 <Daidoji> <Rroff> just wish there was a way to play games on both monitors without the bezel in the middle
P8:39:48 <Infinity> yeah same here
P8:39:49 <Infinity> except
P8:39:50 <Daidoji> 3 monitors.
P8:39:53 <Infinity> i also rune firefox on secondary monitor
P8:39:55 <Rroff> I use an old laptop for mIRC, etc.
P8:39:58 <Infinity> cuz it's to my left and at an angle
P8:40:04 <Daidoji> yeah that's what I was gonna say
P8:40:08 <Infinity> so if some NSFW shit pops up no one passing by hallway will see
P8:40:11 <Rroff> 3 monitors still has the bezels
P8:40:14 <Quatroking> rofl
P8:40:37 <Daidoji> using an old pc and a crummy monitor would be ideal for irc
P8:40:52 <Rroff> all internet and crap I keep away from my main systems
P8:41:08 <Daidoji> since you could leave it on all night without much worry while you turn down the ole 700 watt munching gaming beast
P8:41:18 <Rroff> that too
P8:41:36 <Rroff> tho I tend to turn it off at night these days lol
P8:41:43 <Daidoji> that said I run my pc all the time and my power bill isn't over $50
P8:41:49 <Quatroking> If I ever get a second GTX280 (or they start giving videocards 3 outputs) I might get a third monitor
P8:42:00 <Quatroking> Then I'd have 1,5 meters of screen
P8:42:04 <Rroff> 3 is a bit overkill imo
P8:42:05 <Infinity> rroff since you seem to have lots of money rent a dedi from www.prq.se so you can also host child porn and seed torrents for us
P8:42:08 <Daidoji> but I also spent a good chunk replacing every bulb in the house with flourescent
P8:42:13 <Rroff> I only really use my second one when programming
P8:42:15 <Daidoji> so it counteracts it 
P8:42:29 <Rroff> I rent my dedis from rapidswitch
P8:42:30 <Quatroking> Well even though I have two monitors I still keep noticing lack of space
P8:42:32 <Quatroking> :P
P8:42:36 <Rroff> but no porn torrents
10P8:42:42 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) has joined #minecraft
P8:42:50 <Infinity> where is rapidswitch located
P8:42:57 <Daidoji> 3 is perfect for flight simming
P8:42:58 <Rroff> UK (Suprise)
P8:43:03 <Infinity> ah
P8:43:04 <Daidoji> actually that's probably the only use
P8:43:14 <Rroff> infact last torrent I seeded was the ETQW demo release
P8:43:17 <Rroff> (legal)
P8:43:18 <Infinity> these prices are kinda steep
P8:43:19 <Daidoji> since the center bezel in say il-2 would be annoying as hell
P8:43:22 <Quatroking> Well I'm getting a PS3 soon so 3 monitors would be handy
P8:43:26 <Rroff> you get what you pay for
P8:43:35 <Infinity> i rent from www.limestonenetworks.com
P8:43:43 <Daidoji> I actually have my ps3 connected to this monitor
P8:43:44 <Infinity> no problems 99.9% uptime
P8:43:52 <Rroff> great KVMoIP if you manage to hose your server
P8:43:53 <Daidoji> it's got an input toggle for hdmi
P8:43:59 <Rroff> and customer service is second to none
P8:44:05 <Infinity> you should keep the light sin your room normal
P8:44:09 <Quatroking> My H223HQ's support HDMI too, and are switchable from input on-the-fly
P8:44:09 <Daidoji> the only downside is I have to run a second set of speakers
P8:44:11 <Infinity> the flickering from flourescant is annoying
P8:44:15 <Daidoji> actually..
P8:44:28 <Daidoji> I could run one set, since one has dual inputs
P8:44:28 <Quatroking> Daidoji did you know you can just use your pc speakers?
P8:44:41 <Daidoji> yes I know
P8:44:46 <Daidoji> but I didn't have a splitter
P8:44:48 <Infinity> i have a $50 dollar soundcard and a $50 headset, it sounds better than a $200 surroudn soudn system
P8:44:48 <Quatroking> get a minijack to minijack cable (barely 5 bucks) and plug it from your PS3 to your line-in on your pc
P8:44:53 <Daidoji> the output is on the monitor itself
P8:44:57 <Rroff> I only have a decent amount of disposable income coz I sold my old place and moved back in with my parents :|
P8:45:01 <Daidoji> the sound comes solely from hdmi
P8:45:09 <Daidoji> so I have to do it that way
P8:45:22 <Rroff> and they charge basically nothing as rent
P8:45:38 <Infinity> lol
P8:45:45 <Punx> omgz
P8:45:45 <Infinity> but you can't invite your gf over for secks
P8:45:46 <Quatroking> A friend of mine has two monitors with both hdmi, and does it that way.
P8:45:47 <Infinity> if you live with ur parents
P8:46:06 <Quatroking> just throw the audio through your computer's line-in and it works perfectly with your computer speakers
P8:46:28 <Rroff> yeah its a downside Infinity
P8:46:28 <Daidoji> I use my line-in for mic
P8:46:30 <Quatroking> of course you'll have to throw up the volume of your line-in port too
P8:46:35 <Quatroking> eh
P8:46:37 <Daidoji> since I have a shitty creative x-fi gamer
P8:46:38 <Rroff> but then I'm more of a one night kinda guy anyhow
P8:46:42 <Daidoji> it only has one input
P8:46:42 <Infinity> wat
P8:46:45 <Infinity> that's unfortunate
P8:46:48 <Quatroking> wait wait hold on
P8:46:51 <Daidoji> yeah their newer ones are gay
P8:46:55 <Quatroking> then what do you use your mic port for?
P8:46:58 <Daidoji> it's like HEY SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT PLATINUM BRO
P8:47:09 <Daidoji> recording
P8:47:09 <Rroff> love my x-fi xtreme music
P8:47:10 <Infinity> i have an x-fi gamer
P8:47:12 <Infinity> it's good
P8:47:15 <Quatroking> wut
P8:47:23 <Daidoji> mic/guitar
P8:47:25 <Infinity> and a Creative Fatal1ty headset
P8:47:26 <Quatroking> ah
P8:47:33 <Rroff> if you have CMSS-3D tweaked properly positional audio in games is dope
P8:47:47 <Quatroking> I'm lucky I have a realtek card
P8:47:54 <Quatroking> I can just change ports from function
P8:47:57 <Daidoji> actually I have an old soundblaster platinum breakout box
P8:48:15 <Daidoji> but the fucker is not compatible with the newer SB cards
P8:48:42 <Quatroking> I've got my front mic and front headphone ports sharing the same signals
P8:48:49 <Quatroking> so I can use two headsets at once
P8:48:54 <Daidoji> that was nice since it had a midi in/out on it
P8:48:56 <Quatroking> great when watching movies with friends at night
P8:49:19 <vdgmprgrmr> I am restarting this same goddamn download for the sixth time right now.
P8:50:02 <Infinity> k.
P8:50:06 <Quatroking> torrent or direct download?
P8:50:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Direct download.
P8:50:23 <Infinity> i don't see why'd you have to restart a torrent
P8:50:28 <Infinity> are you downloading childporn
P8:50:28 <Quatroking> I hate downloading huge files through that
P8:50:31 <Daidoji> http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2001/09/25/more_than_a_soundblaster/crlivedrive2.jpg
P8:50:43 <Daidoji> I miss you awesome input box :(
P8:50:45 <Infinity> i accidentally downloaded some from 711chan yesterday and I panic'd
P8:50:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I prefer to directly download things than to torrent them, though.
P8:50:58 <Infinity> that looks nice
P8:51:00 <Infinity> well
P8:51:06 <Infinity> torrents are free and do large files
P8:51:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Since you don't rely on other people having it.
P8:51:15 <Daidoji> I imagine someone figured out how to make an adapter. but I can't be bothered.
P8:51:15 <Infinity> direct downloads for large downlaods usually cost money
P8:51:18 <Infinity> umm dude
P8:51:21 <Infinity> torrents are safre
P8:51:24 <Infinity> they don't get pulled down
P8:51:27 <Infinity> several hundred seeders
P8:51:31 <Infinity> they're more reliable for warez
P8:51:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Not all torrents have hundreds of seeders.
P8:51:41 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm getting a TV show.
P8:51:42 <Daidoji> I'm downloading a legit arma2 demo
P8:51:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I do torrents for games.
P8:51:48 <Daidoji> and this torrent is complete crap though
P8:51:49 <Infinity> lol demo
P8:51:50 <Quatroking> I frequently download turrents with barely 5 seeders
P8:51:52 <Infinity> i haven't played a demo for years
P8:51:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I do direct for movies and TV shows.
P8:52:02 <Quatroking> just watch them for a few minutes if they start downloading, and if they do, then I'm happy
P8:52:09 <Quatroking> when they don't I just get rid of them
P8:52:16 <Quatroking> and try another
P8:52:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I'll still prefer direct for TV and movies.
P8:54:25 <Quatroking> I usually end up with viruses when I try to direct download warez :/
P8:54:33 <Quatroking> pretty ironic actually
P8:55:18 <vdgmprgrmr> So did I.
P8:55:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Then I became not stupid.
P8:55:50 <Quatroking> let me guess
P8:55:58 <Quatroking> you started to actually scan the files you download
P8:56:14 <vdgmprgrmr> No scanning.
P8:56:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Just caution.
P8:56:48 <vdgmprgrmr> So far, 100% effective.
P8:57:32 <Quatroking> Oh yeah, after a long time spending on the itnernet, you get to know the way it works.
P8:57:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> faith
P8:57:49 <Quatroking> I can usually tell from most pages if they're legit or crap
P8:57:49 <Rroff> only time I've ever had any infection was a 0day exploit that hijacked one of the main ad systems
P8:57:57 <Rroff> got it off the guru3d.com site of all places
P8:58:19 <Rroff> coz whatever ad system they was compromised
P8:58:27 <Rroff> +use
P8:58:50 <Quatroking> I remember back in the days, where we had major virus outbreaks every month
P8:59:13 <Quatroking> those viruses that fucked up entire countries you know
P8:59:40 <vdgmprgrmr> I am too young to know the back-in-the-days times... :(
P8:59:54 <Rroff> I got lucky that time too
P9:00:09 <Quatroking> I'm 15, but I remember good how my dad pretty much got his PC fried by the Win32.Wormblaster
P9:00:15 <Rroff> it didn't unleash its main payload initially
P9:00:22 <Quatroking> Windows XP, savest system my ass!
P9:00:28 <Rroff> it tried to hide in startup entries already present
P9:00:38 <Quatroking> Anyone remember 4chan Fandango?
P9:00:46 <Rroff> so was fairly easy to get it out of the system at that point
P9:00:48 <Quatroking> It's about a year old now
P9:01:16 <Rroff> I haven't followed the exploits of 4chan too closely
P9:01:28 <Rroff> they get a bit too carried away with themselves sometimes
P9:01:38 <Rroff> and I have no respect for people who don't know when to stop
P9:01:56 <Quatroking> It infected all the newbies and retards on Newgrounds last year
P9:02:13 <Quatroking> I still have a copy of it preserved on a CD
P9:02:35 <Quatroking> SOMEWHERE
P9:03:21 <Quatroking> it screwed up my school pretty bad too
P9:03:28 <Quatroking> couldn't use the computers ofr two weeks :P
P9:03:31 <Rroff> heh
P9:03:31 <Quatroking> *for
P9:03:53 <Rroff> where I work they managed to infect a closed production network with conficker
P9:03:54 <Rroff> lol
P9:04:04 <vdgmprgrmr> I used to love how all the people I knew would tend to have a computer turned to crap within two weeks.
P9:04:07 <vdgmprgrmr> It was hilarious.
P9:04:14 <Quatroking> it disabled right-clicking, regedit, commandline, got rid of all system restore entries, task manager, etc.
P9:04:23 <Rroff> I didn't love it
P9:04:32 <Rroff> I was usually the person they'd come to get it fixed
P9:04:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Well so was I.
P9:04:44 <Quatroking> Yeah
P9:04:53 <Quatroking> Well my school had to reinstall the entire network
P9:04:58 <Quatroking> about 150 pc's
P9:05:09 <Rroff> I know how it got onto the system too - tho they are still puzzling over it
P9:05:10 <vdgmprgrmr> But I was just like, "No, you're just going to break it again, you don't deserve to have a working computer."
P9:05:11 <Quatroking> and then DO IT AGAIN because the server got infected too
P9:05:19 <Rroff> one of the techs plugged in his laptop to install new printer drivers
P9:05:24 <Rroff> I'm pretty sure his laptop was infected
P9:05:27 <Quatroking> lol
P9:05:52 <Rroff> course he denies it
P9:06:00 <Quatroking> vdgmprgrmr: I have that situation all the time with my little brother
P9:06:14 <vdgmprgrmr> I have it with my grandparents.
P9:06:18 <Quatroking> he doesn't even read error messages he just yells at me to help him
P9:06:23 <Rroff> :(
P9:06:38 <Rroff> 2 days later they've disabled all teh firewalls and shit you installed
P9:06:44 <Quatroking> I've learned to just completely ignore him tho
P9:06:45 <Rroff> and click yes on every popup
P9:06:47 <Rroff> and wonder why
P9:06:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, every time I go to their house, they're all like, "Wa wa our computer got something wrong with it you should fix it!"
P9:07:07 <Quatroking> if my little brother ever manages to disable the firewall I fucking break his neck
P9:07:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Then they get into an argument over who caused it.
P9:07:18 <Quatroking> I've got a hardware firewall
P9:07:24 <vdgmprgrmr> And it pisses me off every time.
P9:07:30 <Quatroking> do they pay you?
P9:07:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Because one insists on opening EVERY SINGLE EMAIL THEY EVER RECEIVE and the other goes to EVERY SINGLE RETARDED GAME SITE ON THE INTERNET.
P9:07:57 <Quatroking> my grandparents don't use their pc enough to fuck it up
P9:08:09 <vdgmprgrmr> No, they don't pay me, because I don't fix it anymore.
P9:08:17 <Quatroking> rofl
P9:08:56 <vdgmprgrmr> "I just play games!" So I look at their browser history and find things like "wehavfreegaamez.net"
P9:09:13 <Quatroking> lol
P9:10:18 <Rroff> the best (kind of) is when you find dodgy stuff on their PC
P9:10:27 <Quatroking> I post ads at the super market about my computer fixing abilities (I ask 10 bucks for problems excluding additional costs) and sometimes I find the strangest things on people's computers
P9:10:38 <Rroff> like when my uncle wanted me to recover data from a dead HDD
P9:10:48 <Rroff> and I opened a couple of pics to make sure the files were intact
P9:10:57 <Quatroking> I once found child porn at a guy's computer
P9:10:57 <Rroff> and that women he was with, was deffinatly not his wife...
P9:11:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
P9:11:06 <vdgmprgrmr>  XD
P9:11:15 <Daidoji> hey didn't someone figure a way to change the level height
P9:11:15 <Rroff> not found any of that thank goodness
P9:11:17 <Daidoji> or was I dreaming that
P9:11:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> level height?
P9:11:45 <Rroff> theres a couple of editors out there for the level file
P9:11:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> i thought that was possible at least a month ago
P9:11:50 <Quatroking> anyways I fixed his PC, got a 10 buck bonus, and pretty much straight after that I went to the police and reported him
P9:12:01 <Quatroking> I got 200 euro for finding the creep
P9:12:02 <Quatroking> :D
P9:12:05 <Daidoji> hmm
P9:12:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Awesome!
P9:12:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> you did?
P9:12:11 <Daidoji> so there's a level generator that has that
P9:12:15 <Quatroking> Certainly
P9:12:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> awesome
P9:12:29 <Daidoji> I know of the editor, I just didn't know if it...made random maps like the regular one
P9:12:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's like
P9:12:34 <Quatroking> and of course I've found the additional porn on people's computer too
P9:12:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> 20 copies of minecraft
P9:13:05 <Quatroking> once a guy just was like "oh, and if you find any porn, feel free to copy it over to your pendrive, it's pretty good stuff"
P9:13:20 <Rroff> heh
P9:13:24 <Quatroking> and it certainly was good stuff
P9:13:37 <Daidoji> been there
P9:13:55 <Daidoji> I still feel slightly dirty rummaging random family photos though
P9:13:59 <Punx> so why was bob banned?
P9:14:03 <Daidoji> and then stumbling on porn out of nowhere
P9:14:04 <Quatroking> bobross?
P9:14:07 <Punx> yeah
P9:14:11 <Quatroking> wiki or forum
P9:14:23 <Punx> hes banend on both?
P9:14:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> why are you asking
P9:14:32 <Quatroking> well I got him blockedo n the wiki
P9:14:32 <Daidoji> what did he do
P9:14:34 <Quatroking> yes
P9:14:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> you could be bob ross hm
13P9:14:47 * AnnihilatorBeta raises suspicion

P9:15:25 <Punx> but yeah he was messing up ur shit on the wiki right?
P9:15:30 <Quatroking> is there an inschato guy around here on the channel?
P9:15:31 <Punx> but what'd he do on the forums?
P9:15:55 <Daidoji> I'll admit I wanted to put random citation needed all over the wiki
P9:15:59 <Daidoji> but that's a harmless prank
P9:16:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> those are hilarious oin wiki
P9:16:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> There are five fingers on the human hand[citation needed]
P9:17:03 <Quatroking> hmm
P9:17:07 <Quatroking> this is strange
P9:17:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> Wikipedia relies on your donations[citation needed]
P9:17:15 <Quatroking> I can't find bob anywhere on the wiki
P9:17:40 <Daidoji> ~this article is written in an in-universe style and should be revised

P9:19:22 <Quatroking> Yeah
P9:19:43 <Quatroking> I'm pretty curious what Inschato is up to tho
P9:19:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> what did he do?
P9:20:08 <Quatroking> according to him I'm vandalizing
P9:20:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh?
P9:20:17 <Quatroking> "User talk pages exist for a reason, putting personal messages on articles is just as bad as what you were reverting"
P9:20:38 <Quatroking> funny how I didn't add anything personal at all to any article
P9:20:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> is that for c418 or something
P9:20:48 <Quatroking> I dunno
P9:20:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> or whatever his name
P9:21:20 <Quatroking> or maybe he means the warning I put in an article in the commentary lines, that was pointed towards this alexvminer guy
P9:21:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> wait what
P9:21:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> is there something up with alexvminer?
