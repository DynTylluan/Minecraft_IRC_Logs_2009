A3:54:46 <Maxloader> i had that once
A3:54:49 <Maxloader> just reboot
A3:55:10 <Maxloader> or maybe unlock your taskbar, minimize it and pull it up again and re-lock it

A4:24:39 <08Notch> sure!
A4:25:06 <Quatroking> He sells the babies to china and uses the profit to buy more blocky stuff to improve Minecraft
A4:25:11 <Quatroking> fact.
A4:25:20 <aera> so THAT's where the blocks come from
A4:25:24 <aera> I hope they're recyclable
A4:25:47 <DustPox> Haha
A4:25:48 <Maxloader> but, the forums are down? surely some people are willing to donate some money for it to citricsquid
A4:25:51 <Quatroking> Every time you destroy a tile... Notch sells a baby.
A4:25:52 <DustPox> Who said WG from 4chan was awesome?
A4:25:59 <Quatroking> I did
A4:26:08 <DustPox> Take a look @ http://4scrape.net

A4:28:58 <Maxloader> why not?
A4:29:02 <Maxloader> hahaha
A4:29:06 <Quatroking> its true
A4:29:07 <DustPox> Hey Notch, I saw your youtube video. Awesome work!
A4:29:11 <Quatroking> I have evidence
A4:29:12 <DustPox> The idea is brilliant
A4:29:13 <08Notch> yay =D
A4:29:13 <Maxloader> how much is it to keep up the forum?
A4:29:26 <DustPox> and you know you can turn minecraft into a great first person shooter with what you have there?
A4:29:31 <DustPox> You see, when you destroy a cube
A4:29:32 <Plinky> Haha
A4:29:37 <Quatroking> three mexicans and a british guy.
A4:29:38 <DustPox> it drops like a mini cube
A4:29:42 <DustPox> sorta like, ammo right?
A4:29:43 <Quatroking> Thats what it takes to run the forums.
A4:29:44 <DustPox> to build
A4:29:53 <DustPox> what if you give the avatar an array of weapons
A4:29:58 <Maxloader> rofl
A4:29:59 <Quatroking> LASERS
A4:30:00 <DustPox> and you have to destroy certain blocks
A4:30:01 <Quatroking> I WANT LASERS
A4:30:06 <Maxloader> hahaha
A4:30:06 <DustPox> and the mini cubes that drop are ammo
A4:30:07 <Quatroking> wait a second
A4:30:15 <Quatroking> holy shit i just got an amazing idea
A4:30:21 <Quatroking> CUSTOMIZABLE WEAPONS
A4:30:33 <DustPox> Ratchet and Clank did it T3T
A4:30:39 <Maxloader> i dont think minecraft is intended as a combat game...
A4:30:45 <DustPox> It would work
A4:30:49 <Quatroking> a base model made out of 5 mini tiles, and you can add 20 more mini tiles to them and create your own weapons!!
A4:31:38 <Quatroking> like, for example, you take a 5-tile bow model, and add 20 extra tiles to create a custom bow which looks incredible and will make your friends SHIT their pants and slit their throws, SO amazing!!
A4:31:39 <DustPox> And notch.. you see how the cursor is a little + sign. When you hover over a cube you select one cube right? Can you make a greater selection grid? Say 3x3? 9Â²cube field.. so we can raise and lower multiple cubes at the same time?
A4:31:50 <08Notch> no, dustpox. =)
A4:32:01 <DustPox> No? Why not?
A4:32:27 <08Notch> because I don't want it, is the short version
A4:32:31 <DustPox> It would make building stuff a bit faster.. and making a flat land easier.. and digging tunnels and caves and creatings pools n such
A4:32:43 <08Notch> minecraft isn't a level editor.
A4:32:51 <DustPox> It is now.
A4:32:59 <08Notch> you might use it as one
A4:32:59 <DustPox> Until more modes are available
A4:33:35 <Quatroking> minecraft is Notch' tool to world domination
A4:33:42 <Maxloader> haha
A4:33:44 <DustPox> I'm talking about "leels" within minecraft itself yknow.
A4:33:49 <Quatroking> it sends sublimial messages, and once Notch has enugh people playing, BOOM
A4:33:51 <DustPox> levels*
A4:34:07 <Quatroking> he hypnotizes everyone and causes chaos all around the world!!
A4:34:25 <Quatroking> and he'll ban all shapes that aren't blocky enough
A4:34:38 <Quatroking> dna research to make our bodies blockier
A4:34:53 <Quatroking> and then, when everything on earth is blocky
A4:35:06 <Quatroking> he will make the earth itself a huge cube
A4:35:11 <Quatroking> with the moon and the sun following
A4:35:21 <Quatroking> :O
A4:35:35 <DustPox> I doubt his programming skills are up to standard to do that.
A4:36:01 <08Notch> that'd require at least like seven for loops
A4:36:41 <DustPox> So, why would a larger cube selection grid be out of the question? Because you want people to dedicated their time deleting and creating single cubes?
A4:36:41 <08Notch> damnit, internets..
A4:36:46 <Quatroking> Notch, did you know that Citricsquid just sold the servers and use the money for something else?
A4:37:04 <Quatroking> He did.
A4:37:08 <DustPox> Dude, you made nearly 13k in a short time. Surely you know how sufficient funds to get yourself some decent internets.
A4:37:28 <Quatroking> In soviet sweden, internet subscribes to YOU
A4:37:35 <08Notch> DustPox: Because minecraft isn't a level editor. I by that argument, i should add noclip and flying as well, and I won't add either of those
A4:37:58 <Quatroking> Notch, you forget a thing there.
A4:37:59 <08Notch> "I by that argument". =D
A4:38:24 <Quatroking> Take a look at "roblox" and Gmod, they both have flying/noclip
A4:38:31 <Quatroking> I don't see how they're level editors
A4:38:31 <DustPox> No need, other people have created a client that has those options so it's hardly relevent to create them yourself now.
A4:38:41 <DustPox> Me neither
A4:38:43 <Maxloader> i played sooo much gmod
A4:38:50 <08Notch> neat. =)
A4:38:52 <DustPox> If minecraft isn't a level editor.. then what the fuck is it?
A4:38:55 <Quatroking> i played so much gmod my gmod folder is over 10 GB
A4:38:57 <08Notch> language.
A4:38:57 <Quatroking> take that
A4:39:19 <Quatroking> Notch: http://www.quatroworld.org/2009/08/05/the-adventures-of-random-comics/
A4:39:21 <DustPox> f*
A4:39:28 <Quatroking> Citricsquid gone mad
A4:39:36 <Maxloader> only 10 gb :P?
A4:40:00 <Quatroking> on my previous pc I had over 20
A4:40:03 <08Notch> right now, it's an alpha version of a game. The only game mode right now is creative mode, which lets you build as much as you want without worrying about dying or resources.
A4:40:08 <Quatroking> couldn't back up because of the size D:
A4:40:15 <DustPox> "the size of your epenis matters not"
A4:40:28 <DustPox> Uh huh..
A4:40:43 <DustPox> So whilst we are in "creative" mode, what's wrong with a bigger selection grid?
A4:41:00 <Quatroking> that reminds me, I need to get my mom to order me my new external drive ASAP
A4:41:04 <08Notch> I've already answered that.
A4:41:07 <aera> if people really want a big sandbox blocky building game, I'm tempted to develop one
A4:41:13 <Quatroking> I only have 120GB of space left
A4:41:23 <aera> but it's a different development path to Notch's - he's aiming for a game
A4:41:25 <DustPox> Yeah, you did answer it alright. Because it's not a level editor
A4:41:29 <DustPox> but creative mode is right?
A4:41:51 <DustPox> Oh well..
A4:41:51 <08Notch> no, creative mode lets you build level within the framework of a game
A4:41:58 <DustPox> oki doki
A4:42:07 <DustPox> Another suggestion then
A4:42:09 <aera> DustPox: if you really wanted it, I imagine a server mod would be possible
A4:42:15 <DustPox> A diagonal cube
A4:42:17 <aera> well, if lua allows it
A4:42:28 <aera> such that when you place a block those around it change
A4:42:32 <DustPox> Like.. the cube, cut off at 45 degrees angle you know
A4:42:43 <Quatroking> Notch, in the vid, you mined some ore, right
A4:42:57 <08Notch> that might happen, DustPox. =) I want sloped blocks
A4:43:03 <08Notch> yes, Quatroking
A4:43:05 <Quatroking> can we do anything else besides building ore tiles with the ore
A4:43:12 <08Notch> not yet
A4:43:20 <Quatroking> hmm
A4:43:22 <08Notch> they will be used for crafting weapons
A4:43:30 <Quatroking> so...
A4:43:35 <Quatroking> will there be some kind of bank?
A4:43:40 <Quatroking> to store resources
A4:43:43 <08Notch> i'm not sure.
A4:43:50 <08Notch> probably not
A4:43:58 <08Notch> chests, probably. Whatever's fun and fits.
A4:44:01 <DustPox> lol
A4:44:13 <Quatroking> because I don't want to die with 4673271 pieces of gold and then loose it all
A4:44:22 <08Notch> hehe
A4:44:28 <Quatroking> because i get torn apart by a freaking bear or something
A4:44:33 <DustPox> how on earth are we going to build weapons? I mean, sqaure weapons.. wut?
A4:44:35 <Quatroking> with laser eyes
A4:44:58 <Quatroking> DustPox: we hire mexicans to do that
A4:45:16 <Quatroking> Hey yeah, will survival mode feature companions?
A4:45:44 <Quatroking> like, i can enslave a mexican so I can use him as bait for a dragon or something?
A4:46:06 <Quatroking> slavery! yay!
A4:46:13 <Maxloader> notch, when do you think the next update is due?
A4:46:13 <aera> no, you enslave the dragon, of course
A4:46:21 <Quatroking> ah, to eat the mexicans
A4:46:23 <Quatroking> :D
A4:46:23 <08Notch> i don't know yet, Maxloader
A4:46:31 <aera> and then give it laser eyes
A4:46:50 <Quatroking> then I order it to poop out the mexicans
A4:46:56 <peerkoel> good morning everyone
A4:46:59 <Quatroking> and then I order it to burn them with the laser eyes!
A4:47:05 <DustPox> so uhm, Notch.. when will we be able to see logs that will show us what client version people log into so we can write an auto ban bot that will ban anyone that logs in with a modified client.
A4:47:28 <08Notch> what would stop the modified client from sending the right version number?
A4:47:32 <DustPox> We try to prevent grievers but noclippers still get out of prisions yknow
A4:47:43 <DustPox> Knowledge.
A4:47:49 <Quatroking> Notch: would it be possible to check filesize?
A4:47:50 <08Notch> err
A4:47:53 <Quatroking> encrypted key?
A4:47:59 <Quatroking> oh wait thats DRM
A4:48:02 <peerkoel> security by obscurity Notch! it's high tech!
A4:48:03 <Quatroking> Hmm
A4:48:05 <08Notch> no, there's no way to do that.
A4:48:22 <DustPox> there has to be a difference when someone logs in using a real client or a modified one.. the packets it sends that enables it to no clip has to differ from the packets a "real" client would send
A4:48:23 <08Notch> seriously, it's impossible to make sure people don't use modified clients
A4:48:32 <aera> the only way to stop griefing is to do server-side physics checks
A4:48:44 <08Notch> yes, I will make servers verify movements
A4:48:44 <aera> you can perfectly spoof any protocol
A4:48:59 <aera> that's @DustPox, I know you know that Notch :)
A4:49:01 <Maxloader> a simple md5 hash on the jar file?
A4:49:07 <Quatroking> hey yeah
A4:49:09 <Quatroking> md5
A4:49:10 <DustPox> I know that too.
A4:49:11 <aera> Maxloader: and how would the server get that?
A4:49:14 <08Notch> the problem there is that since the clients predict what they can do, they will sometimes predict wrongly
A4:49:19 <Quatroking> let the server check the md5 of the client connecting
A4:49:29 <aera> how? by making the client send its own md5?
A4:49:35 <08Notch> like if you walk in front of someone placing a block, your client would let you pass, but the server would detect a "cheat"
A4:49:39 <aera> can't a modified client send the right one?
A4:49:48 <DustPox> No
A4:49:51 <aera> Notch: indeed, but you can build up a probability they're cheting
A4:49:58 <08Notch> I can solve that by either making the server allow "some" cheating, or by teleporting the client back to where they were
A4:50:03 <08Notch> a combination of the two is probably best
A4:50:03 <Quatroking> have the server retrieve the master MD5 from the master server, and compare it to the clients.
A4:50:14 <aera> but the server can't read the client's MD5!
A4:50:14 <DustPox> Exactly.
A4:50:16 <08Notch> where would it get the md5 of the client from?
A4:50:17 <Quatroking> that way, the server software wdoesn't need updates all the time
A4:50:19 <aera> sigh
A4:50:26 <DustPox> It can't if it's not programmed to do so
A4:50:26 <peerkoel> I sent you suggestions about that N. :)
A4:50:26 <Quatroking> from a master server.
A4:50:28 <aera> please, people, take a compsec course :)
A4:50:48 <Maxloader> i read that future minecraft will be stand alone clients... so i think md5 should be possible
A4:50:49 <Quatroking> I'm learning ICT Management
A4:50:51 <08Notch> yeah, it's absolutely 100% impossible to make sure people aren't using modified clients
A4:50:52 <Quatroking> I is geek
A4:50:58 <DustPox> lol Aera, like your "the shit". It's called a discussion.. we discuss opinions and matter.. not to proove who's right.
A4:50:58 <aera> I can promise you, I can make a client that spoofs any protocol you invent for minecraft
A4:51:11 <08Notch> aera is very very right.
A4:51:14 <aera> DustPox: yeah, except this is mathematically provable
A4:51:19 <Quatroking> aera make me a client that enables me to destroy maps in one click
A4:51:21 <Quatroking> kthx
A4:51:31 <aera> Quatroking: sure
A4:51:38 <Quatroking> nukecraft
A4:51:42 <aera> it'll take a while to send all the block updates, though
A4:51:46 <DustPox> lol.
A4:51:48 <08Notch> that'd probably take a while. ;)
A4:51:48 <aera> there's around 4mil on a normal map

A4:52:06 <aera> ^^ this
A4:52:08 <DustPox> Yeah, griefing.. so much fun .-
A4:52:21 <Maxloader> i got 96 backups for eacht 15 mins of my server.... come and destroy it...i will put it back in no time
A4:52:23 <08Notch> so real security lies in making the protocol more verifiable by the server
A4:52:28 <DustPox> But uhm
A4:52:51 <aera> Maxloader: yeah, except you won't notice as it'll delete things underground first
A4:53:00 <08Notch> actually, any real discussion of security starts with "let's assume the client is hacked", not "how can me make the client harder to hack"
A4:53:04 <aera> Notch: what's the limit on block updates per second?
A4:53:04 <DustPox> How do you explain that N-Gaurd for quite a few MMORPG's has the ability to detect an authenticated client and restart any systems logging into the game using a modified client?
A4:53:09 <aera> or is it sekret?
A4:53:23 <aera> DustPox: because they have a second program on the computer
A4:53:23 <Quatroking> how is md5 spoofable
A4:53:27 <08Notch> aera: I don't remember.. It's a bit pointless to keep it secret, since it's in the server code. ;)
A4:53:31 <aera> heh, indeed
A4:53:34 <Maxloader> aera, true true
A4:53:38 <aera> well let's say 3 blocks a second
A4:53:59 <DustPox> Well exactly, the Hex from the client differents from the original client right?
A4:54:10 <aera> it would take 16 days to delete a whole map
A4:54:10 <08Notch> what sends the md5?
A4:54:34 <Maxloader> quatroking, what if a modified client just looks at the hash from the original file and sends that?
A4:54:36 <DustPox> Is there no way the server can compare the source of a client to the source that's on a secure server.. the source of the released client?
A4:54:42 <aera> DustPox: not
A4:54:44 <aera> *no
A4:54:51 <aera> the attacker controls the client and its computer
A4:54:58 <DustPox> Well of course
A4:55:03 <DustPox> but if all was authentic right
A4:55:08 <aera> the _only_ way around such an issue is public/private key crypto
A4:55:14 <Quatroking> maxloader: have the server check the md5, and not the client send the md5?
A4:55:22 <aera> and that won't help, as the private key would be in the jar
A4:55:39 <DustPox> the server should be able to send a package that would ask the client what it's source is.. then send a package back to the server containing that information
A4:55:40 <08Notch> Quatroking: How would it check the md5?
A4:55:47 <Quatroking> fuck, I dunno
A4:55:50 <08Notch> lol
A4:55:55 <Quatroking> I'm not learning java for at least two years
A4:55:55 <peerkoel> even key crypto is not 100% safe, but very very very hard to crack
A4:55:57 <DustPox> the source from a auth client must be different from that of a mod one
A4:55:58 <08Notch> seriously guys, what you're suggesting is impossible.
A4:56:09 <aera> I can direct you to professors who will prove it for you
A4:56:12 <DustPox> Nothing is impossible :P
A4:56:16 <08Notch> yes, it is
A4:56:18 <DustPox> Sure Aera, direct me.
A4:56:18 <aera> well, if they proved things for people in the internet
A4:56:19 <Quatroking> notch will we ever have plutonium in minecraft
A4:56:24 <DustPox> oh
A4:56:27 <DustPox> awesome idea
A4:56:36 <aera> DustPox: actually, in computer security, there's no such things as perfect security
A4:56:38 <08Notch> hehe, probably no. :D
A4:56:39 <Maxloader> quatroking, how can the server check it... it has to request the md5 from the client, and then the client can still choose what to send back
A4:56:40 <aera> that's one of the rules
A4:56:45 <DustPox> True
A4:56:54 <08Notch> aera: Well.. one time pads are 100% secure if the pad is keps secure
A4:56:56 <Quatroking> maxloader: but I am always right
A4:56:58 <08Notch> *kept

A4:57:14 <Snowman> Hello
A4:57:15 <Quatroking> snowman you want plutonium too right
A4:57:16 <08Notch> but that's just sidestepping the issue as then you have to keep the PAD secure
A4:57:27 <aera> Notch: yes, they are, but then you are back to the same delivery problem :)
A4:57:29 <Snowman> Plutonium? Depends
A4:57:29 <Quatroking> we all want plutonium to irradiate our bodies
A4:57:44 <Quatroking> and to power our castles
A4:57:51 <08Notch> bah, we can black box that. ;D "Let's assume we have a secure pad"
A4:58:08 <DustPox> theres no light without darkness, no safe wihtout unsafe
A4:58:12 <Snowman> What isotope of plutonium?
A4:58:28 <08Notch> (I was joking)
A4:58:41 <Quatroking> snowman: the glowing, green one
A4:58:46 <Quatroking> like in the movies
A4:58:47 <Snowman> 238?
A4:58:56 <Quatroking> eh
A4:58:57 <Quatroking> 256
A4:58:58 <Snowman> No wait
A4:59:01 <Snowman> that's orange
A4:59:03 <Quatroking> because I like that number
A4:59:13 <Snowman> Uranium-235 is green
A4:59:20 <Snowman> PLUTONIUM 256?!??!?!?
A4:59:26 <Snowman> ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND
A4:59:33 <Quatroking> yes
A4:59:40 <Quatroking> Yes, I am
A4:59:45 <Snowman> ffs that's a massive amount of energy in there
A4:59:47 <aera> heh, I have a magical perfect security oracle box
A4:59:59 <Quatroking> perfect to power my fortress
A5:00:05 <aera> actually, Notch, try some quantum crypto on Minecraft. I'm sure everyone can support that.
A5:00:28 <08Notch> that won't fix the client insecurity, though. =)
A5:00:29 <Quatroking> quantum physics in Minecraft?
A5:00:30 <Quatroking> golly
A5:00:35 <Plinky> I'm beginning to hate falling off stuff
A5:00:37 <aera> heh, true
A5:00:40 <aera> ahh, authentication
A5:00:42 <Plinky> Can we have jetpacks?

A5:01:10 <ChJees> hai #minecraft
A5:01:18 <Plinky> Xd
A5:01:20 <aera> if Notch managed that on a minecraft scale I think he'd be in for a Nobel prize
A5:01:25 <08Notch> haha
A5:01:51 <08Notch> when you start it up you get to choose between many worlds, copenhagen, or hidden variable
A5:01:57 <08Notch> if you choose hidden variable, you immediately lose
A5:02:18 <ChJees> wat o_O
A5:02:44 <aera> heh
A5:02:45 <08Notch> it's different interpretations of quantum dynamics

A5:03:03 <08Notch> haha yeah
A5:03:04 <ChJees> Notch do you help paying for the Forum and Wiki :P?
A5:03:18 <Quatroking> Notch, when survival comes, will we have day/night?

A5:04:35 <DustPox> with 13k made so far there shouldn't be any ads :P
A5:04:36 <Quatroking> and when I was born the hospital exploded because of me

A5:07:09 <Quatroking> body hair?
A5:07:09 <DustPox> Yup
A5:07:16 <Quatroking> he has a beard of 5 meters long

A5:08:33 <Maxloader> he is evil
A5:08:40 <utilitas> who?me?
A5:08:44 <DustPox> Enabling the avatar to walk around with the actual head of the user. Give the user the ability to upload a pic of his or her face, then sorta like have a crop tool where the user selects the outline of the face
A5:08:45 <Maxloader> no quatroking
A5:08:45 <utilitas> if yes then YAY!
A5:08:50 <DustPox> and then implement the pic into the avatar
A5:08:57 <DustPox> so that the avatar has the users head

A8:47:04 <08Notch> i bought it for the company, though, so I get it cheaper. ;D

A8:49:47 <gear> so its random?
A8:49:48 <08Notch> it's a simple fix, and it's how it SHOULD work, but I did it wrong the first time
A8:49:52 <08Notch> it can be!
A8:49:58 <citricsquid> this mario ai thing is awesome.
A8:50:02 <08Notch> I like to have relatively predictable gameplay, though
A8:50:05 <Snowman> so wtf, if you mine stone you get leaves?
A8:50:09 <08Notch> no, haha
A8:50:20 <gear> i think he means like mining gold makes gold+rocks
A8:50:20 <08Notch> i mean when you mine leaves, the Leaf class decides what it produces
A8:50:28 <08Notch> this way, making Grass produce Dirt was really easy
A8:50:35 <Snowman> oh ok
A8:50:38 <08Notch> the original solution had a bunch of special cases for that
A8:50:41 <08Notch> and that sucked, design-wise.

A10:16:23 <Quatroking> epic lulz
A10:16:39 <Isak> I don't like MMOs with Secret Agendas
A10:16:41 <Isak> Like...
A10:16:48 <gear> all of them
A10:16:50 <Isak> "YOU WIN IF YOU SPEND $50 IN OUR STORE"
A10:16:51 <gear> making money

A10:17:54 <Droqen> Iguana: what
A10:17:54 <Isak> Good Browser Game: Runescape
A10:17:55 <Iguana> Not as fun as a few months ago...
A10:17:56 <Isak> It's the only one

A10:18:07 <Iguana> RUNESCAP
A10:18:09 <Iguana> NO
A10:18:15 <Isak> Runescape is such a great game.
A10:18:20 <Isak> It's extremely complicated for Java
A10:18:21 <gear> if you're braindead
A10:18:23 <Isak> And browser.
A10:18:24 <Droqen> I mean like... php and html and kind of java and shit
A10:18:36 <Isak> There aren't any more beggars
A10:18:36 <Droqen> but not a whole window applet thing.
A10:18:41 <Iguana> Runescape can be re-arranged into Run & Escape
A10:18:41 <Isak> It's a lot more clean.
A10:18:44 <Iguana> FROM THE GAME

P12:02:21 <Snowman> hack attack
P12:02:22 <|404notfound> I'm curious as to why it took about a year or so for the population at large to embrace Twitter

P12:02:47 <Darkebrz> But that is in the really distant future
P12:02:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> True, but all I want now is to catch griefers

P12:24:10 <|404notfound> I'm pretty sure the last version of the special client had saving/loading as well
P12:24:10 <Zaldos> atleast it shows its a good modable game.
P12:24:13 <|404notfound> or it was mentioned in the readme, at least
P12:24:15 <|404notfound> never tried it
P12:24:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't think so |404notfound

P12:35:15 <asiekierka> The maps can't get too big
P12:35:15 <Darkebrz> They are discussing griefing in there :P
P12:35:19 <Darkebrz> Oh
P12:35:19 <Marach> hah i found the client! kiss my firewire port
P12:35:19 <Darkebrz> No
P12:35:23 <Darkebrz> I didnt realize that
P12:35:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah... not sure it was the best idea to post that
P12:35:42 <Darkebrz> Erm
P12:35:44 <Darkebrz> No
P12:35:46 <Darkebrz> There are no hacks
P12:35:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes there are

P12:36:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh shi- WRONG CHANNEL
P12:36:54 <08Notch> haha
P12:37:14 <TrueWolves> damn greifers
P12:37:35 <08Notch> discuss it if you must, but I'd kinda like to not have it discussed in here
P12:37:44 <ChJees> ;o
P12:37:46 <08Notch> obviously, asking you not to talk about it just made it more fun to talk about it. ;)
P12:37:53 <08Notch> which kinda makes sense.
P12:38:04 <Darkebrz> Im going to try out some different hacks
P12:38:07 <Darkebrz> Like flying.exe
P12:38:10 <Darkebrz> Which is very suspicious
P12:38:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, why don't you publicize the fact that shift-f cycles fog backwards
P12:38:17 <Darkebrz> IT DOES?
P12:38:19 <Darkebrz> Wow
P12:38:21 <08Notch> it's a protip =D
P12:38:24 <Marach> IT DOES?
P12:38:27 <ChJees> i was going to make a naughty comment but i won't
P12:38:29 <08Notch> so people can go "Did you know.." at parties
P12:38:40 <TheCell> lol
P12:38:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha

13P12:38:47 * AlLnAtuRalX goes to a random party
P12:38:50 <Marach> did you know that "w" key moves you FORWARD?
P12:38:51 <08Notch> yes?
P12:38:53 <Quatroking> movement will be processed by the server, right
P12:38:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Did you know, that in Minecraft, a block-based building game
P12:38:58 <08Notch> yes quatro
P12:39:00 <citricsquid> minecraft parties?!
P12:39:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> shift-f makes for move backwards
P12:39:02 <citricsquid> I'M THERE!
P12:39:03 <TrueWolves> Notch, can you visit Yggdrasil?
13P12:39:08 * AlLnAtuRalX laughs alone whil there is awkward silence
13P12:39:11 * AlLnAtuRalX gets kicked out
13P12:39:15 * AlLnAtuRalX cries himself to sleep
P12:39:15 <08Notch> haha
P12:39:15 <Quatroking> does this mean noclip and running will get prevented
13P12:39:18 * AlLnAtuRalX is alone, as usual
P12:39:19 <Quatroking> at least for now
P12:39:29 <08Notch> yes, Quatroking. But the server admin can disable it if he/she wants
P12:39:33 <TheCell> there is a secret cow lvl in minecraft!!!!!
P12:39:36 <Quatroking> Oh.
P12:39:39 <08Notch> so if you REALLY like hacks, you can run a hack-allowing server
P12:39:39 <ChJees> Simulate moving Client side i think
P12:39:46 <ChJees> And send to Server
P12:40:00 <Darkebrz> 7zip is not working
P12:40:06 <Darkebrz> it is associated with rars
P12:40:06 <citricsquid> I found the beta site for survival! http://survival.minecraft.net?!?!?!
P12:40:10 <ChJees> 7zip hates you
P12:40:10 <Quatroking> my little faggot brother will be pleased
P12:40:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, without redoing your whole position-updating technique, there's not a good way to prevent speedhacks, is there?
P12:40:19 <Marach> is it hard to check if client app runs from minecraft.net?
P12:40:21 <08Notch> no, not really
P12:40:22 <Darkebrz> But it wont open them
P12:40:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Oh, that works
P12:40:31 <08Notch> Marach: Impossible, pretty much
P12:40:32 <Darkebrz> WOAH
P12:40:41 <Marach> its possible in flash...
P12:40:44 <citricsquid> Marach: they can decompile and remove the verification string though?
P12:40:51 <ChJees> wat
P12:40:51 <Darkebrz> citricsquid, that fails
P12:40:51 <08Notch> no, Marach, it isn't.
P12:40:54 <Marach> but thats more work
P12:40:55 <Quatroking> its a shame a simple thing as a domaincheck won't work in java but does work in flash
P12:40:58 <Darkebrz> http://finishedgame.minecraft.net/
P12:40:59 <08Notch> i can check it, but it will always be possible to hack it
P12:41:01 <Quatroking> considering java is more advanced
P12:41:11 <Darkebrz> http://dungeons.minecraft.net/
P12:41:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Java is a programming language, flash is a joke?
P12:41:18 <ChJees> lies
P12:41:21 <TrueWolves> ha
P12:41:23 <Quatroking> http://jews.minecraft.net/
P12:41:23 <08Notch> i can do the same check as the flash thing does
P12:41:27 <08Notch> but both are hackable
P12:41:29 <Azjherben> Hello notch
P12:41:31 <Azjherben> And all
P12:41:39 <Quatroking> Well
P12:41:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://swastikas.minecraft.net/ ... How interesting that it redirects to the front-page
P12:41:46 <Marach> make a java compiler
P12:41:47 <ChJees> XD
P12:41:49 <TrueWolves> So I can stop those fly hackers now? awesome
P12:41:58 <Quatroking> Well, Notch, it would piss a lot of hackers off
P12:42:00 <Quatroking> GO FOR IT
P12:42:11 <ChJees> A way to make players unable to add or subtract blocks would be a nice start
P12:42:15 <ChJees> :3
P12:42:18 <Azjherben> Notch
P12:42:21 <08Notch> ok, tell you what.. when I finish the private survival mode test, I'll implement more server security.
P12:42:26 <08Notch> it's obviously needed soon
P12:42:28 <Azjherben> That stuff in the video
P12:42:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> You need to do spectate first!
P12:42:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> :p
P12:42:35 <08Notch> then I'll get back to survival mode
P12:42:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha
P12:42:39 <Azjherben> What was the third block in your inventory
P12:42:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> too bad I'm leaving, I would've liked to be in the survival test
P12:42:52 <ChJees> A box full of rape
P12:42:53 <Marach> i get an error after 20 minutes of pllaying and forums are down! im dooomed
P12:42:55 <citricsquid> Notch:: nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo :'(
P12:43:02 <08Notch> citricsquid, what?
P12:43:09 <Snowman> Oh yay, dual monitor minecraft
P12:43:17 <citricsquid> survival delay!
P12:43:30 <08Notch> after the test is up, and i need some time to gather feedback anyway
P12:43:36 <TheCell> need survival mode test acc
P12:43:37 <Marach> challenge - minecraft in J2ME...
P12:43:39 <Snowman> fuck, my right monitor is way too birhgt
P12:43:40 <08Notch> private test = the test version for paying customers
P12:43:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> OH!
P12:43:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> awesome
P12:43:48 <citricsquid> Notch: yay, more purchases!

P12:44:01 <Azjherben> Notch what was the last block in your inventory in that video?
P12:44:03 <Marach> wooo happy ^_^
P12:44:04 <08Notch> (like in a year. ;D)
P12:44:09 <Quatroking> Hmm
P12:44:13 <08Notch> Azjherben: Probably coal or iron
P12:44:14 <citricsquid> Notch: after that, world domination?
P12:44:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, iPhone :D
P12:44:18 <Quatroking> I should start looking for a better Motherboard
P12:44:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Bigger markets FTW
P12:44:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not Java though
P12:44:31 <Quatroking> and then buy another GTX280
P12:44:33 <08Notch> no, when I'm done with Minecraft, I'll either do my Secret Project or a space simulator
P12:44:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> I guess that's an advantage for Android
P12:44:38 <ChJees> Grab the child demography!
P12:44:45 <Quatroking> and then buy another 22" Widescreen monitor
P12:44:50 <Marach> in iphone it would change block type when tilting xD

P12:45:02 <Quatroking> Notch hires mexicans to do the coding
P12:45:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> ChJees, first of all, what child can afford an iPhone?
P12:45:14 <Quatroking> I CAN
P12:45:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> And Minecraft already has the child demographic
P12:45:16 <Quatroking> HAAAA

P12:45:29 <Quatroking> I'm a minor so technically I'm still a child
P12:45:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking, You do know it costs ~$90 a month here, with no SMS and 500 mins?
P12:45:30 <08Notch> (three weeks, on a boat, in indonesia. :D)
P12:45:40 <ChJees> AlLnaturalx, reading comprehension plox :3

P12:46:12 <08Notch> actually, why not.. consider that a promise
P12:46:13 <Quatroking> at least we piss off microsoft
P12:46:20 <08Notch> survival test before I leave for indonesia.
P12:46:26 <Quatroking> and forced microsoft to include firefox and chrome in Win7
P12:46:27 <ChJees> I hate both Microsoft and Apple
P12:46:29 <TheCell> i will get my own boat and crashing into yours if u dont released the survival test :D
P12:46:29 <Quatroking> zing
P12:46:34 <citricsquid> I'd like a 200% refund if you don't make the deadline! :D
P12:46:38 <Quatroking> I'm currently interested in Google

P12:46:50 <Quatroking> I'm wondering how Chrome OS will do
P12:46:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Okay guys, I have to put some pants on and start packing

P12:47:04 <08Notch> I'm pretty liberal with refunds, but I don't think you'll get more than 100%. ;)

P12:49:56 <TheCell> and i want to buy your body xD

P12:54:25 <Jesus> I pretty much killed the forums using my carpenter powers.
P12:54:31 <Evil-Ville> The forums should stay down forever they are terrible
P12:54:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, I don't like them
P12:54:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> but at least they get the prepubescent masses off my IRC

P1:41:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> right
P1:41:41 <ZomBuster> is that fixable or do I need to roll back to 14?
P1:41:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> The phone is just so awesoem I can't stop though.... it's like a drug
P1:41:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> It makes me sad
P1:41:56 <asiekierka> Yay, fixed memory leaks
P1:42:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> The only thing I've used that comes close is the Pre... I love the Pre
P1:42:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think I'll get the Pre after my contract is done
P1:42:12 <PuyoDead> I mean, censoring a dictionary? blocking a twitter client because of content on twitter itself?
P1:42:14 <PuyoDead> that's just silly
P1:42:17 <Darkebrz> I messed with the Pre at the store
P1:42:22 <Darkebrz> It looked pretty awesome
P1:42:31 <Darkebrz> And I put my dads mug as the background :D
P1:42:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> Darkebrz, I know the guy who runs the local radioshack
P1:42:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> he just gave me a pre for an hour
P1:42:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> without any cables attaching it or anything
P1:42:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I got to mess with it
P1:42:54 <Darkebrz> Heh
P1:42:55 <Darkebrz> Awesome
13P1:42:57 * AlLnAtuRalX loves it.
P1:43:06 <PuyoDead> too bad it's on sprint
P1:43:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> If only it had more apps
P1:43:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sprint > AT&T for data
P1:43:25 <PuyoDead> for data, sure. that's about all
P1:43:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Verizon has the best network, but the shittiest phones & cus service
P1:43:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, I had sprint for a bit,the service was fine
P1:43:40 <PuyoDead> verizon can die for all I care
P1:43:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> maybe that's because I live in such a populated area?
P1:43:47 <PuyoDead> they are on the bottom of my list
P1:43:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> T-Mobile is the bottom of mine
P1:44:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's so cheap though!
P1:44:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it has good roaming in yoorup
P1:44:19 <PuyoDead> limited unlimited service? pay for gps? pshaw
P1:44:21 <Chrstfer> other than skins wut r the benifits to peeps who bought the game, so far?
P1:44:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> none
P1:44:34 <Chrstfer> damn!
P1:44:34 <PuyoDead> future updates
P1:44:38 <Chrstfer> i bought it tho!
P1:44:41 <Chrstfer> YAYAYAAYA!
P1:44:53 <ZomBuster> oh clearing my java cache fixed the issue
P1:45:19 <Marach> ...
P1:45:24 <|404notfound> the benefit is that you won't have to pay for the game later
P1:45:24 <PuyoDead> on the whole, though, I would say all prividers are crap, and the entire cell phone market needs an overhaul
P1:45:33 <|404notfound> it's not going to be free when it releases
P1:45:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Right
P1:45:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> $70 / month base plan, plus $10 in fees, for no SMS
P1:45:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> and SMS costs $.10 outgoing AND incoming
P1:46:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> so it ends up at ~100 a month for everything
P1:46:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Not to mention, SMS is free for the carriers
P1:46:21 <PuyoDead> the cost for text alone is atrocious
P1:46:23 <Chrstfer> 404 wut do you mean?
P1:46:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> it literally costs them no money
P1:46:26 <Darkebrz> Im fine with my LG Rumor 2
P1:46:30 <Darkebrz> It satisfies all my needs
P1:46:32 <|404notfound> I mean the game is going to cost money
P1:46:40 <Chrstfer> all natural, from a technical standpoint not true
P1:46:45 <gear> i got some shitty pantech phone
P1:46:47 <gear> idk
P1:46:47 <Chrstfer> but it is 99 percent profit
P1:46:52 <gear> i broke my other one
P1:47:00 <TrueWolves> I'm to broke to get a cellphone x.x;
P1:47:07 <Chrstfer> it costs them maybe .1cent. 
P1:47:11 <Marach> citricsquid shouldnt send me 1 eur for a minecraft account.. would forums be still running? :)
P1:47:32 <citricsquid> if 1 euro is $300, then yes.

P2:18:00 <vede> Apparently, in the US, media may be prohibited by the government if it satisfies all three of these conditions:
P2:18:03 <vede> # Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,
P2:18:03 <vede> # Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions[2] specifically defined by applicable state law,
P2:18:03 <vede> # Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
