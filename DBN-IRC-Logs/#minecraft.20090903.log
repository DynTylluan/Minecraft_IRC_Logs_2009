A12:02:04 <setveen> yeah darkerbz, i can see why you get kicked from servers
A12:02:09 <Darkebrz> ?
A12:02:11 <Darkebrz> What
A12:02:17 <PickYerPoison> Can anyone help me get this running? I've asked a bit before, but I didn't get any real solutions.
A12:02:24 <Darkebrz> Get what running?
A12:02:29 <Darkebrz> setveen: What?
A12:02:30 <PickYerPoison> Minecraft, sorry.
A12:02:34 <Darkebrz> Hmm
A12:02:39 <Darkebrz> You have updated java, right?
A12:02:41 <setveen> you know what
A12:02:43 <Darkebrz> Mac/Windows
A12:02:46 <gear> hahaha
A12:02:50 <Darkebrz> setveen: What did I do
A12:02:52 <PickYerPoison> Java is the latest version.
A12:03:00 <Darkebrz> citricsquid is my mortal enemy
A12:03:11 <Darkebrz> Mac or Windows
A12:03:16 <PickYerPoison> Windows. In IE, after the loading bar with the dirt background, it just goes black.
A12:03:23 <setveen> youre a troll darkerbz, ill put it simply
A12:03:24 <PickYerPoison> In Firefox, it goes blank.
A12:03:36 <Darkebrz> setveen: Again, how
A12:03:47 <Darkebrz> I do troll sometimes, but I am also a contributing member of the community
A12:03:55 <setveen> re read what you say earlier
A12:04:05 <Darkebrz> setveen: I said a lot of stuff -_-
A12:04:19 <Darkebrz> PickYerPoison: Have you ever been able to run it?
A12:04:51 <setveen> i shouldnt have to explain it to you, youre a dick to me, the people @ archives, and now citric
A12:05:02 <Darkebrz> setveen: Lol, I didn't do anything in the archives
A12:05:06 <Darkebrz> And citricsquid is my friend :3
A12:05:20 <Darkebrz> And you were asking for help with illegal clients
A12:05:21 <setveen> "citricsquid is my mortal enemy"
A12:05:27 <potato> "illegal"
A12:05:36 <setveen> like thats never been done here before
A12:05:37 <Darkebrz> On the official IRC channel for a game
A12:05:43 <PickYerPoison> Darkebrz: Not on my computer. I've run it on others, but the few times I've tried to run it on mine, it doesn't work.
A12:05:47 <potato> "for"
A12:05:51 <Darkebrz> setveen: It HAS been done here before
A12:05:56 <Darkebrz> Most people just leave when we tell them to
A12:06:06 <setveen> thats what i meant -_-
A12:06:11 <Darkebrz> PickYerPoison: Strange... What are your system specs?
A12:06:26 <Darkebrz> setveen: So we should offer support for hacked and illegal clients?
A12:06:40 <Darkebrz> And I think I crashed The Archives XD
A12:06:49 <setveen> no, but you dont have to be a dick about it
A12:06:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> good job
A12:07:01 <Darkebrz> setveen: The first time you came on I wasn't
A12:07:05 <setveen> yeah, they did go dont, but you wernt in them
A12:07:05 <Darkebrz> We told you to leave
A12:07:10 <setveen> down*
A12:07:15 <Darkebrz> It gets a bit annoying when you come back
A12:07:20 <Darkebrz> setveen: Actually I had just joined
A12:07:21 <gear> where oh where is my popcorn
A12:07:26 <Darkebrz> And then about 30 seconds later it crashed
A12:07:42 <setveen> its been crashing alot recently
A12:07:49 <Darkebrz> Ah, well
A12:07:52 <setveen> i think there is a world thats flooding
A12:08:04 <setveen> and or broken
A12:08:06 <PickYerPoison> Darkebrz: Windows XP, Intel Pentium III Processor with 648 MHz, 512 MB of RAM
A12:08:15 <Darkebrz> What you have to understand is that I don't care if you come once and we turn you down, but when you return it gets pretty annoying
A12:08:47 <gear> whaaaat

A12:09:12 <gear> how is that computer even alive
A12:09:16 <Darkebrz> Holy shit
A12:09:26 <Darkebrz> Yeah...
A12:09:31 <gear> antique status right there
A12:09:48 <Darkebrz> 1999? Wow
A12:09:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> those were the days
A12:10:06 <Darkebrz> PickYerPoison: Even if you did get it to run, it probably wouldn't work very well
A12:10:07 <PickYerPoison> It is the crappiest computer on the face of the planet. :|
A12:10:08 <setveen> PickYerPoison, does your computer have a turbo button on it?
A12:10:20 <setveen> i love turbo buttons
A12:10:21 <gear> does it have a self destruct
A12:10:22 <PickYerPoison> Umm...I don't think so. I don't even know what that is.
A12:10:41 <Darkebrz> setveen: Okay, well, so you thought you could get some help from the official minecraft IRC channel about a problem with your client?
A12:10:43 <setveen> turbo buttons are only on REALLY OLD computers
A12:10:53 <gear> you can probably get a better computer than that for like 100 bucks
A12:10:56 <Darkebrz> PickYerPoison: That is a pretty old computer
A12:11:04 <setveen> you have said that exact sentence like 5 times now
A12:11:08 <setveen> just shut up
A12:11:11 <setveen> i have
A12:11:12 <PickYerPoison> Yeah, I know. I keep not getting around to buying a better one.
A12:11:31 <Eagle> setveen: Hostile much? No need to be an ass there kiddo.
A12:11:41 <setveen> he is the troll
A12:11:55 <setveen> not me, i get along fine with people
A12:11:55 <Darkebrz> Eagle: He came on twice asking for help with his hacked client
A12:12:00 <Eagle> Darkebrz is a bigt part of the community
A12:12:06 <Eagle> also hacked clients aren't allowed here
A12:12:07 <setveen> 6 times
A12:12:25 <setveen> ill make a counter for you darkerbz
A12:12:31 <gear> guess what got boring as fuck
A12:12:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> now you guys are just being silly
A12:12:37 <Darkebrz> <Darkebrz> setveen: With your issues with the client?
A12:12:37 <Darkebrz> <setveen> http://i25.tinypic.com/6teko6.jpg
A12:12:37 <Darkebrz> <setveen> that
A12:12:37 <Darkebrz> <Darkebrz> No
A12:12:37 <Darkebrz> <Darkebrz> We won't help you with your troubles with your client
A12:12:38 <setveen> itll tick every time you bring it up
A12:12:38 <Darkebrz> <Darkebrz> Stop asking

A12:13:12 <Eagle> gear: True. Although it's not done yet. Not even close.
A12:13:16 <setveen> ill get a website running, just for you
A12:13:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> whatever
A12:13:21 <Darkebrz> Let me direct you to the WoM boards
A12:13:25 <Eagle> It'll get less boring after he actually adds stuff
A12:13:26 <Darkebrz> I think you will like it there
A12:13:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah, in 3 weeks
A12:13:35 <setveen> also, copy pasting convos can get you banned
A12:13:36 <PickYerPoison> So no hope of getting minecraft to run on my stone-age computer, huh?

A12:14:05 <Darkebrz> I got banned by citricsquid for it once
A12:14:07 <Eagle> Why in the hell would cping conversations get you banned. He was clarifying?
A12:14:10 <Darkebrz> He calls it "multi-line spam"

A12:14:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> and by doing that intentionally
A12:14:44 <setveen> just saying, its a little hypocritical darkerbz
A12:14:46 <Darkebrz> I copied like, 11 and I got banned
A12:14:58 <Eagle> 11 is kinda a lot though
A12:15:04 <setveen> bitch at me for breaking the rules
A12:15:14 <Darkebrz> Yep
A12:15:16 <Eagle> setveen: Guess who didn't break the rules just now
A12:15:18 <setveen> them break them yourself
A12:15:19 <Eagle> guess
A12:15:28 <Eagle> Hint: it's darkebrz
A12:15:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's never me
A12:15:47 <Darkebrz> I break the rules a lot >_>
A12:15:50 <Darkebrz> But I have learned
A12:16:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> you have, darling
A12:16:05 <Darkebrz> 3 bans (1 for several days) teachesa you well
A12:16:24 <Eagle> But you're a troll sometimes so that kinda justifys it
A12:16:30 <Darkebrz> Yep
A12:16:31 <setveen> why are there two of you in the archives having a staring contest darkerbz?
A12:16:41 <setveen> oh and ive never been banned
A12:16:44 <Darkebrz> Because I'm that awesome
A12:16:51 <Darkebrz> setveen: You are rarely on this IRC
A12:16:53 <setveen> only kicked once for /nick notch
A12:16:53 <Darkebrz> Im always on
A12:17:51 <setveen>  game broke :(
A12:17:55 <Eagle> Darke, most of the kicks have been from citric haven't they
A12:17:55 <Eagle> :P
A12:17:58 <Darkebrz> I am the only connected players
A12:18:03 <Darkebrz> In fact, 2 of them are connected
A12:18:10 <Darkebrz> Eagle: 2 bans from citric
A12:18:16 <Eagle> I thought so
A12:18:16 <Darkebrz> And then I got banned by Notch :D
A12:18:20 <Eagle> :O
A12:18:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's sweet of you
A12:18:33 <Eagle> Did you post a swastika or something
A12:18:39 <Eagle> I think Notch banned a person for that

A12:19:57 <TestDummy> Yes
A12:20:00 <Darkebrz> Eagle: Yeah that was me
A12:20:04 <Darkebrz> It didnt mean anything though
A12:20:14 <Eagle> Unrelated: There needs to be a Rock Band/Guitar Hero: Queen
A12:20:15 <Darkebrz> I was testing it to use it for some anti Nazi stuff
A12:20:24 <Eagle> Mhmm totally
A12:20:27 <Eagle> :P
A12:20:53 <Darkebrz> Hey TestDummy, what are you doing here?
A12:21:03 <Darkebrz> I don't think anyone has changed their nick to Notch lately...
A12:21:06 <TestDummy> Hanging out.
A12:21:10 <TestDummy> Is that a crime? :|
A12:21:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> for a second, yes
A12:21:13 <gear> yes

A12:26:29 <Darkebrz> NO YOU HATE IT WHEN IT IS QUIET
A12:26:56 <Eagle> When it gets quiet I can hear the monsters hiding underneath the userbar. D:
A12:27:11 <Eagle> They tell me to burn things sometimes.
A12:27:28 <Rodifan> It's much hard to go the distance.
A12:27:40 <Rodifan> It's amazing what you'll find face-to-face.
A12:28:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> face to face was a great boss theme
A12:31:36 <gear> theres like a night and day crowd
A12:33:14 <Eagle> It is day time right now for some people you know.

A12:35:42 <Rodifan> I like the song.
A12:35:47 <asiekierka> The Team ASCII intro?
A12:35:50 <Rodifan> Yeah.
A12:35:54 <asiekierka> It was made in MegaZeux
A12:36:12 <asiekierka> and sound ripped from the 1989 Solidarity intro
A12:36:16 <asiekierka> The idea was ripped as well
A12:36:27 <asiekierka> haha
A12:36:27 <Rodifan> It was brilliant though.
A12:36:34 <asiekierka> the song IS fun, yes

A12:51:20 <Colain> Notch backs up my idea of Minecraft TV, it's mine and he knows it.
A12:51:35 <asiekierka> can it be?
A12:51:37 <Colain> Either way, I'm trying to get you minecraft free, so I wouldn't copy.
A12:51:37 <asiekierka> what about MCSALFNAMTUHNtv?
A12:51:45 <Colain> On the other hand, I will let you join Minecraft TV.
A12:51:51 <asiekierka> Will it be on the archives
A12:51:55 <asiekierka> as the server is handsome
A12:52:41 <Colain> It'll be on heaps of servers
A12:52:57 <Colain> We do everything from rate servers to soap operas... or will do, at least.
A12:53:12 <asiekierka> Well
A12:53:15 <Colain> A preset map for soap operas and stuff would be good.
A12:53:21 <asiekierka> Can be done with TA

A1:01:11 <Colain> Yes, the server "the archive"
A1:01:21 <Rodifan> A fight against this place and that place.
A1:01:35 <Rodifan> A fight between the good and the bad, whoever portrays it as.
A1:01:45 <Rodifan> I've been to the Archive server a few tmes.
A1:01:55 <Rodifan> I could do some LP videos on that thing.
A1:02:09 <Colain> Yeah, I like it a lot.
A1:02:14 <Rodifan> Express my reactions to the custom code and variety of the maps.
A1:02:33 <asiekierka> Colain: You can has msgblocks and portals
A1:02:37 <asiekierka> I can build a studio for you
A1:02:42 <asiekierka> ask for a 128x128x128 map
A1:02:47 <asiekierka> then we have a studio in it
A1:02:50 <asiekierka> of various qualities
A1:02:58 <Rodifan> A studio would sound brilliant.
A1:03:05 <asiekierka> then a teamspeak server hopefully
A1:03:08 <Rodifan> What would you call the map?
A1:03:14 <asiekierka> "minecrafttv", why
A1:03:17 <asiekierka> also it will be private
A1:03:19 <Colain> They haven't fixed my map yet.
A1:03:22 <asiekierka> open only to ones that ARE in minecraft tv
A1:03:24 <Rodifan> Just wondering.
A1:03:29 <asiekierka> and a teamspeak server
A1:03:29 <asiekierka> with various chatrooms
A1:03:33 <asiekierka> each for a different studio
A1:03:44 <Darkebrz> asiekierka: I can have a map? :D
A1:03:50 <asiekierka> sure
A1:03:51 <asiekierka> just ask
A1:03:53 <asiekierka> WHEN AN ADMIN IS ON
A1:03:56 <Rodifan> I could imagine a sitcom.
A1:04:00 <asiekierka> i am not ze admin
A1:04:02 <Rodifan> Could I haveamap as well?
A1:04:04 <Darkebrz> Dang D:

A1:04:12 <asiekierka> so yes
A1:04:16 <asiekierka> but admins will come on
A1:04:17 <Darkebrz> I want a map for me and my friend >_>
A1:04:26 <asiekierka> and minecrafttv will launch soon hopefully
A1:04:27 <Rodifan> Gonna add a useless green room
A1:04:29 <Colain> Darke, asie ain't admin.
A1:04:38 <asiekierka> But I'm a fair enough builder
A1:04:43 <asiekierka> "asie" was built in 90% by me
A1:04:48 <asiekierka> only the secret industries branch was not
A1:04:54 <Colain> Asie is quite good at most things.
A1:05:03 <Colain> I wish they would fix my map!
A1:05:11 <asiekierka> I will ask for it
A1:05:14 <asiekierka> wait
A1:05:17 <asiekierka> what do you mean by fix
A1:06:32 <Colain> My map got griefed after a hack.
A1:06:45 <asiekierka> Oh
A1:06:50 <asiekierka> You need to wait for aera for that
A1:06:57 <asiekierka> only aera can load backups

A4:18:54 <TheAlien> *post
A4:18:58 <TheAlien> that would be awesome
A4:19:07 <citricsquid> What was the PHP to get the correct posters IP with lighttpd on?
A4:19:09 <citricsquid> To aera
A4:19:11 <citricsquid> from citricsquid
A4:19:18 <Snowman> yay for custom crosshair
A4:19:37 <aera> to citricsquid, from aera: look in includes/functions.php, in the get_remote_adress function
A4:20:46 <citricsquid> What should it be? :P
A4:20:51 <citricsquid> to aera from citricsquid etc.
A4:21:35 <aera> you need to run get_apache_headers, or something, then look at X-Forwarded-For, then take the last item in that (which is a comma-separated list)
A4:21:48 <citricsquid> ah okay, I'll sort that out, ty :)
A4:21:54 <aera> the code was already in MediaWiki, thankfully, so I didn't have to fix that
A4:21:57 <citricsquid> need to get "guests online" listing properly :P
A4:22:00 <aera> ...you didn't overwrite it again, did you?
A4:22:14 <citricsquid> I overwrote the forum one like, an hour after you did it, accidentally :(
A4:22:19 <citricsquid> last week or something
A4:22:23 <aera> i fixed it again
A4:22:57 <citricsquid> ahh yes
A4:22:59 <citricsquid> you have
A4:23:07 <citricsquid> I wonder why it isn't working then.
A4:23:10 <aera> includes/functions.php, line 715
A4:23:13 <citricsquid> I'll hve a gander with my subpar php
A4:24:57 <Snowman> has a health bar instead of hearts now :D
A4:25:40 <citricsquid> haha
A4:25:43 <citricsquid> figured the problem
A4:25:44 <citricsquid> and fixed it
A4:25:53 <citricsquid> you had [-1] in the array, instead of [0] :D
A4:27:28 <Snowman> YOW TF
A4:27:34 <Snowman> I spawn in front of 10 skeletons
A4:27:53 <citricsquid> I spawned surrounded by creepers on my second go, crapped my pants.
A4:29:36 <aera> citricsquid: -1 is valid

A4:29:56 <citricsquid> yeah, but that was the wrong item it would appear.
A4:30:02 <aera> if you use [0], you get the (untrustworthy) first item
A4:30:11 <citricsquid> well
A4:30:14 <citricsquid> -1 is empty
A4:30:18 <citricsquid> and 0 has the IP

A4:30:31 <aera> well you want the end one
A4:30:32 <citricsquid> yep, strange :|
A4:30:40 <aera> since proxies append to that header on the end
A4:30:51 <aera> and we only trust our own proxy (the last one, thus the end one)

A5:01:03 <Griskard> The only problem I see is the whole tenticle thing

A5:01:18 <Griskard> ticle
A5:01:21 <Griskard> tent
A5:01:22 <Griskard> icle
A5:01:37 <Griskard> Its the english language, its evolutionary
A5:01:37 <citricsquid> tentickle
A5:02:24 <Evil-Ville> english language is pretty much the worst language in the world
A5:02:27 <Griskard> Hrm
A5:02:33 <Evil-Ville> it's a shame it's so popular
A5:02:36 <Griskard> Grass doesnt seem to grow to platforms
A5:02:44 <Griskard> I tried making my own flat forest
A5:02:47 <citricsquid> has to be connected to other grass
A5:02:55 <Griskard> It was via stairs
A5:03:03 <Snowman> it does grown, just takes time
A5:03:05 <Evil-Ville> Then you didn't wait long enough
A5:03:16 <Griskard> No, I mean, Im in the same survival game as an hour ago
A5:03:27 <Snowman> it's just slow :p
A5:03:28 <Griskard> And I built it pretty early, trying to establish a safe area with wood
A5:03:42 <Griskard> Ive been making this pool on the edge of map
A5:03:51 <Griskard> Really deep hole, gonna flood it
A5:04:18 <Evil-Ville> It takes really long for grass to grow if you've got single block wide stairs
A5:04:33 <Evil-Ville> I wouldn't be surprised if it took hours
A5:11:30 <citricsquid> haha
A5:11:33 <citricsquid> 6 pigs in the same plac
A5:12:32 <Griskard> Wish notch had another week

A5:40:30 <Evil-Ville> Maybe I would believe you if you had placed a sign somewhere and a mushroom grew next to it
A5:40:37 <Griskard> It was growning in a hole where I blew a creeper
A5:40:53 <Griskard> So it cant have been there
A5:41:00 <Evil-Ville> Maybe it wasn't the same hole
A5:41:22 <TheAlien> maybe it was in a small underground 1x1x1 cave
A5:41:36 <Evil-Ville> I think mushrooms should grow under trees
A5:41:43 <TheAlien> which got uncovered by the creeper explosion
A5:41:59 <TheAlien> Evil-Ville: yeah they should
A5:42:04 <Griskard> No, it was against a cliff
A5:42:09 <Griskard> No holes or mushrooms

A5:42:39 <TheAlien> did you see the spot without mushrooms early and then returned to see them there again
A5:42:47 <TheAlien> oh okay
A5:42:59 <TheAlien> i take that as a proof
A5:43:02 <TheAlien> awesome
A5:43:04 <Evil-Ville> I don't
A5:43:07 <Griskard> Although as you said alian
A5:43:08 <Griskard> alien
A5:43:25 <Griskard> I might have missed it when I blew it, maybe mistaking it for those dirt blocks and stuff
A5:43:31 <TheAlien> yeah
A5:43:35 <TheAlien> meh
A5:43:47 <Griskard> And it might have been a 1x1 which was uncovered, But I cant really be sure
A5:43:50 <TheAlien> i guess we can take this as a 10 % proof
A5:43:53 <TheAlien> XD
A5:43:57 <Griskard> Ill place signs where I take mushrooms from from now on
A5:44:04 <Evil-Ville> Best way to see if they grow would be to dig your own hole and then sit there for hours
A5:44:07 <TheAlien> great

A5:44:41 <Evil-Ville> I think they do but I am not sure
A5:44:46 <TheAlien> me neither
A5:45:06 <TheAlien> so i tried starting a small game
A5:45:11 <TheAlien> gonna check it soon
A5:45:27 <Evil-Ville> I've tried killing all the enemies on surface of a small map though and I kept finding more
A5:45:31 <TheAlien> to see if its completely crowded
A5:45:39 <Evil-Ville> So either they crawl out of caves or they respawn
A5:45:46 <TheAlien> and you're sure you killed all?
A5:47:24 <Evil-Ville> Well maybe there was one or two hiding behind a hill
A5:47:38 <TheAlien> hmm yeah okay
A5:47:49 <TheAlien> i think i'll try tonight
A5:47:52 <Evil-Ville> But for example I killed a bunch of skeletons in a lake and then came back later and found three creepers
A5:48:09 <TheAlien> i'll load a small map, kill everything and leave it for the night
A5:48:22 <TheAlien> ^oh so they do
A5:48:47 <citricsquid> uh, they come from different places, I've not seen any respawn yet.
A5:49:20 <citricsquid> watch them for ~10 mins, they can move quite far around a map
A5:49:28 <Snowman> w00t, got a barney zombie now :D
A5:49:43 <TheAlien> but they dont walk around freely right? they stay within a small area, so basicly its easy to check if they do respawn

A6:48:58 <Snowman> they will give everyone a hat for free
A6:49:06 <Snowman> except the ones who used cheats to gets hats XD
A6:49:45 <citricsquid> hahaha brilliant
A6:50:05 <Evil-Ville> They already gave everyone a hat
A6:50:32 <Evil-Ville> Also the special hat doesn't cloak when you're a spy
A6:50:42 <Snowman> :O
A6:50:43 <Snowman> what hat?
A6:50:49 <Evil-Ville> It's a halo
A6:50:52 <Snowman> lol
A6:50:57 <citricsquid> Does this mean EVERY TF2 player who didn't cheat gets a hat?
A6:51:01 <citricsquid> or do we have to have played?
A6:51:07 <Snowman> every tf2 player
A6:51:11 <citricsquid> oh good
A6:51:18 <citricsquid> I want a nice hat :D
A6:51:25 <Evil-Ville> I didn't get one because I used the idler to get bunch of weapons when the spy/sniper patch was released
A6:51:35 <Evil-Ville> The whole random drop system is such bullshit
A6:51:56 <Evil-Ville> I don't care about hats though
A6:53:03 <Snowman> FUCK YEAH
A6:53:08 <Snowman> I now have houndeyes in mc
A6:53:16 <PuyoDead> hmm, looks like it went back a while, too
A6:53:33 <PuyoDead> I used it to get the weapons, due to the garbage drop system
A6:53:48 <citricsquid> how does it check if you idled?
A6:53:56 <PuyoDead> but since I had so many duplicates, I still have everything
A6:54:03 <Snowman> it doesnt, it checks if you used an external application to do it

A6:55:55 <PuyoDead> such as "oh, people want new weapons, but don't want to do ridiculous achievments to get them, maybe we should fix that"
A6:56:31 <PuyoDead> why ever they didn't just flat out give everyone the new weapons with each update is beyond me
A6:56:32 <citricsquid> I probably shouldn't play TF2, I'll get a BSOD
A6:57:22 <Snowman> wait wtf, it said i got awarded with the hat but it's not in my inventory
A6:57:52 <Snowman> nvm
A6:58:08 <Evil-Ville> They should just make it so that every two hours there's a chance of you getting a weapon whether you're playing or not
A6:58:19 <Evil-Ville> So there's no need to idle
A6:58:22 <citricsquid> ugh no
A6:58:24 <citricsquid> that'd suck
A6:58:27 <Evil-Ville> Why?
A6:58:37 <citricsquid> because after a week EVERYONE would have the same weapons

A6:59:51 <Evil-Ville> So you actually want to grind the weapons?
A6:59:57 <Evil-Ville> That's a first
A7:00:10 <PuyoDead> hence why they should have just given them out from the start
A7:00:48 <citricsquid> I would rather earn all the weapons
A7:00:52 <Snowman> Also, I hate they gave out a hat to the first 11111 people who found it :/ the rest cant get it
A7:00:54 <citricsquid> I agree that hourly based time is silly
A7:01:52 <Evil-Ville> No they didn't Snowman
A7:02:00 <Snowman> They did
A7:02:01 <Evil-Ville> They just gave those people a medal that shows on soldier
A7:02:06 <Evil-Ville> Not hats
A7:02:09 <Snowman> yeah it's sort of an hat
A7:02:15 <Evil-Ville> no it's not
A7:02:23 <Evil-Ville> Hat is what you wear on your head
A7:02:47 <Evil-Ville> Besides I am sure there will be bunch of similar things in the future
A7:04:40 <PuyoDead> "We realize there is a high level of demand for items, and we're still working on systems to allow you to find them in new ways (via Trading, and crafting duplicates into desired items)."
A7:04:48 <PuyoDead> yet another sidestep
A7:05:48 <Evil-Ville> They obviously want some kind of randomized weapon system in

A7:28:45 <citricsquid> and therefore cannot be linked by anyone
A7:28:46 <flyboy> ?
A7:28:52 <flyboy> The downloadable client?
A7:29:00 <citricsquid> Phazorx was asking about it flyboy.
A7:29:15 <flyboy> That you can find by googling -oops,almost said it
A7:29:36 <Phazorx> citricsquid: okay...2 more questions then
A7:29:48 <Phazorx> is there a full screen version for decent harsware
A7:29:57 <Phazorx> and is there tunable version for low end hardware
A7:30:12 <Phazorx> and it would be really nice to put the browser out of equsion for later
A7:30:28 <Evil-Ville> no and no
A7:30:40 <citricsquid> Eventually there will be a standalone client
A7:30:48 <citricsquid> Notch said this was his intention (I think?)
A7:30:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah
A7:30:53 <citricsquid> but right now there isn't an official one.
A7:31:07 <Phazorx> is there a way to run the jars browser less?
A7:31:08 <flyboy> in beta there will be
A7:31:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> the links are Somewhere over Around there
A7:31:28 <Phazorx> i'm having issues with performance in relatively old PC
A7:31:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fog is all you can do :(
A7:31:39 <citricsquid> Running it standalone won't help that, will it?
A7:31:42 <Phazorx> however same PC plays fine much more graphically chalenging games
A7:31:52 <Phazorx> getting rid of broswer will help it
A7:31:55 <flyboy> Not unless you're playing mp
A7:31:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> right, the rendering engine is terribly unoptimized
A7:31:58 <Phazorx> and beingable to tune things will help it as well
A7:31:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> And no it won't
A7:32:08 <Phazorx> playing MP yes
A7:32:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> no
A7:32:23 <Phazorx> and yes it weal, browser imposes massive security checks on pretty much anything VM does
A7:32:25 <flyboy> Then play SP
A7:32:32 <Phazorx> which does hinder performance on average by 15%
A7:32:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then go download the standalone and prove me wrong
A7:32:46 <Phazorx> link?
A7:32:50 <flyboy> NO!
A7:32:51 <Snowman> there is a fullscreen greasemonkey application though
A7:32:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft is calculated almost completely on the GPU
A7:32:54 <Phazorx> and it hrdly will prove anything
A7:32:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> which the browser won't touch
A7:32:57 <flyboy> Google
A7:33:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, I wrote a fullscreen greasemonkey script
A7:33:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> *that* I can link to you
A7:33:08 <Snowman> though it only works for multiplayer
A7:33:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> search minecraft or AlLnAtuRalX on userscripts
A7:33:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> should work for SP also... no?
A7:33:19 <Phazorx> MP is what am interested in
A7:33:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> never tested on survival
A7:33:30 <Phazorx> not survaial evn just creative
A7:33:49 <Phazorx> and as far as GPU rendering - i assume it is OGL based
A7:33:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> yes
A7:34:04 <Phazorx> is there ogl version the game is shooting for specifically?
A7:34:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Don't believe so
A7:34:26 <Phazorx> just to make sure the gpu does not run in compatibility moed or something ugly like that

A7:40:30 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: no distribution
A7:40:31 <Peerko> it wouldn't be too hard to make something that downloads the client, would it?
A7:40:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Nope, never distributed it here
A7:40:49 <Phazorx> readme would be nicethanks
A7:41:17 <Evil-Ville> You can do it over private message if you want AlLnAtuRalX
A7:41:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Distributing would be against Notch's wishes, and that would be bad.

A7:59:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> As for whoever said crime (ChJees): m
A7:59:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Since 2005 the city has had the lowest crime rate among the 25 largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1980s and early 1990s from the crack epidemic that impacted many neighborhoods. By 2002, New York City had about the same crime rate as Provo, Utah and was ranked 197th in overall crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000. Violent crime in New York
A7:59:32 <AlLnAtuRalX>  City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005 and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases.[156] In 2005 the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966,[157] and in 2007 the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963.[

A8:39:14 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I've also been a Medic.... I don't like all the big huge heavy weapons and demolitions and pyro etc...
A8:39:15 <asiekierka> it's just 14:39
A8:39:18 <asiekierka> :P
A8:39:24 <liq3> Xeros: Oh, why not?
A8:39:24 <citricsquid> yeah I have no idea why I did that lmao
A8:39:34 <citricsquid> wait what
A8:39:36 <Nohbdy|Xeros> even in other games the weapons they have aren't my kinda thing.. except for the demolition's mine shooter gun thing
A8:39:39 <citricsquid> he's in new zealand.
A8:39:48 <asiekierka> so it's probably 3 AM for him
A8:39:51 <asiekierka> dammit
A8:40:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> AM/PM FTW
A8:40:08 <asiekierka> AM/PM SUX
A8:40:10 <liq3> Xeros: These weapons aren't really like the the other games. :p
A8:40:11 <asiekierka> LONG LIVE MILITARY TIME
A8:40:30 <liq3> Xeros: Like in most WWII games rocket launchers are extremely... heavy. Hard to hit ppl with etc. Not the case in TF2.
A8:40:38 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I'm not a fan of "going in guns blazing".. I prefer tactics and stealth... not that the big gun guys can't but.... they don't have as good equipment to do so
A8:40:46 <liq3> Xeros: Tried Spy yet? :D
A8:40:50 <citricsquid> If you want a good FPS
A8:40:52 <citricsquid> play cod1
A8:40:54 <Nohbdy|Xeros> oh yeha I did like the soldier actually it's my favorite offensive
A8:41:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Play Quake 1 or Quake 3
A8:41:06 <liq3> Xeros: soldier is the best at general fighting. ;]
A8:41:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Warning: You WILL get raped in Q1
A8:41:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are people that have been playing for years on end
A8:41:18 <flyboy> citricsquid>	he's in new zealand.
A8:41:19 <citricsquid> I remember playing UT2004
A8:41:19 <offset> I destroy soldiers as scout
A8:41:20 <flyboy> <asiekierka>	so it's probably 3 AM for him
A8:41:21 <citricsquid> hates that game
A8:41:21 <flyboy> 1.41am
A8:41:30 <flyboy> and who?
A8:41:33 <liq3> offset: They are newb soldiers.
A8:41:39 <offset> And some good ones :)
A8:41:42 <liq3> offset: Or you got them while they were distracted. :p
A8:41:44 <Nohbdy|Xeros> You will also get raped on Starcraft... but that's a mix of experience and hacks lol
A8:41:50 <offset> I'm fairly good at scout >:D
A8:41:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Starcraft you get raped by Koreans
A8:42:01 <offset> aslong as it's not indoors ofcourse
A8:42:05 <liq3> offset: doesn't really matter how good you are. Scouts lose to soldiers. ;]
A8:42:22 <asiekierka> Time to work on TeamASCIItv
A8:42:26 <Nohbdy|Xeros> oh yeah I forgot about Scout... it's probably a class I'd like but I never tried it since it's so popular I wanted to try everything else first... but I got addicted to engineer

A8:43:02 <citricsquid> scout is an awful class
A8:43:07 <citricsquid> just run around hitting people
A8:43:08 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Heck yeah Spy was my first choice

A8:43:28 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I do a pretty good job of pretending to look like I'm on their team.
A8:43:32 <liq3> haha.
A8:43:34 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Love teh Spy
A8:43:49 <liq3> What's nice is that the "spy update" effect seems to have worn off.
A8:43:55 <Nohbdy|Xeros> ?
A8:43:58 <liq3> I'm seeing a lot less spies now, actually finding games without any.
A8:44:10 <liq3> Spies get signifcantly worse the more there are.
A8:44:19 <liq3> Ideally you'd only ever have 1, maybe 2.
A8:44:23 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I remember seeing the spies "smoking" around their body.. idk what that is
A8:44:25 <liq3> 2 are pretty scary if they work together well.
A8:44:33 <liq3> The smoke is them disguising.
A8:44:41 <Nohbdy|Xeros> it looks like it lasts a long time
A8:45:12 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I usually switch disguises a lot so I wonder if that's how some of them have been identifying me easier
A8:45:21 <liq3> hrm.
A8:45:26 <liq3> just don't let ppl see it.
A8:45:32 <liq3> It really only lasts 2-3 seconds.
A8:45:46 <liq3> Honestly I disguise a TON.
A8:45:58 <liq3> Like I'll backstab someone, and they have 2-3 allies up a head (who haven't seen).
A8:46:10 <liq3> And I'll disguise so if they do look I might not die. xD
A8:46:22 <liq3> Disguise right after I kill that is. ;]
A8:46:33 <Nohbdy|Xeros> sometimes of course I disguise my spy as another class of my same team so if they see me they may have false counter-strategies.
A8:47:48 <Nohbdy|Xeros> like I'll pretend to be a pyro so they know I attack at close range.. and they may end up chasing after me.. which by then I turna  corner.. time it right, and change into their team for a quick unexpected kill :D
A8:48:14 <liq3> pyro isn't that good, although it is my most used.
A8:48:30 <liq3> I really don't use disguises to try to hide... I mostsly use em as a "glance" type thing.
A8:48:37 <liq3> Because they don't really work. :P
A8:48:52 <Nohbdy|Xeros> as for me being sniper well.. that's because I love being a sniper in any game lol.
A8:49:27 <bobo> i just found a cave full of water
A8:49:31 <bobo> with mushrooms inside bubbles
A8:49:37 <bobo> underwater
A8:49:58 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I seem to do a good job as long term disguising... heck I even followed the whole team for a while simply because I was facing my teams direction and about 3 of em passed me by
A8:50:09 <citricsquid> bobo: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2209
A8:50:18 <Evil-Ville> Obviously that team was terrible
A8:50:19 <Nohbdy|Xeros> and I made it look like I was gonna ambush my own team
A8:50:38 <bobo> hehe cool
10A8:50:45 * ParOut is now known as Parthon
A8:51:28 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I also choose classes to disguise as that look less unnatural when running towards their base.. like medics and engineers
A8:51:44 <citricsquid> disguise as a spy, obviously.
A8:51:57 <citricsquid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR04zoJurSI also relevant
A8:52:05 <Evil-Ville> Relying on disguises makes you a terrible spy
A8:52:35 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I saw too many enemy spies being disguising as our side spies... it's obviously a popular tactic so I don't use it as much... I usually do though when I want to cloak
A8:56:19 <Nohbdy|Xeros> But yeah engineer... not only of course do I love their building ability but they also have good enough weapons for me, a pistol and a shotgun. The engineer class in general inspires me more to someday create games. I love games where you can construct something, tis why I love minecraft lol.
A8:57:38 <Nohbdy|Xeros> liq3 do you play on xbox live or on the copmuter? orr... do they both "intertwine" or something lol
A8:57:47 <liq3> PC.
A8:58:04 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Can Xbox players play with PC-ers?
A8:58:08 <liq3> no
A8:58:11 <Nohbdy|Xeros> danng
A8:58:16 <liq3> if you have only the xbox version, that's sad. :P
A8:58:22 <liq3> because it's like 10x worse then the PC ver.
A8:58:27 <Evil-Ville> There's zero reason to play the xbox version
A8:58:43 <bobo> same goes for all fps
A8:58:46 <bobo> on console
A8:58:51 <Nohbdy|Xeros> you mean besides the fact that no computer I've ever had would run it... and because I'm borrowing the orange box for free.
A8:58:56 <Evil-Ville> Well it's especially true in this case
A8:59:06 <Evil-Ville> Since there's so many new maps and other stuff in the pc version
A8:59:33 <bobo> i'm sure the updates would come out on xbox too
A8:59:44 <bobo> current gen consoles are good with stuff like that
A8:59:49 <Evil-Ville> They won't
A8:59:50 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I disagree with the console-fps thing.. most new and old fps games I've played were amazing on the console... my first was 007 goldeneye
A9:00:04 <Nohbdy|Xeros> nintendo :P
A9:00:06 <bobo> well yeah, ok
A9:00:09 <asiekierka> I'm still thinking how would Minecraft (in 2D) work on an original gameboy
A9:00:09 <bobo> 007 was awesome
A9:00:14 <bobo> but the mouse cannot be matched
A9:00:21 <Evil-Ville> Microsoft doesn't want to allow free updates and content
A9:00:24 <bobo> minecraft in 2d?
A9:00:31 <asiekierka> on an original gameboy
A9:00:33 <asiekierka> not even gbc
A9:00:38 <asiekierka> the original, huge, fat gameboy
A9:00:41 <Nohbdy|Xeros> minecraft in 2d.... maybe isometric... :P
A9:00:43 <bobo> it'd work on DS wouldnt it?>
A9:00:48 <asiekierka> with an emulator
A9:00:55 <asiekierka> Also i wanted to do simple tiles
A9:01:01 <asiekierka> cuz isometric IS infinitely harder
A9:01:07 <asiekierka> cuz you need to have all edge combinations
A9:01:10 <Evil-Ville> true 2D minecraft style game would be pretty cool
A9:01:15 <Evil-Ville> Since you could have huge maps
A9:01:18 <asiekierka> by true 2D i mean plain 2D
A9:01:28 <asiekierka> Maybe layers
A9:01:28 <bobo> it'd be hard building structures though

A9:01:31 <Nohbdy|Xeros> indeed.. I love 2d... and since it's 2D I'd imagein a loot more could be put into it
A9:01:32 <asiekierka> between which you can move
A9:01:32 <bobo> tall things would get in the way
A9:01:36 <asiekierka> also
A9:01:42 <asiekierka> it could run on a 1991 gameboy
A9:01:42 <bobo> maybe 2d as in side view
A9:01:45 <bobo> platform style
A9:01:48 <Nohbdy|Xeros> that's just cause I have no problems with graphics... I love crap graphics
A9:01:49 <asiekierka> thats what i want to do
A9:01:57 <asiekierka> I actually wanted to do a survival mode-esque game for the gameboy
A9:02:01 <Evil-Ville> yeah platform style is the only smart way to go about it
A9:02:05 <asiekierka> like survival mode which you can play anywhere you want
A9:02:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> crap? no no no
A9:02:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's not crap. it's beauty
A9:02:43 <Nohbdy|Xeros> you misinterpret crap.. I say crap because general population opinion says crap
A9:03:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> no way no no this can't be happening i'm hallucinating i must
A9:03:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's my general opinion though
A9:03:42 <Nohbdy|Xeros> It's faster than saying "I don't care if most people think 2d is "Crap"... if it's crap then I suppose I love "crap". lol

A9:06:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> i worship games

A9:06:26 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Oh and.. as much as I love Minecraft.... you guys know about the game that's comign out, that's also being created by only 1 person? And it sounds quite similar to minecraft(except for constantly changing environment like eroding and etc.. I'm sure Notch'll add that someday lol)
A9:06:33 <Nohbdy|Xeros> The game is called "Love"
A9:06:41 <citricsquid> I hardly play games :D Minecraft, besides COD1 is the only game I play properly, most games are too serious.
A9:06:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes, love

A9:08:14 <d0ohan> In the video he says about 100 or so
A9:08:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's what i heard
A9:08:23 <Nohbdy|Xeros> oh cool... 100 is good too lol

A9:18:26 <Evil-Ville> Right now you can kill every single enemy on the map without getting hit once
A9:18:31 <Nohbdy|Xeros> is there some code I can add to a youtube URL to make it "low" quality? haha I can't watch this trailer because it's too good quality
A9:18:34 <asiekierka> Notch: AND THE OLD PLANK BLOCK (to creative mode, PLEASE)
A9:18:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> flaming arrows?
A9:18:34 <08Notch> what if I make shooting arrows require wood? ;)
A9:18:36 <liq3> Evil-Ville: Yeh, ith melee. >.>
A9:18:40 <citricsquid> Notch: that'd be awesome
A9:18:40 <Evil-Ville> Yes
A9:18:44 <Evil-Ville> It's way too easy
A9:18:45 <asiekierka> Notch: yes
A9:18:51 <08Notch> ok, I'll do that as well then
A9:18:54 <liq3> Notch: Awesome idea! :D
A9:18:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> old plank?
A9:18:55 <asiekierka> but I care more about the old plank block
A9:18:55 <Quatroking> Notch: sounds good if you improve the accuracy
A9:18:56 <asiekierka> in 0.023a
13A9:18:59 * Notch digs into code
A9:19:03 <asiekierka> I am NOT going to wait until october
A9:19:05 <citricsquid> also some sort of cool down for eating; right now if you collect 99 mushrooms you can just run around into groups of mobs and eat as you hit and get hit :P
A9:19:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> what's the old plank block again?
A9:19:15 <Evil-Ville> Also the arrows feel super floaty
A9:19:19 <Evil-Ville> It makes them boring to use
A9:19:27 <asiekierka> AnnihilatorBeta: Google "minecraft hitler" in youtube
A9:19:32 <asiekierka> hitler's bunker is the right video
A9:19:33 <Nohbdy|Xeros> floaty?
A9:19:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> uh
A9:19:34 <asiekierka> it has that block
A9:19:35 <Evil-Ville> It's like you're shooting bits of styrofoam at people
A9:19:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> okay
A9:19:41 <asiekierka> it was there until like... 0.0.12a or so
A9:19:43 <Evil-Ville> I mean enemies not people
A9:19:50 <asiekierka> It was awesome
A9:19:53 <asiekierka> And I wish it was back

A9:22:15 <asiekierka> He only cares about Shitvival.
A9:22:21 <Zed> what block
A9:22:22 <asiekierka> I appreciate the work
A9:22:24 <Quatroking> annihilatorbeta: and when they hit you you bump backwards, and when they miss they run 5 tiles further unless they bump into something, which hurts them

A9:22:34 <Zed> oh...

A9:23:49 <Marach> Notch, I think the mobs' vision should be based on raytracing, not distance

A9:24:03 <asiekierka> I will get the game

A9:24:47 <asiekierka> No answer for 2 days is fine, No answer for a month is fine, No answer and making your own game which is a cheap ripoff of minecraft is BAD

A9:44:19 <Siiseli>  AlLnAtuRalX ewww
A9:44:19 <gear|work> oh god
A9:44:20 <asiekierka> Gameboy color survival clone = eeeviler
A9:44:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> Those are some of the 1337est players I know
A9:44:33 <Marach-afk> DONT add raytrace vision with these...
A9:44:36 <liq3> Notch: Time for the ability to farm food? :D
A9:44:38 <gear|work> are you gonna do height checking on mob detection?
A9:46:01 <08Notch> no, but I can make pigs drop mushrooms as a quick hack
A9:46:01 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Quatroking: everyone does what?
A9:46:13 <liq3> Notch: :D
A9:46:17 <Quatroking> xeros: everyone who wants to move japan teaches english
A9:46:22 <Dilt> notch, actually
A9:46:31 <Evil-Ville> It's the only thing dirty foreigners are allowed to do
A9:46:38 <Dilt> how possible would it be to code a button to make all the mobs on the map hostile to you immediately and permanently?
A9:46:39 <Quatroking> xeros: become an exporter of japanese goods instead
A9:46:46 <Dilt> (mob survival mode!)
A9:47:03 <Dilt> you know, so you can hold off a fort you've built in defense of the mobs
A9:47:13 <gear|work> they're kinda dumb at moving
A9:47:16 <Evil-Ville> They probably couldn't get to you anyways
A9:47:18 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Lol I can't imagine doing anything else there anyway, amazingly "teaching english in japan" requires not too much japanese language knowledge, and is a very popular thing to do there.
A9:47:34 <gear|work> wishing mobs could dig
A9:47:38 <liq3> Notch: You gonna fix mobs jumping? 
A9:47:54 <Nohbdy|Xeros> anything else other than "programming awesome Japanese games!!!"
10A9:48:01 * Cue (cueball61@cpc4-alde1-0-0-cust240.glfd.cable.ntl.com) has joined #minecraft
A9:48:25 <gear|work> i want to go to a japanese club, and feel entirely awkward
A9:48:25 <08Notch> if I can think of a quick fix for it, sure
A9:48:28 <Dilt> honestly the 'mob invasion' button would work as a sort of goal, notch
A9:48:38 <Dilt> make all the mobs angry at you at once and have them all head right for you :D
A9:48:38 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I'll probably be working on coding "while" I'm at Japan anyway. Besides... Japan suits me... I would LOVE to live in a small cramped apartment.
A9:48:49 <Evil-Ville> It's not going to work that easily Dilt
A9:48:55 <Dilt> no? i haven't been awake
A9:48:59 <Evil-Ville> Since they're extremely dumb
A9:49:03 <Nohbdy|Xeros> And teh culturezorz there is like...my favorite ever.
A9:49:12 <Evil-Ville> Most of them would just walk against a wall somewhere
A9:49:22 <Dilt> well, true. especially with the underground ones
A9:49:24 <Dilt> still
A9:49:32 <08Notch> haha
A9:49:34 <Dilt> if mobs respawn, then it's pretty much very possible to just
A9:49:38 <08Notch> skeletons shooting arrows = baaad news
A9:49:38 <Dilt> push the button at the start then
A9:49:39 <Dilt> GOOD LUCK
A9:49:51 <Dilt> you might have skeletons coming out of the ground the moment you dig a hole
A9:49:55 <citricsquid> Notch: how deadly are arrow hits?
A9:49:59 <Evil-Ville> Just don't make them shoot too fast
A9:50:00 <gear|work> they would anyway dilt
A9:50:01 <Nohbdy|Xeros> how accurate are they >.>
A9:50:10 <gear|work> since mobs dont have any regard for heihg
A9:50:11 <gear|work> t
A9:50:13 <Dilt> gear: almost
A9:50:17 <gear|work> if you dig into a cave with them below you
A9:50:22 <gear|work> they're all sitting waiting
A9:50:38 <gear|work> and then its like shooting fish in a barrel
A9:50:45 <Dilt> but the trick is that they'd be
A9:50:48 <Dilt> right next to you waiting for you
A9:50:52 <Marach-afk> i cant change nick
A9:51:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> and why is that
A9:51:37 <Dilt> just ready to pop out the ground the moment they could
A9:51:37 <Marach-afk> mobs take damage from falling
A9:51:55 <Marach-afk> i killed a pig throwing it off the cliff :)
A9:52:03 <citricsquid> haha, meanie.
A9:52:06 <gear|work> you sick bastard
A9:52:08 <Dilt> i sorta want to
A9:52:11 <Dilt> grab a pig and keep it in my inventory
A9:52:12 <Marach-afk> Notch: figured out what causes the FPS drop?
A9:52:15 <Dilt> and use it to beat other mobs with...
A9:52:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> lol
A9:52:24 <08Notch> Marach-afk: No, I haven't had time to look at it
A9:52:29 <08Notch> I will fix it after indonesia
A9:52:35 <liq3> Is it possible all the mobs are rendering at once?
A9:52:40 <08Notch> possibly
A9:52:48 <Marach-afk> when i installed newest GPU drivers, it fixed the fpashing graphics bug, but game is EVEN slower!
A9:52:52 <gear|work> 3 weeks of dsigning the craziest survival map possible
A9:52:54 <08Notch> it used to run well with 200+ mobs before
A9:52:59 <liq3> ah...
A9:53:01 <liq3> Tru.
A9:53:18 <08Notch> I think I messed up somethign with the rewrite. It's probably something simple
A9:53:25 <liq3> 100 mobs would drop my fps from 122 to 120. xD
A9:53:26 <citricsquid> Notch: Will saving maps work the same as singleplayer, where we can link others to them?
A9:53:26 <08Notch> I'll look into it if I get some extra time today
A9:53:30 <08Notch> but it's already 5 pm. :D
A9:53:39 <08Notch> citricsquid: Kinda, yes
A9:53:49 <08Notch> they will only work if you play via the survival page
A9:53:55 <08Notch> so you need to manually edit the url
A9:54:06 <liq3> Notch: Will old maps we saved before you disabled it work?
A9:54:11 <08Notch> instead of /play.jsp, it's /survival/index.jsp
A9:54:16 <citricsquid> cool, means we can have challenges where the map matches for everyone :D
A9:54:17 <ChJees> hmm
A9:54:18 <08Notch> I don't think so, liq3
A9:54:25 <liq3> Notch: Hrm..I  hope so. >.>
A9:54:28 <Dilt> zombie invasion notch!
A9:54:30 <08Notch> But old maps from before survival mode should work
A9:54:34 <08Notch> I
A9:54:40 <asiekierka> They DO work
A9:54:43 <08Notch> great =D
A9:54:45 <ChJees> I can has forge?
A9:54:45 <asiekierka> it was tested on IRC already
A9:55:01 <Dilt> actually i was kinda sad
A9:55:07 <asiekierka> Notch: Will you please look into adding the old (0.0.11a) blocks as new blocks? ...A big... please? I promise i won't whine anymore...
A9:55:11 <Dilt> i made this great fort but there were no mobs willing to challenge me :(
A9:55:13 <08Notch> No, asiekierka
A9:55:55 <asiekierka> Aww :(
A9:55:59 <asiekierka> Oh well then
A9:56:02 <asiekierka> I guess I'll just move on
A9:56:43 <betasword> 200 mobs is one thing for slowdown. Huge sized maps tend to spawn with over 1000 mobs, though, and normal maps with over 500. Not sure how much that's effecting framerate for people.
A9:57:13 <liq3> betasword: it's really hurtin mine. I can't get over 30-40 fps on huge.
A9:57:27 <Dilt> i haven't actually tried survival on this computer
A9:57:36 <08Notch> I think it might be related to mobs. I got a 20-30% increase in fps when I did the speedups in rendering
A9:57:41 <Marach-afk> betasword, in console you can see the exact amount of mobs spawned
A9:57:52 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Hey guys, anyone want waffles, I'm gonna go get some waffles guys. You want waffles? I'm gettin' waffles, so if you want waffles com get waffles, I'm gettin waffles, guys.
A9:57:52 <Dilt> on my little Eee PC on battery I can get 12-18 FPS on second-smallest fog, 30+ on smallest fog (mind you, all of these are on smallest map)
A9:57:55 <betasword> My framerate's dropped down to around 40 or so on huge maps at times, too.
A9:57:58 <liq3> Marach-afk: Console?
A9:57:58 <Marach-afk> its usually ~300 on normal and ~1000 on huge
A9:58:02 <Nohbdy|Xeros> come*
A9:58:28 <Dilt> if there's 1000 mobs on a huge map
A9:58:29 <betasword> Oh, I thought it was more for normal... Huh.
A9:58:39 <aera> Notch: you're presumably culling the mobs outside the viewport from doing animation?
A9:58:43 <Dilt> that's 1000 different collision detections and 1000 different 'is your dude in my sight' detections
A9:58:50 <aera> i can think of something like that hurting
A9:59:08 <Dilt> i'm not sure how much that'd hurt framerate though
A9:59:27 <betasword> I'd maybe even suggest culling the AI for mobs outside of a certain radius of the player, maybe beyond some very basic "move around".
A9:59:40 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Hey dudes, I got syrup for waffles, if you want waffles, 'cause I'm gettin' waffles guys. So if you want waffles, I got syrup. The syrup is for the waffles you guys. So if you want syrup you might want waffles dudes. I'm gettin' waffles.
A10:00:01 <citricsquid> Nohbdy|Xeros: stop it.
A10:00:10 <Dilt> betasword: that's uhh
A10:00:18 <Dilt> pretty much all they do when outside of range
A10:00:23 <Dilt> randomly move+jump
A10:00:28 <Nohbdy|Xeros> citric doesn't understand joke ;-;
A10:00:37 <gear|work> they still bump into each other dilt
A10:00:39 <Evil-Ville> It's not even a joke
A10:00:41 <bobo> when is 'love' coming out?
A10:00:43 <Evil-Ville> It's retarded dribble
A10:00:43 <gear|work> and other such nonsense
A10:00:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> soon, my child
A10:00:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> soon
A10:00:59 <bobo> free?
A10:00:59 <liq3> Bobo: I'd expect a beta of some sort soon... Within 3 months.
A10:01:05 <bobo> ah k
A10:01:06 <bobo> nice
A10:01:08 <bobo> i like the look of it
A10:01:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's going to be paid
A10:01:21 <liq3> Bobo: The dev said it's basically done, and ready for beta... But knowing him it'll be closed beta so I dunno.

A10:03:48 <liq3> d-pad moves obviously.
A10:03:51 <Marach-afk> you answered yourself
A10:03:56 <liq3> maybe a jumps, and b attacks/mines?
A10:03:59 <asiekierka> no
A10:04:03 <asiekierka> Well, actually, maybe
A10:04:04 <asiekierka> A jumps
A10:04:06 <asiekierka> B mines
A10:04:11 <asiekierka> SELECT toggles place/removal
A10:04:15 <liq3> yeh that'd work.
A10:04:16 <asiekierka> actually that's B+D-PAD
A10:04:25 <liq3> hrm.
A10:04:30 <Marach-afk> im stuck being afk :/
A10:04:31 <Quatroking> asiekierka code for gba instead
A10:04:34 <liq3> yeh Dpad + B could be place/mine

A10:06:09 <asiekierka> Retro = the 90's
A10:06:12 <asiekierka> and the 80's
A10:06:17 <asiekierka> GBA is obviously not a 90's machine
A10:06:27 <Quatroking> its still retro
A10:06:37 <Evil-Ville> 2001 is pretty close though

A10:07:23 <potato> not retro enough to be cool, not modern enough to be cool
A10:07:30 <Evil-Ville> I prefer GBA over DS
A10:07:30 <Marach-afk> halp help
A10:07:31 <asiekierka> potato: Agreed
A10:07:35 <asiekierka> I prefer DS over GBA
A10:07:37 <Evil-Ville> It has more good games
A10:07:41 <potato> gbc was great
A10:07:44 <Marach-afk> i love both

A10:07:51 <asiekierka> also
A10:07:54 <Marach-afk> and i dislike all before gba
A10:07:55 <asiekierka> GBA is GBC-compatible
A10:08:03 <Evil-Ville> Well DS is better in the end because it can play GBA games
A10:08:04 <asiekierka> GameBoy Micro and Nintendo DS/DSi can emulate it, too
A10:08:08 <Evil-Ville> DSi just blows though
A10:08:16 <asiekierka> So you can run GBC on any post-GBC platform :D
A10:08:26 <asiekierka> GBA, Gameboy Micro, DS, DSi
A10:08:33 <asiekierka> With compatibility on the first one

A10:21:41 <08Notch> I want to TRY them, but I can take things out if it isn't fun
A10:21:41 <asiekierka> I don't care really
A10:21:46 <asiekierka> try it out
A10:21:48 <asiekierka> if you want it
A10:21:50 <08Notch> I'm not adding poisoning now, though
12A10:21:54 * Katnipz (Mibbit@67.158.170.101) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
A10:22:03 <citricsquid> It'd be cool if once poisoned you had to get to water to unpoison
A10:22:20 <08Notch> I want to limit arrows in some easy way.. then I'll upload a new version. :D
A10:22:44 <citricsquid> you get xx arrows everytime you get a kill + for wood, somehow...
A10:23:00 <08Notch> I could just make it use wood
A10:23:01 <gear|work> have mobs drop arrows?
A10:23:08 <Marach-afk> no, you get arrows for killing skeleton arrowshooters :)
A10:23:09 <potato> you get 99 arrows, and you can go and pick up the ones you've already shot
A10:23:12 <08Notch> i don't have support for non-tile items in the inventory
A10:23:16 <gear|work> gotcha
A10:23:22 <Dilt> yeah notch
A10:23:23 <Dilt> make it use wood
A10:23:24 <08Notch> i could add it, though..
A10:23:26 <citricsquid> Notch: they could go next to the health bar couldn't they?
A10:23:26 <gear|work> make arrows a tile item ;p
A10:23:29 <Dilt> or
A10:23:33 <Dilt> gear has a good idea however.
A10:23:34 <citricsquid> like a little arrow icon with # next to it
A10:23:41 <Dilt> we can't craft yet.
A10:23:42 <08Notch> oh, that's not a bad idea, citric
A10:23:47 <08Notch> it'd be a temporary thing for this test
A10:23:51 <08Notch> it'll go in the inventory later on
A10:23:51 <Marach-afk> Notch, you could add some feature0adding items lying on ground or in caves
A10:23:54 <gear|work> you can just make a mob kill add to that counter
A10:24:05 <08Notch> I can have arrow resources in the world!
A10:24:05 <potato> what we'll need eventually is a bigger inventory
A10:24:07 <Marach-afk> some maybe time-based so you use it in stategical moment
A10:24:11 <08Notch> like have skeletons drop them when you kill them
A10:24:17 <Dilt> oh notch
A10:24:18 <08Notch> or if you manage to reach an arrow stuck in the ground before it vanishes
A10:24:20 <Dilt> do mobs respawn?
A10:24:20 <potato> maybe we can craft a backpack
A10:24:24 <08Notch> yes, they do now =D
A10:24:25 <Dilt> slash do more spawn when you kill them off
A10:24:26 <Dilt> :D
A10:24:31 <Dilt> and did you ever uhh
A10:24:33 <liq3> Mobs respawn? :D :D :D :D
A10:24:38 <08Notch> also, mobs that haven't "seen action" for a while will vanish
A10:24:40 <Dilt> answer how feasable a 'all mobs go hostile and go right at you' button?
A10:24:41 <potato> oh good, that was one of my main gripes
A10:24:45 <08Notch> so a mob stuck in a cave will die by itself
A10:24:48 <gear|work> notch, have you added a score to the main screen?
A10:24:53 <08Notch> no, I will!
A10:25:06 <potato> what we need is some more difficulty
A10:25:23 <potato> also:
A10:25:23 <Dilt> my mob invasion button is just what we needed!
A10:25:24 <Evil-Ville> Doesn't that cause caves to be empty?
A10:25:27 <gear|work> or harder mobs as we go deeper
A10:25:36 <potato> saving and loading levels from creative mode
A10:25:42 <08Notch> no, mobs will spawn under ground as well
A10:25:58 <Dilt> ... will mobs spawn in the sky?
A10:26:03 <08Notch> no dilt. =)
A10:26:04 <gear|work> i drew a concept for an ogre-mob
A10:26:04 <Dilt> and promptly fall to their demise? :D
A10:26:07 <Dilt> aww
A10:26:08 <08Notch> if you build something up there, yes
A10:26:11 <Dilt> actually
10A10:26:14 * Real (Real@66.231.145.59) has joined #minecraft
A10:26:15 <Evil-Ville> But you just said that mobs stuck in caves will die by themselves
A10:26:19 <Dilt> i kinda was hoping for mobs to randomly show up in my fort
A10:26:23 <Dilt> when i leave to go get supplies
A10:26:25 <gear|work> Evil-Ville: they also respawn now
A10:26:30 <Dilt> ... also i'm out of time i will be leaving now
A10:26:35 <Dilt> i will catch you all later :D
A10:26:43 <potato> mobs we spawn in creative mode should turn into a random mob once we load them in survival
A10:26:52 <Evil-Ville> Yes they'll respawn in the cave and die again because they're stuck in a cave
A10:27:23 <gear|work> well then hopefully you catch them when they respawned
A10:27:32 <gear|work> i dont imagine they die instantly
A10:27:35 <gear|work> just on a timer

A10:27:46 <Snowman> HAI
A10:27:48 <Evil-Ville> Skeletons will now shoot things
A10:27:50 <liq3> Real: We have shootin ones apperently.
A10:27:55 <liq3> Real: Skeletal bowman.
A10:27:59 <Real> Serious? Nice
A10:28:04 <Snowman> back to modding survival :D
A10:28:07 <08Notch> they're pretty dangerous..
A10:28:12 <Marach-afk> flying ones will be EPIC Notch plz add them!
A10:28:15 <liq3> Notch: how good is their aim? O.o
A10:28:15 <gear|work> are they accurate?
A10:28:20 <08Notch> it's random. :D
A10:28:27 <gear|work> oh lawd
A10:28:28 <Dilt> oh right notch
A10:28:28 <betasword> Notch: Is there any way you'd be able to make it so that the frame limiter turns off while a map is loading or generating, and then back on once you get into gameplay? That'd drastically reduce load times for maps.
A10:28:28 <Marach-afk> Snowman what are you making?
10A10:28:33 * Marach-afk is now known as Marach
A10:28:38 <Marach> AT LAST!!
A10:28:40 <Dilt> have you tried digging out the side of a hill, getting to 99 dirt, and not being able to pick up any more to build?
A10:28:45 <Dilt> for large builds... well
A10:28:51 <Dilt> having to make dirt dumps is not fun
A10:28:54 <Snowman> simple modding
A10:28:56 <potato> when creepers die on the timer, will they explode as normal
A10:29:03 <potato> yeah dilt that is annoying

A10:29:10 <gear|work> i hate that
A10:29:11 <liq3> Dilt: I think it's a good mechanic honestly.
A10:29:12 <Real> Oh and the resources from mining should disappear after some time, if they don't already.
A10:29:15 <Dilt> it's a good mechanic but uhh
A10:29:18 <Snowman> btw Notch, I have some texture problems with survival, do you know what causes this? Here are some screens: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=17288#p17288
A10:29:18 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Maybe there could be a type of block, like an "Evil" block.. that appears in clusters mainly above-ground and that act as major "spawn areas" for NPC's. It wouldn't effect amount of NPC's but "density" of NPC's.
A10:29:21 <gear|work> they do real
A10:29:23 <Dilt> it's annoying. and afk, be back
A10:29:23 <liq3> Dilt: In RL if you dig something up, gotta move it somewhere else. :P
A10:29:33 <Dilt> yeah iiq3, but if i can carry 99 dirt then uhh
A10:29:35 <Dilt> yeah.

A10:29:53 <potato> you can't build on the little resource cubes, that pisses me off
A10:29:55 <liq3> I just think it's a good idea, otherwise we'll get ppl carrying around like 10000 stone.
A10:29:59 <Dilt> yeah, you can't build on it
A10:30:02 <Dilt> is the issue
A10:30:09 <Evil-Ville> I think it would be better if the more stuff you carried the slower you moved
A10:30:11 <Dilt> blarrg but
A10:30:13 <liq3> Dilt: Just spam stone/dirt while you move around outside.
A10:30:17 <Dilt> i'll think about this later gotta go to classsssss
A10:30:22 <Dilt> liq3: won't work with my eee pc
A10:30:28 <potato> there should be a collective limit rather than a limit for each block
A10:30:29 <Evil-Ville> So it wouldn't encourage carrying half the world with you everywhere
A10:30:31 <Dilt> rotating and clicking is iffy
A10:30:35 <Dilt> it's hard to do both at once
A10:30:36 <potato> like, 999 blocks total
A10:30:41 <Dilt> and gah afk.
A10:30:57 <Snowman> You should be able to fill a different slot with the same material if a slot is full
A10:30:58 <potato> but they could be distributed however you wantr
A10:31:09 <Evil-Ville> You can't even carry 999 blocks if you fill up every slot
A10:31:10 <potato> yeah snowman, like that
A10:31:11 <gear|work> you should also be able to destroy a slot
A10:31:31 <Snowman> Notch, you know what causes this problem? http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=17288#p17288

A10:31:38 <08Notch> haha, I think I know how to let you harvest arrows now.. :D
A10:31:38 <Evil-Ville> If anything the max should be like 300 blocks
10A10:31:42 * betasword_ is now known as betasword
A10:31:44 <potato> eventually, crafting backpacks and shit can give us a bigger inventory
A10:31:46 <08Notch> I do not, Snowman :-O
A10:31:46 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Evil-ville I'm sure he knows that, he's simply making a point that doesn't require a math problem.
A10:31:46 <Evil-Ville> Or less
A10:31:48 <08Notch> how many are getting it?
A10:31:49 <Snowman> :D
A10:31:51 <Snowman> None
A10:31:54 <08Notch> looks trippy
A10:31:55 <Snowman> did it myself :p
A10:31:55 <08Notch> lol
A10:31:57 <08Notch> haha
A10:31:57 <potato> Evil-Ville: 99 blocks * 10 slots = 990
A10:31:59 <Snowman> texture editing
A10:32:05 <08Notch> kewl
A10:32:05 <Evil-Ville> There's 9 slots though?
A10:32:06 <Snowman> looks like source missing textures :D
A10:32:11 <potato> oh
A10:32:12 <potato> shit
A10:32:27 <citricsquid> Notch: Here is a confirmed bug though : http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=2204
A10:32:30 <potato> 891 then
A10:32:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh no
A10:32:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> checkerboards
A10:32:38 <Snowman> atm I replaced the hand with a crowbar
A10:32:40 <Marach> yay great mods
A10:32:49 <PuyoDead> finished professor layton, woo!
A10:32:51 <Quatroking> ah fuck Flash is crashing
A10:32:55 <Quatroking> fucking deco tool
A10:32:59 <Evil-Ville> Still I can't imagine ever needing to carry that many blocks
A10:33:02 <potato> by the way notch
A10:33:04 <Marach> PuyoDead, which one?
A10:33:04 <Snowman> Also, replaced the zombies with zombie security guards
A10:33:14 <PuyoDead> diabolical box
A10:33:16 <Snowman> with armor being kevlar vest + helm
A10:33:22 <Marach> im playing it
A10:33:23 <potato> the invisimobs happen at the same time as the weird pigs
A10:33:52 <gear|work> Evil-Ville: i go through tons of blocks while building a fort
A10:34:03 <Nohbdy|Xeros> The "amount" of blocks can be discussed after the general idea of a collective system is "OK'd" as a possibility.
A10:34:16 <Evil-Ville> I think you should just be able to use a drop key to drop the blocks you're carrying in the current slot
A10:34:21 <Evil-Ville> and then later instantly pick them up
A10:34:29 <Evil-Ville> As opposed to placing them all over the place
A10:34:31 <gear|work> that would be nice for multiplayer too
A10:34:33 <Evil-Ville> then digging them back
A10:34:41 <gear|work> have one person go digging
A10:34:44 <gear|work> and drop a load
A10:34:46 <potato> crafting a vault
A10:34:57 <gear|work> for the builders
A10:34:58 <liq3> I don't like that idea of being able to dorp them like that.
A10:35:10 <bobo> nah i like the way it is now
A10:35:13 <gear|work> ok maybe you lose 50%
A10:35:13 <liq3> Honestly I kinda want "storage" blocks. They're normal blocks but 20x in one.
A10:35:25 <liq3> When you destroy them they drop 20x of that type of block.
A10:35:25 <bobo> i like the fact you have to dig a cave out, go outside and put the blocks somewhere
A10:35:26 <Evil-Ville> Does it make sense to you that you place gold ore on the ground and then you have to dig it again?
A10:35:27 <bobo> its realistic
A10:35:28 <citricsquid> I like how it is now, makes you think more.
A10:35:44 <bobo> yeah it makes sense
A10:35:47 <gear|work> hmm
A10:35:48 <liq3> Evil-Ville: no, it doesn't haha.
A10:35:52 <potato> all this shit will be solved once we get crafting
A10:35:53 <citricsquid> more focused on explore than just dick straight through
A10:36:00 <citricsquid> lol dick wtf
A10:36:01 <citricsquid> dig*
A10:36:04 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Maybe if you could store blocks somewhere, I don't like randomly dropping either.
A10:36:24 <Marach> "dick" straight?
A10:36:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> lol
A10:36:43 <Snowman> citric always thinks about dicks :p
A10:36:59 <Marach> haha
A10:37:26 <08Notch> ok, skeletons will explode into a flurry of arrows when you kill them now. :D
A10:37:27 <Nohbdy|Xeros> If there was an option to store items that'd be pretty cool. I was gonna suggest a "discard" but that would cause the finite number of blocks to go down.
A10:37:30 <Peerko> oh, so ehm, do mobs respawn?
A10:37:36 <citricsquid> awesome!!
A10:37:40 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Yes Peerko ^.^
A10:38:00 <potato> Notch: have you got the pigs/meat thing working yet
A10:38:05 <liq3> Xeros: You can farm stone and wood. :P
A10:38:08 <potato> do they drop little hams
A10:38:14 <Peerko> farm stone?
A10:38:15 <liq3> Xeros: so there's no issue of running out of stuff...
A10:38:15 <Nohbdy|Xeros> How does that work liq3?
A10:38:25 <liq3> Xeros: Wood - grow trees. Farm - lava + water.
A10:38:26 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Well then dirt is finite.
A10:38:29 <liq3> Although stone farming is very hard.
A10:38:35 <Peerko> ah hm
A10:38:40 <Nohbdy|Xeros> And dirt is needed for growing.
A10:38:41 <Evil-Ville> Notch can you tone down the distance you hear enemies walking from
A10:38:49 <Peerko> level saving would be nice
A10:38:49 <liq3> Dirt is fairly useless. Wood is the best for making structures atm, since it's mined faster then dirt, can be farmed, and is harder then stone.
A10:38:51 <Evil-Ville> It's really annoying
A10:39:05 <liq3> Peerko: We're gettin it. :P
A10:39:21 <Peerko> go Notchman go!
A10:39:37 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Wood is harder than stone? That's sad =/
A10:39:49 <liq3> Planks*. Yeh, they're like 2x slower haha.
A10:39:59 <liq3> From a gameplay persective I say keep it honestly. :P
A10:40:06 <Marach> blocky meat xD
A10:40:07 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Maybe if you could turn stone into "brick block" or something that is "man-made" and harder to destroy or something.
A10:40:11 <liq3> But maybe make trees harder to cut down.

A10:40:38 <liq3> Which is harder then planks.
A10:40:42 <Peerko> I want glass too :(
A10:40:46 <liq3> Peerko: same :(.
A10:40:55 <potato> Peerko: lava and sand
A10:40:57 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Maybe even branch it up! 2 cobble-stone makes X... two X makes Y.. etc :P
A10:40:58 <Peerko> sand + lava = glass :)
A10:41:00 <bobo> lava+sand = glass
A10:41:02 <bobo> darn you peerko
A10:41:06 <Peerko> darn me!
A10:41:09 <Snowman> Lava + Water = Cobblestone imo

A10:41:16 <liq3> Xeros: Nah, we have ore for harder tsuff. :P
A10:41:17 <08Notch> but four arrows or so
A10:41:26 <citricsquid> Notch: Do we start with any?
A10:41:31 <Evil-Ville> Oh yeah there doesn't seem to be any way to drop poison mushrooms
A10:41:32 <Snowman> You gonna limit bow? :( no more machine gun
A10:41:34 <Evil-Ville> That's silly
A10:41:34 <08Notch> yes. Not many. ;)
A10:41:42 <Snowman> I just replaced the arrows with bullets :D

A10:41:59 <Marach> i think none
A10:42:09 <gear|work> was just going to add
A10:42:15 <gear|work> planks should break faster
A10:42:15 <08Notch> I think I fixed the bug with the vanishing monsters

13A10:43:20 * citricsquid waits for video
A10:43:26 <gear|work> notch, you should keep all the weird builds
A10:43:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> :(
A10:43:39 <gear|work> if you dont
A10:43:54 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I think an option for a harder difficulty mode(if there will be that) is the ability to make things a loot longer to mine/break and etc. I could imagine it being pretty fun for multiplayer survival with people against eachother. Would take more planning and timing rather than quick reflexes.
A10:43:54 <gear|work> and then release them as oddities in the future
A10:44:45 <gear|work> just saying
A10:44:57 <LG_Legacy> I liked the mines

A10:46:34 <citricsquid> LG_Legacy: skeletons fire arrows now
A10:46:35 <gear|work>  already has
A10:46:39 <LG_Legacy> ...
A10:46:39 <citricsquid> keep up boy!
A10:46:40 <LG_Legacy> Fucking..
A10:46:42 <LG_Legacy> Awesome..
A10:46:47 <Nohbdy|Xeros> haha
A10:47:07 <potato> notch what do you think about monsters being able to see you from farther away
A10:47:59 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I'm sure it's definitely already been asked about... but "flying" monsters sound very good. You would no longer be safe in a high tower, and since we already have bows...
A10:48:20 <08Notch> already done, potato 
A10:48:25 <Nohbdy|Xeros> (well a tower with openings)
A10:48:28 <potato> grand
13A10:48:51 * Snowman has houndeyes instead of pigs
A10:48:58 <potato> what about mobs that can dig
A10:49:10 <gear|work> digging monsters would be good too
A10:49:12 <LG_Legacy> Time to play survival :D
A10:49:13 <gear|work> specific ones though
A10:49:19 <gear|work> molemans
A10:49:56 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I'm hoping someday an implementation of "fire" or elements will be added. I'd imagine using fire you could turn sand into glass, cook meat for more health... etc
A10:50:04 <potato> http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h246/blackdragon521/SkyLeech.gif someone made this
A10:50:08 <potato> i think it's cool
A10:50:26 <potato> also, cows
A10:50:29 <potato> and sheep
A10:50:35 <citricsquid> also squids ;)
A10:50:39 <potato> lol
A10:50:49 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I have a feeling they'd be as bothersome as "Cliff Racers" in Morrowind... but I feel it would fit in with survival mode.
A10:50:49 <bobo> squids would be awesome
A10:50:54 <potato> squids should be found in underwater caves
A10:51:00 <bobo> agreed
A10:51:10 <citricsquid> any underwater animal would be awesome
A10:51:27 <Nohbdy|Xeros> underwater anything! besides, single-ing out caves sounds hard to do =/
A10:51:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> pigs are underwater animals

A11:00:50 <LKA> the title
A11:00:55 <LKA> i instantly 10/10'd without seeing it
A11:00:59 <potato> when we can load maps from creative mode, mobs we spawn should turn into enemies

A11:03:19 <LKA> we start rocket jumping off of them, doing flips and shit
A11:03:55 <PuyoDead> so, the pig staying alive underwater thing that liq3 found, is that "normal", as in, pigs do that anyway?
A11:03:59 <Snowman> Zombie security guards: http://i27.tinypic.com/2wn4to1.jpg
A11:04:03 <liq3> PuyoDead: nope.

A11:04:12 <liq3> PuyoDead: There was 3 pigs in there at the start, 2 drowned. :P
A11:04:15 <PuyoDead> hmm
A11:04:41 <Snowman> Also, notice the custom crosshair + health bar
A11:05:04 <PuyoDead> ewww, custom health looks terrible
A11:05:11 <Snowman> it does?
A11:05:28 <Snowman> What's so awful about it?
A11:05:32 <liq3> Hehe, i just found a way to make Trees grow 2 spaces apart. :D
A11:05:37 <citricsquid> hearts match the feel of the game much better
A11:05:39 <Real> alright, maybe it should be that the floating resources simply get moved out of the way (over, on top of, etc.) when trying to build in their place
A11:05:53 <PuyoDead> at least make some segments that show how many "hearts" there are
A11:06:13 <Snowman> copies the health bar from zuriki btw ;) mine looks cooler than her's though :p
A11:07:14 <Snowman> ill make segments
A11:07:22 <citricsquid> his*
A11:07:30 <Snowman> its

13A11:07:41 * citricsquid goes for noms

A11:08:03 <liq3> Notch: ANy chance you could make it so trees can grov next to each other?
A11:08:07 <Snowman> making segments atm
A11:08:24 <potato> notch what are the rules for tree growing
A11:09:41 <liq3> potato: FRom what I've seen ingame, where the tree is gonna be created (including leaves) has to be empty.

A11:22:47 <Evil-Ville> I just killed like five of them
A11:22:52 <Evil-Ville> they can't do shit
A11:22:53 <PuyoDead> I had one continually hitting me back
A11:22:54 <Real> so pigs drop... mushrooms? i figured they'd drop meat and when you pick it up your health automatically increases, not you have to equip it and eat it, Notch. thoughts?
A11:23:00 <Evil-Ville> You go too close then
A11:23:06 <Maulrus> wait does pausing work properly now?
A11:23:09 <citricsquid> Real: It's a quick solution, I think. Only while he's away!

A11:23:18 <08Notch> you'll have to eat food later on as well

A11:26:15 <Quatroking> or this one: "As a Christian, we do not invent any gods because we Believe there is a God." that doesn't make any sense

A11:26:34 <liq3> At least without using bows.
A11:26:38 <08Notch> ok, I fixed the creeper craters
A11:26:39 <citricsquidoo> I got 2 mushrooms from 1 pig!

A11:34:47 <gear|work> thats going to be so epic
A11:34:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> skeletons have a low fire rate, so bob side to side long distance and shoot between invisibility, collecting arrows.  replace the health you lose with shrooms.  all other mobs are easy

A11:38:30 <08Notch> oh, wait, no, between 4 and 9
A11:38:33 <Quatroking> Make them with coal and some iron, and done

A11:38:44 <Quatroking> AWESOME

A11:39:22 <08Notch> the trees have the same spawn code as level generation, but with slightly smaller border boxes

A11:39:35 <08Notch> or, well, flower
A11:39:36 <Stargoat> does a tree need grass nearbye to grow or something?

A11:40:56 <ZomBuster> hey how do I get seeds now
A11:41:12 <Real> there should be a way to drop red mushrooms

A11:41:25 <liq3> wow. I can stand still and the skellies miss. -_-
A11:41:30 <Real> bc they take up inventory and you get hurt by eating them
A11:41:38 <gear|work> red mushrooms should damage you. but give you a temporary damage boost
A11:41:39 <08Notch> how much longer should arrows last?

A11:41:52 <08Notch> whoooaaa
A11:41:53 <citricsquid> How long is it now? 15 seconds sounds good
A11:41:53 <Real> 20-30 seconds

A11:41:56 <Wirtualnosc> 30 for round numbers :D

A11:42:06 <08Notch> it's one to potentially infinity now
A11:42:07 <liq3> Notch: Mmmm is it? How long do they last now?
A11:42:14 <Real> or make it dependent on # of nearby enemies, Notch

A11:42:38 <08Notch> any other small tweaks I should make?
A11:42:42 <08Notch> should skeletons shoot more arrows?
A11:42:43 <Stargoat> killed by zombies while I was trying to grow a garden on my house.
A11:42:46 <liq3> Notch: It's because there's like 5 skellies together... One will die and his arrows disappera before I can kill the others.
A11:42:57 <betasword> Skeletons shoot enough arrows as it is :P
A11:42:58 <Quatroking> Notch, did you fix the invincibility yet?

A11:43:44 <08Notch> Real: I agree it's slightly too far, yes, but it also feels pretty rewarding. :D
A11:43:44 <betasword> I have to second the call for increased arrow stay time, for the same reason as liq3.

A11:44:59 <betasword> Ah, ok. Just checking.
A11:45:01 <Evil-Ville> Melee range is way too massive
A11:45:02 <liq3> Snowman: Eh?
A11:45:17 <08Notch> do others agree melee range is foo far?
A11:45:23 <08Notch> it's the same as digging now
A11:45:23 <betasword> Very true. Infinite arrows may sound good, but gameplay-wise, aren't.
A11:45:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> sorta
A11:45:28 <ZomBuster> oh oh here is a bug
A11:45:32 <Real> yeah i think it is, Notch. both for the player and the enemies.
A11:45:32 <potato> hahaha, zombies and skeletons in the tombs
A11:45:32 <bobo> i agree that melee range is too much
A11:45:35 <liq3> Notch: I think digging range is too far. :P
A11:45:38 <ZomBuster> mobs get damaged by right-clicking!
A11:45:45 <bobo> digging and building range is fine
A11:45:46 <08Notch> liq3: It is, but it gets hard to play if its tighter..
A11:45:47 <Snowman> uhm... are the skeletons supposed to be spinning around crazy?
A11:45:53 <Real> i'm fine with the digging/building range though!!
A11:45:57 <08Notch> Snowman: haha, no
A11:45:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> you can hurt them through blocks
A11:46:10 <08Notch> still?
A11:46:11 <Evil-Ville> You should only be able to knock the enemies back if you have some kind of special weapon that allows it. Like a warhammer
A11:46:13 <Wirtualnosc> Notch, then maybe change digging time only in survival?

A11:46:45 <liq3> Evil-Ville: Warhammer could hit them back further (if we get them).

A11:47:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> i should try that
A11:47:10 <liq3> Evil-Ville: Omg I just remember the DF Warhammers... They hit things so far. ;]
A11:47:17 <Snowman> Creeper blew open a wall, flooding this cave withw ater
A11:47:27 <Snowman> made it to safety though
A11:47:38 <betasword> Suddenly, I want to homerun zombies across the map...
A11:47:43 <liq3> D: I just got ambushed by 3 zombies and died.
A11:47:48 <ZomBuster> agh
A11:47:49 <liq3> hahahaha i love this. :]
A11:47:56 <Evil-Ville> It would be really boring if there was only one type of weapon I think
A11:47:57 <Real> Notch: I think you might want to decrease the melee range for both the player and the enemies, as well as the fly-back distance when an enemy is hit. Both need only be decreased a bit, just so it looks slightly more natural. Think about pushing someone in real life and how far they fly back and when you know they're faking.
A11:47:59 <ZomBuster> those zombies home in from FAR

A11:48:54 <betasword> I love it, by the way.
A11:48:54 <LKA> zombies swimming the ocean at alarming rates
A11:48:56 <Real> ZomBuster: They're on steroids AND speed at the same time, so their senses are better and they move with the quickness.
A11:48:58 <Snowman> ooooh, load buttom
A11:49:01 <mdm> Okay.  Just finished playing Survivor Mode for past couple hours.  What a game.
A11:49:09 <Evil-Ville> I found creepers and skeletons infighting again
A11:49:11 <Snowman> on death I mean
A11:49:23 <08Notch> Real: I want people to be able to push mobs off cliffs
A11:49:32 <Wirtualnosc> Evil-Ville: Like in doom? ;p
A11:49:37 <Evil-Ville> Yeah
A11:49:41 <Real> Evil-Ville: I think certain enemies should be fighting each other, too.
A11:49:48 <potato> Notch: when you load a level it should plant some mushrooms
A11:49:48 <08Notch> they will, real. =D
A11:50:05 <08Notch> no, that'd defeat the point of loading a level. ;)

A11:50:09 <citricsquid> do trees give arrows yet?
A11:50:22 <Real> Notch: You can still push them off cliffs, you just have to be slightly more skilled. Or maybe hit them with an arrow to make them fly back farther?
A11:50:27 <liq3> Yeh a way to get arrows besides skellies would be nice.
A11:50:29 <betasword> So, if we're supposed to be able to push mobs off cliffs... How about eventually having the ability to just pick them up and toss them off? :P
A11:50:35 <bobo> i feel as though its less of a survival game and more like... zombie hunting
A11:50:41 <Quatroking> Notch: what is the current survival version?
A11:50:47 <potato> also notch, default mobs should turn into either zombies or skeletons
A11:50:57 <Snowman> wait, arrows are actual blocks now?
A11:50:59 <Wirtualnosc> lol
A11:51:03 <Real> bobo: Oh, it's survival. Walk around the map without clicking for awhile.
A11:51:09 <Parthon> Notch: you rock :D
A11:51:11 <Snowman> looks like it, judging from the texture file
A11:51:16 <Evil-Ville> lurkers make a real mess of my castle

A11:57:08 <08Notch> just uploaded a new index.jsp

A11:58:58 <betasword> One more thing about the random spawns: Perhaps make small groups spawn, instead of just singular mobs? That'd repopulate a lot faster.

Just have the flashing... Well, flash more, like it already does as they get to lower health. Maybe give it 10-15 seconds or so after the first hit.

P12:14:42 <liq3> Quatroking: I really don't care. :/
P12:14:48 <citricsquid> Notch: my favourite thread of the week.
P12:14:53 <ZomBuster> Zombies ? Inside MY fortress?
P12:15:02 <Shotz> Notch
P12:15:03 <liq3> You are ZOM[bie]Buster.
13P12:15:10 * asiekierka says his last words: "java.lang.NullPointerException" and dies
P12:15:20 <Shotz> I think mobs should be able to destory bricks
P12:15:23 <Shotz> :P
P12:15:27 <liq3> asiekierka: divide by zero by any chance?
13P12:15:28 * asiekierka says his last words v2: "I still have 0.24_03!!!" and dies, finally, i hope
P12:15:36 <Shotz> So if you build something, you have to build multiple walls to survive
P12:15:39 <liq3> hrm.
P12:15:44 <Shotz> Like, a row of walls.
P12:15:45 <liq3> Shotz: HRm?

P12:16:40 <08Notch> yeah, that's probably the limit

P12:16:58 <Wirtualnosc> or 8?
P12:16:58 <asiekierka> Notch: Well, let me guess
P12:16:58 <Vic> Custom Buddhist Invaders 
P12:17:01 <asiekierka> a) This wasn't intended
P12:17:05 <liq3> Notch: Do they disappear at all?

P12:17:35 <asiekierka> Notch: What's the answer?
P12:17:37 <asiekierka> a, b, c or d?
P12:17:46 <08Notch> a mix of them, I guess. =)
P12:17:51 <asiekierka> So is it d?
P12:17:53 <asiekierka> Well
P12:17:59 <asiekierka> a and b contradict each other in a way =(
P12:18:02 <asiekierka> But I'm sure it's b
P12:18:02 <08Notch> liq3: Far away from the player, for a long time, and hasn't gotten damaged or damaged anything in a while
P12:18:17 <liq3> Notch: Ok cool... how long is a long time?
P12:18:22 <Quatroking> back
P12:18:25 <08Notch> it's stochastic, so it's hard to say
P12:18:29 <08Notch> at least 30 seconds, or something
P12:18:34 <08Notch> then it can happen AT ANY TIME!!
P12:18:36 <Quatroking> I just shit a whole cow out of my ass
P12:18:40 <ChJees> o_O
P12:18:41 <liq3> Notch: Acck... That makes my plans for a mob arena impossible. :(
P12:18:47 <08Notch> I think the half-time is like 30 seconds as well, so the average is one minute, I guess
P12:18:52 <08Notch> yeah, it's temporary
P12:19:01 <Quatroking> half-time? HALF-LIFE?
P12:19:01 <Maulrus> notch will pausing work soon
P12:19:03 <08Notch> mobs get stuck too easy now
P12:19:08 <08Notch> *half-life!!
P12:19:13 <LG_Legacy> So whats new?
P12:19:23 <Quatroking> LG_legacy: laserhounds
P12:19:34 <LG_Legacy> Less sarcasm
P12:19:40 <liq3> Quatroking: Dogs that bark bees that shoot lasers with their eyes.
P12:19:48 <liq3> Erm, I meant that for LG_Legacy. >.>
P12:19:52 <LG_Legacy> I'm too lazy to look at his blog.
P12:19:56 <Quatroking> eh
P12:19:58 <Quatroking> this is weird
P12:20:11 <Quatroking> I just plugged out my USB stick but i can still access the files
P12:20:33 <08Notch> LG_Legacy: The game is generally more difficult now, and mobs respawn
P12:20:36 <08Notch> and you can save/load
P12:20:42 <LG_Legacy> I was being sarcastic
P12:20:52 <LG_Legacy> :P
P12:20:52 <Vic> hey notch, i have one thing to ask
P12:20:59 <Vic> how will death work in multi
P12:21:05 <08Notch> I'm not sure yet
P12:21:08 <08Notch> I want it to be severe
P12:21:11 <08Notch> we'll see what's fun
P12:21:21 <Vic> well
P12:21:21 <08Notch> permadeath probably will NOT be fun, unfortunately. I really want it
P12:21:23 <RRRRR> why do all the servers i try to play on come up with an error message
P12:21:27 <Vic> when we get crafting
P12:21:27 <offset> die, lose all your items, respawn timer
P12:21:44 <Vic> there could be some crafting skill thingie
P12:21:47 <Vic> that resets when you die
P12:21:58 <Jbell135> like 1 minute before respawn
P12:22:31 <08Notch> RRRRR: What error message?
P12:22:32 <RRRRR> "an error occured while loading this applet, please contact suport to resolve this issue, fatal error occured (7): com.mojang.minecraftapplet
P12:22:34 <08Notch> have you always gotten that?
P12:22:35 <Quatroking> hey citricsquid, http://www.uploadscreenshot.com/image/40984/5190931 (nsfw)
P12:22:42 <RRRRR> it just started today
P12:22:49 <liq3> Notch: Maybe 1-2 minute respawn time, and you lose all your itmes?
P12:22:50 <08Notch> have you played survival mode?
P12:22:55 <RRRRR> no
P12:22:59 <LG_Legacy> Dammit Notch!
P12:23:02 <08Notch> hum
P12:23:06 <08Notch> what?
P12:23:07 <LG_Legacy> Theres too many flowers, i do NOT feel terrified :<
P12:23:11 <08Notch> haha
P12:23:14 <Quatroking> I once put that as newgrounds avatar on an alt account and it got me banned instantly :D
P12:23:18 <08Notch> it's not meant to be a terrifying game :D
P12:23:22 <LG_Legacy> OH MY GOD A ZOM- Ooo look at the pretty flower..
P12:23:25 <Maulrus> i like permadeath actually
P12:23:26 <08Notch> but yeah, there are too many flowers
P12:23:32 <LG_Legacy> Suddenly
P12:23:36 <LG_Legacy> FLOWERS FUCKIGN EVERYWHERE
P12:23:38 <Maulrus> makes me feel a lot more attached to whatever shitty things i build
P12:23:38 <08Notch> haha
P12:23:43 <liq3> Maulrus: Permadeath in multi will be terrible...
P12:23:49 <LG_Legacy> Alas
P12:23:50 <LG_Legacy> Question
P12:23:57 <Maulrus> liq: oh god i can't imagine that
P12:24:01 <LG_Legacy> Will you be making different blocks deal more damage? Or faster mining?
P12:24:06 <Jbell135> needs to be like a 5 minute death or something
P12:24:11 <Maulrus> but at least for single player permadeath should work
P12:24:13 <Vic> 5
P12:24:14 <Maulrus> 5 minutes is pretty excessive
P12:24:15 <Vic> is too much
P12:24:17 <RRRRR> notch what should i do
P12:24:19 <Vic> siince
P12:24:20 <liq3> Maulrus: Permadeath in single is the only way to go. :]
P12:24:21 <Maulrus> maybe 1 at most
P12:24:21 <Vic> you can just
P12:24:23 <Vic> rejoin the server
P12:24:23 <Quatroking> oh hey, it now uses the player skin as hand?
P12:24:24 <Quatroking> sweet
P12:24:29 <liq3> maulrus: we can save it anyway, so it's not real perm.
P12:24:31 <Maulrus> you just lose all your items and respawn
P12:24:34 <Jbell135> ok lol 1 or 2
P12:24:39 <Maulrus> i know but you can do that with a lot of permadeath games
P12:24:42 <Evil-Ville> I recorded a new video but for some reason my irc client flickers on it every now and then
P12:24:52 <Evil-Ville> Should provide an artistic experience
P12:24:55 <Shotz> How do you shoot arrows?
P12:24:55 <Wirtualnosc> Respawn time should be changable in server options.
P12:25:02 <Jbell135> yeah
P12:25:04 <Maulrus> i would opt for no respawn time
P12:25:08 <Shotz> Anyone?
P12:25:09 <Maulrus> just lose all items
P12:25:09 <Shotz> D:
P12:25:14 <Maulrus> tab

P1:44:40 <Snowman> Hey people who are on the leaderboard, how about we scrap the old scores and continue with the 0.25 version
P1:44:49 <Mercyfire> Wow how do you change the colour to black =D
P1:44:50 <LG_Legacy> True this
P1:44:53 <Snowman>  because getting 50k is now like impossible
P1:44:54 <LG_Legacy> I approve of Snowmans
P1:45:10 <liq3> Snowman: Actually if you play smart it's easier, since mobs respawn...
P1:45:10 <LG_Legacy> Wait till creepers get faster
P1:45:14 <citricsquid> could easily get 50k on flatgrass
P1:45:26 <Snowman> Yeah but they hit hard and in teams
P1:45:47 <cockoman> where can i get survival mode?
P1:45:48 <Azjherben> Ah ha!
P1:45:51 <Azjherben> I got a great idea
P1:45:54 <liq3> cockoman: buy the game
P1:45:58 <cockoman> ah
P1:45:58 <Azjherben> I will now change the minecraft.jar

P1:46:12 <Azjherben> the dirt block
P1:46:20 <Azjherben> I'll make temporally transparent
P1:46:21 <Azjherben> BUT
P1:46:28 <Azjherben> it can't handle transparency correctly

P1:46:38 <Snowman> azjherben
P1:46:39 <Quatroking> Your engine is fucking awesome
P1:46:42 <Snowman> change terrain.png
P1:46:42 <Azjherben> So, I'll get x-ray visiona and see all the enemys before they see me!
P1:46:42 <LG_Legacy> Fun fact: Try turning all textures into something random.

P1:47:29 <Mercyfire> where do i get these files to edit?

P1:57:40 <geektoo> eventually the train fills up
P1:57:43 <Alwayswatching> Notch, would it be possible to add variables when generating a new map?

P2:51:14 <liq3> Phazorx: The point is it should be workin, but it's not.
P2:51:22 <liq3> Phazorx: so I have no real idea.
P2:51:25 <Phazorx> i realise that i can unpug from net and i will loose the internt and this nice chatroom
P2:51:35 <Phazorx> but nothing will chnage between server and client since theyboth on my pc
P2:51:51 <Phazorx> it has nothing to do with router or anything else external to this PC
P2:52:04 <Phazorx> so back to question - how can i generate the externalurl
P2:52:06 <Phazorx> so it has locla ip
P2:52:12 <liq3> You can't.
P2:52:17 <Phazorx> grrr
P2:52:18 <Phazorx> i can
P2:52:23 <Phazorx> server generates it
P2:52:24 <liq3> Oh, actually you probably can, but I don't know how.
P2:52:30 <Phazorx> based on data it has
P2:52:42 <liq3> Only way to find out is to decompile the server and check it's code, or find someone who already has (and hope they tell you).
P2:52:43 <Phazorx> currently it uses external IP
P2:52:49 <Phazorx> all i need to do is make sure it uses internal one
P2:53:06 <Phazorx> heh... nobody here ever tried running the server?
P2:53:21 <liq3> I think half the ppl have, and didn't have any problems. :p
P2:53:30 <ChJees> I made a fortress :P

P3:21:36 <Omfgbeans> i found a tiny cave with 60 mushrooms in earlier lol
P3:21:40 <LG_Legacy> Skeletons exploded on me
P3:21:49 <Omfgbeans> there was a mushroom on every block
P3:22:49 <r4dio> ..
P3:24:02 <LG_Legacy> The place was deserted.. I didn't have many resources, but my pixaxe... Strangely i see a pig at sea, i slaughtered it and to my suprised inside was mushrooms. What was i taking?
P3:24:16 <Mercyfire> Ah damnit i was killed
P3:24:24 <Snowman> You were taking mushrooms :D
P3:24:26 <LG_Legacy> I saved those for late..
P3:25:14 <LG_Legacy> How i got here, or where i am was beyond me..

P3:26:51 <Snowman> it just takes some getting used to
P3:26:57 <LG_Legacy> And landed into some sturcture or narrow hall..
P3:27:29 <LG_Legacy> Thee ceiling itself caved in on me, i had to act fast. I scurried across to an edge where lava afloated before me.
P3:27:42 <Griskard> Now if only pigs would breed or drop more mushys
P3:27:52 <liq3> they respawn
P3:27:54 <Snowman> HOMERUN!
P3:28:03 <Snowman> Knocked a creepers 3 blocks into a hole
P3:28:05 <LG_Legacy> I questioned myself why so many mushrooms were around..
P3:28:09 <Omfgbeans> Pig breeding, just push them into each other and out pops baby pig xD

P4:15:45 <Snowman> it's possible and easy
P4:15:49 <vede> Zuriki modified the sign.
P4:15:54 <Visiiri> But rather pointless, no?
P4:16:00 <Visiiri> ONE sign is avalible
P4:16:00 <Quatroking> casquall: 7zip
P4:16:02 <r4dio> yeah , he did..but how?
P4:16:04 <Visiiri> And it's in single player
P4:16:15 <vede> You change signs for theatrics.
P4:16:18 <r4dio> i modified the png file , but the game just displays the default one

P5:41:53 <Snowman> Then how can you give em?
P5:41:55 <Snowman> oooooh
P5:41:59 <Snowman> photoshops as in skins?
P5:42:01 <Iguana> LIES
P5:42:06 <vede> ...
P5:42:11 <vede> Like, screenie photoshops.
P5:42:15 <Iguana> Forum thread is up anyways
P5:42:17 <Iguana> In forum games
P5:42:19 <Iguana> I think?
P5:42:30 <Iguana> Vede...what if you fail in Photoshop...
P5:42:35 <Iguana> Or are too lazy to make it
P5:42:38 <vede> Then you don't get in the competition.
P5:42:42 <Iguana> BUT CAME UP WITH THE IDEA!
P5:42:45 <Iguana> *nudge
P5:42:47 <vede> Oh.
P5:42:56 <vede> I dunno.
P5:42:58 <Iguana> I suggested it like...a while ago.
P5:42:59 <Iguana> LOL
P5:43:10 <vede> We should get some mods in here to set it up, though.
P5:43:15 <Iguana> BLARG
P5:43:19 <Iguana> Dibs on judge then. :D
P5:43:27 <LG_Legacy> Damn i wanted judge
P5:43:36 <LG_Legacy> Hm..
P5:43:37 <vede> More than one judge might be best. >.>
P5:43:42 <LG_Legacy> Now i want the title 'The Judge'
P5:43:52 <Iguana> YA
P5:43:59 <Iguana> Threaten Mods? LOL
P5:44:03 <Snowman> FINE
P5:44:06 <Snowman> Ill go shop then
P5:44:12 <Iguana> We should have the 3 people who were originally here, as judges
P5:44:16 <aera> LG_Legacy: approve of what?
P5:44:24 <Iguana> I.e. - Snowman, Legacy, et moi. :D
P5:44:31 <LG_Legacy> Custom title for good +10 Photoshop stuff of Minecraft + Games
P5:44:32 <vede> Sounds coo.

P5:53:57 <Mikeh> Yes they do
P5:54:02 <potato> then in between waves you can repair your tower

P6:18:31 <Zuriki> I'm enlarging it by x2

P6:18:35 <potato> the lava at the bottom of the map isnt affected by water
P6:18:52 <Zuriki> BAD
P6:18:54 <Zuriki> It's BAD
P6:19:00 <Dropshock> I like how most of the time monsters travel around in little packs, especially when its creepers. If you do it right you can get them all to explode at once.
P6:19:04 <vede> I believe Notch should allow people to save the map in MP.
P6:19:15 <vede> Instead of us having to use alt clients.

P7:07:29 <Hunter712> Wait, what's WoM?
P7:07:31 <Kratospie> the reason why i dont like hacks are cus hackers can get mad....
P7:07:33 <Zuriki> MUST READ

P7:07:40 <Kratospie> hacker-grifers are the worst
P7:07:46 <Snowman> Alex, where should I set the spawn?
P7:08:15 <AlexVMiner> just below the sky platform
P7:08:23 <AlexVMiner> i use hacks
P7:08:24 <AlexVMiner> :O
P7:08:25 <vede> Yeah, but it didn't work.
P7:08:39 <vede> It resulted in some weird crazy-ass shit, so it was removed.
P7:08:47 <AlexVMiner> yeah
P7:08:51 <Kratospie> I dont like hacks, just like i dont like WoM
P7:09:11 <AlexVMiner> didn't it grief the server?
P7:09:16 <AlexVMiner> or was that loading a map?
P7:09:18 <Animator> Hacks vary on those who use it.
P7:09:27 <SMP> lol
P7:09:47 <AlexVMiner> like me!
P7:09:47 <AlexVMiner> :D
P7:09:50 <Animator> I use flyhack ad runhack to get places I couldn't get just by walking.
P7:09:55 <Kratospie> Grifers, or people with short tempers, who have hacks, can ruin a server
P7:10:00 <Animator> But there are others...
P7:10:02 <AlexVMiner> yeah
P7:10:05 <Snowman> No alex, you're just called Vary

P7:11:25 <Animator> I once moderated a normal server, public.
P7:11:38 <Animator> 3 grief attacks came in at the same day, with hackers.
P7:11:45 <Animator> Of all types and backgrounds.
P7:11:56 <Animator> Got to a point where it became private.
P7:12:06 <Kratospie> on my first day, we had around 14 diffrent griffers banned

P7:13:18 <Kratospie> my server is private now, and if it goes public, every person is followed
P7:13:28 <Animator> Nowadays I take care of The Archives. Griefer activity is low there.
11P7:13:31 <DBN> notch could add a feature so that only people on an access list could modify stuff in the server

P7:15:29 <Hunter2458> I've seen them blow up adminium
P7:15:32 <Animator> An admin muted me because he thought I wasn't going to use correct grammar.

P8:38:08 <vede> haha!
P8:38:13 <fleshBasedProcessor> Fighting skeletons is so much fun. Once I was climbing out of my mine and was attacked by a horde of skeletons and almost got knocked down to the bottom of my mine. Fucking epic
P8:38:13 <Nalok> Once we get weapons we cam make a giant RP land in SP
P8:38:20 <vede> Skeleton and a zombie just got into a crazy fist fight under a tree.

P8:38:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> Haven't seen any infighting yet
P8:38:46 <Parthon> Zuriki: how did you do that?
P8:39:04 <Hunter2458> Best way to get infighting on epic scales, bring creepers to skeletons.
P8:39:06 <Igggyyy> HAX0RZ?!
P8:39:20 <Hunter2458> They usually hit eachother with arrows.

P9:02:19 <Super-Dot> Rather than gain
P9:02:23 <vede> I survive the fall.
P9:02:26 <Nalok> I like pigs but that's cruel
P9:02:29 <GeneralGuy> but they give food
P9:02:33 <vede> I figure any minute now, they're gonna come in the cliff with me.
P9:02:46 <Super-Dot> So there's a tradeoff between food and points
P9:02:48 <vede> But they don't, so I go out to see what's going on, from the side.
P9:02:51 <GeneralGuy> I miss infinite arrows =(
P9:03:10 <vede> Turns out, in the time I spent in the big hole, most of the skeletons had died.
P9:03:14 <vede> From loneliness.
P9:03:19 <GeneralGuy> well what about mushrooms
P9:03:24 <vede> Since they had scattered a bit when I started fighting them.
P9:03:27 <Hunter2458> Notch should allow you to choose Old (Easy) and New (Hard) versions to play.
P9:03:28 <Super-Dot> Dying from loneliness is unfortunate
P9:03:50 <GeneralGuy> how about eating red mushrooms gives you more points!
P9:03:52 <vede> Even Notch said "And now enemies will die when they're not around other enemies. From... loneliness.. or something."
P9:04:03 <Hunter2458> He doesn't even know why they die XD
P9:04:09 <Kratospie> lol
P9:04:11 <GeneralGuy> starvations
P9:04:11 <Hunter2458> He should just tell us the technical aspect
P9:04:17 <geekahedron> so ... you'll only ever find armies of enemies?
P9:04:23 <GeneralGuy> or they were so lonely
P9:04:24 <Kratospie> yes
P9:04:24 <geekahedron> lovely
P9:04:28 <Hunter2458> "WHen the value of enemies near the unit is less than 1 then mob takes damage over time"
P9:04:28 <GeneralGuy> they became emo 
P9:04:34 <GeneralGuy> and killed themselves
P9:04:41 <Hunter2458> 0-0
P9:04:44 <Hunter2458> No, it's swine flu
P9:04:58 <geekahedron> aw
P9:05:02 <GeneralGuy> but why must the pigs die!
P9:05:07 <Kratospie> Curse you Swine Flu and your emo ways!
P9:05:15 <geekahedron> that means my fun little trap dungeons will fail
P9:05:17 <GeneralGuy> I had two pigs in a pen
P9:05:19 <Nalok> God, reading that kid's post maeks mi reterteddedurrrr
P9:05:22 <GeneralGuy> and they both died
P9:05:25 <geekahedron> unless several enemies get trapped at once
P9:05:32 <Hunter2458> The best way to combat swine flu is to spread it around.
P9:05:45 <Hunter2458> It'll kill you by yourself XD
P9:05:59 <GeneralGuy> best way to combat swine flu is with FIRE!
P9:06:09 <Hunter2458> I thought that was furries.
P9:06:12 <Kratospie> If all else fails use fire
P9:06:18 <Super-Dot> I wish creepersplosions worked properly on custom levels
P9:06:30 <Super-Dot> I want this city to get deformed
P9:06:54 <Hunter2458> And creepersplosions shouldn't break admin blocks nor yield admin blocks.
P9:07:08 <Super-Dot> They yield admin blocks? :O
P9:07:10 <Kratospie> I wish there were lightblocks
P9:07:33 <Eagle> http://img2.imageshack.us/img2/2117/skullg.png <- Guys, does this look okay? I'm practicing my spriting. :P
P9:07:55 <vede> That looks really good.
P9:07:55 <Hunter2458> Yeah, if you blow up a creeper near admin blocks you can get admin blocks D:
P9:08:12 <Hunter2458> That looks pretty good Eagle
P9:08:12 <vede> You can get admin blocks by mining them as well.
P9:08:16 <vede> Just takes hella long.
P9:08:47 <Hunter2458> In fact, the far right one could even pass for a modern 3d game I'd say.
P9:09:09 <Eagle> :D
P9:09:09 <Super-Dot> I just blew up a bunch of creepers near admin blocks and got no admin blocks
P9:09:42 <Super-Dot> Oh wait, I guess it would be different if they're the ground beneath me
P9:10:21 <Nalok> Could you upload an omen map and use it as a survival map?
P9:10:40 <Nalok> Or is that unpossible?
P9:10:47 <Hunter2458> Uh...
P9:10:52 <Eagle> You'd have to use that hack that saves multiplayer maps.

P9:19:45 <Hunter712> We should be given some spawn options, like how many of what kind of enemies you want spawned, and how fast you want them to spawn
P9:19:53 <Hunter2458> :D

P9:20:05 <Hunter712> That'd be nice.

P9:38:48 <Shawnachu> We need snakes

P9:38:54 <Hunter2458> Which sort of custom mob skins?

P9:41:10 <Hunter2458> I'm a hunter of peace.
P9:41:14 <princepsregulus> *or humans
P9:41:15 <Hunter2458> I try talking to creepers...
P9:41:21 <Hunter2458> It never works...
P9:41:24 <princepsregulus> I am a human hunter
P9:41:41 <Hunter2458> We need a new block of uranium.
P9:41:43 <vede> Super-Dot, so because it's possible to uglify the world, we should not allow people to prettify the world?
P9:41:46 <PuyoDead> here ya go http://www.impawards.com/1978/posters/deer_hunter.jpg
P9:41:49 <vede> Or make different themes?
P9:41:56 <princepsregulus> I really want multiplayer survival mode
P9:41:56 <Hunter712> We need magnesium blocks
P9:42:00 <Hunter712> That esplode

P9:42:22 <Hunter2458> more like http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/video_game_movies_4.jpg
P9:42:24 <vede> I mean, people can plaster their skin with penises if they like.
P9:42:25 <Parthon> or sodium blocks
P9:42:28 <princepsregulus> I have some (I think) good ideas for it
P9:42:39 <Shawnachu> Sodium blocks you can drop in water
P9:42:43 <Shawnachu> :D
P9:42:49 <Hunter2458> I want mini pet creepers.
P9:42:57 <Hunter2458> That I can send out to asplode at will
P9:43:11 <princepsregulus> Suicide bomber pets?
P9:43:15 <Super-Dot> I like the idea of prettifying the world, but I think more people would just abuse them to pretend they have sub-block detail
P9:43:22 <Hunter2458> Like pikmin, but with creepers and explosions.
P9:43:25 <princepsregulus> Might that be sending the wrong message?
P9:43:45 <Hunter712> I was thinking enemies should have variations, like a normal one, a brute that is medium sized, and a gargantua that is huge
P9:43:47 <Hunter2458> "Oh no my creeper was eate-BOOM"
P9:43:50 <Hunter712> That would be pretty k
P9:44:05 <vede> Who would seriously run a server with penises and crap for textures?

P9:45:30 <Super-Dot> Custom blocks are like theming MySpace pages! That's probably a better comparison
P9:45:31 <vede> Yeah.
P9:45:39 <princepsregulus> Each person loads them themselves
P9:45:59 <princepsregulus> So you can't have server-specific textures

P10:25:30 <vede> It seems like the skeletons are, like, soldiers are something.
P10:25:39 <vede> Since they spawn in squads and have ranged weapons.

P10:25:51 <gordenfreechmen> an exploding enemy, one that can kill you from across the field, a standard melee, and a weak one that heals you
P10:25:52 <Sep> i put that in but it didnt say name was illegal

P10:26:17 <gordenfreechmen> well...yeah
P10:26:24 <gordenfreechmen> somehow it killed a zombie with in-fighting

P10:26:34 <vede>  O_o
P10:26:47 <Sep> so am i on my internet server or a singleplayer one
P10:26:47 <gordenfreechmen> its fun getting so close to skeletons that they shoot each other
P10:27:03 <vede> We have a good arsenal, but we still should have lots more enemies.
P10:27:16 <vede> Things that affect the environment.
P10:27:20 <vede> Sandworms!
P10:27:25 <vede> WE NEED SANDWORMS.
P10:27:30 <potato> oh hell yes
P10:27:41 <potato> sandworm would be a great bos enemy
P10:27:43 <vede> (Or... just big worms that can tunnel through the ground would be good.
P10:27:46 <vede> )
P10:27:56 <vede> Not necessarily SANDworms.
P10:28:28 <potato> desertmap generator
P10:28:31 <potato> with sandorms
P10:28:47 <vede> We also need flying enemies.
P10:28:55 <vede> That can swoop down as a flock and attack.
P10:29:10 <vede> Or a flying enemy that can pick you up and drop you.
P10:29:18 <Hunter2458> We need ally mobs or multiplayer before we make the game even harder D:
P10:29:29 <Hunter2458> And a goal, goals are good too.
P10:29:31 <vede> Not really, Hunter2458.
P10:29:37 <potato> mo hirelings
P10:29:40 <potato> mob*
P10:29:43 <vede> No need for allies.
P10:29:59 <Hunter2458> We're overwhelmed by enemies already.
P10:30:01 <gordenfreechmen> taser + zombie = ally
P10:30:03 <vede> Uh...
P10:30:03 <Kratospie> i like the sandbox mode personaly
P10:30:05 <Hunter2458> We need something to draw them away.
P10:30:06 <vede> No we're not.
P10:30:20 <vede> Survival mode is actually pretty easy still.
P10:30:27 <vede> Just the beginning is hard.
P10:30:31 <Hunter2458> Yeah.
P10:30:36 <gordenfreechmen> they respawn too fast

P10:30:53 <Hunter2458> They do respawn too fast and in higher numbers and too close.
P10:30:59 <vede> And enemies don't "respawn".
P10:31:01 <gordenfreechmen> so I ended up making like, a 50 block deep hole
P10:31:02 <vede> They just spawn.
P10:31:06 <vede> In random locations.
P10:31:20 <vede> In packs.
P10:31:23 <gordenfreechmen> I had a creeper who kept respawning in the same place
P10:31:24 <gordenfreechmen> :/
P10:31:26 <Hunter2458> It all depends on where you go and how you handle it.
P10:31:38 <Darkebrz> Wow
P10:31:53 <Darkebrz> Notch must have made around $25000 for minecraft so far
P10:31:56 <vede> Although currently enemies are able to spawn NEAR you, and even in your field of vision.
P10:31:56 <gordenfreechmen> I love how monsters fight each other
P10:32:01 <Darkebrz> And thats only in 4 months!
P10:32:26 <Darkebrz> Of course, he made a lot more than $25000 from MC
P10:32:36 <vede> Actually, he made a lot less.

P10:32:51 <Darkebrz> Ouch, really?

P11:04:18 <Sep> i did that
P11:04:23 <Sep> wait
P11:04:29 <Sep> if i have it as false
P11:04:44 <Sep> then that url should work right
P11:04:58 <Sep> ?
P11:06:01 <TheOne> yes
P11:06:29 <Eagle> I can't decide if I want to play Fallout 3 or Mother 3
P11:06:40 <Eagle> I must be spoiled or something
P11:06:42 <Sep> it let me on the server but is it online or is it just a local server
P11:09:05 <vede> Don't play Fallout 3.
P11:09:50 <TheOne> whats the name?
P11:09:50 <chaos95> play Fallout 3
P11:10:26 <vede> Also, I have an idea regarding this crazy anti-grief debate. Permissions, of a sort, but not quite the same as usual. Basically, when a player joins, they are assigned one block (a color block) which they can build and remove.
P11:10:49 <vede> That's all they can affect, so they can build whatever they want, wherever they want, but only in that color.
P11:10:59 <Navt> if
P11:11:10 <vede> So if they start building, an op can grant them access to all blocks.
P11:11:31 <vede> No change to level size.
P11:11:35 <vede> And easily undone.
P11:12:52 <vede> The only major problem is that normal players would have to avoid building in the predetermined colors.
P11:13:34 <vede> A server could also have a script by which whenever a NEW player joins, the server selects an op and sends the op a message telling them to monitor that person.
P11:14:10 <vede> So there's no confusion as to who's following who.
P11:14:29 <vede> And everything's easy to understand.
P11:14:36 <Daidoji> this is why public servers are gay
P11:14:48 <vede> I like public servers.
P11:15:17 <vede> I think that you should be able to both allow people you don't know into your server, and not have too much griefing.
P11:17:04 <Daidoji> I think having build zones would be better
P11:17:24 <vede> I don't like the idea of build zones.
P11:17:33 <vede> It's like, you can grief, but in THAT area.
P11:18:18 <vede> And chances are they'd run out of room too quickly.

P11:21:24 <vede> I like that idea a lot.
P11:21:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P11:21:34 <Daidoji> you plop a deed down to claim an area
P11:21:44 <Daidoji> and no one can fuck with that shit unless that player is on the permission list
P11:22:07 <Daidoji> admins could grant deeds to players or whatever. or however you can set that up.
P11:22:11 <vede> Might need some big maps if anyone wants to not be stuck with a measly 20-block plot.
P11:23:06 <Daidoji> well if notch ever impliments streaming terrain
P11:23:20 <Daidoji> then we could have stupidly huge maps
P11:23:33 <vede> Hm. Troo.
P11:24:15 <vede> Prolly be a major bandwidth killer, though.
P11:25:31 <Azjherben> Yes!

P11:25:41 <Azjherben> I'm done
P11:25:41 <Daidoji> the map could be broken up like that
P11:26:18 <vede> Another thing I think would be good would be to make the game render distant terrain differently than closer terrain.
P11:26:21 <Azjherben> The map is already broken into 16*16*16 sectors.
P11:26:49 <Azjherben> Use those to start.
P11:26:51 <vede> So farther away, instead of exact blocks, you'd see bigger, blockier, approximations of areas.
10P11:26:59 * Chemo (a@ool-4574c3be.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
P11:27:00 <Daidoji> yeah it could be done
P11:27:26 <vede> Streaming terrain could be done pretty easily, actually, yeah.
P11:27:29 <Daidoji> notch could simply meld distant blocks
P11:27:31 <Azjherben> Okay, one sad thing is
P11:27:35 <vede> Maybe a bit harder on the server, but meh.
P11:27:38 <Azjherben> I just made an animatable image format
P11:27:52 <Azjherben> but I don't know where to find a program that can animate gifs or pngs

P11:28:04 <Daidoji> and then you'd have a block wall of 200 bricks just be a single poly

P11:28:07 <vede> pngs aren't animatable.
P11:28:08 <Daidoji> since it's flat anyway
P11:28:12 <vede> Only "apng"s are.
P11:28:44 <vede> Daidoji, that'd be two polys. Takes to triangles to make a rectangular wall.
P11:28:46 <vede> *two
P11:28:53 <Daidoji> well face. whatever
P11:28:56 <vede> (But I'm just being technical.)

P11:29:51 <vede> Turning 16^3 sections into big blocks textured like what their dominant block is, if it's REALLY far away.
P11:30:01 <Azjherben> Um
P11:30:04 <vede> Maybe going to just 8^3 or 4^3 at shorter distances.
P11:30:06 <Azjherben> That would be bad
P11:30:09 <Azjherben> Because no where
P11:30:16 <Azjherben> Can you go in a normal map
P11:30:24 <Azjherben> nay, any map that can be hosted
P11:30:43 <vede> That makes no sense at all...
P11:30:47 <Azjherben> Where such a low level of detail / or of distence could ever be found.
P11:30:48 <vede> You're being incoherent.
P11:30:57 <Azjherben> brb
P11:31:01 <vede> Ah, that makes more sense.
P11:31:04 <Daidoji> just look at wurm
P11:31:16 <Daidoji> it does that more or less
P11:31:20 <vede> Yeah, I agree, that's why I suggested that it be only for EXTREMELY far away blocks.
P11:31:21 <Azjherben> I looked it up
P11:31:27 <Azjherben> But vede
P11:31:41 <Azjherben> I just said, you'll never find a use for it
P11:31:56 <vede> Um, yeah you would.
P11:32:03 <vede> Would make the maps run far faster.
P11:32:06 <Azjherben> 256^3 blocks away, still would have to be more detailed
P11:32:08 <vede> For people that needed it.
P11:32:21 <Azjherben> Sigh, you'd have to be thousands of blocks away
P11:32:23 <Daidoji> 256 is hella far
P11:32:28 <Azjherben> Not really...
P11:32:34 <Daidoji> for lod it is
P11:32:36 <Azjherben> lod?
P11:32:41 <Daidoji> level of detail

P11:32:46 <vede> At 256, even the farthest fog level starts to be seen.
P11:32:53 <Azjherben> I know
P11:32:55 <Azjherben> but just barly
P11:32:58 <Azjherben> like at the edges
P11:33:13 <Daidoji> anyway, you can stream the map with the fog distance
P11:33:14 <vede> And even then, we're discussing how to handle "stupidly large" maps.
P11:33:18 <Daidoji> problem solved
P11:33:24 <Azjherben> Exactly vede
P11:33:48 <vede> So with the approximations, people would at least be able to see basic structures in the distance.
P11:33:56 <Azjherben> I'm telling you, your suggestion of one tex per 16^3 would olny be used on crazy big maps
P11:34:11 <vede> You think I'm stupid or something?
P11:34:15 <Azjherben> Where I'd have normal view on anyway (usually short actually_
P11:34:43 <Azjherben> No I don't, just pointing somthing out.
P11:34:45 <vede> The approximations would allow people to not have to be so limited visually, but still run the game well.
P11:35:05 <Daidoji> the view distance is fine as-is though
P11:35:07 <Azjherben> Hmm, I suppose I wouldn;'t have short/normal view on if it was less detailed
P11:35:16 <Daidoji> I mean sure more could be nice
P11:35:16 <Azjherben> so maybe it would get used
P11:35:29 <Daidoji> I mean have you guys played on 512x512 maps
P11:35:36 <vede> I have.
P11:35:37 <Azjherben> I once had a 
P11:35:42 <Azjherben> 32*32*512 map
P11:35:45 <Azjherben> 512 tall
P11:36:13 <Azjherben> I made it 64*64*512 without problems
P11:36:14 <Daidoji> highest I can load without running out of memory is 512x512x128. that is hosting and joining myself though.
P11:36:20 <Azjherben> But
P11:36:31 <Azjherben> Theres a little bug, or false cheat detection
P11:36:37 <vede> I mean, almost no other game lets you decrease the fog such that you can barely see a few meters in front of you, and if it does, that's definitely not the primary way to improve performance.
P11:36:51 <Azjherben> With the kreepers
P11:36:57 <vede> usually, it just decreases detail with distance.
P11:37:09 <vede> *they just decrease
P11:37:10 <Azjherben> I get a much worse fps than I did before
P11:37:17 <Daidoji> well yeah notch hasn't even added his occlusion thing to the main game yet
P11:37:26 <Daidoji> which will boost it quite a bit
P11:37:40 <Azjherben> So, maybe you kould suggest dekresing with distanse to notch.
P11:37:45 <vede> He said he made it so long strips of blocks are rendered as one big face.
P11:37:47 <Daidoji> right now it's rendering everything so it's gonna be slow on huge maps
P11:38:14 <vede> But it seems like calculating which blocks to do that with will generate more overhead than just rendering them normally.
P11:38:27 <Azjherben> Yeah, so, when's notch going away?
P11:38:35 <vede> This week.
P11:38:42 <vede> No more updates for THREE WHOLE WEEKS.
P11:38:45 <vede>  :'(
P11:38:55 <Azjherben> This was my first update

P11:39:06 <Daidoji> http://ilm.johnnythemidget.com/image/wurm/bb_expressway.jpg
P11:39:11 <Daidoji> well that's how he did it in wurm
P11:39:18 <vede> In the early days, Notch was, like, some kind of beast.
P11:39:20 <Daidoji> it's alright really (yes wurm is ugly)
P11:39:27 <Azjherben> I gtg
P11:39:36 <Azjherben> See ya people later...

P11:40:08 <vede> Yeh, wurm is hella ugly..
P11:40:15 <gordenfreechmen> what is wurm
P11:40:27 <Daidoji> I'd rather see trees like wurm in minecraft though
P11:40:29 <gordenfreechmen> I heard about it but...
P11:40:35 <Daidoji> maybe they could be more cartoony
P11:40:47 <Daidoji> but I mean trees are that are a model instead of a bunch of blocks
P11:41:10 <gordenfreechmen> im with you there
P11:41:14 <vede> I think everything should be blocks in Minecraft.
P11:41:20 <Daidoji> meh
P11:41:22 <mib_t2k2w9> And where'd all the dead things come from? Is there a secret necromancer? D:
P11:41:41 <vede> Nah, that's just Notch testing crap.
P11:41:45 <Daidoji> actually I'd prefer just the terrain be blocks
P11:42:05 <vede> He's had a zombie from day one, and he made a skeleton to show what he could do with his new alpha-texture system.
P11:42:12 <Darkebrz> Damn
P11:42:18 <Darkebrz> Survival is getting boring again D:
P11:42:27 <vede> Darkebrz, yeah.
P11:42:32 <mib_t2k2w9> Multiplayer will be so awesome, though.
P11:42:46 <Darkebrz> In a month
P11:42:53 <mib_t2k2w9> Pessimism.
P11:42:59 <vede> Not pessimism.
P11:43:07 <vede> If anything, that's optimism.
P11:43:16 <Daidoji> http://ilm.johnnythemidget.com/image/wurm/bearback_mountain_east_of_dongel.jpg
P11:43:18 <vede> There will be no updates at all for over three weeks.
P11:43:23 <Daidoji> that tower took us 2 weeks to make
P11:43:32 <Daidoji> and there were 20 people working on it.
P11:43:47 <vede> And then after that, Notch will need to recuperate, and then it'll still prolly take a while to get a good MP Survival system working.
P11:44:11 <mib_t2k2w9> So think about how cool it will be, not how long it will take. It'll be done before you know it.
P11:44:19 <vede> Not really.
P11:44:36 <vede> It'll take FOREVER to be done.
P11:44:48 <Visiiri> Notch should clone himself.
P11:44:49 <Darkebrz> ..That is wurm?
P11:44:52 <mib_t2k2w9> Haha, okay man. Enjoy the wait.
P11:44:53 <Daidoji> yes
P11:44:57 <vede> We'll all be bored of Survival, bored of Sandbox, pining for the glory days.

P11:47:46 <mib_t2k2w9> Vede definitely isn't.
P11:48:00 <vede> We were talking about how Survival MP will be quite a while down the road from right now.
P11:48:13 <Daidoji> Imagine four balls on the edge of a cliff. 
P11:48:16 <vede> And this mibbit-user says that time goes faster or slower if someone cares.
P11:48:21 <Daidoji> Say a direct copy of the ball nearest the cliff is sent to the back of the line of balls and takes the place of
P11:48:21 <Daidoji> the first ball. 
P11:48:37 <Daidoji> The formerly first ball becomes the second, the second becomes the third, and the fourth falls off the cliff.
P11:48:45 <Daidoji> Time works the same way.
P11:48:51 <vede> Uh...
P11:48:54 <vede> No...
P11:49:12 <vede> Time is the movement of particles.
P11:49:23 <vede> EVERYTHING is based on particles moving.
P11:49:26 <mib_t2k2w9> Time didn't exist before we said it did.
P11:49:29 <fleshBasedProcessor> I'm up to 30000 points!

P11:49:37 <vede> Yes it did, mibbit-user.
P11:49:42 <Visiiri> It's not visible, it's not tasteable
P11:49:49 <Visiiri> Realtiy can't recognize it.
P11:49:50 <vede> Time as a force did exist.
P11:49:55 <vede> The same way gravity did.
P11:49:56 <TheOne> Mail2345 did you say you got restore working?
P11:50:00 <PuyoDead> it's not "time", it's duration

P11:50:30 <TheOne> cool
P11:50:32 <mib_t2k2w9> So my reality could go fast, while yours goes slowly.
P11:50:37 <vede> TIME has no effect on reality, reality affects TIME.
P11:50:37 <Visiiri> yes.
P11:50:47 <vede> Because TIME is simply an extension of reality.
P11:50:53 <vede> And there is only one reality.
P11:51:00 <mib_t2k2w9> Survival will come at the same time for everyone. I'm just saying I won't be waiting as long.
P11:51:04 <vede> We just experience it from different perspectives.
P11:51:11 <Visiiri> Does measuring in meters rather than feet change the distance?

P11:54:42 <PuyoDead> mibbit user here is talking philosophy, that has no purpose here
P11:54:43 <vede> It's provable by the fact that time is constant.

P11:57:29 <vede> There is reality.
P11:57:31 <Visiiri> Therefor, there are no constants.
P11:57:32 <Visiiri> Ok
P11:57:35 <vede> Even if we don't see it correctly.
P11:57:36 <Visiiri> Vede, you've been there?
P11:57:39 <Visiiri> What is it like?
10P11:57:42 * mail2345 is now known as mail2345|afk
P11:57:43 <mib_t2k2w9> Yes, and so if I perceive time to pass quickly, it does.
P11:57:44 <vede> Dunno.
P11:57:50 <Visiiri> Yeah
P11:57:51 <Visiiri> xP
P11:57:56 <Visiiri> I like philosiphy
P11:58:05 <PuyoDead> troll is successful.
P11:58:10 <Visiiri> Who is troll?
P11:58:12 <mib_t2k2w9> I've been agreeing with you all this time, visiiri.
P11:58:14 <mib_t2k2w9> And it's me.
P11:58:16 <Visiiri> xP
P11:58:18 <Visiiri> It's you who?
P11:58:21 <vede> There is only one reality.
P11:58:24 <vede> That's the world.
P11:58:27 <vede> Particles.
P11:58:28 <mib_t2k2w9> I turned the conversation on it's head, with the help of Vede.
P11:58:41 <Visiiri> uhhh..?
P11:58:46 <mib_t2k2w9> But I have a huge and undeniable point.
P11:58:56 <vede> No, you have an easily deniable point.
P11:59:01 <PuyoDead> I tried to right it, but troll's power was too great
P11:59:06 <Visiiri> There is no way to measure time
P11:59:13 <Visiiri> Time can go fast and slow
P11:59:18 <mib_t2k2w9> Exactly.
P11:59:19 <Visiiri> It depends on who percieves it.
P11:59:22 <vede> You're saying that time FACTUALLY goes FASTER when you simply THINK it does.
P11:59:22 <mib_t2k2w9> Yes!
P11:59:27 <vede> And time can be measured.
P11:59:31 <Visiiri> Right now, time is edging along because i'm fucking hungry
P11:59:36 <Visiiri> and I'm to l azy to eat
P11:59:41 <Visiiri> Vede, yes
P11:59:42 <vede> Time is moving at the same pace, all the time.
