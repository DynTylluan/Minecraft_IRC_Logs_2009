A4:44:01 <mib_7ihq9l> could somebody please tell me WTF is up with the swastiaks? why are they on every server, and sometimes protected?
A4:44:57 <m0bus> laterz
A4:45:10 <m0bus> people love the white powers
A4:45:27 <m0bus> i think everyone in the world should be pretty desensitized to them by NOW
A4:45:30 <Quatroking> What's wrong with swastika's?
A4:45:37 <mib_7ihq9l> has the internet gotten +20 stupid without me noticing?!
A4:45:46 <mib_7ihq9l> is it just 12 year old kids running around these servers?
A4:45:51 <m0bus> they were pretty offensive like...60 years ago
A4:45:58 <m0bus> its MOSTLY 12 year olds
A4:45:58 <Quatroking> There's nothing wrong with a swastika, honestly.
A4:46:00 <mib_7ihq9l> what's the point, unless you're trying to piss people off?
A4:46:07 <m0bus> it works right?
A4:46:13 <mib_7ihq9l> yes, and that makes you a dick.
A4:46:17 <m0bus> :P
A4:46:20 <m0bus> i dont make them
A4:46:24 <Quatroking> Well it certainly pisses you off
A4:46:33 <m0bus> i just say that people will always find ways to piss off other people
A4:46:40 <m0bus> and it works
A4:46:51 <mib_7ihq9l> i understand griefing, but EVERY server? is it some meme I'm not aware of?
A4:47:05 <m0bus> i said it earlier
A4:47:09 <Ylle> Lots of people are jerks, they're just afraid irl.
A4:47:09 <m0bus> no matter what you do
A4:47:14 <m0bus> no matter who you are
A4:47:19 <m0bus> no matter where you live
A4:47:26 <Ylle> And hell, if you're going to see something written on the wall on a bathroom stall
A4:47:27 <m0bus> you will run into griefers in all walks of life
A4:47:31 <Ylle> its gon' be a swastika
A4:47:35 <m0bus> it could be a mailman or your boss
A4:47:36 <Ylle> or a failed swastika
A4:47:46 <Quatroking> I've even seen goddamn hammer and sickles :P
A4:47:47 <m0bus> you will always find griefers in this world
A4:47:52 <m0bus> just get used to it man
A4:48:03 <mib_7ihq9l> these aren't griefers. they're systematic griefers.
A4:48:03 <m0bus> dont let things irk you so much
A4:48:09 <m0bus> :P
A4:48:11 <m0bus> lol
A4:48:15 <mib_7ihq9l> the swastikas don't irk me, just the people whose sole purpose is to piss people off.
A4:48:23 <mib_7ihq9l> they can GTFO my internets, plz.
A4:48:33 <m0bus> well they might not get far in life, who knows
A4:48:46 <Quatroking> I like to troll around once in a while on Newgrounds, and that's just to piss people off and get hilarious comments back
A4:48:49 <m0bus> the internet was designed for griefers
A4:49:07 <m0bus> by a griefer
A4:49:18 <Quatroking> Once people understand I'm doing it for the comments, they mostly see the fun in the comments too
A4:49:49 <m0bus> :P
A4:50:04 <m0bus> the trolling griefer...classic
A4:50:10 <m0bus> bothers some people
A4:50:13 <m0bus> no big deal 
A4:50:26 <Quatroking> remembers me of a Hanky guy a few days ago
A4:50:26 <m0bus> i get a kick out of seeing someone grief
A4:50:29 <Quatroking> he came on the IRC
A4:50:44 <m0bus> griefer?

A5:11:20 <Quatroking> the master list doesn't know which of the comptuers is sending the server signal you see
A5:11:30 <Quatroking> that's why we got port forwarding
A5:11:41 <Quatroking> so anyways, launch up that cmd.exe
A5:12:04 <Quatroking> got that open?
A5:12:10 <Turtleboats> yep

A5:12:30 <Quatroking> ipconfig
A5:12:40 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:12:45 <Quatroking> it should throw out a bunch of stuff
A5:12:51 <Turtleboats> yepp
A5:13:06 <Quatroking> you see the ip adresses?
A5:13:18 <Turtleboats> yeah think so
A5:13:24 <Turtleboats> at the top of the list thing right?
A5:13:27 <Quatroking> the ones we need are your ipv4 adres/local ip and your gateway adress
A5:13:29 <Turtleboats> there are like 3
A5:13:30 <Quatroking> Yeah
A5:13:54 <Turtleboats> yeah gotem

A5:15:20 <Quatroking> does it ask for a password?
A5:15:35 <Turtleboats> umm
A5:15:36 <Turtleboats> i guess not
A5:15:40 <Quatroking> Oh.
A5:15:45 <Turtleboats> it says password set

A5:20:55 <Quatroking> marach, just wait a few days until the exchange goes up
A5:21:09 <Quatroking> it happens to me all the time, but with larger amounts like 50 euro's at a time :P
A5:21:27 <Quatroking> Turtleboats, did you got the router and usb adapter as a Wireless N Starter Kit?
A5:21:40 <Turtleboats> possibly
A5:21:45 <Turtleboats> i really don't know that one
A5:21:53 <Quatroking> Well Let's assume that then
A5:21:56 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:21:59 <Turtleboats> sounds like a plan
A5:22:09 <Quatroking> considering its the only way a DWA-140 can be acquired
A5:22:17 <Turtleboats> haha 
A5:22:19 <Quatroking> which would mean your router is.... a DIR-635
A5:22:31 <Quatroking> found it.
A5:22:56 <citricsquid> marach: I replied :)
A5:23:05 <Turtleboats> k
A5:23:19 <Quatroking> Turtleboats, take a look at this
A5:23:20 <Quatroking> http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Dlink/DIR-635/default.htm
A5:23:55 <Quatroking> That interface looks horrible compared to my router by the way, dear god
A5:24:22 <citricsquid> my router is hilarious, if you plug anything into the wall sockets in our house it goes offline =(
A5:24:28 <Turtleboats> which one is my router ip?
A5:24:38 <Quatroking> your gateway
A5:24:40 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:24:58 <Turtleboats> hold up
A5:25:10 <Turtleboats> it didn't take me to a dlink site
A5:25:14 <Turtleboats> it took me to at&t
A5:25:30 <Quatroking> but at&t is your internet provider..
A5:25:36 <Turtleboats> yeah
A5:25:50 <Turtleboats> the tutorial thing shows a dlink site coming up
A5:25:57 <Turtleboats> i never got to that site
A5:26:01 <Quatroking> It's possible they've thrown in a custom version in your router
A5:26:17 <Quatroking> you don't get any setup options either?
A5:26:48 <Turtleboats> dont think so
A5:27:21 <Quatroking> Well then I'm out of idea's, I've never seen the gateway Ip leading to your provider's website before
A5:27:22 <marach> i know a sitewhere you can get 0.10 $ for free in exchange of big amount of spam...
A5:27:35 <Quatroking> give it to me, marach
A5:27:37 <citricsquid> marach: Read the topic =D I'll send you the money you need :P
A5:27:57 <marach> ok big thx
A5:28:22 <marach> couldnt exchangerate go up insteadof down...
A5:28:41 <marach> failing spacebar
A5:28:42 <citricsquid> yep, but might take a while
A5:28:45 <Quatroking> it's idfferent all the time
A5:28:49 <citricsquid> it could potentially keep going down and down for a while
A5:28:55 <citricsquid> or it could go up for ages, it's magic!
A5:29:09 <Quatroking> When I bought my PC my money gone up and down by amounts like 50 euro's or something
A5:29:17 <Quatroking> because I had so much :P

A6:08:35 <marach> whats this extension anyway?
A6:08:55 <Quatroking> it makes it possible to add raw HTMl to protected pages on the wiki
A6:09:05 <Alwayswatching> So what does everyone think the next update will be
A6:09:29 <Quatroking> which makes it possible to embed the Mibbit IRC client so that all the stupid people won't have to spam around on the forums about how they can't use IRC because they got brain tumors

A7:34:33 <citricsquid> it's the way the server side client runs afaik
A7:34:39 <citricsquid> you need to use the local IP of your machine
A7:35:00 <Turtleboats> well how come nobody else can join either?
A7:35:04 <Turtleboats> and also
A7:35:13 <citricsquid> What's the server name?
A7:35:18 <Turtleboats> i click on my server to join it and i can't
A7:35:19 <Turtleboats> hold up
A7:36:38 <citricsquid> what does the server command line show you
A7:36:41 <citricsquid> is it sending heartbeats?
A7:37:08 <Turtleboats> it says level saved!
A7:37:18 <Turtleboats> load 0/16
A7:37:24 <Turtleboats> what are heartbeats?
A7:37:28 <citricsquid> okay, the problem is most likely your ports then.
A7:38:03 <Turtleboats> i already port forwarded
A7:38:42 <ZomBuster> anyone know fueuer
A7:38:45 <Turtleboats> Like the only way i can get on is by putting in the info manually. and Nobody else can get on from the link

A8:00:21 <ZomBuster> peerkoel
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> I never thought about it like that.
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> Also why do men have nipples?
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> Think about it>
A8:00:58 <citricsquid> we all start out as women
A8:01:11 <flak> we all start out as cell
A8:01:11 <citricsquid> and the best become men
A8:01:12 <citricsquid> ;)
A8:01:27 <flak> and then cell grows nipples
A8:01:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, we actually start out as two cells
A8:01:31 <citricsquid> "All humans begin life in the womb as females. If no Y chromosome is present in the foetus, then the embryo will continue to develop as and be born as a female. If there is a Y chromosome present in the embryo, the male sex hormone testosterone restricts the full development of breasts to just nipples,"
A8:01:49 <citricsquid> LOL
A8:01:54 <citricsquid> "So we know when it's time to put on a jumper. "
A8:01:55 <Flyboy> Yeah. When you think about it we were the fastest sperm out of 250,000,000
A8:02:15 <flak> or the strongest
A8:02:21 <Flyboy> Bit amazing isn't it.
A8:02:22 <flak> maybe they kill each other
A8:02:25 <citricsquid> I posted that on a forum, "When your parents hate you, remember that you beat millions of other sperm so it could have been worse"
A8:02:31 <Flyboy> That would be epic.
A8:02:46 <citricsquid> I wish we could remember being sperms, that'd be awesome.
A8:02:49 <Flyboy> SPERM COLLISEUM!!!!
A8:03:09 <flak> or maybe one sperm that lives is the smallest, so it can squeeze through when nobody can see it
A8:03:23 <Flyboy> That would explain a lot.
A8:03:56 <Flyboy> Anyone live in NZ?
A8:06:09 <smn> nazi zone?
A8:06:16 <smn> ooh

A8:08:04 <Flyboy> I was talking to someone on Omegle who had never heard of New Zealand.
