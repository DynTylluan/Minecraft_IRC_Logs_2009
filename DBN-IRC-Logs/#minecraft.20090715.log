A12:00:26 <Tripknotix> man back when i used to watch "attack of the show" on g4
A12:00:39 <Tripknotix> they had this bbs thing that u dial into and leave messages that they would read
A12:00:40 <Tripknotix> on air
A12:00:50 <Tripknotix> and im like... those are going to be the worst messages ever
A12:00:52 <Bryce9000> I found an irc client for blackberry :P

A12:01:23 <Bryce9000> Lol
A12:02:56 <Bryce9000> remeber "next step" on discovery channel?

A12:04:48 <PuyoDead> and yea, thinking back, I don't know how I ended up in that channel. I didn't know anyone there, and I don't know if it was linked or what
A12:05:45 <Bryce9000> lol. Where's the log
A12:05:56 <PuyoDead> oh man, on a disc somewhere
A12:06:10 <PuyoDead> probably not of that, though. I don't think I kept logs immediately

A4:51:03 <EcksJay> I'm experimenting with hosting my own server and I gave my friends OP. They can place unbreakable stone and use the other OP commands, but they can't erase unbreakable stone.
A4:51:17 <EcksJay> Is there something else I need to toggle?
A4:52:43 <Siiseli> yeah you need to push the big red button
A4:52:48 <Siiseli> you know, the one behind the fridge
A4:53:10 <EcksJay> I didn't think he had coded support for my fridge button yet
A4:53:13 <EcksJay> I am impressed
A4:53:23 <Siiseli> you should be.
A4:53:44 <Super-Dot> I think your friends need to rejoin the server after getting opped
A4:53:57 <EcksJay> Okies, I'll try that
A4:54:07 <EcksJay> (The fridge idea, I mean. Rejoining is just silly)
A4:54:25 <Siiseli> indeed
A4:55:37 <Tripknotix> ecks
A4:55:45 <Tripknotix> they need to rejoin the server
A4:55:49 <Tripknotix> to erase blocks
A4:55:49 <EcksJay> Yup, it worked
A4:56:09 <EcksJay> The fridge idea, bizzarely, did not
A4:56:16 <EcksJay> Thanks guys :)
A4:56:28 <Tripknotix> i'll gladly take credit for copying someone elses answer

A5:51:31 <JTE> You know what would be funny?
A5:54:09 <citricsquid> explain!
A5:55:26 <doohan> A clown on a t-rex?
A5:59:00 <offset> JTE forgot :(
A5:59:48 <LKA> a clown on a t-rex is only funny if the t-rex is riding a rocket ship
A6:01:53 <tripknotix2> anyone else feel like theyve been wasting alot of time in mine craft to see all their stuff ruined within 12 hours
A6:02:12 <peerkoel> not really
A6:02:15 <LKA> not really
A6:02:20 <citricsquid> not really
A6:02:24 <tripknotix2> do u guys built with perma blocks?
A6:02:30 <tripknotix2> build
A6:02:33 <LKA> I build in single player or on private servers :V
A6:02:34 <peerkoel> not really
A6:02:40 <tripknotix2> lolz lka
A6:02:42 <citricsquid> If you want it to stay there forever, single player or private.
A6:02:43 <tripknotix2> then that doesnt count
A6:02:57 <tripknotix2> cant u just like, stop griefers o.O
A6:02:58 <tripknotix2> magically
A6:03:02 <LKA> lol no
A6:03:07 <tripknotix2> please
A6:03:11 <citricsquid> you do realise a lot of deletion isn't griefers?
A6:03:16 <citricsquid> It's people building
A6:03:19 <citricsquid> BUILDING ON MINECRAFT
A6:03:20 <LKA> cast Rafoie on them and hope they have low EFR
A6:03:46 <tripknotix2> brand new sever, half the people joining attempt to jump ontop of my building by building up wards from the floor and start tearing shit down then jump in and rip it apart
A6:03:53 <tripknotix2> peice by peice with auto clickers in a matter of seconds
A6:04:09 <citricsquid> private.
A6:04:38 <tripknotix2> i think bans should start getting reported to the server that keeps track of ur name
A6:04:47 <tripknotix2> 1 extra variable
A6:04:47 <citricsquid> why?
A6:04:49 <LKA> It's a game
A6:04:50 <tripknotix2> keep a number
A6:04:52 <LKA> Why does it matter
A6:04:54 <tripknotix2> u hit 10 and ur done
A6:04:55 <citricsquid> I can ban you for no reason, then you get perma banned from the game.
A6:05:04 <citricsquid> *makes 10 servers* *bans you on all*
A6:05:08 <tripknotix2> i think 10 , 1 per server
A6:05:23 <tripknotix2> also detecting if a user is in the game
A6:05:25 <LKA> you have to remember anything you can do to try and stop a greifer
A6:05:27 <LKA> can be used against you
A6:05:31 <tripknotix2> if they arent in there, dont count it
A6:05:36 <citricsquid> Exactly; minecraft IS FREEDOM.
A6:05:39 <Ausfriendlaptop> I haven't seen Notch for a long time
A6:05:41 <citricsquid> Taking away the freedom takes away minecraft
A6:06:03 <tripknotix2> thinkin like a true windows nt blaster virus victim lka =D
A6:06:08 <peerkoel> also, people who grief are free game to insults
A6:06:10 <tripknotix2> u are anyhow
A6:06:24 <tripknotix2> the idea is to think ahead
A6:06:24 <LKA> I honestly don't care how many times you get greifed by superjohnnymario1234567890
A6:06:28 <LKA> nothing you do can stop anything
A6:06:37 <tripknotix2> alot of women who get raped say that
13A6:06:37 * citricsquid highfives LKA
A6:06:41 <tripknotix2> perhaps u should do somethign about it
A6:06:46 <tripknotix2> isntead of falling victim 
A6:06:54 <LKA> lmao you're bringing rape up in a comparison to MINECRAFT GREIFING
A6:06:59 <citricsquid> tripknotix2: You're an idiot, comparing rape to a game is fucking stupid.
A6:07:00 <peerkoel> comparing rape to minecraft = fail
A6:07:14 <tripknotix2> hey i was just bringing some sense to the argument
A6:07:19 <LKA> No you're not
A6:07:21 <citricsquid> tripknotix2: That's sense?
A6:07:24 <peerkoel> you overdid it by miles
A6:07:25 <citricsquid> I'd like to see your nonsense
A6:07:26 <LKA> you're bringing logical fallacies in :V
A6:07:42 <Adura> A lot of towns that get pillaged say that.
A6:07:44 <tripknotix2> its called an an analogy
A6:07:49 <citricsquid> GRIEFING in minecraft is like blowing the twin towers up you should be waterboarded and raped by army soldiers.
A6:08:03 <citricsquid> You can't compare a game to real life.
A6:08:06 <tripknotix2> lolz
A6:08:15 <peerkoel> the game is about freedom to do what you want. being a person isn't.
A6:08:19 <tripknotix2> well citricsquid i think the forum DOES have a twin towers map lol
A6:08:21 <peerkoel> neither is being a town
A6:08:52 <tripknotix2> some people will join a server with twin towers map and re-enact the events of 9 11
A6:08:55 <tripknotix2> think about that
A6:08:58 <tripknotix2> lolz
A6:09:04 <peerkoel> so ?
A6:09:09 <citricsquid> tripknotix2: How old are you?
A6:09:11 <LKA> So what?
A6:09:23 <tripknotix2> well it "is" like it, in a sense where in counter strike ur shooting people in the face and killing them
A6:09:26 <peerkoel> don't build the twin towers in a sandbox game if you don't like them torn down
A6:09:27 <tripknotix2> while it doestn cause physic harm
A6:09:42 <LKA> If they want to waste their time and offend easily offended people then let them
A6:09:45 <LKA> thats not our problem :V
A6:09:45 <tripknotix2> its still an act that the other person doesnt enjoy
A6:10:03 <peerkoel> should have thought of that before building on a public server
A6:10:07 <citricsquid> So? Eating and sex are both enjoyed by some people, does that mean eating is sex?
A6:10:23 <peerkoel> could be .. citricsquid ;)
A6:10:24 <LKA> foodgasms
A6:10:27 <citricsquid> I don't want to fornicate my bacon.
A6:10:37 <tripknotix2> i can pick up my watch, i can pick up my 100lb refrigrderator
A6:10:44 <Adura> A lot of bikes that get stolen by African American's say that.
A6:10:44 <tripknotix2> does that mean refrigerator = watch?
A6:10:45 <peerkoel> but do you like your woman to swallow?
13A6:11:04 * peerkoel gets sidetracked
A6:11:34 <tripknotix2> if in a game u had to have sex to eat, in the game, then it would be the same citric
A6:11:35 <tripknotix2> remember that
A6:11:57 <LKA> that'd probably be a bad porn game so it doesn't count
A6:12:05 <tripknotix2> its like how u have sex to bring up ur health bar in god of war
A6:12:12 <tripel> tripknot, are you high?
A6:12:16 <tripknotix2> lol nah
A6:12:27 <LKA> this reminds me of some guy on schthack
A6:12:32 <LKA> FrattinAllDay
A6:12:42 <tripknotix2> i am however head banging to anthrax - in my world
A6:12:44 <LKA> he suggested renaming the status healing items to drug terms
A6:12:49 <LKA> because he thought pso was too nerdy
A6:17:11 <JTE> heh.

A6:42:13 <citricsquid> Flatgrass is popular :O
A6:42:34 <LKA> Flatgrass is just.. a flat map with a layer of grass right
A6:42:40 <LKA> nothing to find underneat or anything?
A6:42:45 <citricsquid> yep
A6:42:48 <citricsquid> easy to build on

A6:43:03 <LKA> I always loved leveling the landscape to build things
A6:43:26 <LKA> no matter how large the landscape is, it's just somewhat satisfying to just kinda bulldoze through it with two or three friends
A6:43:54 <citricsquid> I spent 6 hours flattening a map manually
A6:43:56 <citricsquid> did about 20%
A6:43:57 <LKA> that and finding lava in caves underneath was always nice
A6:44:00 <LKA> fff ahahaha

A6:58:07 <Cueball> geh im rather bored chaps
A6:58:19 <Cueball> what can we do on this fine night?
A6:58:27 <LKA> space-talking from PSO was hilarious
A6:58:31 <LKA> especially when playing bomberman online
A6:58:34 <LKA> because space was drop bomb
A6:58:41 <LKA> so I'd accidentally kill myself trying to talk
A6:58:52 <JTE> I prefer using Enter to talk
A6:59:01 <JTE> but Enter is set respawn point in Minecraft. D:
A6:59:05 <LKA> Space just feels natural
A6:59:20 <JTE>  You still end up with a space in front of
A6:59:23 <JTE>  everything you say.
A6:59:31 <LKA> well
A6:59:35 <LKA> I don't do it that much anymore
A6:59:42 <JTE> But with the Enter key, 100% of all chat clients ignore it if you press enter without typing anything.
A6:59:45 <LKA> Unless I like..
A6:59:51 <LKA> binge off PSO for like 9+ hours at once
A6:59:53 <LKA> hunting something
A6:59:54 <Cueball> twhat should i do chaps?
A7:00:04 <JTE> I have a URL for you
A7:00:07 <Cueball> twats
A7:00:08 <Ausfriendlaptop> JTE bring your server up :(
A7:00:09 <Cueball> :D
A7:00:09 <JTE> It'll amuse you for like 5 seconds.
A7:00:38 <JTE> Ausfriendlaptop, I'd rather not. Doing so would require me to get rid of a lot of water before I can trust you to be alone with it and leave me to my work.
A7:00:54 <Ausfriendlaptop> Oh, it's not public
A7:00:56 <Ausfriendlaptop> nvm then
A7:01:06 <Ausfriendlaptop> Just a bunch of shit on the server list

A7:01:30 <Cueball> i read polish underwear server
A7:01:41 <LKA> polished glass underwater dome
A7:01:43 <JTE> It's not that, it's that I only just discovered that my custom block types were set to save as the normal blocks they disguise as by accident.
A7:01:58 <Ausfriendlaptop> Oh and JTE, i have a few suggestions
A7:02:15 <Ausfriendlaptop> How about a block that automatically rebuilds itself after a set amount of time, useful for things like spleef?
A7:03:01 <JTE> The 'work' I have been doing which bringing up my server would distract me from is in fact a dedicated spleef server which I am coding for Super-Dot.
A7:03:16 <Ausfriendlaptop> Oh,
A7:03:17 <Ausfriendlaptop> lol.
A7:03:19 <JTE> :3 It will be verygood.
A7:03:45 <JTE> And I may even release it, if the decision is mutual ...
A7:04:07 <JTE> Otherwise, it'll just be another dedicated server in the list...
A7:04:31 <JTE> but yes, I'll make other spleef stuff too
A7:04:34 <JTE> We love spleef~ <3
A7:04:39 <LKA> I still haven't played it yet
A7:05:38 <Ausfriendlaptop> its lots of fun
A7:10:41 <citricsquid> JTE: If you want a VM for hosting some minecraft servers, I can set one up for you :)
A7:11:04 <Cueball> how does that one work jte?

A7:16:15 <JTE> Okay, I'll bring the server up private for the moment and let you in if you prooomise to help me sponge it clean and replace the watervator WITHOUT breaking blocks and flooding the whole dang thing. @.@;;

A8:18:03 <Spadge> blast
A8:22:01 <netzero> 2 questions for the world at large: would it be frowned upon to modify the source of the server, and if not has anyone attempted to add additional op commands to it yet?
A8:22:20 <citricsquid> you're allowed to if you don't distribute it after it's changed
A8:22:27 <citricsquid> and people have built their own servers already - JTE
A8:22:46 <netzero> Yes, I've seen that, unfortunately it would seem that he has no intention of releasing the code yet
A8:22:55 <citricsquid> He's not allowed.
A8:22:56 <netzero> And I'm very interested in adding a few things just for personal use
A8:23:33 <Adura> Just do a bit of packet sniffing.
A8:25:53 <netzero> I was thinking that the changes I'd like to make would probably be very trivial if I could properly get to the source
A8:26:27 <netzero> Something like the /fetch command that JTE put into his server would be nice, also the ability to create water/lava blocks for admins
A8:28:05 <Spadge> its not illegal, but Notch really doesn't like when people do it
A8:28:40 <citricsquid> afaik notch has no problems with modifying stuff, but he doesn't want any of it distributed.
A8:29:14 <netzero> Well that wouldn't be an issue, some of the things I'd like to put in wouldn't be very good on a public server but would serve a private LAN just fine
A8:29:34 <netzero> And it would be more of an exercise in java for me anyway

A9:52:46 <iPope> oo python web
A9:52:58 <iPope> i was wondering how it was done
A9:52:59 <PuyoDead> y'know what else would be kind of neat? a server.log analyzer. something like "user joined this many times in this time period" "user banned this many users" "user said this many lines" etc
A9:53:10 <cryzed> PuyoDead: I could do that
A9:53:11 <Zuriki> Shhhhhhh I'm caught between crazed geeks
A9:53:18 <cryzed> I might just integrate this whole thing
A9:53:20 <cryzed> into cMss
A9:53:23 <cryzed> might
A9:53:25 <iPope> no cryzed, im going to do it
A9:53:29 <peerkoel> hm, I might brush up my proxy to spew out a lot more info
A9:53:31 <cryzed> iPope: no you are not
A9:53:37 <cryzed> YOU GUYS ARE NOT
A9:53:42 <cryzed> :D
A9:53:44 <cryzed> okay
A9:53:44 <iPope> cryzed: YOU WANNA FIGHT?

A9:54:12 <cryzed> or Echidna
A9:54:18 <cryzed> Was a joke
A9:54:19 <Zuriki> Nothing's more amusing than nerds fighting. :3
A9:54:22 <cryzed> You don't need to
A9:54:29 <iPope> :P
A9:54:30 <peerkoel> or your own java code that you've been sitting on for a while

A10:46:54 <iPope> guys i had a very good idea last night
A10:47:08 <iPope> why doesnt notch code the lua api, then use the lua to make survival mode?

10A10:47:25 * Ausfriendlaptop is now known as Ausfriendissleeping
A10:47:42 <Saer> Hello World!
A10:47:44 <iPope> then hed have to make the lua api very versitile
A10:49:05 <peerkoel> I think it's better if the API goes on top of the survival code
A10:49:13 <peerkoel> so that we can script the survival mode elements
A10:50:46 <iPope> huh?
A10:51:15 <iPope> if you have lua api capable of making the survival gamemode, then it would be able to script the survival elements
A10:51:19 <JTE> Hey iPope. :3
A10:51:35 <iPope> the point is that he sets uo the api so he can interacte with the engine using lua
A10:51:38 <iPope> hi JTE :3
A10:52:39 <iPope> just saying that JTE should make the lua api with all the functions and then use it to make the survival game mode
A10:53:08 <iPope> i mean notch
A10:53:10 <iPope> :(
A10:53:23 <JTE> Heh, JTE would make the Lua API with all the functions, Notch should.
A10:53:31 <JTE> Silly. :P
A10:53:54 <peerkoel> well, if the survival code is in lua, then we need to edit that lua code to add/change gameplay that has to do with survival
A10:54:21 <peerkoel> if the API is on top of the survival code in java then you only add lua code for the game elements you want to add or change
A10:54:56 <iPope> do you not understand the concept of a lua api?
A10:55:06 <JTE> Everybody wants to be Garry's Mod ... Geeze.
A10:55:13 <peerkoel> it lets you interact with the game core
A10:55:19 <iPope> yes
A10:55:30 <peerkoel> survival mode is game core imho
A10:55:38 <iPope> its a game mode
A10:55:53 <iPope> the core is the engine
A10:56:41 <iPope> so bassicly notch adds all the base elements he needs or we would need to the engine
A10:57:07 <iPope> then the lua api comes on top, with functions like, getHealth() getWeapon() umm setHealth()
A10:57:21 <peerkoel> or he could make a rich API that supports interaction with survival game mode
A10:57:21 <iPope> setBlock(X, Y, X)
A10:57:43 <iPope> if the game mode was made with the api you cant get much more interaction than that
A10:57:50 <iPope> it would be directly moddable
A10:57:58 <peerkoel> an API is nothing more then an interface. an interface to what, that's what we have different views on
13A10:58:33 * peerkoel afk
A10:58:42 <iPope> its an interface to the engine
A10:58:52 <iPope> JTE, you get what im on about right?
A11:03:49 <JTE> Yes, I have plenty experience with Lua and the APIs thereof, and I understand your concerns, yet agree with peerkoel that it would be better hardcoded in Java, though a suitable "custom gametype test" which can essentially do every single thing Survival mode can do should be available anyway.

A11:33:27 <SteGriff> Very well, tahnking
A11:33:38 <Spadge> notch: the funny thing about my error, is that i can play on my own server, and on singleplayer, and on JTE's server
A11:33:55 <08Notch> i'd blame jte's server then. It's not standard and not supported. =)
A11:34:01 <Spadge> lol

A11:34:13 <08Notch> ?
A11:34:17 <08Notch> oh, and ON
A11:34:22 <08Notch> I thought you said "but not on"
A11:34:33 <08Notch> so you can play on some servers but not others? That's veeery strange
A11:34:51 <Spadge> only mine, via direct IP
A11:34:54 <Spadge> singleplayer
A11:34:56 <Spadge> and JTE's
A11:35:08 <Spadge> none of the public ones are working for me
A11:35:18 <08Notch> it's probably not a graphics driver problem then
A11:35:29 <Spadge> no :P
A11:35:33 <citricsquid> sounds like a problem with the official server client :O
A11:35:55 <JTE> But what would cause such a thing?
A11:36:03 <JTE> That's almost nonsensical..
A11:36:09 <08Notch> yeah.. weird. Something's got to be different..
A11:36:12 <08Notch> any idea at all, jte?
A11:36:29 <JTE> I've got my own problems; Watervator blocks turn into normal water on server reboot. X_x;
A11:36:29 <08Notch> If local play didn't work, it'd make more sense
A11:36:43 <SteGriff> I have some questions about server properties
A11:36:54 <08Notch> might be about how fast the server replies to the login attempt..
A11:37:04 <SteGriff> what do verify-names and max-connections do?
A11:37:38 <08Notch> SteGriff: verify-names forces people to play via the web site. If you turn it off, people can log in with any name by doing some hacking
A11:37:42 <08Notch> this also means anyone can be op
A11:37:56 <SteGriff> right
A11:38:05 <08Notch> some people have trouble connecting to their own server and/or want to play offline, so I let people turn it off
A11:38:06 <Spadge> yeah that hack peevs me off
A11:38:09 <JTE> Which means it's very good that JTE can verify names.
A11:38:11 <SteGriff> (I'll leave that on then)
A11:38:36 <08Notch> max-connections is, if I remember correctly, how many people can connect from a single ip
A11:38:49 <08Notch> it's meant to protect against someone connecting 32 bots to your server from a single computer
A11:39:11 <SteGriff> Do you work for/run a company which serves MMORPGs?
A11:39:22 <08Notch> no, but I used to work on Wurm Online
A11:39:36 <iPope> which means hes super awesome
A11:39:36 <SteGriff> Anyhow, thank you very much for your help :)

A11:47:08 <PuyoDead> what I don't get about the pixel format not accelerated thing is... when I boot into XP on this machine, minecraft works. but when I boot into win7 on this same machine, I get that error
A11:47:20 <08Notch> yeah, I want to do more stuff with the lighting. =D

A11:47:30 <liq3> Puyodead: you got drivers for your card on the win7 install?
A11:47:46 <Hover> One of these days someone will force Notch to implement advanced ray tracing for lighting
A11:47:59 <PuyoDead> it's quite an old card, so I'm not sure what it pulled

A11:49:33 <liq3> lol wtf i have no idea.
A11:49:48 <SteGriff> Again: where can I get a flatgrass server level file, please?
A11:49:53 <liq3> you tried googling? I doubt it's Minecraft specific.
A11:49:59 <JTE> It's minecraft specific.
A11:50:05 <Spadge> yeah it is

A11:58:47 <Spadge> isn't that one of the founding ideas of the game?
A11:58:51 <Hover> But the problem is there's no demand for it.  Plus you can just destroy it on a whim

P12:00:52 <peerkoel> and digging like crazy in search for ores, flooding their mining spots

P12:01:40 <peerkoel> I thought you had some way of generating maps, JTE ?
P12:02:12 <iPope> SteGriff
P12:02:18 <JTE> Currently I have two, peerkoel: The old /generate command I haven't bothered to replace yet, and the /new command which just makes flatgrass/empty/ocean maps.
P12:02:19 <08Notch> JTE: I do random 3d worms to generate caves and ore
P12:02:31 <JTE> Yeah, you do pretty awesome worms.
P12:02:42 <08Notch> why, thank you!
P12:02:47 <iPope> i noticed certain features of caves

P12:03:43 <Hover> I like finding caves then turning them into secret underground temples that no one will ever find <_<

P12:04:41 <liq3> peerkoel: Btw, random digging for ores won't that common. :p
P12:04:56 <liq3> Since notch said in his blog digging stone could take up to a second per block.
P12:05:08 <JTE> Oh pfft, I actually DID fix the special blocks when saving/loading, but I actually passed IN the wrong array altogether. X_X;
P12:05:10 <liq3> So randomly digging would take ages for one person.
P12:05:17 <peerkoel> hm, true..
P12:05:19 <liq3> JTE: Eh?
P12:05:24 <Spadge> JTE: lol
P12:06:08 <peerkoel> yeah.. I had a problem with my code where I removed the first item in a list where I had to remove the item being handled, which wasn't always the first
P12:06:11 <peerkoel> that took me ages
P12:06:30 <iPope> brb
P12:06:33 <JTE> liq3: I have this little chunk of code here that copies the map blocks array and loops through all of the custom block types that look like other types on my server, like lava sponge and watervators, replacing all of them in to get the "real" map data in order to put it into the file
P12:06:49 <JTE> And then immediately below it, I completely discard the array I just made and put the original array in anyway.

P2:23:29 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't even do network code with Blitz, so...
P2:23:34 <liq3> darn.
P2:23:39 <JTE> I like C++.
P2:23:48 <JTE> And I know how to do network code, is very fun <3
P2:23:53 <liq3> JTE: Can you help me? O.o
P2:24:09 <JTE> Possibly. o.o
P2:24:14 <liq3> Well...
P2:24:16 <JTE> Depends on how much patience I have.
P2:24:21 <liq3> lol.
P2:24:32 <liq3> I'm trying to make multiplayer pong. Netcode got me stuck.
P2:25:06 <JTE> Do you know where to begin?
P2:25:20 <liq3> Specific code isn't the problem. Like, dunno when to update and stuff, or to use UDP or TCP/IP.
P2:25:32 <JTE> Use TCP for now. Is easier.
P2:25:42 <liq3> Heh, I question that, but ok. :p
P2:26:05 <JTE> TCP messages are guaranteed to come IN ORDER and WITHOUT RANDOM MESSAGES BEING DROPPED.
P2:26:09 <JTE> ... Is easier. >.>
P2:26:12 <liq3> Yeh...
P2:26:17 <liq3> But it's pong...
P2:26:19 <liq3> So it's real time. :P
P2:26:30 <Hover> Yeah, I can't imagine why someone would punish themselves making a game using UDP if it's something simple
P2:26:31 <JTE> IRC? That's TCP.
P2:26:32 <JTE> Minecraft? TCP.
P2:26:39 <JTE> Pong? TCP.
P2:26:39 <liq3> Minecraft is TCP? O.o
P2:26:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Anyone here willing to model a skin for me?

P2:28:16 <liq3> I do 200 frames per second atm. :p
P2:28:17 <C418> pretty much
P2:28:39 <Hover> Why is pong going at 200 frames a second?
P2:28:45 <JTE> Then limit how often you do your networking, if you for some convoluted reason wish to actually KEEP that ridiculous framerate. >.>
P2:28:47 <liq3> Why not? O.o
P2:29:02 <liq3> It uses like 5% of one of my cores at that speed...
P2:29:27 <Hover> Because you come into problems with networking :P  You're going to have to limit either the frames or the information sent
P2:29:37 <liq3> Exactly. :p
P2:29:57 <Hover> And, personally, I'd say limit the frames and try to be precise as possible with the net code so everyone gets the same experience.  But I guess it doesn't make much difference here
P2:30:08 <liq3> Yeh, it's pong...
P2:30:12 <Hover> Hehe
P2:30:25 <liq3> I mean I feel the best way is basic server/client, with clients lagging behind.
P2:30:33 <liq3> But I don't know how to do even that.
P2:31:31 <Snowman> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Snowman

P2:31:55 <Snowman> Finished version
P2:33:18 <liq3> JTE: Btw, I can change the framerate easily.
P2:33:19 <Hover> Linearly interpolate between physics frames and make the most complicated pong net code ever!
P2:33:29 <liq3> Hrm.
P2:33:41 <liq3> I mean the simpliest way is to just send when someone changes or something isn't it?
P2:34:25 <Hover> The simplest way is to send it each frame.  You save bandwidth by sending when something changes
P2:34:31 <Hover> Which is when things get complicated
P2:34:40 <liq3> Hrm.
P2:34:48 <liq3> I'll try that then.
P2:34:54 <liq3> I think I knows how to do it too.

P2:35:08 <Hover> For pong, just do what JTE said and send all the data needed every frame and limit either the net "FPS" or for the love of god your frame rate
P2:35:13 <liq3> I should also probably lower the framerate. xD
P2:35:17 <Hover> Haha
P2:35:25 <liq3> Oh.
P2:35:28 <Animator> Human Multiplayer Pong?
P2:35:32 <liq3> I'll just limit the net FPS.
P2:35:50 <liq3> Probably lower it to like 50 fps or something.
P2:35:56 <Animator> YES. Finally I get to hear that idea into motion.
P2:36:14 <liq3> Animator: Wut?
P2:36:27 <Animator> I heard pong.
P2:36:43 <Hover> But the thing is, you're going to keep limiting new refresh rates every time you add something since it's all based on graphics FPS.  Add AI?  You'll have to invent a new limit for that too, and it makes nice code when you consolidate everything together
P2:36:52 <Hover> Oh god I'm writing paragraphs
P2:37:10 <liq3> Hover: What's wrong with paragraphs?
P2:37:29 <Hover> I dunno, it always seemed weird to write long things on IRC
P2:37:45 <liq3> Also I'm using an accummlator for the 'physics' fps.
P2:37:57 <liq3> the normal FPS i just use SDL_Delay if it's too high. :/
P2:38:32 <liq3> And considering if I turn off FPS capping I get 2200fps on my PC heh.
P2:40:13 <Hover> Anyway, long story short you'll end up making a lot of exceptions and individual refresh rates if you don't cap your FPS, and that's all I have to say about that
