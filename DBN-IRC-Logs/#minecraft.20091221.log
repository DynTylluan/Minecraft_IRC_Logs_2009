A12:38:53 <Roadcrosser_> opaque or transparent
A12:38:55 <Brett> this sicks
A12:38:59 <Koitenshin> Opaque
A12:39:06 <Brett> The World class was designed to be a singleton
A12:39:27 <Brett> now i need multiple instances of it

10A12:39:33 * Roadcrosser_ is now known as Roadcrosser
A12:39:34 <Koitenshin> Brett and byte[] need to work together
A12:39:36 <AotC> this is why you don't use singletons
A12:39:52 <Brett> wasn't me who wrote the world class!
10A12:40:06 * Roadcrosser_ (1305339@120.141.250.200) has joined #minecraft
A12:40:09 <Koitenshin> Thats not what I'm saying
A12:40:14 <AotC> or the other 100 singleton classes?
A12:40:20 <Roadcrosser> weird
A12:40:22 <Koitenshin> byte[] has easily done maps that are side by side
A12:40:30 <Roadcrosser> i didnt know ice chat had auto jain
A12:40:34 <Brett> and no, normally they're fine... we didn't envision multiworld support initially
A12:40:51 <Brett> there are like 3
A12:40:56 <Koitenshin> well that's why i suggested byte[] helping you
A12:40:57 <AotC> :|
A12:41:06 <Brett> world, configuration... hell, i can't even name the other
A12:41:22 <Brett> oh
A12:41:25 <Brett> yeah, figured
A12:41:28 <Brett> the task queue, obviously
A12:42:28 <AotC> singletons are just bad in general

A12:42:54 <mail2345> in regards to multiworld
A12:43:02 <mail2345> make an effectivly massive map
A12:43:17 <mail2345> by sending clients chunks of it
A12:43:22 <mail2345> basically when you go to the edge
A12:43:29 <mail2345> you go into a diffrent sub segment
A12:43:46 <Brett> i'd simplify that to having a grid of maps
A12:43:54 <Brett> and loading the adjacent map when you hit a certain coordinate
A12:44:00 <mail2345> that's what i meant
A12:44:11 <mail2345> i suck at explaining

A12:56:55 <Lmaoboat> Notch has been chasing butterflies or something
A12:56:57 <Koitenshin> He probably has. He just doesn't want to release it yet.
A12:56:58 <AotC> wasn't paint.net just updated with new stuff for windows 7?
A12:57:07 <Skittles> Add-ons for a reason
A12:57:52 <Lmaoboat> Notch needs to be reminded again that this is an alpha, and he's supposed to release buggy, unfinished things

A1:12:50 <System> Yep not even online
A1:13:13 <Roadcrosser> i havent seen pixeleater for some time and now he just left?
A1:13:19 <Roadcrosser> what did he come here for?
A1:15:13 <Koitenshin> fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
A1:15:23 <Koitenshin> Why can the server software not recognize opaque skins
A1:15:38 <Koitenshin> I want to be an invisible OP
A1:16:10 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:16:11 <Roadcrosser> HELLO
A1:16:16 <Roadcrosser> thats TRANSPARENT
A1:16:37 <Koitenshin> Yeah but I have it set to half opacity
A1:16:42 <Koitenshin> still shows as normal
A1:16:51 <Roadcrosser> AND NOTCH PURPOSELY MADE THAT HAPPEN
A1:16:53 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:16:54 <Roadcrosser> oh
A1:17:01 <Roadcrosser> notch never made half opacity
A1:17:07 <Roadcrosser> even for headgear
A1:17:09 <Koitenshin> i notced
A1:17:20 <Roadcrosser> try /hide if its implemented :P
A1:17:35 <Roadcrosser> it fails
A1:17:38 <Koitenshin> im on a server coded by Nossr
A1:17:42 <Koitenshin> whoops
A1:17:43 <Roadcrosser> lemme see
A1:17:46 <Koitenshin> brain running slow
A1:17:54 <Koitenshin> I'm on a server coded by Notch
A1:18:09 <Koitenshin> so a default server
A1:18:12 <Roadcrosser> oh
A1:18:15 <Roadcrosser> that :/
A1:18:48 <Roadcrosser> get a custom coded server
A1:19:10 <PuyoDead> Yea, opacity was one of the first things I tried with the new head skins.
A1:20:11 <Roadcrosser> wait what?
A1:20:12 <Roadcrosser> :/
A1:20:18 <Roadcrosser> yea...
A1:20:24 <Roadcrosser> i tried it too
A1:20:31 <Roadcrosser> it ignored the new layer altogether
A1:21:03 <Koitenshin> Maybe Notch will code in Invisible OP commands
A1:21:20 <Koitenshin> I suppose it wouldn't hurt to ask.
10A1:21:22 * System is now known as LG_Legacy
A1:21:43 <PuyoDead> Nah, it shows up, just as solid.
A1:21:56 <Roadcrosser> NO
A1:22:00 <Roadcrosser> rouge ops...
A1:22:12 <vede> Well, the Wikipedia article for Minecraft is now finished, but I can't post it yet. Apparently someone else made a Minecraft article in October and it was deleted, so I should probably get it cleared there first. Then I also want to make special extra sure Notch is okay with it.
A1:22:26 <lolhate> hah
A1:22:34 <vede> I *can* pastebin the text and all that, though, if anyone wants to see it.
A1:22:44 <LG_Legacy> Yawn
A1:22:45 <PuyoDead> He was supposed to implement a thing where a button press showed everyone's names, as if you were hovering over them. Not sure where that went.

A1:30:20 <Koitenshin> I'd have to see if Notch could implement something like it.
A1:30:44 <Koitenshin> If in admin.txt you could be invisible
A1:30:47 <tentacos> you don't even need to make them transparent, just don't send their position to the non-ops
A1:30:52 <Koitenshin> something like that is needed
A1:31:08 <Koitenshin> tentacos has the idea
A1:31:08 <Roadcrosser> ...
A1:31:19 <Roadcrosser> invisible is fail unless notch codes it
A1:31:25 <Marach> off to :(school:(
A1:31:26 <Shadaez|AFK> I think he should allow people to make transparent skins, except at least a certain percentage has to be solid

A2:03:17 <KamikazeBeat> Does anyone happen to know, when forwarding ports in order to host a server on Minecraft, are the ports TCP or UDP?
A2:03:21 <vede> I don't think he's allowed to.
A2:03:22 <gm|lap> vede: yay for citations
A2:03:27 <gm|lap> KamikazeBeat: TCP
A2:03:28 <Shadaez> Just do both.
A2:03:33 <vede> What, gm|lap?
A2:03:35 <KamikazeBeat> TCP?
A2:03:37 <Shadaez> That's hwat I do :D
A2:03:50 <KamikazeBeat> I've been having trouble and I can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
A2:04:04 <KamikazeBeat> Do you use the IP address in the "Private IP" box?
A2:04:11 <gm|lap> well, you've got 4 citations in your article, so any [citation needed]s will probably be ridiculous
A2:04:13 <KamikazeBeat> Like, your IP address.
A2:04:16 <Shadaez> no
A2:04:28 <Shadaez> put your internal IP. Should look something like 192.168.1.#
A2:04:39 <vede> Yeah, I wanted to make sure I didn't have any stuff in the article that wasn't self-evident, or that didn't have a concrete source.
A2:04:40 <KamikazeBeat> 192.168.0.1
A2:04:54 <vede> No, not that.
A2:04:57 <Shadaez> Not the same as the one that connects to your router.
A2:04:57 <vede> That's your router.
A2:05:04 <vede> Your local IP.
A2:05:14 <Shadaez> Look for a DHCP list and find your PC's name there, and the IP by it, or do a ipconfig in cmd
A2:05:21 <vede> Go to cmd and type "ipconfig" and find the row that says "IP Address" or something.
A2:05:27 <AndrewPH|MM> ipconfig /all
A2:05:38 <vede> No need for the /all if all you want is an IP.
A2:05:52 <AndrewPH|MM> add /all just because
A2:06:00 <vede> Well, I guess that's okay.
A2:06:02 <Shadaez> so u look liek a computer haxor.
A2:06:08 <KamikazeBeat> for my IP address, its giving me 192.168.0.101
A2:06:08 <vede> ya
A2:06:09 <Koitenshin> #minecraft helping people? SACRILEGE!
A2:06:16 <vede> Then use that, KamikazeBeat.
A2:06:16 <Shadaez> That seems right.
A2:06:28 <KamikazeBeat> k
A2:06:33 <KamikazeBeat> and you say TCP right?
A2:06:44 <Shadaez> yeah
A2:06:45 <vede> I believe so.
A2:06:53 <gdude2002> Forwaring ports are we?
A2:06:54 <Shadaez> I always jsut do both though
A2:06:58 <Shadaez> :)
A2:06:59 <vede> Although if it doesn't work, you might just make it both.
A2:07:05 <gdude2002> yeah
A2:07:13 <gdude2002> If you're forwarding ports: simpe port forwarding
A2:07:17 <KamikazeBeat> Alright, I set it as both.
A2:07:19 <gdude2002> hany much
A2:07:23 <KamikazeBeat> I'm going to go try it out
A2:07:23 <gdude2002> handy*
A2:07:36 <Shadaez> or just learn to do it, it isn't rocket surgery.
A2:07:47 <gdude2002> yeah, I know
A2:07:49 <vede> Yeah.
A2:07:50 <gdude2002> good for noobs though
A2:07:57 <vede> I've tried surgery on rockets before.

A2:08:03 <gdude2002> lol
A2:08:03 <Koitenshin> one thing vede
A2:08:12 <Koitenshin> I don't like that you directly link them to WoM
A2:08:16 <Koitenshin> >_>
A2:08:18 <vede> Why not?
A2:08:22 <vede> It's valid information.
A2:08:40 <vede> It's the best source for that text that I can think of.
A2:08:41 <Koitenshin> I know but oh boy, server owners be prepared for a new wave of griefers
A2:08:51 <gdude2002> Why?
A2:08:53 <vede> Nah, most people don't check the citations anyway.
A2:08:58 <KamikazeBeat> It still isn't working =[
A2:09:10 <KamikazeBeat> Any other ideas of what might be wrong?
A2:09:11 <gdude2002> Some routers need a reboot
A2:09:12 <Koitenshin> I must be one of the few that checks citations then
A2:09:20 <KamikazeBeat> Reboot, good idea.
A2:09:22 <Shadaez> I don't :)
A2:09:22 <vede> And I'm figuring the majority of potential griefers *definitely* doesn't check citations.
A2:09:32 <gdude2002> lol vede
A2:09:39 <gdude2002> Wom has retty much 9000 users
A2:09:45 <gdude2002> I wonder how many are griefers?

A2:10:41 <Shadaez> it's bothering me.

A9:06:15 <Quatroking> with graph
A9:07:26 <Quatroking> In 1998, an informal group called the Mozilla Organization was formed and largely funded by Netscape (the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape)
A9:07:40 <Quatroking> However, the aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape 5 and re-write the source code. The re-written source code was in the form of the Mozilla web browser, which, with a few additions, Netscape 6 was based on.
A9:07:48 <Quatroking> netscape made mozilla which made netscape

A9:48:06 <Zedd> will run it fine, assuming my specs are up to it.

A9:48:33 <Zedd> And if my specs aren't, I can run it on an iMac or a Mac Pro with the same software I use here.
A9:48:51 <VurtualRuler98> brb digging up screenshots
A9:48:54 <Zedd> Here's an example.
A9:48:57 <Griob> does anyone have the disturbed songs sickened, Monster, dehumanized and hell?
A9:48:59 <Zedd> Steam is windows only.
A9:49:03 <Zedd> I run Steam.
A9:49:16 <Zedd> I run TF2, HL series, Max Payne, and other games.
A9:49:21 <VurtualRuler98> Without emulating or dualbooting?
A9:49:24 <Zedd> Through steam, on my mac.
A9:49:29 <Zedd> With zero emulation
A9:49:33 <Zedd> And zero dualbooting
A9:49:40 <VurtualRuler98> Hax.
A9:49:42 <Zedd> It's called CoG, it's pretty awesome
A9:49:45 <Zedd> Is not.
A9:50:12 <VurtualRuler98> I demand a link or information about this
A9:50:20 <VurtualRuler98> Unless you're talking about your center of gravity.
A9:50:24 <Zedd> looooool

A9:50:41 <AndrewPH|MM> VurtualRuler98, you of all people should know that zedd is a giant troll.
13A9:50:51 * Zedd looks at Andrew
A9:51:00 <Zedd> Excuse me! I would disagree.
A9:51:09 <VurtualRuler98> I'd not call anyone around today a troll.

A9:51:42 <Zedd> I don't fit my own definition of troll. Ah well, he can ignore who the hell he likes.
A9:51:57 <VurtualRuler98> Pff
A9:51:57 <Zedd> Anyway, yeah, CoG and CoP are great pieces of software.
A9:52:01 <VurtualRuler98> That's still emulation.
A9:52:05 <Zedd> No, it's not.
A9:52:11 <VurtualRuler98> Not literally, but still.
A9:52:12 <Zedd> It's built off of wine
A9:52:23 <VurtualRuler98> You still lose.
A9:52:24 <Zedd> WINE = WINE Is Not An Emulator
A9:52:31 <Zedd> No emulation going on.
A9:52:43 <Zedd> Just like wine, just an implementation of DLLs
A9:52:43 <VurtualRuler98> You sound like the worst kind of non-windows nerd right now.
A9:52:54 <Zedd> Oh?
A9:53:02 <VurtualRuler98> Also, ArmA 2 has ridiculously high system specs, and any compatability system is going to push you off the edge.
A9:53:02 <Zedd> Eh, I don't care.
A9:53:16 <Zedd> No, not really. So long as the system is up to it.
A9:53:21 <Zedd> But, so what.
A9:53:25 <Zedd> Run what you like.
A9:53:25 <VurtualRuler98> It probably isn't up to it in the first place.
A9:53:41 <Zedd> Mine? NO. I have a crappy Intel integrated chipset. 
A9:53:41 <VurtualRuler98> Either way, macs still fail.
A9:53:44 <Zedd> An iMac, yes.
A9:53:49 <Zedd> But, dude, I run a laptop
A9:54:07 <Zedd> So there is close to zip way I have the specs for something heavy
A9:54:49 <VurtualRuler98> Actually, right now, give me some reasons why I'd want to use a mac.
A9:55:07 <PuyoDead> You want to look cool, and have a lot of money?
A9:55:12 <Siiseli> hah
A9:55:19 <Zedd> I don't have a lot of money. :D
A9:55:22 <Siiseli> well mac laptops have a nice mousepad
A9:55:24 <Zedd> BSoDs, there's a reason.
A9:55:33 <Zedd> System crashes
A9:55:35 <Siiseli> they in general can be argeu
A9:55:39 <Siiseli> argued to have a better ui
A9:55:45 <Zedd> A better interface/UI
A9:55:45 <VurtualRuler98> Zedd, currently, I have had 0 BSoDs during normal operation, or crashes.
A9:55:46 <PuyoDead> BSOD is pretty much non-existant anymore.
A9:55:49 <Siiseli> (I sneezed and accidentally hit the enter)
A9:55:53 <Zedd> I don't know.
A9:56:07 <Zedd> I know windows peeps who threw out 7 because of constant BSoDs
A9:56:14 <PuyoDead> Err...
A9:56:20 <PuyoDead> You've been lied to.
A9:56:26 <VurtualRuler98> The only one's I've had were on Vista, when overloading the system and using out of date drivers, and greenscreens with an ancient videocard on XP.
A9:56:51 <AndrewPH|MM> I told you all Zedd is a hueg troll
A9:57:03 <Roadcrosser> hoey

A9:57:50 <VurtualRuler98> Shouldn't you be telling us why it's better? We asked you why.
A9:57:51 <PuyoDead> Complaining about Windows BSoD'ing and crashing is like complaining about Mac only having one mouse button.

A9:58:47 <Zedd> I will admit that it is easier to run some stuff on a PC
A9:58:57 <VurtualRuler98> I wouldn't combine a mac and windows.
A9:59:00 <PuyoDead> I've no problem with OSX itself.
A9:59:03 <Zedd> I'm trying to set up what was once a dell box downstairs
A9:59:11 <Iguana> The brand new WinMac
A9:59:11 <VurtualRuler98> Maybe Ubuntu and Windows into some mega-OS.
A9:59:12 <Zedd> Because it's cheaper to get better specs 
A9:59:15 <Iguana> A Mac that WINS
A9:59:17 <PuyoDead> I'm not a fan of Apple as a company, however.
A9:59:19 <Iguana> HAHA.
A9:59:20 <VurtualRuler98> Iguana, that's whack.
A9:59:26 <Siiseli> one thing I have a problem with is apple
A9:59:31 <AndrewPH|MM> Ubuntu: If windows and OSX had sex and had a baby and only the good things came out.
A9:59:31 <Iguana> You want a MacDows?
A9:59:32 <Siiseli> and the other is the so called macfags
A9:59:38 <Roadcrosser> will it ended
A9:59:47 <Siiseli> I also hate windows enthusiasts who whine about macs all the time
A9:59:53 <Griob> apples only product line that i like is ipod, because they arent slow and annoying. 
A9:59:55 <AndrewPH|MM> Better linux distros: same but BETTER
A9:59:57 <Zedd> Unfortunately for Andrew, Ubuntu us an EYESORE
A10:00:02 <VurtualRuler98> Reason #1 for not combining a mac and windows: No possible name.

A10:00:09 <PuyoDead> How long has it been since you've used Ubuntu?
A10:00:14 <Marafk> http://marach.tk/download/ubuntu.jpg
A10:00:15 <Zedd> What's slow and annoying, Griob?
A10:00:19 <VurtualRuler98> Wait, Ubuntu an eyesore?
A10:00:22 <Zedd> About 4 months, PuyoDead
A10:00:29 <Iguana> I have 9.10 or whatever and it looks fine to me.
A10:00:33 <Zedd> Eyesore = most "flavors" of linux
A10:00:41 <Iguana> :/
A10:00:43 <Marafk> it's mine
A10:00:46 <PuyoDead> You have poor taste then.
A10:00:50 <Griob> yes slow and annoying. i havent been on many macs but the crap ones at school.. :P
A10:00:52 <VurtualRuler98> I spent two minutes messing around, found the "Dust" theme, and gave it a different default background.
A10:00:53 <Zedd> That's possible.
A10:00:53 <vede> Who actually says "flavors" of Linux?
A10:00:56 <vede> Seriously.
A10:01:01 <Zedd> That's entirely possibly, PuyoDead.
A10:01:07 <PuyoDead> At this point, most OSes look pretty much fine.
A10:01:12 <vede> And even then, you're able to *gasp* change the visual theme!
A10:01:14 <VurtualRuler98> End result is 99% the same and makes people do a double-take.
A10:01:25 <PuyoDead> They all have good and bad points, but none look terrible, I feel.
A10:01:35 <Zedd> Griob, a proper Mac,  like my system, or a desktop mac, that is --modern-- runs fast, runs great
A10:01:55 <Marafk> unless you have to run a game.
A10:01:56 <Zedd> Windows looks ugly to me too. I guess I have high standards. 
A10:02:06 <Zedd> My games run sweet, Marafk
A10:02:30 <VurtualRuler98> Wait, call me crazy, but aren't all the macs pre-built?
A10:02:33 <Marafk> YOUR games do.
A10:02:37 <VurtualRuler98> You're being forced to use a prebuilt computer.
A10:02:44 <PuyoDead> You're just used to OSX, is all. Switching to any UI you're not used to isn't going to be an easy process for most people.
A10:02:48 <VurtualRuler98> Also, you said you had an integrated intel chipset
A10:02:52 <Zedd> Marafk  -- TF2, Half Life series, Max Payne, Civ IV
A10:02:54 <VurtualRuler98> And play half-life.
A10:03:00 <AndrewPH|MM> Guys
A10:03:01 <VurtualRuler98> YOU ARE A LIAR.
A10:03:03 <Zedd> Yes, I do have an integrated intel chipset
A10:03:03 <AndrewPH|MM> zedd is a troll
A10:03:05 <AndrewPH|MM> just ignore him
A10:03:07 <Zedd> And Half Life 2 runs sweet
A10:03:12 <Zedd> So do the episodes.
A10:03:16 <VurtualRuler98> AndrewPH|MM, well, now we have proof.
A10:03:18 <Ten_Tacles> lulz
A10:03:18 <PuyoDead> All in all, this is probably the most accurate way to put it: http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/song-chart-memes-operating-systems.jpg
A10:03:20 <Marafk> i dont play games like this
A10:03:23 <Zedd> Andrew, what'd I ever do?
A10:03:23 <Ten_Tacles> ashleigh ?
A10:03:46 <Ashleigh> Yes
A10:03:57 <AndrewPH|MM> Zedd, trolling is bad in all forms, bud.
A10:04:04 <vede> Zedd, you make inane statements that may or may not be intended to stir controversy.
A10:04:11 <Zedd> Andrew, I don't fit my definitions of a troll
A10:04:14 <Ten_Tacles> is the server open?
A10:04:15 <VurtualRuler98> The middle is actually a puzzle.
A10:04:18 <Ashleigh> Yeah
A10:04:22 <AndrewPH|MM> Zedd, you sit under bridges and eat goats.
A10:04:23 <Ashleigh> I fixed it now
A10:04:24 <Zedd> vede, controversy? Am I talking about religion?
A10:04:25 <Ashleigh> It crashed
A10:04:28 <AndrewPH|MM> You fit the description perfectly.
A10:04:30 <Ten_Tacles> good :D
A10:04:31 <Marafk> this chart is great!
A10:04:39 <PuyoDead> You might want to look up "controversy".
A10:04:41 <vede> Zedd, do you think the only kind of contro-- SEE THAT?
A10:04:46 <Zedd> Andrew, if I did that, your goat problem would be gone and your grass would grow better.
A10:04:49 <vede> You did it again!
A10:05:04 <Zedd> I did what again? >.<
A10:05:07 <Zedd> This is bothersome.
A10:05:10 <Marafk> afk.
A10:05:11 <LG_Legacy> Troll hunt
A10:05:12 <AndrewPH|MM> Young zedd
A10:05:13 <VurtualRuler98> Where you stop whining about OSes and just use the latest windows that you get with your computer parts for gaming machines, then use random linux distros for everything else.
A10:05:14 <PuyoDead> Indeed.
A10:05:20 <VurtualRuler98> That is the true OS>
A10:05:24 <AndrewPH|MM> you must stop trying to convince us that you are not a troll
A10:05:26 <LG_Legacy> Mah boi
A10:05:32 <AndrewPH|MM> also stop trying to convince us that osx is superior
A10:05:34 <LG_Legacy> This OS Is what all true warriors strive for.
A10:06:14 <PuyoDead> Hint: If you have to convince multiple people you are not a troll, at great length, chances are you are playing the part.
A10:06:39 <Zedd> Andrew, use whatever the fuck OS you like. I don't care. I --will-- be vocal about my own systems. 
A10:06:40 <PuyoDead> If you mean it or not, that's probably how it's going.
A10:06:57 <VurtualRuler98> I am actually the world's most skilled troll.
A10:07:04 <Zedd> PuyoDead ... sure. We'll go with that. I tired of arguments.
A10:07:08 <LG_Legacy> Welcome to #minecraft where bitching about a better OSX that you have, is considered trolling.
A10:07:09 <Zedd> *tire

13A10:10:44 * Zedd gives VurtualRuler98 a big box.

A10:10:48 <VurtualRuler98> Maybe a lego X-Wing, that'd be awesome.
A10:10:54 <smn> well, i did get a ps3
A10:10:57 <LG_Legacy> When i was a kid..
A10:11:03 <LG_Legacy> I use to be brutal with my legos
A10:11:06 <smn> for christmas, but not AT christmas this year
A10:11:08 <smn> >:|
A10:11:09 <VurtualRuler98> But on the upside, just before Christmas, I got all sorts of cool stuff.
A10:11:15 <PuyoDead> I still have most of my Legos.
A10:11:18 <LG_Legacy> I built cars, ships, tanks, and smashed them with different toys to test their might.
A10:11:19 <smn> same same, VurtualRuler98
A10:11:29 <LG_Legacy> Bouncy balls were REALLY fun to toy with Mechwarriors
A10:11:31 <VurtualRuler98> I have every last lego I've owned more or less, still available somewhere.
A10:11:33 <smn> but now all the joy is over
A10:11:34 <Griob> l4d2 any good?
A10:11:40 <LG_Legacy> Especially the mother-core top 'brain'
A10:11:41 <VurtualRuler98> Griob, yes.
A10:11:44 <LG_Legacy> It always fell off in two hits
A10:12:01 <VurtualRuler98> When I had legos, I had this ridiculously long story.
A10:12:05 <PuyoDead> But this is the most fun thing to do, although time consuming: Built model cars (the cheap plastic kind), then get a nice metal body model car. Wreck them into each other. Fun.
A10:12:08 <ez> well guys, I'm off to infiltrate the world now
A10:12:14 <PuyoDead> G'luck!

A10:12:43 <smn> i need to purchase me some Skate 2 today
A10:12:45 <LG_Legacy> None of the cars survived
A10:12:49 <LG_Legacy> And now i only have a few left
A10:12:50 <Marafk> most of text disappears after refresh
A10:13:12 <LG_Legacy> Nearly everyu toy i gotten from soneone, i basically destroyed.
A10:13:12 <VurtualRuler98> Then, my entire childhood was a story of how him, then later other guys were legendary heroes. Eventually there was a Star Trek style starship battling and the main guy was missing, so everyone was searching for the sword and trying to fight random skeletons and space pirates.
A10:13:17 <VurtualRuler98> My childhood was awesome.
A10:13:21 <PuyoDead> It's fun because the plastic model cars bust apart in all the little car pieces. I was a slightly destructive child.
A10:13:38 <LG_Legacy> My favorite were the plastic dolls. (Example: Buzz Lightyear.) I was the grim reaper, and would you believe a hockey-stick was a scythe? Fun times
A10:13:46 <Zedd> Destructive is fun, Puyo. :)
A10:13:47 <smn> <VurtualRuler98> My childhood was awesome. <-- !!! in '93, i got "my"(shared) first computer. from then on, my childhood was top-notch
A10:13:54 <Marafk> hey
A10:14:02 <Siiseli> my childhood was horrrible :D
A10:14:04 <Siiseli> yay
A10:14:05 <Marafk> bugs so far found on my ipod touch: http://marach.tk/download/iphone/
A10:14:07 <LG_Legacy> Man i massacred so many toys back in my childhood >_>
A10:14:14 <PuyoDead> I was still jammin' away on my SNES in '93.
A10:14:15 <VurtualRuler98> I had a tiny ship model I built out of a few pieces, then many baseplates and pieces that made up the whole ship interior.
A10:14:17 <Marafk> forums and colloquy
A10:14:28 <smn> <@Siiseli> my childhood was horrrible :D <--- my youth was, and, in some accounts, still is. if there is any youth left in me. :D
A10:14:34 <VurtualRuler98> I've had a computer since I can really remember.
A10:14:34 <LG_Legacy> Any model pieces i DESTROYED within contact
A10:14:48 <LG_Legacy> Whether planes on the walls, or tanks, or even plastic soldiers and cars with them.
A10:14:55 <LG_Legacy> That was fun with the grill, that was the best mission the yever had.
A10:15:06 <VurtualRuler98> But never really used them at first. Then, I got more into them, and only very recently(04-05) did I actually get a computer alll to myself, to do whatever.
A10:15:14 <smn> :3
A10:15:28 <LG_Legacy> Ah johnny's face was never the same
A10:15:31 <LG_Legacy> Neither was batman's
A10:15:31 <Siiseli> smn, yay
A10:15:49 <VurtualRuler98> And, then, shortly after, less than a year, I heard about Half-Life 2 Episode One on TV. I was like "ehh I'll probably never play that game", it was a review/walkthrough.
A10:15:51 <Siiseli> my childhood was full of divorce, fighting, alcoholic parents, bullying and stuff :D
A10:15:55 <Marafk> anyone opened it?
A10:16:00 <Marafk> :/
A10:16:03 <VurtualRuler98> Then it hit me. Half-Life.
A10:16:07 <VurtualRuler98> 2.
A10:16:15 <LG_Legacy> See VurtualRuler98
A10:16:45 <LG_Legacy> Back in my day, we cooped up inside the homes in the '90s playing Vidya games like Metal Gear Solid, Duke Nukem 64, Zelda OoT, Command and Conquer, Oddworld, Time Crisis.
A10:16:48 <smn> my youth was full of false friends, broken relation ships (read: teen drama), social anxieties and alcohol... the latter of which might just be the last piece of youth left :D
A10:16:56 <smn> relationships*
A10:17:02 <VurtualRuler98> I rushed to find out more, this was later. They had made a Half-Life 2, and I eagerly looked into this. Ended up buying Portal and Garry's Mod, and Half-Life 2 a bit after.
A10:17:10 <LG_Legacy> See SMN? I've had half of that but vidya games helped me :D
A10:17:16 <smn> harr :D
A10:17:16 <VurtualRuler98> That got me into the internet even more, which brought me here.

A10:18:22 <LG_Legacy> Really..
A10:18:25 <VurtualRuler98> Then one time I punched him, and he stopped being mean.

A10:19:35 <LG_Legacy> I played with ALOT of army men
A10:19:40 <LG_Legacy> And brought it everywhere
A10:19:41 <VurtualRuler98> I had a toy rifle, and a halloween costume of a soldier which came with grenades and a plastic knife.
A10:19:51 <smn> but the grenades were real? =O
A10:20:06 <VurtualRuler98> Well one style had a ring you could pull.
A10:20:10 <smn> ahh
A10:20:49 <VurtualRuler98> My rifle was a SIG SG 550 something, I still have it.
A10:21:15 <smn> booya!
A10:21:23 <VurtualRuler98> If you pull the trigger, it goes bbrrrrzzzt with a weird mechanism, and has roughly 24 brzt-ings, each one being like a bullet.
A10:22:19 <VurtualRuler98> The slide was a red circle thing, and that served as the ammo mechanism. It'd go forward while you were firing, and you pulled back to reload.
A10:22:25 <VurtualRuler98> Actually, I was alot older when I hadthat.

P1:29:39 <bildramer> what's the Archivist? A client or a client wrapper?
P1:29:47 <gdude2002> It's a client.
P1:29:49 <gdude2002> a bot, to be exact.
P1:30:00 <Animator> The Archivist archives maps.
P1:30:06 <gdude2002> yeah.
P1:30:10 <gdude2002> It has its own client.
P1:30:15 <gdude2002> Which is really the server.
P1:30:15 <bildramer> so, it gets the map data and doesn't move at all? :/
P1:30:19 <gdude2002> Yep
P1:30:20 <Animator> It's the bot that allows the history of a map to be seen with 3 specific commands.
P1:30:24 <Animator> Exactly.
P1:30:31 <Ten_Tacles> lol nice
P1:30:52 <Animator> It works for any server that's been spidered as well.
P1:31:12 <Ten_Tacles> FUCK epic lag
P1:31:19 <bildramer> :?
P1:31:31 <Animator> The worlds originally served as a place to show previous maps and explore in them.
P1:31:46 <Snowman> Like Yggdrasil
P1:31:48 <Ten_Tacles> 4 times minecraft is too much
P1:31:58 <gdude2002> God, Iremember Yggdrasil
P1:32:00 <gdude2002> that was ftw
P1:32:00 <Animator> Dating back to the first instance a map (from any spidered server) was made.
P1:32:07 <Ten_Tacles> what was Yggdrasil?
P1:32:14 <Animator> A giant tree.
P1:32:14 <Snowman> Huge fucking tree
P1:32:24 <Animator> Made by TrueWolves.
P1:32:30 <gdude2002> It was so epicly win though
P1:32:40 <Ten_Tacles> coool
P1:32:56 <Ten_Tacles> no one wants to play strategic minecraft today?

P4:42:26 <Shadaez> wow 8 eyra olds :\
P4:42:34 <Shadaez> I didn't have a cell till I was 18
P4:42:34 <Siiseli> bildramer, yes, it will
P4:42:50 <Shadaez> (I am 20 now)
P4:42:52 <Siiseli> wow that's weird
P4:43:34 <vede> 1) eight-year-olds don't need a goddamn cell phone 2) her ringtone was NOT suitable for small children 3) eight-year-olds don't have boyfriends 4) eight-year-olds don't have teen drama involving skanky ten-year-old bitches
P4:43:43 <Koitenshin> I think its the way the 8-year old is acting that's more appalling.
P4:44:25 <Animator> I blame artificial hormones, vede.
P4:44:35 <copyboy> vede: right in the face, man. right in the face
P4:44:38 <Ashleigh> I'm 16 with a cell. Is that bad?
P4:44:44 <copyboy> (kiss her)
P4:45:00 <Shadaez> no
P4:45:09 <vede> 15 or 16 I can understand.
P4:45:15 <Shadaez> I think 12-14 is young enough :/
P4:45:21 <vede> 12-14 is pushing it.
P4:45:35 <copyboy> i don't have one
P4:45:38 <Shadaez> 12 maybe, 14 eh. But anythign under 12 doesn't need one.

P4:45:44 <vede> I'm sixteen and I don't have one.
P4:45:57 <EmpiresBane> i remember reading about this kid in kindergarten called 911 like 40 times

P4:46:27 <copyboy> it's the internet
P4:46:31 <Shadaez> it's so weird how careless people are now.
P4:46:36 <copyboy> making young people dumb
P4:46:47 <vede> I mean, the most a little kid really might NEED is a portable 911 dialer plus GPS locator, in case of some crazy emergency.
P4:46:48 <mail2345> internet: does not inherently make people dumb
P4:46:52 <Shadaez> I remember when I was a kid and called 911 on accident (was pressing phone buttons cuz i waz kewl) I was so scared.
P4:46:52 <EmpiresBane> they've always been careless, it's just reported now
P4:47:18 <mail2345> internet: abuse of makes people dumb
P4:47:42 <Shadaez> Just look at lamebook for a while. :\

P6:35:01 <Koitenshin> Minecraft was only getting boring because you werent building anything EPIC.
P6:35:55 <Koitenshin> Think we can get Notch to make progressive loading like in MMO's so we can have insane map sizes?
P6:36:07 <Shadaez> progressive loading?
P6:36:19 <Shadaez> I think I understnad
P6:36:34 <Koitenshin> Basically it only loads a certain range beyond where you're standing
P6:36:45 <Koitenshin> Like if I'm at this corner of the map
P6:36:45 <Shadaez> that would be a good idea
P6:36:54 <Koitenshin> I don't need to know what you're doing on the other side
P6:37:20 <Shadaez> unless your drawdistance is max..
P6:37:45 <Koitenshin> even with drawdistance max I wouldn't necessarily see you
P6:38:15 <Shadaez> but when you get close enough it would go from what you used to see to what they've built since then
P6:38:22 <Koitenshin> Yes.
P6:38:29 <mail2345|game> we can get progressive loading
P6:38:33 <mail2345|game> with custom servs
P6:38:33 <Koitenshin> only updating chunks when it needs to
P6:38:47 <Shadaez> custom != minecraft imo
P6:39:09 <Koitenshin> I just want a 4096x409 server =/
P6:39:17 <Koitenshin> *4096x4096
P6:39:22 <Shadaez> 409?
P6:39:24 <Shadaez> k lol
P6:41:56 <Aeomin> progressive loading would be cool..
P6:43:15 <gm|lap> Koitenshin: how high?
P6:43:29 <Ashleigh> The problem with progressive loading is the client.
P6:43:36 <Ashleigh> It can't "unload" the data.
P6:43:38 <gm|lap> because that's 16MB a tier
P6:43:45 <Ashleigh> So it causes an overflow
P6:43:49 <Ashleigh> And dies.
P6:44:09 <Koitenshin> will if my progressive loading were enabled
P6:44:16 <Koitenshin> theoretically unlimited
P6:44:22 <Ashleigh> No.
P6:44:31 <Ashleigh> The client doesn't "unload" map data.
P6:44:32 <gm|lap> while COMPRESSED it's usually not too bad, it's still 16MB a tier at least on the server side.
P6:44:35 <Koitenshin> If it unloaded the data
P6:44:42 <Ashleigh> It doesn't though.
P6:44:46 <Ashleigh> So it's IMPOSSIBLE.
P6:44:49 <Koitenshin> like I said, if
P6:45:06 <Ashleigh> Notch would have to code that in.
P6:45:12 <gm|lap> also, 4096x4096 will make players look all screwy as the player coordinates are 11.5-bit fixed-point
P6:45:13 <Koitenshin> Well then GM it's up to whomever is running the server
P6:45:31 <gm|lap> so 2048x2048 should fix the screwyness
P6:45:43 <Koitenshin> well then 2048x2048
P6:45:50 <gm|lap> that's the maximum without making it look like everyone's in the top-left corner
P6:45:53 <Koitenshin> I just want something bigger than 256x256x256 for right now
P6:45:54 <vede> Okay, did you seriously just say 11.5-bit?
P6:45:57 <Koitenshin> that doesnt break
P6:46:07 <gm|lap> vede: it's fixed-point
P6:46:13 <gm|lap> the integer itself is 16-bit
P6:46:14 <vede> You can't have half a bit.
P6:46:27 <vede> It just doesn't work.
P6:46:31 <gm|lap> i meant 5 bits for the fraction
P6:46:53 <gm|lap> and 11 bits for the... can't remember what it's called
P6:46:54 <Ashleigh> That makes no sense.

P6:47:21 <EmpiresBane> no
P6:47:22 <Ashleigh> By my logic.
P6:47:43 <EmpiresBane> it's a real number
P6:47:43 <vede> And I'm pretty sure that would be called a float, or a floating point, not fixed-point.
P6:47:43 <Ashleigh> Unless you mean (11*8)+5
P6:47:51 <Koitenshin> 11 bit and a nibble?
P6:48:20 <Koitenshin> IIRC nibble is the right word
P6:48:51 <vede> And even then, you're still wrong, since there's been a 16x16x<some number over 30000> map made.
P6:49:21 <Ashleigh> Error  Line 10, Column 76: Attribute "ALIGN" is not a valid attribute. Did you mean "align"?
P6:49:26 <Ashleigh> cellspacing="0" class="container" align="center">
P6:49:27 <vede> I believe a nibble is four bits.
P6:49:28 <vede> Not five.
P6:50:42 <Ashleigh> Strict HTML is stupid.
P6:50:56 <Ashleigh> There is no way to center align tables in CSS properly.
P6:51:12 <Ashleigh> And there is no usage of align="" allowed on elements.
P6:51:16 <Koitenshin> a nibble is 4-7 bits so HA
P6:51:26 <Koitenshin> a byte and a nibble
P6:51:28 <vede> DAMMIT
P6:51:43 <Koitenshin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28data%29
P6:51:57 <Ashleigh> This is a pointless conversation.
P6:52:02 <Ashleigh> /idles
P6:52:05 <vede> Waaaait.
P6:52:06 <vede> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble
P6:52:17 <vede> "In computing, a nibble (often, nybble) is a four-bit aggregation"
P6:52:34 <Koitenshin> Historically, there have been cases where the term "nybble" was used for a set of bits fewer than 8
P6:52:36 <Koitenshin> :P
P6:52:40 <vede> We're talking specifically about computing here.
P6:52:45 <Koitenshin> so thus, a nibble is 4-7 bits
P6:52:46 <gm|lap> a nibble is 4 bits
P6:52:50 <gm|lap> i believe
P6:52:54 <vede> A nibble is four bits.
P6:52:57 <Koitenshin> 4-7
P6:53:03 <Koitenshin> look at the first wiki link
P6:53:03 <vede> No, four.
P6:53:11 <gm|lap> well, these days it's 4
P6:53:21 <Koitenshin> it's still 4-7
P6:53:31 <vede> Well, look at the second wiki link.
P6:53:40 <vede> The second is far more specific than the one you linked.
P6:53:41 <Koitenshin> Then it needs to be corrected
P6:53:46 <vede> Seeing how it's about nibbles only.
P6:53:50 <Koitenshin> Well what I pasted
P6:53:54 <Koitenshin> is from your link
P6:53:54 <Koitenshin> Historically, there have been cases where the term "nybble" was used for a set of bits fewer than 8
P6:54:20 <Koitenshin> but not necessarily 4
P6:54:47 <Shadaez> how about we just yse bits and bytes
P6:54:48 <vede> Well, firstly, we are talking about computers.
P6:55:00 <vede> Computers tend to have trouble dealing with things which aren't powers of two.
10P6:55:06 * PickYerPoison is now known as PYP|AFK
P6:55:14 <Shadaez> But I agree on the 4.
P6:55:23 <Koitenshin> Writing data to a disk was done by converting 256-byte pages into sets of 5-bit or, later, 6-bit nibbles
P6:55:27 <Shadaez> I can call my poop candy but it doesn't make it so.
P6:55:28 <Koitenshin> Apple II
P6:55:43 <vede> It's commonly accepted that a nibble is four bits.
P6:55:48 <vede> A byte is eight bits.
P6:55:53 <vede> And so on.
P6:55:54 <vede> So...
P6:55:56 <vede> STFU.

P8:32:27 <Roadcrosser> SO LAGGGY
P8:32:38 <AotC> between java and python i'd have to go with java
P8:32:50 <AotC> although those options are pretty limited
P8:33:32 <PoF59> Seeing as you two are the only actual voters on this, I guess Java's it. What you DON'T get is this is my FIRST, not last
P8:33:46 <PoF59> I'm going to try others as I get better
P8:33:49 <AotC> heh
P8:33:51 <AotC> look up C#
P8:34:05 <Shadaez> I have a C# book here.

P8:46:53 <mail2345> well actually depends on what your aiming for
P8:47:06 <mail2345> python is best for casual use
P8:47:12 <mail2345> but companies frown on it
P8:47:21 <Koitenshin> He wants to get familiar with syntax and command usage
P8:47:40 <mail2345> python is a good starter in general
P8:47:48 <mail2345> not too much synthax to learn
P8:48:08 <mail2345> and you can still learn the ideas in programming
P8:49:14 <PoF59> And now I'm again, torn. Thanks guys. Thanks a bunch. XD
P8:49:22 <Koitenshin> You're welcome.
P8:49:23 <Shadaez> wtf
P8:49:25 <Koitenshin> We do our best.
P8:49:30 <Shadaez> mail get out java>p
P8:49:44 <mail2345> i really don't know much about java
P8:49:47 <Koitenshin> If he wants to learn Java I put my vote in for java
P8:49:50 <mail2345> besides that it's heavy on classess
P8:50:07 <Shadaez> pythons so light huh
P8:50:15 <mail2345> that's not what i was saying
P8:50:18 <mail2345> i'll use a better word
P8:50:20 <mail2345> focused
P8:50:28 <Koitenshin> Aside from everyone being forced to install it.
P8:50:54 <Brett> If you don't have some form of a JVM at this point you're doing it wrong

P8:51:17 <mail2345> anyway
P8:51:19 <Shadaez> hopefully
P8:51:20 <Koitenshin> Oh....I'm thinking OOOOLD Python then
P8:51:26 <mail2345> python programs can be wrapped into a seperate exe
P8:51:31 <mail2345> or whatever type of executable
P8:51:51 <Shadaez> Whatever just got with Python, it's super easy to learn and then you'll be over it in a week and move onto a real language.
P8:52:03 <Shadaez> Then be confused again.
P8:52:26 <mail2345> python is a real language
P8:52:30 <Shadaez> psh.
P8:52:32 <Brett> I would start with Java. The exception handling and reporting is great.
P8:52:40 <PoF59> Fuck it. It's now based on my brother. If I can borrow the book, java. If not, Python. Why the hell not.
P8:52:51 <PoF59> In fact

P8:56:28 <Shadaez> I havn't learned python tbh, but I believe it's a simple language and would be easy to learn, but you really won't learn much..?
P8:56:47 <Brett> you'll learn typing and oop concepts and stuff
P8:56:51 <Brett> basic language constructs
P8:57:07 <PoF59> 10pm. I used to be horrible at sleeping at night, and still not great, so it's really to let me fall asleep B4 12

P10:01:55 <Jat> perhaps you should give the thread a more informative title so people who see it in the list of threads and go fuck it

P10:02:10 <Jat> that was not a coherent thought

P10:05:45 <Animator> But it's not the Archives.
P10:05:55 <Animator> Nor it's forum. That is very odd.
P10:07:07 <Animator> The question is, what is it?
P10:07:48 <Koitenshin> Hey Animator
P10:08:05 <Koitenshin> can you go here and threaten them with banning if they provide information to hack around -hax
P10:08:05 <Koitenshin> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=4854
P10:08:40 <Koitenshin> Some moron is already asking
P10:09:11 <mail2345> Herrode is annoying
P10:09:24 <mail2345> THE CURRENT INVALID CHAR SOLUTION ALREADY WORKS
P10:09:30 <mail2345> WHY THE FUCK DOES IT NEED TO BE CHANGED
P10:10:21 <Animator> I'll keep Herrode on my "BITCH BETTA WATCH'CHO BACK" list.
P10:10:42 <mail2345> i just realised
P10:10:52 <mail2345> all of the retarded posts from him
P10:11:00 <mail2345> in regards to invalid chars
P10:11:06 <mail2345> are justification for his griefing
P10:11:55 <mail2345> i honestly think herrode is another lailai
P10:12:12 <mail2345> but with half assed internal justification for his actions
P10:12:30 <mail2345> atleast lailai knew what he was doing was wrong
10P10:12:33 * afk_legacy is now known as LG_Legacy

P10:15:16 <mail2345> but without the hostile overtones
P10:16:12 <Animator> It's not really a bashing thread, more like something to get people aware about.
P10:16:17 <Animator> It can turn into one, though.
P10:16:25 <PuyoDead> Oh, it will.
P10:17:52 <mail2345> there are hostile overtones
P10:17:58 <mail2345> primarily in the words hostile
P10:18:00 <mail2345> and bullshit
P10:18:02 <mail2345> err

P10:18:14 <mail2345> i need to get a RAM upgrade
P10:18:29 <mail2345> what's a good, stable and cheap brand of RAM?
P10:18:52 <Shadaez> newegg, sort by price, get the cheapeast one with 4+ star rating

P10:23:49 <Animator> Yeah, I ask the same thing.
P10:24:04 <PuyoDead> Probably some old test or somesuch.
P10:24:21 <Animator> I dunno, Puyo.
P10:24:41 <Animator> Maybe Aera's starting up competition against us.
P10:24:54 <LG_Legacy> Pfft

P10:25:10 <LG_Legacy> He's a admin on these!
P10:25:16 <LG_Legacy> So it's like a time paradox

P10:50:05 <Koitenshin> It's really simple once you play with it.
P10:50:13 <Koitenshin> and the basic version is free
P10:50:25 <Jat> yeah
P10:50:27 <Koitenshin> just export a heightmap in bmp format and import into omen
