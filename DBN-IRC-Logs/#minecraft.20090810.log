A5:27:46 <ChJees> I wonder why everyone think Monster X is hard
A5:27:52 <ChJees> That boss was piss easy
A5:28:10 <UnknownX> ChJees did you beat the final boss?
A5:28:30 <ChJees> Hasn't played much further after i let "Robot girl" die :p
A5:28:44 <UnknownX> Then you can't beat the game
10A5:28:56 * C419 is now known as C418
10A5:29:00 * ChanServ sets mode: +o C418
A5:29:15 <UnknownX> You have to have her to beat it
A5:29:29 <ChJees> For Good Ending
A5:30:14 <UnknownX> ChJees: The neutral ending isn't the real ending 
A5:31:42 <UnknownX> You have to get the good ending to actually beat the final boss
A5:32:32 <ChJees> There is so much in Cave Story that could had been better
A5:32:57 <ChJees> Like making the Rocket Launcher useful
A5:33:09 <ChJees> The Bubbler is even more useful than it
A5:33:09 <UnknownX> It is useful
A5:33:35 <UnknownX> Without the rocket launcher the fourth form of the final boss is hell

A5:36:24 <UnknownX> Which Boss are you talking about?
A5:36:31 <Evil-Ville> ballos
A5:37:03 <UnknownX> Theres a glitch that you can beat the fourth form in less than 3 seconds with the rocket launcher
A5:37:20 <Evil-Ville> Yes well I didn't know that and it still wasn't hard
A5:37:40 <UnknownX> Its hard when you have 3 hp and its your only option
A5:38:19 <Evil-Ville> Why would you have 3 hp
A5:38:47 <UnknownX> Because i can't dodge the spikes at all
A5:40:25 <Evil-Ville> I don't even remember any spikes

A6:22:16 <lailai> but I can't
A6:22:28 <lailai> it says Connecting then The Server Is Prob Down

A6:29:16 <LG_Legacy> ?
A6:29:25 <lailai> ok
A6:29:26 <LG_Legacy> Firewall or router blocking.
A6:29:39 <LG_Legacy> If none, then anti-virus
A6:29:45 <lailai> I disabled my firewall and anti-virus
A6:29:49 <LG_Legacy> Router?
A6:29:57 <lailai> How do I check that?
A6:30:05 <LG_Legacy> .. >_> Do you have a router?
A6:30:05 <venn177> go to your router's IP
A6:30:13 <lailai> yes I have a rounter
A6:30:16 <venn177> it's normally something like 192.168.1.1
A6:30:18 <LG_Legacy> Rounter... heh.
A6:30:21 <LG_Legacy> What type/company?
A6:30:23 <LG_Legacy> Linksys?
A6:30:27 <lailai> Mine is http://10.0.0.138/
A6:30:30 <venn177> OH
A6:30:30 <venn177> WAIT
A6:30:31 <venn177> I KNOW
A6:30:32 <lailai> I'm using 2Wire
A6:30:34 <venn177> turn verify names off
A6:30:39 <LG_Legacy> Uh..
A6:30:40 <LG_Legacy> No
A6:30:41 <venn177> you can't connect to your own server if it's on
A6:30:46 <LG_Legacy> It's server is down.
A6:30:50 <LG_Legacy> Not illegal name
A6:30:53 <LG_Legacy> Anyways
A6:30:55 <venn177> oh
A6:30:58 <venn177> fuck me sideways
A6:31:01 <LG_Legacy> Sure
A6:31:02 <venn177> wasn't paying attention
A6:31:02 <LG_Legacy> Lay down
A6:31:07 <LG_Legacy> Lailai
A6:31:11 <lailai> yes?
A6:31:13 <LG_Legacy> Do you know how to port-forward?
A6:31:21 <lailai> Yes I port forwarded
A6:31:28 <LG_Legacy> Are you running windows?
A6:31:31 <lailai> yes
A6:31:34 <venn177> If other people can connect, but he can't, it's obviously not a port issue
A6:31:39 <LG_Legacy> Is your internal ip correct?
A6:32:02 <lailai> umm, what?
A6:32:16 <LG_Legacy> Is your internal/router ip correct from the one in dos to your router?
A6:32:28 <LG_Legacy> Or in basic terms:
A6:32:33 <lailai> You mean http://10.0.0.138/?
A6:32:38 <LG_Legacy> Maybe
A6:32:44 <LG_Legacy> I got an idea
A6:32:51 <LG_Legacy> Do you have to put in numbers for your port-forwarding?
10A6:32:54 * H4X_ (chatzilla@c220-237-76-239.kelvn1.qld.optusnet.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A6:33:06 <lailai> well it says I need to put
A6:33:14 <lailai> port range, i set it to 25565 to 25565
A6:33:18 <LG_Legacy> Besides that
A6:33:21 <lailai> then it says timeout, i set it as defualt
10A6:33:26 * H4X_ is now known as bob_the_builder_
A6:33:34 <LG_Legacy> Theres a part in which you place part of your ip, do you see that?
A6:33:34 <venn177> there should be something where you can make the option TCP/UDP
10A6:33:35 * bob_the_builder_ is now known as bob_the_builder
A6:33:37 <lailai> 124.184.247.107
A6:33:39 <lailai> yes
A6:33:46 <LG_Legacy> Part of your ip
A6:33:46 <lailai> I set it to TCP and I also
A6:33:51 <venn177> Set it to both, lailai
A6:33:52 <lailai> added a new one, set it as UDP
A6:33:52 <LG_Legacy> Not the full ip
A6:34:10 <LG_Legacy> Your port-forward only accepts internal ips
A6:34:19 <lailai> You mean private IP?
10A6:34:26 * Kapow (kapox@c-68-82-107-29.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A6:34:33 <LG_Legacy> The ipconfig in dos.
A6:34:36 <LG_Legacy> You'll find it there
A6:34:41 <lailai> you mean CMD?
A6:34:49 <LG_Legacy> Run>Cmd>Ipconfig
A6:35:10 <LG_Legacy> You'll find your router ip, usually you need to input the last digits on the third period.
A6:35:10 <lailai> done that.
A6:35:17 <LG_Legacy> Normally anyways
A6:35:20 <LG_Legacy> However
A6:35:21 <lailai> Defualt gateway?
A6:35:37 <LG_Legacy> Ip Address
A6:35:44 <lailai> IPv4?
A6:35:48 <LG_Legacy> Uh... yeah
A6:35:51 <lailai> 10.0.0.5
A6:36:07 <LG_Legacy> Then you may want to put in 5 where your ip should go in your port-forward section
A6:36:08 <lailai> for Wireless WAN adapter
A6:36:14 <LG_Legacy> Aw geez wireless..
A6:36:34 <lailai> yes I use wireless
A6:36:46 <LG_Legacy> Either way... put 5 where the ip should go
A6:36:51 <LG_Legacy> I'm going to try to find guides on this
A6:37:04 <lailai> for Port (or Range): what do I put?
A6:37:13 <lailai> From: To:
A6:37:17 <LG_Legacy> The port? Is just the port for the default minecraft server
A6:37:27 <lailai> So From 25565 To 25565?
A6:37:42 <LG_Legacy> Yes
A6:37:47 <lailai> Protocol Timeout (seconds): do I leave it?
A6:38:08 <LG_Legacy> Do you know the model number for your router? And leave it for now.
A6:38:12 <lailai> Map to Host Port: what do I do here?
A6:38:20 <lailai> 2701HGV-W
A6:39:20 <LG_Legacy> Huh.
A6:39:31 <LG_Legacy> Yeah leave map to host port
A6:39:39 <lailai> So 25565?
A6:39:47 <lailai> Default = the same port as defined above.
A6:39:47 <LG_Legacy> Only in the range
A6:39:59 <lailai> So do I give it a random number between 1 and 255?
A6:40:04 <LG_Legacy> It appears you don't need to input an ip, nor need to add any extra ports to the other two sections.
A6:40:29 <lailai> Well this is all input fields I got
A6:40:34 <LG_Legacy> Of course
A6:40:48 <LG_Legacy> Just accept it the way it is, if you have another application/setting with the same port, rid of it.
A6:41:10 <LG_Legacy> Opening the port twice (Unless it's seperate protocool such as UDP.) will only close it.
A6:41:10 <lailai> Ok I'll try it
A6:41:49 <lailai> Uhh, I opened twice. TCP and UDP
A6:41:59 <LG_Legacy> Then it's fine.
A6:42:02 <lailai> Protocol  	Port (or Range)  	Host Port  	Timeout (sec) TCP 	25565 	88 	86400 	 UDP 	25565 	88 	600
A6:42:24 <LG_Legacy> I question those other nuymbers

A6:43:05 <LG_Legacy> I question 88 and 86400 and 600.
A6:43:09 <LG_Legacy> Did you add those?
A6:43:14 <lailai> 86400 is Timeout
A6:43:22 <LG_Legacy> I know but did you manually add em?
A6:43:31 <lailai> no, default
A6:43:43 <LG_Legacy> Oh... alright then, something else is blocking you from connecting then.
A6:43:51 <LG_Legacy> Are you sure all firewalls/spyware/anti-virus is off?
A6:44:02 <lailai> Yes
A6:44:32 <LG_Legacy> Then there should be nothing wrong, unless your router scrwed something up and didn't port-forward itself.

A9:33:28 <Chrstfer> hi all
A9:33:35 <Chrstfer> plz talk!
A9:33:36 <LucanC> herro
A9:33:40 <Chrstfer> hey luc
A9:33:53 <Chrstfer> notch been on recently?
A9:34:10 <citricsquid> he'll be here tomorrow.
A9:34:15 <Chrstfer> yay
A9:34:40 <Chrstfer> citric wen u set teh servers up add a donation box, with perks for donators. id donate.
A9:34:51 <citricsquid> k
A9:35:19 <Chrstfer> just dont make i a crappy "you can donate, but u only get perks if u donate 5 dollers or over" or some shit like that! =P
A9:35:35 <citricsquid> uh, donating any less is pointless.
A9:35:38 <citricsquid> What use is $0.20?
A9:35:57 <Chrstfer> WEL MAKE IT LIKE A DOLLER
13A9:36:03 * PuyoDead gives citric 73 cents
A9:36:04 <Chrstfer> crapp
A9:36:09 <Chrstfer> srry for caps. 
A9:36:14 <PuyoDead> what's a doller?
A9:36:38 <citricsquid> I don't *need* donations and I'm not going to make people, the minimum amount will be $5, anything less isn't really worth the effort. In fact, <$10 isn't worth the effort, but $5 will do ;)
A9:36:43 <PuyoDead> is that some weird spanish currency?
A9:37:21 <Chrstfer> y would u have a mininum on ppeeps trying to halp u?
A9:37:34 <citricsquid> Chrstfer: uh, Paypal fees and tax.
A9:38:17 <Chrstfer> true. but fees are only a percen tage, as are tax. you stil come out ahead, one way or another
A9:39:11 <Underd0g> i like currency
A9:39:17 <Chrstfer> anyoneknow y zachariassmiths spleef aint been up recently?
A9:40:01 <citricsquid> Chrstfer: $0.30 + 4% is paypal fees, 10 people sending me $1 really isn't going to be worth the effort of managing it all. Furthermore, donating should be to support a service NOT for the "perks", donating $1 doesn't do anything and it seems silly donating just for the perks. I appreciate people wanting to donate, but I don't *need* it and if people are going to, I don't want them donating just for the sake of it.
A9:40:41 <Chrstfer> ok.
A9:40:48 <Chrstfer> but there should be perks.
A9:41:02 <Chrstfer> and th min should be three dollars. (thats all i have)
A9:41:09 <Chrstfer> DONT JUDGE ME!
A9:42:27 <LucanC> what kind of perks chrst?
A9:42:54 <Chrstfer> idk. stuff tho
A9:44:29 <PuyoDead> you want perks (for your own gain) by donating the smallest amount possible. lovely.
A9:45:01 <LucanC> I'd expect someone to donate at least $20 for perks.
A9:45:02 <triddin_> 1c
A9:45:04 <Chrstfer> no. i want perks for helping citric, by giving him all the money in mah paypal.
A9:45:23 <Chrstfer> i have but 3.57 cents in mah paypal

P12:06:15 <Miclee> Find files that look suspicious.
P12:06:19 <Miclee> Then search about them.
P12:06:29 <Darke> Also, when I do run it in normal mode, I quickly terminate a process before it finishes starting
P12:06:38 <Darke> And then WINDOWS ran fine, except antivirus stuff
P12:06:55 <Darke> But then I check my processes again, and BAM b.exe is there

P12:07:10 <offset> b.exe, not half sus

P12:08:04 <Miclee> Important: Some malware camouflage themselves as b.exe, particularly if they are located in c:\windows or c:\windows\system32 folder. 
P12:08:10 <Darke> I know

P1:07:37 <megachad> Hi all, I was just wondering if anyone could please help me setting up a server. I've opened my port, all the settings should be okay, but still I can't manage to connect to it.  So if anyone has an idea of what I might've done wrong, this would help a lot. Thanks
P1:08:28 <megachad> Oh and I'm on windows xp by the way, if that helps.
P1:08:58 <PuyoDead> you're trying to connect your own serveR?
P1:09:04 <PuyoDead> minus that caps r
P1:09:11 <megachad> well from a remote pc, yes
P1:09:19 <megachad> well, the pc is on the same network though
P1:09:49 <PuyoDead> hmm, try this: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
P1:10:09 <megachad> okay I'll try this
P1:10:48 <megachad> "Connection lost. Illegal name"
P1:10:59 <megachad> no luck there

P1:11:19 <mariopro766> mine do'nt work
P1:11:26 <PuyoDead> I've really no idea why it gives that error
P1:11:44 <Bob> try the intern ip, something like 10.0.0.2
P1:11:46 <PuyoDead> you could try taking off verify names, but that's risky
P1:12:51 <megachad> doesn't work eithe with public IP or external URL, both of those simply show "Failed to connect. You failed to connect to the server, it's probably down"
P1:12:54 <kalanosh> megachad what is the server os running?
P1:13:19 <kalanosh> never mind just read xp
P1:13:50 <kalanosh> you sure the port is open?
P1:13:52 <megachad> I' getting the same result with my static private IP
P1:14:13 <kalanosh> and windows firewall is disabled or allows that program through?
P1:14:17 <megachad> yeah the port was opened at least, and preobably still is
P1:14:29 <megachad> I've opened it but I might just as well double check
P1:14:57 <kalanosh> make sure your port is forward to the host computer first from your router utility, and then double check the host firewall is allowing the conncetion out
P1:15:45 <megachad> when I look at my server it says kicking /<the IP I entered in the url> : Illegals name
P1:16:25 <kalanosh> verify names is on?
P1:16:41 <kalanosh> also check your max conncetion setting in your server porperties file
P1:16:53 <Quatroking> wtf?
P1:16:54 <megachad> yeah certainly, I haven't touched that, which file do I edit to turn it off?
P1:16:54 <kalanosh> makes sure its set to max_connection=3 hell even 4

P9:25:44 <alkan> so wat is python
P9:25:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> hang on
P9:25:54 <SyntheticLight> Programming language
P9:26:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'll describe it in my own words
P9:26:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.

P9:27:02 <SyntheticLight> Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language.[2] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability.[3] Python claims to "[combine] remarkable power with very clear syntax",[4] and its standard library is large and comprehensive. Its use of indentation as block delimiters is unusual among popular programming languages.
P9:27:02 <SyntheticLight> Python supports multiple programming paradigms (primarily object oriented, imperative, and functional) and features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language.
P9:27:02 <SyntheticLight> The language has an open, community-based development model managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation, which maintains the de facto standard definition of the language in CPython, the reference implementation.
P9:27:16 <AnnihilatorBeta> Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, OS/2, Amiga, Palm Handhelds, and Nokia mobile phones. Python has also been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines.
P9:27:18 <SyntheticLight> :D
P9:27:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> Python is distributed under an OSI-approved open source license that makes it free to use, even for commercial products.
