A12:01:15 <PuyoDead> it is a nice one, though
A12:01:32 <Wolfram> Agreed
A12:01:34 <Wolfram> That's why I chose it
A12:01:38 <Wolfram> That and I never see it around
A12:03:08 <PuyoDead> yea, I don't think I have

10A12:05:41 * Nalok is now known as SleepingNalok

A12:07:43 <Super-Dot> Connected cubes?
A12:08:06 <Adura> Are you sure it's not a pre-existing logo?
A12:08:14 <PuyoDead> the two cube outlines, interconnected
A12:08:39 <PuyoDead> well, I hadn't seen them anywhere at all this whole time... until I made some on reddit once. the next day, and every day since, I'm seeing them all over

A12:08:51 <Adura> It seems like a logo I've seen before.
A12:09:02 <PuyoDead> could very well be
A12:09:43 <Wolfram> What's all this?
A12:09:47 <Wolfram> Connected cubes?
A12:10:33 <PuyoDead> just a simple outline of a cube, where each corner is inside another
A12:10:40 <PuyoDead> well, one corner
A12:10:55 <Wolfram> Aha.
A12:11:32 <vdgmprgrmr> A tesseract?
A12:11:43 <PuyoDead> is that it?
A12:12:18 <PuyoDead> oh, no
A12:12:41 <Super-Dot> Aha, found one
A12:12:45 <Super-Dot> Or I guess two
A12:12:49 <Super-Dot> By which I mean four
A12:12:59 <Super-Dot> I found four cubes connected in pairs
A12:13:19 <Super-Dot> And I haven't seen such connected cubes before, so I think you did start it, yeah
A12:13:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, I think I understand what you're saying.
A12:13:52 <Adura> I'm actually reminded of a program icon, just can't remember the name.
A12:14:25 <PuyoDead> yea, there are at leasy 7 on reddit right now
A12:14:32 <PuyoDead> I've created a monster
A12:15:41 <PuyoDead> http://img67.imageshack.us/img67/9789/minecraftcubes.jpg
A12:16:58 <Adura> VMWare's icon is pretty close.
A12:17:21 <PuyoDead> hmm, yea, I can see that

A12:18:03 <Adura> Using VMWare recently?
A12:18:09 <PuyoDead> hah, no, not at all
A12:18:14 <PuyoDead> I used those colors because of portal
A12:18:16 <Adura> Heh.
A12:18:32 <PuyoDead> wait... brie? you ass, griefed the hell out of my server earlier tonight
A12:18:40 <PuyoDead> if, y'know... that's the same guy
A12:18:42 <brie> whaat?
A12:18:53 <PuyoDead> well, in that case, you share the name with one
A12:20:16 <Wolfram> Pop quiz
A12:20:22 <PuyoDead> yup, if you don't already use that name, you might want to watch out 22:37:46  Mar_Krishamun says: brie is a greifer!!!!

A12:20:23 <Wolfram> What happens when you deal with boiling water
A12:20:30 <Wolfram> And you don't happen to be wearing a shirt?
A12:20:49 <PuyoDead> I'm guessing there's pain involved
10A12:20:56 * brie (brie@67.171.143.49) has joined #minecraft
A12:21:01 <Wolfram> Oh no
A12:21:02 <Wolfram> I was just asking
A12:21:17 <PuyoDead> oh, in that case, pretty much nothing
A12:21:26 <Wolfram> You fail
A12:21:28 <Wolfram> There was pain
A12:21:38 <Wolfram> I was trying to stir macaroni and like
A12:21:42 <Wolfram> scrape the burnt pieces from the bottom
A12:21:51 <Wolfram> And in a brilliant moment I pulled towards myself
A12:21:59 <PuyoDead> ohhhh, yup, that'll do it
A12:22:28 <Wolfram> Not quite as bad as the time I spilled the whole pot on my leg cast
A12:22:33 <Wolfram> Talk about unpleasant
A12:22:46 <Wolfram> Imagine wearing the water and not being able to get away from it
A12:23:10 <Wolfram> I eventually had to go jump in the creek nearby

A12:25:55 <CantSleepNalok> :|
A12:26:01 <Wolfram> Haha, Nalok
A12:26:06 <brie> it doens't know where to find java becasue it's not linked!
A12:26:19 <CantSleepNalok> It's quiet but I'm not tired >.>
A12:26:26 <Wolfram> http://www.java.com/en/
A12:26:29 <mib_xkmhec> wuold using cmpaability mode fix it?
A12:26:31 <Wolfram> I'm telling you, white noise
A12:26:50 <Wolfram> Something loud enough to cover random sounds, but quiet enough not to be obtrusive
A12:27:00 <Wolfram> I use a big fan
A12:27:13 <CantSleepNalok> Where can a man get white noise at 1:30 in the morning?
A12:27:13 <Wolfram> Rain is another example
A12:27:28 <brie> tv static is good too
A12:27:30 <CantSleepNalok> It's not raining and my fan is semi-quiet
A12:27:35 <Wolfram> Download something with a perfect loop
A12:27:41 <Wolfram> Play it through your speakers and sleep nearby
A12:27:44 <CantSleepNalok> There is a big fan in the kitchen but..
A12:28:10 <CantSleepNalok> Hmm, Maybe Shiek's melody, but all I have are youtube videos
A12:28:26 <Wolfram> Shiek's melody, huh?
A12:28:28 <Wolfram> Can you link me?
A12:28:43 <CantSleepNalok> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cSDTN47Xrc

A12:29:02 <Wolfram> Lands, haven't heard this in ages
A12:29:29 <Wolfram> That's certainly soothing. Need a better loop, though. Hold
A12:30:06 <CantSleepNalok> Holding
A12:31:50 <Wolfram> Okay, got one. Give me a second to rip it.
A12:32:27 <Wolfram> Sounds the same but it doesn't have that massive gap of silence at the end
A12:32:43 <Wolfram> There was an orchestrated one but it really just didn't sound as good
A12:33:23 <PuyoDead> hey Nalok, http://www.bwgen.com/
A12:33:27 <PuyoDead> that should be interesting
A12:34:48 <Wolfram> There.
A12:34:49 <Wolfram> http://download568.mediafire.com/wzxv0bmozzjg/0dnzotmy2ij/Sheik%27s+Theme.mp3
A12:35:04 <Wolfram> Gotta thank you, really
A12:35:08 <Wolfram> Since I get a good mp3 out of it, too
A12:35:20 <CantSleepNalok> lol

A12:35:50 <PuyoDead> I've always had an obession with the song of storms in zelda
A12:36:06 <Wolfram> I like that one, too
A12:36:12 <Wolfram> I have all of the different ocarina songs
A12:36:22 <Wolfram> But somehow Sheik's theme just got lost in the translation
A12:38:31 <CantSleepNalok> Hm, lol
A12:38:55 <CantSleepNalok> Well that certainly made me sleepier
A12:40:28 <PuyoDead> I really wish audio worked on this pc
A12:40:34 <PuyoDead> but noooo, it has to be busted
A12:40:36 <Wolfram> Wow, no sound?
A12:40:54 <PuyoDead> none
A12:41:06 <PuyoDead> no damned idea why, it just quit
A12:41:18 <PuyoDead> updated drivers, even tried a new sound card
A12:41:28 <PuyoDead> two different sets of speakers, nothing
A12:41:58 <Wolfram> Hmm, that's a stumper
A12:42:20 <Wolfram> If you changed the card AND the speakers, it may not be hardware
A12:42:31 <Wolfram> But beyond the drivers I'm not sure how you might fix it
A12:43:07 <Wolfram> Might be a busted connector on the motherboard end
A12:43:28 <Wolfram> I'm surprised you don't have onboard, actually
A12:43:31 <PuyoDead> well, I tried onboard and a card. AND disabling the onboard
A12:44:58 <Wolfram> Gotta be your board
A12:45:05 <Wolfram> That or some obscure software problem
A12:48:28 <PuyoDead> hmm, one thing I haven't tried, I'm going to boot into windows 7, and ubuntu. see if either of those do the trick
A12:48:41 <PuyoDead> can't play minecraft in those, though, so still no minecraft sounds
A12:50:44 <Wolfram> My room-mate liked 7, apparently, but he switched back and neither of us can remember why.

A12:54:46 <PuyoDead> <mnx> ... did you lose your hearing and just not realize it?  
A12:55:18 <Wolfram> Haha.
A12:58:36 <brie> hmm, got the server batch file to work, but i cant connect to the server now...
A12:58:42 <brie> back to the forums i guess. :P
A12:58:48 <Wolfram> Haha. Good luck
A12:58:51 <Wolfram> What's the error this time?
A12:58:56 <PuyoDead> <mnx> let's test it:  quick, how many fingers am i holding up?
A12:58:56 <PuyoDead> <mnx> ... that's the only test i know how to administer.
A12:58:57 <brie> it *should8 work already.
A12:59:09 <brie> not an error on my end, just cant connect to the server.
A12:59:15 <Wolfram> Haha. Who is this mnx
A12:59:31 <Wolfram> Did you leave verify names on?
A1:00:09 <PuyoDead> I've been playing FPS with her for years
A1:01:11 <Wolfram> Sounds pretty funny
A1:01:55 <PuyoDead> <mnx> and why is it possible to download "walden" into an ipod or kindle?  
A1:01:55 <PuyoDead> <mnx> that kind of irony should be radioactive.
A1:02:46 <CantSleepNalok> Wow, AQW midnight releasw 
A1:04:19 <PuyoDead> ok, going to start messing around with my other OSs now
A1:04:26 <CantSleepNalok> Ohshit this is so cool!

A1:12:39 <brie> fine*
A1:13:16 <Wolfram> Haha, brie. Well, more's the better. Success at least, right?
A1:13:21 <Wolfram> I've played that, Nalok
A1:13:45 <Wolfram> Couldn't get into it though. Mostly because I'd already played the original game for an age and even paid for guardianship back in the daaaay.
A1:14:00 <Wolfram> I was like bah, I'm not paying these dudes again
A1:14:10 <CantSleepNalok> lol I know
A1:14:35 <CantSleepNalok> But now we have Houses, Friends Lists, PVP is on the way..

A7:27:21 <Quatroking> http://media.bigoo.ws/content/background/food/food_47.jpg
A7:27:35 <Dossy> Because they are native to Sweden and are widely used in Swedish cuisine, brown beans are sometimes called Swedish brown beans.
A7:27:38 <Dossy> Therefore, we give no shit.

A7:32:20 <citricsquid> I spent hours wondering what I'd done wrong with a mysql query, I'd type "qurey" and not noticed for hours.
A7:32:36 <JTE> criticsquid: I am hosting a server on port 27016, I am hosting a fake server on 27015, I connect to the URL I get from sending a heartbeat on 27015, it connects to my fake server thing, and that causes the fake server to connect to the real one and relay messages back and forth between them acting exactly the same as if you connected directly
A7:32:49 <Dossy> citricsquid: Pretty much what I've just done :|
A7:33:01 <JTE> EXCEPT, I can watch every single packet that goes through and have it ignore ones that I don't want to happen, like a player saying they destroy some block.
A7:33:07 <citricsquid> JTE: Awesome, what's the purpose though? :D Does this mean you can have custom /commands?
A7:33:22 <JTE> I can have custom /commands that DON'T say the command to everyone!
A7:33:26 <citricsquid> :D
A7:33:29 <citricsquid> does it cause much lag?
A7:33:43 <JTE> Since they're running on the same computer, there's no lag difference at all.
A7:33:48 <citricsquid> awesome
13A7:33:52 * citricsquid highfives JTE
A7:33:55 <JTE> It connects to the server by 127.0.0.1 :P
A7:34:24 <JTE> Theoretically it could be used to connect to other people's servers too, but I have no use for that. o.o
A7:35:03 <JTE> ... Theoretically, I could understand all 14 packets it sends back and forth and use that at a later date to forge my own custom client that doesn't require minecraft.net, but that's beyond my scope for now.
A7:35:30 <Dossy> load is clearly defined you heap of crap...
A7:36:03 <doohan> You tell it.
A7:36:13 <Quatroking> so what can you do with it, JTE
A7:36:33 <JTE> :3~ Anything I want.

A7:36:46 <Quatroking> hack the data between the client and the server?

A7:44:16 <citricsquid> I can do like, the most basic of js :D what's the problem?
A7:44:44 <Dossy> Posting to a file with jQuery, is the path to the file according to the page the js file is included on or the js file itself? :p
A7:46:10 <fanta> i had a nice map made by the community, but people were complaining about lava. so i replaced it by air. 
A7:46:25 <Dossy> Hmm, time to test then I suppose :|
A7:46:25 <fanta> however i wanted to know how much lava there was
A7:46:26 <fanta> http://bildupload.sro.at/a/images/1-lava.jpg
A7:47:10 <fanta> so i deletet all blocks except for the lava (i replaced them with lavastill)
A7:47:20 <fanta> conclusion: lava sucks
A7:47:35 <fanta> it spreads all over the map
A7:48:19 <fanta> as long as there are no game modes, i do not see a reason keeping it ;)
A7:48:29 <fanta> in my maps
A7:48:29 <citricsquid> lava ftw
A7:48:40 <Dossy> Lava ftw indd.
A7:48:47 <Dossy> Keeps out the griefers :p
A7:49:14 <fanta> actually they used it to flood tunnels :/
A7:49:25 <citricsquid> it's easy to get rid of.
A7:49:35 <fanta> i know
A7:49:54 <fanta> thats why i did it
A7:49:58 <citricsquid> water is scary, I built this huge underground base and removed 1 wrong block, took >30 mins to remove =D
A7:50:20 <Quatroking> at least you're not digging a tunnel and find a lake of lava
A7:50:26 <Quatroking> >.<

A9:22:26 <iM> AlLnAtuRalX
A9:22:32 <iM> i have something to propose to you
A9:22:34 <iM> are you there?
A9:22:56 <citricsquid> if it's marriage, he's already married to linux.
A9:23:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah iM 
A9:23:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol citricsquid 
A9:23:15 <Dossy> Lol also :v
A9:23:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> I wanted to buy you a pizza from domino's yesterday citricsquid, but you were AFK the whole day :P
A9:23:23 <iM> well
A9:23:26 <fanta> why do people keep asking if some one is there, when the name show up on the names list?
A9:23:29 <iM> a couple of us were talking
A9:23:45 <citricsquid> fanta: people idle :)
A9:23:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm not making it a private server?
A9:23:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
A9:23:49 <iM> and we don't like resets
A9:23:54 <iM> so i proposed
A9:23:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> iM, I think I'm rolling with Jat's idea
A9:23:59 <iM> Instead of resets, we just demolish old buildings
A9:24:05 <iM> and we put a red cross on buildings
A9:24:12 <iM> if no-one claims it within 5 days
A9:24:14 <iM> we destroy it
A9:24:20 <citricsquid> 5 days?
A9:24:23 <iM> ya
A9:24:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> The underground would still be raped though
A9:24:29 <iM> hmm.
A9:24:33 <iM> that's true
A9:24:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> How about this: We have two servers.  One build, one gallery
A9:24:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> We chose old maps
A9:24:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> to put on the gallery server
A9:24:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> and people can do whatever to them
A9:24:48 <iM> oh okay
A9:24:53 <iM> that seems nicer
A9:24:57 <iM> like a different old map each week?
A9:25:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, maybe... or every few days
A9:25:13 <iM> that isn't backed up, or is saved
A9:25:14 <iM> ?
A9:25:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah
A9:25:24 <fanta> citricsquid, you can just write, $name foobar. if he is not there he will not answer. if he is, he will respond. its that easy. 
A9:25:41 <fanta> same would happen if you ask "are you there?"
A9:26:00 <iM> what do you mean?
A9:26:03 <iM> i idle on irc a lot.
A9:26:12 <iM> if someone wants to talk to me and uses my name, it flashes the icon
A9:26:15 <iM> so i know someone wants to talk
A9:26:15 <citricsquid> It's easier to say "you there fanta?" than write out the whole query and get no answer :D
A9:26:22 <iM> i agree with that
A9:26:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm not sure iM, I'm still working out the details, but that's one of my todos for today
A9:26:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> How's the castle, btw?
A9:27:11 <fanta> citricsquid, but he gets an highlight and can answer it later

A9:32:58 <PuyoDead> while gmod is similar, it's completely different in how it's actually played. be nice if people would think about that
A9:33:32 <citricsquid> personally I'd rather put up with griefing and have the freedom we have now than have no griefing and be limited in what we can make.

A9:36:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Horrid lag?  Not really... it might be annoying in an FPS, but MineCraft?  w,e
A9:36:46 <citricsquid> minecraft forum only gets ~600 uniques /day =(

A10:09:35 <citricsquid> The eye isn't trained to read centered text so it looks off

A10:10:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> without centering the others or using fluid width
A10:11:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> because of the way Notch did the CSS

A10:38:10 <citricsquid> gradients +o(
A10:38:19 <Wolfram> I guess it's not really bad, but it's too different. Or something
A10:38:30 <Dossy> Gradients, if at all
A10:38:35 <Dossy> Should be really subtle
A10:38:37 <citricsquid> Gradients should NEVER be the focus
A10:38:40 <citricsquid> dossy: exactly :P
A10:38:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Maybe I should just do it with a black background?
A10:38:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> heh
A10:39:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know citricsquid, just dicking around with a few combs... the background right now is terrible :/
A10:39:08 <Dossy> You could have a dark grey background then a dark grey->black background :|
A10:39:10 <citricsquid> :D
A10:39:11 <Dossy> That would work :p
A10:39:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> did I say combs?  combos lol
A10:39:37 <citricsquid> tbh, the current design works fine as a "splash page".

A10:57:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> for extended playing
A10:57:44 <citricsquid> why not used the texture but stick it down to about 30% alpha? That could work, just a very subtle texture, maybe?

A11:02:08 <PuyoDead> yea, get this...
A11:02:18 <PuyoDead> no sound in XP, Win7, or Ubuntu

A11:03:16 <PuyoDead> I pop it in... worked immediately

A11:03:30 <PuyoDead> somehow, my onboard AND old card died simultaneously

A11:17:14 <citricsquid> Wolfram: Captcha can be bypassed by humans... 
A11:17:16 <citricsquid> That's the point
A11:17:18 <Wolfram> I know that
A11:17:21 <citricsquid> captcha just protects against bots :P
A11:17:23 <Wolfram> That's why I agreed that it wasn't bots
A11:17:28 <citricsquid> k :D
A11:17:54 <citricsquid> when signing up you get an email with a password, you then login with that, so you have to have a legitimate email address and a way of checking it, there are very few if not any bots that can do that.

A11:19:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wolfram, I agree with him 100%
A11:19:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> You seem to think that it's an option between the two, but we both think the best choice is neither, and you don't want to accept that
A11:19:56 <citricsquid> I also do :P ALl the methods are "bad" but permissions is the best out of all the methods presented.
A11:20:28 <Wolfram> Perhaps you should read my response to him, http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=773
A11:20:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> don't lose me here squid... Anyone who wants permissions gets a bad mark from me
A11:20:31 <Wolfram> Doh,
A11:20:34 <Wolfram> That is totally not it.
A11:20:39 <Wolfram> I last had your name copied, haha
A11:20:50 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I don't want them (can we do italics in IRC?) but it is the best idea I've seen.
A11:20:50 <Wolfram> In any case
A11:21:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> I read your response
A11:21:11 <Wolfram> Removing the functionality of prisons is unreasonable as it leaves you with what you want
A11:21:14 <Wolfram> (open servers)
A11:21:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> What?
A11:21:29 <Wolfram> But removes what members of the opposing camp wants
A11:21:37 <Wolfram> (locked servers)
A11:21:49 <PuyoDead> I'd agree permissions are better than prisons, but that's like saying stale bread is better than really stale bread
A11:21:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Keeping them on in the present state is also unreasonable.  It leaves you with what you want (locked servers), but the opposing case gets nothing (clearly labeled servers)
A11:22:07 <Wolfram> You can have labeled servers. I advocate that
A11:22:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> My request is simple.  All public server admins who use prisons label their servers with a |PRISON| tag
A11:22:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's
A11:22:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> all
A11:22:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> sorry for two lines.. damn enter key
A11:22:41 <Wolfram> We've established that
A11:22:45 <Wolfram> And my stance on it
A11:22:52 <PuyoDead> maybe in the style of server listings with FPS showing FF, weapons limting, that type of thing. of course, that would require a whole new system of server listing
A11:23:26 <citricsquid> current server listing is pretty basic, I assume it'll be overhauled eventually.
A11:23:32 <citricsquid> I think notch just threw it together.
A11:23:39 <PuyoDead> I was hoping later rather than sooner
A11:23:46 <PuyoDead> y'know, to put effort into more important things
A11:24:14 <Wolfram> I wish Notch had a little help, really
A11:24:51 <citricsquid> meh, I could see him having a web developer for the site and him doing the game, but having >1 person working on a game can cause problems and I doubt he wants it changed from his own personal vision.
A11:25:05 <Wolfram> Oh, no, I agree with that

A11:26:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> If he could integrate the login system into the applet, we could create our own custom websites for it

P4:30:35 <PuyoDead> interesting side note, with the maps I made the topic about, the protected from flood versions are being downloaded more
P4:30:53 <Adura> To think people don't like server crashes.
P4:31:16 <PuyoDead> not by much, mind you, there's not many downloads in the first place
P4:31:26 <PuyoDead> what about server crashes?
P4:32:15 <Adura> Flooding can cause that.
P4:33:00 <Wolfram> That's true, excessive water spread freaks the server out.
P4:33:06 <PuyoDead> I don't mean entire map flooding, just the stuff from the sides
P4:33:06 <Adura> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=606 More users, more testing.
P4:33:20 <vdgmprgrmr> The stuff from the sides is enough to crash it.

P4:34:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, yeah, but still.
P4:34:36 <PuyoDead> I'm just thinking of people digging into the side, and making tunnels to flood people's stuff
P4:34:36 <Wolfram> It's because down is so much faster than over, right?
P4:34:46 <PuyoDead> but yea, if they hit someone's giant chamber, than I can see that
P4:35:09 <Adura> I flipped a map and the grass updates made it unstable.
P4:35:13 <vdgmprgrmr> A giant chamber probably wouldn't crash it.
P4:35:22 <Adura> So, I strip grass before flipping now.

P5:24:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> i barely go on servers i have never been to before
P5:24:59 <PuyoDead> oh, and i'm on windows
P5:25:06 <Jat> exe on cygwin?
P5:25:53 <PuyoDead> I'm probably missing something stupid, I'm sure
P5:27:54 <Jat> for a long time i was really pissed off at cygwin because i had installed it once and from then on and even after i uninstalled it a lot of installation programs i tried to run would run the cygwin installation program instead of installing themselves

P5:30:14 <PuyoDead> yea, I give up on this
P5:30:19 <Jat> cygwins installation program was just called setup.exe... and i had left that in the directory i use to store downloaded files in because i didnt know it was cygwins installation program. as it turns out on windows xp for some reason a certain type of installation program will always automatically run a file called setup.exe if it is in the same directory
P5:30:26 <Jat> tinstead of running its own installation
P5:30:43 <PuyoDead> oh, weird
P5:30:55 <PuyoDead> yea, pretty stupid that it's just "setup.exe"
P5:31:06 <Jat> so every time i tried to run one of those installation programs out of my downloads directory it would run the cygwin setup.exe
P5:31:26 <Jat> stupid and annoying
P5:31:36 <Jat> im not sure how i eventually found out that was the problem
P5:31:53 <Jat> i wasa probably just cleaning out my downloads directory and found setup.exe didnt know what it did and ran it
P5:32:01 <Jat> and then i figured it out :|
P5:32:18 <Jat> or at least it became ovious
P5:32:59 <Jat> i no longer save files called setup.exe directly into my downloads directory :D
P5:33:41 <Jat> anyway whats the problem puyo?
P5:33:49 <PuyoDead> just doesn't work
P5:33:55 <Jat> you mean the installation?
P5:34:05 <PuyoDead> there is no installation

P5:40:18 <Jat> well according to the perl site cygwin lets you choose what to install and update or something
P5:40:22 <Jat> it doesnt have many details...
P5:40:28 <Jat> http://www.cpan.org/ports/#cygwin
P5:41:39 <PuyoDead> I'll try that again
P5:41:57 <PuyoDead> ahh, there it is
P5:42:36 <Jat> it asks you or something?
P5:42:52 <PuyoDead> it has a giant list of stuff
P5:43:17 <Jat> oh ok
P5:43:20 <PuyoDead> perl was listed, but they don't make it very obvious
P5:43:34 <PuyoDead> just says "default". you have to select it and tell it to install it

P6:55:43 <Adura> Should still run it from cygwin's bash or MinTTY.
P6:56:03 <Adura> And, all the comments in the .pl and .json file apply.
P6:56:58 <Adura> It'd be...

P6:58:21 <Adura> So... I have to write a guide about cygwin... eh.
P6:58:54 <PuyoDead> well, I ran it from cygwin, but it seems the minecraft server itself crashed *shrug*
P6:59:07 <Adura> I can't do much about that, heh.
P6:59:32 <Adura> Though, an auto-restart function will likely be soon.

P7:08:04 <Seraph> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=5345#p5345 if you think you might be interested
P7:09:11 <PuyoDead> so is this only for remote servers?
P7:09:23 <Adura> You can telnet into it locally.
P7:09:28 <PuyoDead> hmm
P7:09:38 <Adura> Just minimize the window if it's displaying output.
P7:10:08 <Adura> Or, you could...
P7:10:37 <Adura> nohup ./mcadmin_v0_1.exe &
P7:10:47 <Adura> It'll be in the background.

P7:12:34 <PuyoDead> yea, I just set it up for backups
P7:13:06 <Adura> Alright, just telnet to it to see how it's performing.
P7:13:29 <Adura> Though, errors don't go through telnet, certain reports.

P11:16:55 <LilRobot> k
P11:17:15 <Wolfram> It would be on the bottom, though.
P11:17:28 <LilRobot> Making a map right now so yeah.
P11:19:35 <Jat> just so you know
P11:19:53 <Jat> the coordinates might actually be designated as x z y
P11:20:58 <Jat> so be careful of the order you use and take into consideration that if there are errors that might be why
P11:21:02 <LilRobot> Anyone think they could help me with a map code?
P11:21:12 <Jat> i can try but im a shitty programmer
P11:21:19 <LilRobot> Ever used MCTool?
P11:21:24 <Jat> nope
P11:21:40 <LilRobot> Probably won't be of much help then..
P11:21:44 <Jat> :|
P11:21:47 <Jat> what is mctool?
P11:21:48 <LilRobot> Sorry >.<
P11:21:52 <LilRobot> "Minecraft" tool.
P11:21:56 <Jat> oh that
P11:22:01 <Jat> is it on the forums?
P11:22:03 <greenslimy> Made by Rossetta
P11:22:09 <Jat> oh that
P11:22:10 <greenslimy> yes
P11:22:11 <LilRobot> No. It's ma- what Green said.
P11:22:13 <Adura> I just came up with simple stripping stuff with info in the wiki.
P11:22:15 <LilRobot> Anyone here good with it?
P11:22:29 <Jat> what do you mean by good with it?
P11:22:37 <LilRobot> Can successfully make a large map.
P11:22:42 <Jat> oh
P11:22:48 <Jat> just wondering... since ive never used it
P11:22:51 <Jat> how does it work?
P11:23:00 <Jat> im not on a computer i can really test these things out with at the moment
P11:24:36 <LilRobot> Some complicated code.
P11:24:47 <LilRobot> Something like..
P11:25:04 <LilRobot> java -cp "minecraft-server.jar;MCTool.jar" mctool.MCTool config(name).TXT
P11:25:19 <LilRobot> Update? o:
P11:25:43 <LilRobot> dunno what it does.
P11:25:51 <Jat> what do you mean?
P11:26:14 <Adura> That's complicated code...?
P11:26:20 <Adura> Looks like a single line.
P11:26:21 <Jat> is there a config(name).txt file in the directory with the tool?
P11:26:52 <Jat> i assume (name) is supposed to be replaced with a name
