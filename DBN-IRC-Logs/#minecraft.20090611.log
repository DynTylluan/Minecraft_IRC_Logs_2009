A12:36:06 <notjotham> what OS
A12:36:10 <KEROLiUKAS> vista x64
A12:36:32 <notjotham> minecraft locks up trying to talk to the server, sometimes it can take a minute or so before it responds/processes events/tells you it can't connect
A12:37:09 <notjotham> i don't know much about vista/vista64, but the first place to start would be ensuring your Java is up to date from Sun(.com)
A12:37:18 <ItzMattu> pyl: you really ought to clean your log up so people's IP addresses aren't visible T__T

A4:16:22 <pyl> ISN'T THAT FUCKED UP
A4:17:25 <TrueWolves> Wait, as in the person who owns the server? or anyone?
A4:17:32 <pyl> anyone who is an op
A4:17:34 <pyl> can do
A4:17:38 <pyl> !new
A4:17:41 <pyl> and it generates a new level
A4:17:46 <pyl> or !save blablabla
A4:17:49 <pyl> and it saves the level
A4:17:52 <pyl> or !load blablabla
A4:17:55 <pyl> and it loads that level.
A4:17:58 <doohan> Sweet
A4:18:18 <pyl> it'll blow up for sure
A4:18:26 <pyl> but who cares :)
A4:18:32 <doohan> Well it's just like any server with ops.
A4:18:38 <doohan> Just watch who you op.
A4:19:01 <pyl> idea was to basically op all the people who hang out in here
A4:19:20 <doohan> Yeah that'd be chaos
A4:19:23 <pyl> but i haven't seen you around here before, for example
A4:19:30 <doohan> I've been here for weeks!
A4:19:34 <pyl> really?
A4:19:36 <pyl> :D
A4:19:36 <doohan> Yes.
A4:19:42 <pyl> you're not very noteworthy!
A4:19:45 <doohan> :(
A4:19:58 <TrueWolves> I was one of the first!
A4:20:00 <doohan> I've been demanding high explosives
A4:20:08 <doohan> Fighting that corner for forever.
A4:20:11 <doohan> :D
A4:20:30 <pyl> tom@zak:~/irclogs/esper$ cat \#minecraft.log | grep doohan | wc
A4:20:32 <pyl> 276
A4:20:35 <doohan> See
A4:20:35 <pyl> that's not very much
A4:20:41 <doohan> Quality.
A4:20:45 <doohan> Not quantity.
A4:21:14 <pyl> problem is a lack of quantity means i won't get to know you
A4:21:17 <pyl> or trust you
A4:21:19 <doohan> !!!!
A4:21:20 <pyl> and thus won't op you now
A4:21:29 <doohan> Ah well easy come easy go :)
A4:21:59 <doohan> I'll be running my own server tonight. Vaserv have finally got my vps back up

A4:37:18 <ItzMattu> since when can you save/load levels in mp?
A4:37:24 <ItzMattu> O_o
A4:37:30 <pyl> since i implemented it with an ugly server-side script
A4:37:36 <ItzMattu> Lol
A4:37:48 <ItzMattu> But don't you have to restart the server for that? O_o
A4:37:53 <pyl> yeah.
A4:37:55 <ItzMattu> Ewww
A4:38:02 <pyl> it works :]
A4:38:13 <pyl> and it lets people fuck with levels when i'm not around

A4:47:45 <TrueWolves> Oh, you banned the infamus ilililiiililiili
A4:48:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, no one really liked ilililiiililiili.
A4:48:06 <vdgmprgrmr> .
A4:48:13 <Rydia> someone said that i should make it so it's not anti-aliased but i dunno what to do
A4:48:17 <Narks> any good minecraft servers up?
A4:48:29 <Rydia> my driver settings says "let application decide"
A4:48:31 <TrueWolves> Yeah, the main minecraft server.
A4:48:41 <Rydia> with no "always off" option
A4:48:43 <Narks> i said server, not master server
A4:48:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Main Minecraft server?
A4:49:08 <TrueWolves> Well, there is a player run main multiplayer server now.
A4:49:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Well yeah.
A4:49:20 <Narks> what are you talking about
A4:49:21 <vdgmprgrmr> (Which is filled with awesome and win.)
A4:50:12 <Narks> "<TrueWolves>	Well, there is a player run main multiplayer server now." -?
A4:51:15 <TrueWolves> I don't know if it's open this second... is it open to everyone vdgm?
A4:52:11 <vdgmprgrmr> It's still a hazy matter at the moment.
A4:52:43 <vdgmprgrmr> We don't really have an "official" ruling in that area, as far as I know.
A4:53:02 <vdgmprgrmr> The only chattings were utopian ideas of "yeah, and only filled with cool people".
A4:53:45 <pyl> meh, people can't grief too bad now
A4:53:49 <pyl> now you can save and load
A4:53:51 <vdgmprgrmr> "Yeah, only filled with cool people, but not one of those douchy cool-people-only clubs."
A4:53:52 <pyl> and have a backup
A4:53:54 <pyl> :]
A4:54:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Was a pretty good paraphrasing, i think.
A4:54:04 <pyl> mm
A4:54:06 <pyl> accurate
A4:54:36 <Narks> that server was boring, nobody there
A4:54:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Well no not right now.
A4:54:55 <vdgmprgrmr> That's because as of yet the only links have been PMs.
A4:54:59 <vdgmprgrmr> (Except up there.)
A4:55:06 <vdgmprgrmr> (Somewhere, I think.)
A4:55:18 <Narks> also i am surprised there hasnt been more serious grief attacks
A4:55:23 <mezo> that's just how few cool people there are narks
A4:55:26 <vdgmprgrmr> (In the infinite reaches of the scroll-bar.)
A4:55:38 <vdgmprgrmr> And yeah, mezo is right.
A4:55:41 <Narks> the game is so easy to hack in
A4:55:59 <vdgmprgrmr> All da coo peeps are kinda few and far between.
A4:56:45 <pyl> guhghr
A4:56:52 <pyl> why am i stuck on something tiny and insignificant now
A4:56:54 <vdgmprgrmr> O_o
A4:56:56 <pyl> my brain is broken
A4:57:05 <vdgmprgrmr> What is it?
A4:57:57 <pyl> the code for linking to the level files from the webpage.
A4:58:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Cycle through the files, list them.
A4:58:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Put Doom files in a separate folder.
A4:59:00 <Rydia> ughhh i really want to left click
A4:59:01 <vdgmprgrmr> So people who wanna load maps have to do like !load doom\EXLY
A4:59:03 <pyl> no fucking way am i implementing folder support in all this shit :D
A4:59:11 <pyl> and no
A4:59:14 <vdgmprgrmr> I thought it already was there!
A4:59:21 <pyl> letting people load shit from outside the folder is a baaad thing
A4:59:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Possibly.
A4:59:28 <pyl> !load ../../../etc/passwd
A4:59:31 <pyl> WOOPSIE
A4:59:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah there's that.
A5:00:02 <pyl> better yet
A5:00:04 <pyl> !save
A5:00:04 <Rydia> does anyone have any ideas
A5:00:05 <pyl> :D
A5:00:20 <Rydia> i've got latest java and everything
A5:00:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Um...
A5:00:31 <Rydia> everything works except for editing
A5:00:44 <vdgmprgrmr> There's this weird idea that's in my head but I can't quite figure it out.

A5:01:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Um...
A5:01:46 <Rydia> the highlight doesn't even show up
A5:01:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Ooh!
A5:02:08 <vdgmprgrmr> You have your folder with your levels and such in it right?
A5:02:31 <vdgmprgrmr> And you have another folder inside that one for all the doom levels.
A5:02:56 <vdgmprgrmr> And when someone tries to load a level, if the level doesn't exist, it checks that folder, and if it's in there, it loads it.
A5:03:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Eh? Eh?
A5:03:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I assume you're trying to avoid listing EVERY SINGLE doom level, while still having them, and having a level list.
A5:03:57 <pyl> or i could just hide levels that begin with a .
A5:03:59 <pyl> like god intended
A5:04:12 <pyl> and rename the doom levels to start with .
A5:04:16 <vdgmprgrmr> See I didn't think you could do that.
A5:04:31 <pyl> i'm cunning
A5:04:41 <pyl> not cunning enough to fix this thing, though
A5:04:52 <vdgmprgrmr> So what's wrong with it?
10A5:05:05 * Bawl (chatzilla@IGLD-84-229-229-137.inter.net.il) has joined #minecraft
A5:05:54 <vdgmprgrmr> What is the mighty Pyl not cunning, dashing, or handsome enough to fix?
A5:07:19 <Deiz> I don't see what's wrong with the subfolder approach
A5:07:34 <vdgmprgrmr> No he has that problem all figured out from what I read.
A5:07:44 <vdgmprgrmr> But I think something else is being all problematic.
A5:07:46 <Deiz> It's inflexible, and could lead to a mess
A5:08:08 <Deiz> You could sanitize the input, removing periods, tildes, leading slashes, such that a player can't read anything outside the working dir
A5:08:19 <Narks> hah
A5:08:27 <Narks> eventually one player will figure out how to get past sanitization
A5:08:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Not if it's IMPOSSIBLE.
A5:08:44 <Deiz> There are a finite number of ways to escape a dir
A5:08:52 <Narks> you'll forget something
A5:08:54 <Narks> rofl
A5:09:13 <vdgmprgrmr> I doubt it would be very easy to forget all the ways to escape a directory.
A5:09:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Assuming these people don't just hack into the computer the server's running on.
A5:09:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Somehow.
A5:10:07 <Deiz> There's also a level of paranoia missing here
A5:10:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe.
A5:10:21 <Narks> paranoia = good
A5:11:23 <Deiz> The Minecraft server is untested and a potential vulnerability, it should ideally be run as a minimally privileged user with read access to the Minecraft dir, /bin, /sbin, /etc and other essentials
A5:12:13 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A5:13:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
A5:14:28 <pyl> hard
A5:14:29 <pyl> to say.
A5:14:39 <Deiz> Also, is there a !save timer?
A5:14:47 <vdgmprgrmr> What's hard to say?
A5:15:13 <pyl> what's wrong with it
A5:15:44 <pyl> Deiz: i already sanitize the input a bunch, and files with a leading dot are The Way To Hide Files on unix-systems.
A5:16:01 <pyl> also, my minecraft server runs in a fucking chroot.
A5:16:02 <pyl> :]
A5:16:05 <Deiz> I see.
A5:16:06 <Deiz> That's good.
A5:16:14 <Deiz> However, you're still going to end up with a mess of files
A5:16:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I gotta say I liked the prefix idea a lot.
A5:16:22 <vdgmprgrmr> And what is chroot?
A5:16:33 <pyl> i don't really care
A5:16:37 <pyl> about the mess of files
A5:16:39 <pyl> i'm fine with that
A5:16:50 <pyl> you guys are the ones who will live with it :)
A5:16:51 <Bawl> is there a way to download Minecraft?
A5:16:59 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A5:17:07 <Bawl> oh well
A5:18:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Although I think I would go for something a bit less symboly (despite the dot being The Way To Hide Files) like "dl" or some-such.
A5:20:01 <Narks> rofl
A5:20:14 <Narks> it's fun falling through map
A5:20:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Hello?

A5:24:00 <pyl> Deiz: i'll fix that soon
A5:24:41 <Deiz> If you were to implement folders, you could do some neat things
A5:25:14 <Deiz> Like allow certain people to have their own directories, loadable by all but only writable with their username
A5:25:22 <pyl> yes, and users would be confused and fuck it up and create eighteen folders named variations on "ghrh"
A5:25:40 <pyl> hm
A5:25:47 <pyl> that's an idea i'm willing to entertain
A5:25:50 <Deiz> I think folders should be hand-created
A5:25:53 <pyl> user-based folders
A5:28:08 <Deiz> If Notch were to cooperate and implement some things, there could be a graphical in-game loader that reads the server's maplist, for when the standalone client is released
A5:29:38 <Deiz> Making it cross platform might be tricky, though
A5:29:48 <Deiz> Granted, most long-term servers are probably *nix
A5:32:23 <Deiz> Though I'm not really sure what survival mode will be, I assume it'll mean longer-term games
A5:32:38 <Deiz> Which means streamlined server saving/loading would be an asset
A5:34:18 <Narks> wait
A5:34:20 <Narks> can you save first
A5:35:11 <Deiz> Hm?
A5:35:19 <pyl> right
A5:35:27 <pyl> Narks: what are you wondering?
A5:35:43 <Narks> i dunno how to use IRC
A5:35:52 <Deiz> There's one obstacle I don't know how to get around; housekeeping
A5:36:02 <Deiz> Run a server for a long time and you'll get a ton of cruft
A5:36:09 <Deiz> Eating disk space and generally making a mess
A5:36:24 <Deiz> Automated pruning based on mtime/atime might delete valuable maps, etc.

A8:49:50 <Tim> are you going to make a tool out of it?
A8:50:06 <Awol10> still getting what values equal what tiles but I got a half a map filled with solid rock
A8:50:20 <mezo> that's going to really diminish the novelty of building cool shit
A8:50:37 <Awol10> well some people want to start with either nothing or with things added
A8:50:46 <Awol10> I can now edit a level and remove all water
A8:50:55 <Awol10> or add more water
A8:51:25 <mezo> you should make a level with 10 layers of rock, 2 layers of dirt, and then all sky
A8:51:26 <Tim> so you can create a flatgrass map :)
A8:51:34 <Awol10> yes I can
A8:51:42 <mezo> and two pockets in the very top corners of the map, one holding lava and the other holding water
A8:51:48 <Rydia> anyone know why editing won't work for me?
A8:51:50 <mezo> behind leaf blocks
A8:51:51 <Awol10> or I can create new maps with a different random code
A8:52:15 <Rydia> blocks don't get highlighted for placement/removal unless i look at certain blocks at certain angles
A8:52:30 <Awol10> thats how editing works Rydia
A8:52:31 <Rydia> and i basically can't make anything
A8:52:55 <Awol10> but you can't place blocks at the edge of the map
A8:53:22 <Rydia> i mean it rarely ever highlights for me
A8:54:55 <mezo> which browser
A8:54:59 <Rydia> firefox
A8:55:15 <Rydia> i've tried all of them but none of the others work either

A9:22:25 <AfterShave> but i cant do that
A9:22:34 <Eagle> How not? It's easy.
A9:22:35 <AfterShave> i can only build from 2 sides and in an odd way
A9:22:38 <Awol10> for straight into something just remember you are 2 blocks tall
A9:22:42 <AfterShave> im new to this
A9:23:05 <AfterShave> am i supposed to just be able to build/delete from 2 sides or something?
A9:23:16 <Awol10> guessing you are having the same issues Rydia is having
A9:23:27 <AfterShave> i have to look at a corner or edge that have a tile of air behind it

P1:08:49 <Gen> So is this guy serious about charging 20 euro for a java applet?
P1:09:04 <Maulrus> he is
P1:09:13 <Maulrus> Have you actually played it?
P1:09:27 <Gen> I have played it.
P1:09:46 <Gen> Considering it costs more than a game like Team Fortress 2, I'd have to say its a crock of shit.
P1:10:00 <Maulrus> yay
P1:10:17 <Zolyx> you're certainly welcome to your opinion :) each to their own
P1:10:19 <Maulrus> k
P1:10:20 <Maulrus> Well TF2 cost more than that when it came out
P1:10:20 <Maulrus> and also it's more deep than TF2
P1:10:20 <Maulrus> so that makes sense
P1:10:22 <Gen> Dont get me wrong, Minecraft is fun though.

P1:10:55 <Maulrus> no, less
P1:10:59 <Maulrus> uhh
P1:11:02 <Maulrus> yaeh
P1:11:09 <Maulrus> somone told me that 10 euro is 14 bucks
P1:11:18 <Gen> Okay so... 28 bucks then.
P1:11:19 <Maulrus> or 14.007 or something
P1:11:26 <Maulrus> yus

P1:12:02 <Gen> I can get the complete Penumbra set for 5 bucks.
P1:12:27 <Gen> The entire Orange Box for the same price, 29
P1:12:51 <Zolyx> alternatively, "pre-order" MC and get the full thing for cheap, like Cortex Command
P1:12:58 <Gen> And he wants to charge 28 for something I could probably fit and run on my Nintendo DS
P1:14:10 <Zolyx> I agree 20 euro is probably a bit expensive, but we don't exactly know what that'll buy us yet
P1:14:21 <Gen> Or, you know go to the exact same game except free.. Infiniminer.
P1:14:26 <Zolyx> meanwhile 10 is easier to swallow and certainly I'll get more value out of that than a lot of things
P1:14:45 <Zolyx> which has problems with hackers, or so I hear
P1:15:08 <Gen> You haven't been on Minecraft in the last few days then.
P1:15:15 <Gen> Lava spawned all the way to the top of the map.
P1:15:23 <Gen> And in fact its very easy to do.
P1:15:24 <Zolyx> Aha; that was fixed shortly after
P1:15:42 <Gen> When, today?
P1:15:47 <Gen> Because it happened this morning
P1:16:46 <Zolyx> ./shrug - server 1.3 fixed at least one such exploit, but there could have been another; which will also get fixed in good time :)
P1:17:31 <Gen> Actually all you have to do is find the value of water/lava, last server it was at 812 so just bump that up to 900 and BAM. Water everywhere.

P1:19:23 <random_runner> is there anything that anyone can do about people who follow you and destroy random crap? =S
P1:19:44 <Gen> Eh, I suggested yesterday about a party system that locks bricks.
P1:19:53 <Zolyx> get an op to ban them, but at the moment nothing else
P1:20:08 <random_runner> so i can report someone going destroying blocks in here?
P1:20:08 <ItzMattu> Blocking access to bricks is a bad idea
P1:20:19 <random_runner> yeah, what if someone builds a wall around you
P1:20:21 <ItzMattu> In general it just creates more problems than it solves
P1:20:39 <Zolyx> if a server op is online, yep, random
P1:20:54 <random_runner> how do i recognize a server op
P1:20:59 <ItzMattu> You don't
P1:21:01 <ItzMattu> Heh
P1:21:03 <Gen> Yeah there needs to be a playerlist of some sort
P1:21:08 <ItzMattu> ThatThere is
P1:21:10 <Zolyx> <Tab>
P1:21:10 <ItzMattu> Press Tab
P1:21:16 <ItzMattu> It doesn't denote admins though
P1:21:17 <Zolyx> but no way to identify an op, yet
P1:21:18 <ItzMattu> And it shouldn't
P1:21:22 <random_runner> oh
P1:21:31 <ItzMattu> If it did, griefers would just join a server and then KNOW there is no admin
P1:21:33 <ItzMattu> Then grief away
P1:21:52 <ItzMattu> It's more fun now because I can be there and they grief infront of me and I /banip it up.
P1:22:11 <random_runner> banning ip is not wise
P1:22:12 <Zolyx> true enough.
P1:22:18 <random_runner> there are many people on public ips/dynamic ranges
P1:22:29 <ItzMattu> Rofl
P1:22:29 <random_runner> it's ok if you unban ip next day or so
P1:22:34 <ItzMattu> No there isn't
P1:22:41 <ItzMattu> Most people aren't at a university or on a large network
P1:22:42 <random_runner> for example, our whole city has same ip\
P1:22:46 <ItzMattu> And those that are: too bad.
P1:23:03 <random_runner> or there is a shitload of dynamic ips when yo usign up for an isp
P1:23:08 <Gen> Ah, and uh
P1:23:11 <ItzMattu> So?
P1:23:15 <random_runner> so then you reconnect and you get different ip
P1:23:16 <Gen> Temporary blocks, that auto delete after a time period
P1:23:17 <ItzMattu> Those don't get reset for months at a time
P1:23:18 <random_runner> and someone else gets your old one
P1:23:28 <Gen> So there arent a ton of random sand blocks just sticking out of the ground everywhere
P1:23:29 <ItzMattu> Wrong random.
P1:23:30 <random_runner> no, they reset everytime you reconnect
P1:23:36 <Gen> They'll just disappear after a short time
P1:23:40 <ItzMattu> You usually have to unplug a modem for at least 15-30 minutes to get a new IP
P1:23:47 <random_runner> bull.shit
P1:23:49 <ItzMattu> Dude random, no
P1:23:51 <ItzMattu> This isn't dialup
P1:23:54 <ItzMattu> LRN2INTERNET
P1:23:56 <ItzMattu> Seriously
P1:23:56 <random_runner> i have been on 2 different ips, from t-com and from orange
P1:23:59 <random_runner> dsl
P1:24:11 <random_runner> you click disconnect/connect, you get different ip. that's how it works
P1:24:26 <Gen> Random must have dynamic IP
P1:24:28 <ItzMattu> Even if that were true, there are billions of IP's
P1:24:41 <ItzMattu> The chances of the person getting that IP that was banned wanting to play minecraft is extremely rare
P1:24:52 <ItzMattu> As long as logs are flushed once a YEAR you'd be fine
P1:24:53 <ItzMattu> Honestly
P1:25:00 <ItzMattu> You're over exaggerating the issue
P1:25:01 <random_runner> but it's very high probablity that you someone else's. and you won't slove anything because you ban someone on dynamic ip. he reconnects and gets another one
P1:25:05 <random_runner> then there's also proxies.....
P1:25:08 <ItzMattu> Wrong random
P1:25:10 <random_runner> no, really
P1:25:16 <ItzMattu> I'm done arguing with you
P1:25:17 <ItzMattu> You're clueless
P1:25:28 <random_runner> i actually study informatic technologies on university of brno
P1:25:33 <ItzMattu> Rofl
P1:25:36 <ItzMattu> That meawsn nothing
P1:25:38 <ItzMattu> means*
P1:25:43 <random_runner> that means that i am not clueless

P1:58:37 <paul|not> local multiplayer would be nice
P1:58:42 <paul|not> eg being able to play over LAN
P1:58:44 <ItzMattu> I don't think one game mode and sandbox makes the game worth 20, that's for sure.
P1:58:54 <Wootsicle> isnt it 20 euros?
P1:58:57 <ItzMattu> No
P1:58:59 <ItzMattu> $20
P1:59:02 <Wootsicle> still
P1:59:10 <ItzMattu> I think the initial price of 10 is good
P1:59:12 <Wootsicle> not worth it, many other games out with much more work put into them
P1:59:15 <ItzMattu> I mean think of it like this...
P1:59:15 <Wootsicle> that cost the same or less
P1:59:20 <Wootsicle> i can go buy games on steam for $4
P1:59:20 <ItzMattu> Plants vs Zombies, a professional casual game
P1:59:22 <ItzMattu> Is only 10
P1:59:26 <paul|not> who defines that standard wootsicle
P1:59:32 <ItzMattu> Plants vs Zombies has amazing polish
P1:59:40 <Wootsicle> and costs
P1:59:40 <Wootsicle> 10
P1:59:43 <Wootsicle> when this will be 20
P1:59:48 <ItzMattu> paul|not: It's not a matetr fo definition
P2:00:00 <ItzMattu> When a company works on a game for months straight devoting an entire team to code/art/sound/setc.
P2:00:04 <ItzMattu> And only charge 10 dollars...
P2:00:04 <paul|not> 10 euros wootsicle
P2:00:08 <ItzMattu> Make sit hard to dish out 20 for this
P2:00:13 <ItzMattu> No
P2:00:15 <ItzMattu> It will be 10
P2:00:17 <ItzMattu> 20*
P2:00:21 <Awol10> then don't
P2:00:22 <ItzMattu> 10, then 15, then 20 at release
P2:00:30 <paul|not> how? I've seen a guy (a SINGLE guy) work for eight years on one game
P2:00:32 <ItzMattu> Awol, I want the game to do well
P2:00:34 <paul|not> it's not incredibly polished
P2:00:37 <paul|not> but it's damn fun
P2:00:39 <paul|not> 18 USD
P2:00:45 <paul|not> should I not pay for that
P2:00:50 <Wootsicle> was this worked on for eight years?
P2:00:54 <paul|not> no
P2:00:57 <paul|not> but it's damn fun
P2:00:58 <ItzMattu> Awol10: saying "Don't buy it" doesn't help the game, you just think you're clever.
P2:00:59 <Awol10> fun is what matter does it not?
P2:01:16 <Awol10> well bitching about it doesn't help much either
P2:01:22 <paul|not> Who cares if it was made three months ago
P2:01:25 <ItzMattu> Bitching?
P2:01:26 <ItzMattu> Who is bitching?
P2:01:30 <ItzMattu> I'm giving my opinion
P2:01:34 <ItzMattu> ROfl
P2:01:38 <Wootsicle> fun matters, but this game is made fun by the multiplayer with people i know, and i'm not handing out a total of $80 for this when i can just wait for a new game
P2:01:39 <paul|not> how many indie java games can you get that run at 300 FPS and work wunderuflly
P2:01:45 <C418> but you really help notch and also me to make this game better if you pay the game
P2:01:50 <Wootsicle> www.quakelive.com
P2:01:53 <Wootsicle> better graphics
P2:01:56 <Wootsicle> bigger community

P2:02:01 <paul|not> hey cool wootsicle TOTALLY DIFFERENT GAMES
P2:02:02 <ItzMattu> C418: I want to buy the game, and probably will for 10 before release.
P2:02:05 <Wootsicle> you just asked
P2:02:08 <ItzMattu> C418: but not many people will buy it for 20
P2:02:09 <Wootsicle> i gave you an answer..
P2:02:22 <C418> don't say that before the game is done
P2:02:32 <ItzMattu> paul|not: seriously you're asking for proof, he gave it, and you say it's not good proof?
P2:02:36 <C418> because that will take a long time
P2:02:39 <ItzMattu> paul|not: you're not having a very intelligent discussion
P2:02:47 <Wootsicle> yeah, but he's making us pay for alpha and beta rights?
P2:02:49 <paul|not> oh christ ---ugh
P2:02:50 <C418> it's not like minecraft hits beta next month
P2:02:55 <ItzMattu> C418: The only things scheduled to be added is one game mode, then release
P2:02:56 <C418> we are talking years of development here
P2:02:57 <flak> mount and blade on early alpha stages didn't looked promising much
P2:03:01 <flak> and see where it now
P2:03:35 <paul|not> <ItzMattu>	ROfl
P2:03:37 <Wootsicle> how can you charge for the right to alpha test?
P2:03:40 <paul|not> intelligent discussion
P2:03:52 <ItzMattu> paul|not: Way to quote out fo context. Champion debater you are.
P2:03:53 <C418> are you stupid? alpha and beta testing are totally free of charge
P2:03:58 <Drakkar> man
P2:04:02 <paul|not> how can you take issue with optional charging for the final version of the game
P2:04:07 <Evil-Ville> I bought mount & blade when it was first released and I've been playing it since
P2:04:09 <Wootsicle> did i miss something really important?
P2:04:10 <Drakkar> Wootsicle you just reminded me of how much I hate quake 3 compared to UT
P2:04:15 <Evil-Ville> One of the best investments I've done game-wise
P2:04:20 <Evil-Ville> I am expecting minecraft to be similar
P2:04:27 <ItzMattu> Wootsicle: You can buy the game during alpha and beta for 10 and 15 respectively, but it won't cost to play.
P2:04:40 <flak> what if take M&B and out it into minecraft
P2:04:42 <flak> mmm...
P2:04:46 <Wootsicle> well that changes my entire opinion
P2:04:47 <flak> *put
P2:04:47 <ItzMattu> It is only if you want to pre-purchase the final release early.
P2:04:56 <Wootsicle> so wait
P2:04:58 <Drakkar> sounds pretty reasonable to me
P2:05:03 <Wootsicle> he's trying to force us to buy early xD
P2:05:07 <ItzMattu> No
P2:05:07 <Drakkar> force?
P2:05:09 <Drakkar> nah
P2:05:09 <Wootsicle> or does he just need money
P2:05:11 <ItzMattu> It's 50% off at first
P2:05:12 <Wootsicle> for development?
P2:05:16 <Drakkar> you're paying for less
P2:05:19 <Drakkar> but that less
P2:05:22 <Drakkar> will become more
P2:05:24 <paul|not> OR maybe he's just interesting in getting a little money off a longterm project
P2:05:25 <ItzMattu> Well, who wouldn't want money while they work on a game?
P2:05:30 <Drakkar> ^
P2:05:37 <Drakkar> I intended to donate some money anyway

P2:06:48 <Wootsicle> including the ability to host a MP server?
P2:06:59 <C418> the server is free
P2:07:03 <paul|not> and notch is vehemently against restricting demo MP
P2:07:09 <paul|not> I asked him about this yesterday
P2:07:38 <Lmaoboat> My only problem is that the full version will cost, after conversion, 30 USD, which is where comercial games start
P2:07:47 <paul|not> they do?
P2:07:50 <paul|not> maybe for the DS
P2:07:59 <C418> yeah, we're sorry that the euro sucks cocks
P2:08:14 <paul|not> buy early before the dollar slips more
P2:08:35 <Wootsicle> will people with a full game be able to play with people who have the demo?
P2:08:43 <Wootsicle> i wont be able to convince my friends to pay for this
P2:08:43 <C418> yes
P2:09:20 <Drakkar> wtf
P2:09:21 <Wootsicle> nifty
P2:09:27 <Drakkar> I have a steven seagal energy drink

P2:10:02 <C418> it's like trackmania nations forever and trackmania united
P2:10:03 <Evil-Ville> I can only tolerate people whining about paying for minecraft by telling myself that all the whiners are 12 year old kids

P2:11:11 <paul|not> Evil-Ville: isn't that how you deal with all arguments about paying for things?
P2:11:15 <paul|not> it's how I do it anyways
P2:11:27 <Wootsicle> yeah uh
P2:11:30 <Wootsicle> i'm not 12
P2:11:42 <Wootsicle> i just want my pals to play as well, and they dont find this game worth paying for
P2:11:49 <Drakkar> I just don't care
P2:11:53 <Evil-Ville> Are your pals 12 years old
P2:11:57 <paul|not> eighty dollars even if you were paying for four licenses is not exactly prohibitively expensive
P2:11:58 <Wootsicle> nope
P2:12:02 <Drakkar> its other people's prerogative to whine
P2:12:04 <paul|not> twenty dollars is even more laughable
P2:12:10 <Drakkar> despite the fact that whining not only emasculates them to others
P2:12:12 <C418> I bought a very short indie game yesterday for 5€. Best 5€ I've spent all month
P2:12:16 <Drakkar> but also alienates others
P2:12:22 <Drakkar> what game
P2:12:29 <C418> blueberry garden of course
P2:12:30 <paul|not> blueberry garden?
P2:12:32 <Drakkar> oh god

P2:12:34 <Drakkar> I want that so bad
P2:12:40 <Drakkar> is it as cool as it looks?

P2:12:51 <Drakkar> YES
P2:12:53 <Drakkar> fuck

P5:28:44 <peerkoel> I just wondered about the same thing, and you cannot get single user levels into multiplayer game mode
P5:31:24 <wingfag> but yo can multiplayer?
P5:32:05 <peerkoel> running a server, logging in on the site: multiplayer
P5:32:32 <wingfag> i think i get how this works then
P5:32:45 <wingfag> build a map in multiplayer and you can just save the data
P5:32:52 <wingfag> and send to people
P5:32:58 <wingfag> but not with singleplayer
P5:33:00 <peerkoel> the server saves the data every minute
P5:33:02 <peerkoel> or so
P5:33:07 <peerkoel> you got it
P5:33:12 <wingfag> thaks :)
P5:33:16 <wingfag> thanks
