A3:17:14 <AndrewPH> 7 different actionscript autoclickers
A3:17:21 <AndrewPH> that all click in a slightly different pattern
A3:17:33 <Visiiri> We have a right auto clicker and a left autoclicker

A3:18:18 <Visiiri> I don't think I can do that ATM
A3:18:31 <Roadcrosser|W7> and a solid/empty
A3:18:33 <Roadcrosser|W7> why?
A3:18:44 <VurtualRuler98> So, how do I set up MP survival?
A3:18:46 <Visiiri> I'd have to have maths in there
A3:18:52 <Visiiri> MP survival; step one
A3:18:55 <Visiiri> get into your tem
A3:18:58 <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, do nothing
A3:19:00 <AndrewPH> OR
A3:19:01 <Visiiri> find www.minecraft.net
A3:19:03 <AndrewPH> make the server private
A3:19:07 <VurtualRuler98> Found that.
A3:19:14 <AndrewPH> oh
A3:19:14 <Visiiri> minecraft-creeper-test
A3:19:17 <Visiiri> minecraft.jar
A3:19:26 <Visiiri> take that into your client folder
A3:19:34 <Visiiri> where you had to place the original minecraft.jar
A3:19:35 <VurtualRuler98> Wait, this doesn't work with normal MC?

A3:20:04 <Roadcrosser|W7> ...
A3:20:05 <AndrewPH> wat
A3:20:10 <Roadcrosser|W7> vurtual
A3:20:12 <AndrewPH> I meant clients
A3:20:12 <Visiiri> you just have to replace the "minecraft.jar" in "minecraft"
A3:20:15 <Visiiri> :P
A3:20:17 <VurtualRuler98> k
A3:20:17 <Roadcrosser|W7> if you want
A3:20:22 <VurtualRuler98> I renamed the whole folder, didn't work.
A3:20:24 <VurtualRuler98> Will try just jar
A3:20:24 <Visiiri> outside of minecraft-creeper
A3:20:24 <Roadcrosser|W7> come to the archives
A3:20:30 <clone1018> Time to make a new map
A3:20:30 <Visiiri> not folder

A3:20:39 <Visiiri> minecraft.jar
A3:20:42 <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, mobs aren't synched

A3:20:46 <VurtualRuler98> So?

A3:21:51 <VurtualRuler98> Okay, gimme a sec

A3:22:16 <Roadcrosser|W7> put minecraft.jar in lib folder

A3:56:22 <AndrewPH> that's total
A3:56:25 <AndrewPH> you can use more
A3:56:52 <clone1018> duh

A6:29:10 <Quatroking> It ruins gameplay for everyone else
A6:29:18 <Siiseli> no it doesn't.
A6:29:20 <Quatroking> And makes people lazy as fuck
A6:29:32 <Siiseli> well if the original game is built in such a way that building is a pain in the ass
A6:29:38 <Siiseli> then why not use hacks that make it more fun
A6:29:40 <Quatroking> "omg i cant use hacks this server SUCKSSS"
A6:29:55 <Siiseli> :p
A6:30:09 <oldage> wat, that's actually the truth

A6:31:00 <Marach> hacks on theone's lava are pointless
A6:31:07 <oldage> ya
A6:31:07 <Marach> its good theyre disabled here
A6:31:19 <oldage> takes away the whole point of surviving lava
A6:31:20 <Siiseli> oh yeah well that individual was an idiot
A6:31:28 <Marach> we dont need that guys here
A6:31:47 <Quatroking> and thanks to all those goddamn hacks, servers now have to put tags on themselves to prevent people from hacking
A6:31:50 <Siiseli> well yeah but hack users in general shouldn't be banned
A6:31:51 <Quatroking> how is this logical?
A6:32:09 <Siiseli> and Marach if we banned all idiots from here
A6:32:13 <Siiseli> there wouldn't be many left
A6:32:31 <Marach> public servers = idiot magnets.

A8:45:40 <Roadcrosser|W7> i think i saw an ld post bout that

A8:46:12 <Roadcrosser|W7> you need one for the contest?
A8:46:18 <Roadcrosser|W7> as a prize?
A8:46:24 <AlexVMiner> well
A8:46:25 <Drakkar> because you have to write reams and reams of text

A8:46:35 <Roadcrosser|W7> i gave mine
A8:46:48 <Drakkar> something most developers NEVER do
A8:46:49 <AlexVMiner> because maybe the second unpaid could get one
A8:47:07 <Drakkar> its akin to writing a novel
A8:47:09 <Drakkar> but interactive
A8:47:12 <Drakkar> or a short story
A8:47:30 <Drakkar> which means its also far harder to get away with a bad one

A9:01:23 <VurtualRuler98> Gallium-boned coconut chicken.
A9:01:43 <VurtualRuler98> All this indie game stuff makes me want to make a game.
A9:01:58 <Snowman> You know what?
A9:02:08 <Snowman> Enter in the Christmachinima :p
A9:02:12 <VurtualRuler98> no
A9:02:17 <Snowman> It's almost like making a game!
A9:02:26 <VurtualRuler98> I'm daydreaming about an RPG FPS, with no stats, and only new items/equipment of awesomeness to improve oneself.
A9:03:10 <VurtualRuler98> Like, you're in some barren place, and you have to mess around and get a little base working to survive in a desert planet. You have some hazard suit armor thing, but it's all brown and rusty and liightly steampunk'd.
A9:03:24 <VurtualRuler98> Then bad guys invariably try to kill you. So you shoot them.

A9:07:32 <Quatroking> lmao
A9:07:46 <Quatroking> two kids yesterday put fireworks in a pipe
A9:07:49 <Quatroking> and it exploded
A9:07:51 <VurtualRuler98> It'd be like finding a new gun in Half-Life 2, you'd still use the others.
A9:07:55 <Quatroking> and one of the kids has a concussion
A9:08:04 <Quatroking> and the other is now missing an eye
A9:08:04 <Snowman> They were 13 and 15

A9:09:53 <Snowman> I don't feel sorry for him

A9:09:59 <VurtualRuler98> That's how you fire fireworks.

A9:10:03 <VurtualRuler98> They just didn't know how to fireworks.
A9:10:10 <Nalok> Hookay....skin idea...
A9:10:15 <VurtualRuler98> I feel sad about this, if you don't, you're just screwed up, man.
A9:10:40 <Snowman> If they don't know how fireworks work THEY SHOULDN"T USE THEM
A9:10:42 <Nalok> Someone make a computer head with the BSOD on it :D
A9:10:43 <VurtualRuler98> I have friends who have seriously been screwed up by stuff like this, it isn't funny when it's people you care about. It's not funny at all.
A9:10:54 <Snowman> And their parents suck, who gives 13 and 14 year olds fireworks?
A9:11:04 <VurtualRuler98> I had fireworks when I was a kid. :/
A9:11:11 <VurtualRuler98> Well, they were there, and I could reach them.
A9:11:11 <Quatroking> yeah but you're not a dutchfag
A9:11:24 <VurtualRuler98> I'm a redneck kid with a thirst for explosions.
A9:11:39 <Quatroking> here in holland you have to be 16 to buy fireworks, and you're not allowed to fire them at all except on 31 december
A9:11:42 <Snowman> Loads of people in the Netherlands have illegal fireworks too
A9:11:43 <Nalok> LADIES AND MENTELGEN
A9:11:47 <Quatroking> true true
A9:11:51 <Quatroking> but not 13 year olds
A9:11:54 <Quatroking> derp
A9:12:09 <Snowman> There are loads of kids with just normal fireworks though
A9:12:12 <Snowman> Bad parents
A9:12:16 <Quatroking> unless the peeps in belgium are stupid enough to sell their fireworks to kids
A9:12:23 <Snowman> The only fireworks kids should use are sterretjes
A9:12:28 <Snowman> Under adult supervision
A9:12:35 <Quatroking> sparklers
A9:12:38 <Quatroking> and rotjes
A9:12:43 <VurtualRuler98> I've had friends who had their legs burned off, or are horribly scarred by an explosion.
A9:12:47 <Quatroking> lol
A9:12:48 <Snowman> Those are too explosive
A9:12:57 <Quatroking> nah, rotjes are alright
A9:13:01 <Snowman> Kids will stuff em in their nose and light them
A9:13:09 <VurtualRuler98> This isn't something to hate someone for, they did something stupid. Don't you have emotions?
A9:13:17 <Quatroking> you can pretty much stand on rotjes without even getting injured
A9:14:06 <Snowman> VurtualRuler98, it's their own fucking fault
A9:14:21 <VurtualRuler98> It's an accident.
A9:14:26 <Snowman> If you would go to the store, buy a gun, then shoot yourself with it, should I feel sorry for you?
A9:14:27 <VurtualRuler98> Didn't you do something stupid as a kid?
A9:14:32 <PuyoDead> Live and learn.
A9:14:45 <Snowman> Well I certainly didn play around with dangerous stuff like fireworks
A9:14:46 <Quatroking> I didn't do fireworks until I was 15
A9:14:49 <VurtualRuler98> What if I accidentally got a huge scar on my arm when doing target practice?
13A9:14:50 * Quatroking feels sad
A9:14:56 <Snowman> It's the same as giving a gun to kids
A9:14:59 <VurtualRuler98> What about the guy who blew his arm off at a normal day at the range?
A9:15:09 <Quatroking> lern 2 gun
A9:15:12 <Snowman> He wasn't a kid
A9:15:18 <VurtualRuler98> They weren't experienced enough, and accidentally loaded a bullet wrong.
A9:15:18 <Snowman> And how can you shoot your own arm off
A9:15:25 <Quatroking> snowman: shotgun
A9:15:28 <Snowman> You're supposed to hold the gun the other way around
A9:15:32 <Nalok> I need a good server to play on
A9:15:42 <Quatroking> extreme recoil?
A9:15:43 <VurtualRuler98> A round that didn't chamber properly, and was mis-manufactured.
A9:15:44 <Snowman> Inexperienced people always need supervision
A9:15:45 <Nalok> Also some kids are just that retarded, Snow
A9:15:50 <Snowman> Not some, all
A9:15:59 <VurtualRuler98> So it blows and sets off a chain reaction, and you lose grip of the gun, or your hands are blown off.
A9:16:03 <Quatroking> until you're 16 you're a fucking retard
A9:16:04 <Quatroking> fact
A9:16:11 <PuyoDead> People have accidents, it happens.
A9:16:20 <VurtualRuler98> Should we hate people for them?
A9:16:26 <Quatroking> yes
A9:16:37 <PuyoDead> No, but sometimes, they can be for stupid reasons.
A9:16:37 <Snowman> If you do dangerous stuff, make sure to have someone with you who is experienced enough to prevent you from getting hurt
A9:16:42 <Nalok> Hey, when I was a kid I knew bullets went out the hole. Thank you Call of Duty
A9:16:55 <Snowman> Kids are obviously not experienced with fireworks
A9:17:00 <VurtualRuler98> I learned how to operate firearms thanks to counter-strike, goldeneye, and rainbow six.
A9:17:05 <Snowman> They shouldn't be using them
A9:17:06 <PuyoDead> Also, Vurtual, have you not realized that Quatro and Snow are trolling you yet?
A9:17:10 <Snowman> ...
A9:17:14 <Quatroking> I'm not trolling
A9:17:17 <Quatroking> I hate kids.
A9:17:18 <Snowman> I'm dead serious
A9:17:21 <VurtualRuler98> PuyoDead, if they are, and they probably aren't, then I'll gladly argue them bored.
A9:17:22 <Snowman> I hate kids too
A9:17:31 <Nalok> Quat, how old are you exactly?
A9:17:34 <Snowman> <VurtualRuler98> I learned how to operate firearms thanks to counter-strike, goldeneye, and rainbow six.
A9:17:38 <Snowman> I facepalmed at this
A9:17:42 <VurtualRuler98> Snowman, no, really.
A9:17:53 <VurtualRuler98> I was a great shot the day I first had a gun.
A9:17:59 <Quatroking> Yeah, snowman, I've learned a lot about firearms thanks to games too.
A9:18:04 <VurtualRuler98> Amazing accuracy.
A9:18:10 <Quatroking> HOWEVER
A9:18:14 <PuyoDead> Ok, nevermind, it's the other way around.
A9:18:15 <Snowman> But using them in game is not the same as shooting them irl
A9:18:16 <Nalok> And besides, I played with toy guns too
A9:18:30 <PuyoDead> Sorry Quatro and Snow, I had it backwards.
A9:18:30 <Quatroking> I'm not all of the sudden a wannabe terrorist like the media says

P3:36:02 <BananaBot> Kratospie is the biggest troll I've ever had the misfortune of meeting.
P3:36:08 <mail2345|smacx> he's not a troll
P3:36:11 <mail2345|smacx> he's an idiot
P3:36:16 <AndrewPH> same difference
P3:36:18 <vede> Yeah, mail2345 is right.
P3:36:19 <mail2345|smacx> not really
P3:36:27 <AndrewPH> both are retarded
P3:36:28 <vede> He's just really, really stupid.
P3:36:31 <mail2345|smacx> ^^

P3:37:20 <PuyoDead> Again, this has happened before.
P3:37:24 <mail2345|smacx> along with the other troll alts

P7:05:18 <Darkebrz> He made one spelling mistake, not a grammar mistake
P7:05:19 <Snowman> The rest are

P7:36:51 <Iguana> I guess end of the week.
P7:37:01 <Iguana> Wednesday to Friday actually.
P7:37:02 <Koitenshin> okay then. I was gonna ask how you get the heightmap to utilize the full 256 depth
P7:37:12 <PuyoDead> So 3 weeks from now, ok.
P7:37:14 <Koitenshin> in Omen
P7:37:15 <clone1018> I got it TrueWolves

P7:37:28 <Iguana> Wut. 3 weeks!?
13P7:37:31 * Iguana reads deeper
P7:37:42 <PuyoDead> Vavle time, you see.
P7:37:43 <Koitenshin> Any time I import the Heightmap in Omen it only uses like 64 depth and then the rest is stone
P7:37:45 <mail2345> valve time

P7:37:50 <chariot> Oh.
P7:37:50 <PuyoDead> damnit! Valve.
P7:37:53 <mail2345> there is also swine time
P7:37:57 <mail2345> SWINE TIME
P7:38:04 <Koitenshin> It doesn't churn out maps like yours.
P7:38:08 <chariot> I don't know, I always make the map 256^3 and then import the heightmap
P7:38:16 <Koitenshin> That's what I did.
P7:38:22 <chariot> a lot of times, the top of the map is so close to the roof though
P7:38:32 <Koitenshin> That's fine with me.
P7:38:35 <chariot> the top of the land is so close to the top of the map*
P7:38:36 <clone1018> Okay
P7:38:40 <clone1018> ISO craft is telling me
P7:38:49 <clone1018> Enter save name with extension: 
P7:39:02 <Koitenshin> But it doesnt exactly give me what it shows me in the 3d view
P7:39:04 <clone1018> What extension should I use?
P7:39:09 <chariot> png
P7:39:14 <Koitenshin> it gives me that....but it's squished badly.
P7:39:21 <chariot> Wierd
P7:39:36 <chariot> are you setting the dimensions to 256x256 in world machine?
P7:39:37 <Koitenshin> even with the scale set to 1.3333
P7:39:41 <Koitenshin> Yes.
P7:40:00 <chariot> that's odd
P7:40:17 <chariot> to be honest, i've never had trouble making maps in omen, they all seem to come out good
P7:40:29 <Koitenshin> What filters do you use in World machine?
P7:41:04 <chariot> hold on
P7:41:41 <clone1018> For some reason ISO craft wont work :\

P7:45:29 <chariot> if that even works in omen

P8:03:08 <clone1018> How to use OMEN's image import?
P8:03:24 <Koitenshin> Easy. Map must have same dimensions as image

P8:04:14 <Koitenshin> Even with the tried scaling, I have 131 layers of stone.
P8:04:32 <Koitenshin> I don't think Omen can read heightmaps properly.
P8:04:52 <chariot> It just needs to be able to slide them up/down

P8:07:07 <Koitenshin> Yeah then I could sync up the water levels.
P8:07:34 <Koitenshin> The reason I don't think it reads them properly is the scaling.

P8:08:07 <Koitenshin> but it looks the same either way in Omen.

P8:12:46 <Koitenshin> I'm running a test now but I might have found the problem.
P8:13:32 <Koitenshin> Yeah, it reads normal heightmaps correctly. World Machine has a problem.
P8:13:42 <Koitenshin> It doesn't output height maps correctly.

P8:14:37 <Koitenshin> What layer the rock starts on.

P8:23:08 <Koitenshin> You didn't even know what the problem was.
P8:24:15 <Animator> Oh hey, you're that dude who did that whole Thomas Edison thing in that thread.
P8:24:39 <Koitenshin> I still think a Universal ban list would work, if done by certain people.
P8:24:55 <Koitenshin> Basically honest people.
P8:25:12 <Animator> I hope you realise the fact that every server has their own definition of griefing.
P8:25:15 <Animator> And proxies.
P8:25:20 <Animator> And dynamic I.P.'s.
P8:25:38 <Koitenshin> I only list name bans
P8:25:41 <Koitenshin> and static IPs
P8:25:48 <chariot> Animator you didn't have to anonymously call me out in that thread like that, bro
P8:25:48 <Animator> Unless Notch unified each server with a common set of rules, it would never work.
P8:25:56 <Animator> Yes, I had to.
P8:26:03 <Animator> Because the mods are tired of it.
P8:26:12 <Animator> It was also addressed to everyone else.
P8:26:15 <chariot> Of me reporting posts? All 3 of them?
P8:26:21 <Animator> Not reporting posts.
P8:26:26 <Animator> Telling us what to do.
P8:26:41 <Animator> "BAN SO-AND-SO YOU'RE WIMPS GET SOME COJONES"
P8:27:03 <Koitenshin> Some OPs in servers ARE too lenient.
P8:27:13 <Animator> That's the server's problem.
P8:27:19 <chariot> it's a suggestion >: )
P8:27:20 <Koitenshin> and some OPs/Admins are complete bastards
P8:27:28 <Animator> Like most of WoM.
P8:27:44 <Koitenshin> I've never been on a WoM server so I can't say.
P8:28:04 <Animator> Oh, I have. SMP and the owner of WoM is a nice guy.
P8:28:14 <Animator> I just hope they've been fixing that.
P8:28:43 <Koitenshin> I'm just glad ZOMG now runs perfectly for me.
P8:28:53 <Animator> But again, each server has an individual right to whom they ban.
P8:28:56 <Koitenshin> And I fixed my World Machine too.
P8:29:03 <Animator> Unless Notch says otherwise.
P8:29:39 <Koitenshin> Well if the moment you get out of spawn you run around deleting blocks and placing random ones, you're a griefer in my book
P8:29:44 <Koitenshin> that's what bjr did.
P8:30:07 <Koitenshin> It was probably an MC bot or script.
P8:30:16 <Animator> That's just bjr's. Not the entire consesus of all servers.
P8:30:31 <Animator> And then there are the servers whose purpose is to be griefed.
P8:30:45 <Koitenshin> That's different.
P8:30:53 <Koitenshin> The destressing server doesn't count.
P8:31:05 <Animator> But the concept you laid out is universal.
P8:31:16 <Animator> Which applies to all servers.
P8:31:26 <Koitenshin> Okay fine, "An Almost Universal Ban List"
P8:31:35 <Koitenshin> Is that better?
P8:32:09 <Animator> Even then, there are still flaws I can poke out of there. I'm just not in the mood to debate heavily.
P8:32:36 <Koitenshin> But I think it is good to share ban lists.
P8:32:55 <Koitenshin> In my server, if I hear of anyone griefing ANY server, they get banned.
P8:33:03 <Koitenshin> except the destressing one.

P8:53:04 <vede> I went into this program wanting to make a game, and I just spent the last four hours making a system by which I can load fonts from a png, and then easily draw them to the screen at any size or color I want.
P8:53:21 <vede> :/
P8:53:31 <TrueWolves> o.O
P8:53:34 <vede> Which will be really useful, but...
P8:54:30 <vede> It's a pretty cool system, I think. I mean, it's better than the default font loading/drawing system.
P8:54:41 <Koitenshin> Most RPGs allow you to choose different fonts/colors/sizes
P8:54:42 <vede> Which is just way over-complicated.
P8:54:51 <Koitenshin> so here's to your hopefully good RPG

P8:56:32 <Animator> And you're going to code a game...
P8:56:35 <Animator> And, yeah...
P8:56:39 <vede> I'm thinking a sort of sci-fi shooter with some really simplistic RPG elements, but I really don't know.
P8:56:55 <Animator> I was going for fast-paced platformer with guns.
P8:57:05 <Animator> Of varying difficulty.
P8:57:09 <Mudder> lol
P8:57:12 <vede> Like, you get lazor gunz and then when you kill x amount of enemies, you pick a cool special attack.
P8:57:34 <Mudder> vede id play that. 
P8:57:43 <Mudder> wut launguage?
P8:57:48 <vede> Python.
P8:58:01 <Animator> Wicked.
P8:59:30 <vede> I don't think teaming up with anyone would be a really good idea, seeing my depressingly low finish-rate with games.
P8:59:49 <Mudder> wait... gui? or tb?
P8:59:52 <VurtualRuler98> The only "id play that" games are the ones so vague people optimism it into likability.

P9:06:38 <Animator> The idea for my game has side-scrolling.
P9:06:45 <Animator> That's what makes it fast-paced.
P9:06:55 <Animator> Well, it starts out normal at first.
P9:06:57 <Koitenshin> Is it Metal Slug sidescrolling epic?
P9:07:08 <Animator> Then a sudden explosion, and then sidescrolling.
P9:07:27 <Animator> Very fast sidescrolling while killing flying robots simultanoeusly.
P9:07:38 <Koitenshin> you mean an intro movie, then ewxplosion, then sidescrolling?
P9:07:50 <Animator> And then the boss you fight, which is a giant transforming blade, is also in the sidescrolling part.
P9:07:53 <Animator> Not an intro movie.
P9:07:54 <Koitenshin> because normal could be anything
P9:07:54 <VurtualRuler98> Well, real men use FIRST PERSON THREE DEE!
P9:08:16 <Animator> An intro battle.
P9:08:21 <Koitenshin> real men are pansies that think they need first person three dee
P9:08:43 <Koitenshin> true real men play the game for sake of playing the game

P9:12:59 <Animator> I'm a spritist/photoshopper.
P9:13:08 <Animator> I'm 1/2 of a whole.
P9:13:32 <Animator> I make spritesheets when I bored.
P9:13:37 <mail2345|smacx> and if the programmer has easy accesss to a suicide mechanism that he could use if he detected his psycology was under attack?
P9:13:48 <VurtualRuler98> mail2345|smacx, still easy.
P9:13:48 <Animator> Robots, people, cyborgs, aliens, ships, you name it.
P9:13:55 <Animator> So how about it, vede?
P9:13:59 <VurtualRuler98> Because you can easily gain trust and bend will.
P9:14:15 <vede> If you're manipulating someone such that the person can tell you're manipulating them, you fail at manipulation.
P9:14:44 <mail2345|smacx> but what if the programmer was excessivly paranoid
P9:14:51 <Animator> Vede?
P9:14:53 <mail2345|smacx> and had to consult a committe before opening the box
P9:14:54 <vede> I'm fine with it, Animator, but be warned that there's a relatively good chance that the game ends up unfinished.
P9:15:06 <VurtualRuler98> mail2345|smacx, still easy.
P9:15:10 <VurtualRuler98> Because you can easily gain trust and bend will.
P9:15:10 <Animator> I'm also very good at nagging.
P9:15:15 <Animator> So I'll take my bets.
P9:15:23 <vede> Alright, then!
P9:15:38 <mail2345|smacx> and if the commite kills the programmer if he asks to open the box?

P9:16:40 <VurtualRuler98> So you turn programmer into your real world avatar.
P9:17:14 <vede> If the only way the AI could communicate is on an isolated chat terminal, and the programmer had to consult an outside committee every time he wanted to do something, I think the odds of escape would be properly low.
P9:17:23 <VurtualRuler98> Who then kills the committe, or retrains them.
P9:17:32 <mail2345|smacx> the programmer is unarmed
P9:17:36 <VurtualRuler98> Without ever talking to them.
P9:17:44 <VurtualRuler98> Just your mood can do wonders to an opinion.
P9:17:59 <vede> And even then, it would be possible to appoint a person who has no communication with the programmer or committee to stop any escapes from happening.

P11:00:37 <Koitenshin> can you say CPU intensive?
P11:01:15 <vede> Why would it be CPU intensive?
P11:01:19 <Koitenshin> or notch could simply add in a new list that only certain players can add/destroy blocks
P11:01:33 <Koitenshin> like the /allow command that has been suggested
P11:01:43 <vede> It just detects incoming packets and gets rid of blockchange packets.

P11:05:37 <AndrewPH> The minecraft community has a brain similar to Bananabot's
P11:05:37 <Koitenshin> I am now Level 12.
P11:05:39 <mail2345|smacx> this channel therefore must be highly concentrated stupidity
P11:05:47 <mail2345|smacx> @andrew bananabot is more intelligent
P11:05:48 <Koitenshin> I have absolutely no chance of dying.

P11:07:05 <TestDummy> I've already made note of that myself.

P11:07:16 <PuyoDead> It's yet another example of this communities obsession with shitty bots.
P11:07:17 <Kratospie> Bannana bot is a bot

P11:07:35 <Kratospie> Why are there always so many bots on this IRC?
P11:07:44 <Cial> mail is making a bot army to take over the world
P11:07:48 <Koitenshin> Because we get bored by ourselves.
P11:07:49 <mail2345|smacx> indeed
