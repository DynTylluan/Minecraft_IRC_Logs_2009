A1:24:46 <asiekierka> So singleplayer must work
A1:24:54 <asiekierka> cuz multiplayer is like the thing you ADD to an engine

A1:51:06 <asiekierka> (i'm on windows)
A1:51:27 <Parthon> visual c++ express 2008 is the one I use

A1:52:57 <asiekierka> I'm talking about C compilers allowing multiplatform support
A1:53:28 <Parthon> yah
A1:53:32 <asiekierka> I think... MinGW maybe
A1:53:38 <asiekierka> or cygwin GCC
A1:53:47 <asiekierka> but MinGW's generally suited for windows
A1:53:49 <Parthon> sure, if you want
A1:53:51 <asiekierka> while cygwin... meh
A1:53:55 <Rommel> Ew cygwin
A1:54:04 <Parthon> cause, you know
A1:54:15 <asiekierka> what?
A1:54:17 <Parthon> the linux games market is HUGE
A1:54:25 <asiekierka> My game will be open source

A1:54:44 <Parthon> will you use SDL?
A1:54:46 <asiekierka> Yes
A1:54:54 <Parthon> then almost any compiler will work

A1:55:05 <asiekierka> that's the point

A1:58:41 <asiekierka> SDL has networking support
A1:58:42 <Maveric> just use something thats on the jvm or python

A1:59:54 <asiekierka> I don't know java or python
A1:59:57 <asiekierka> I know C a bit
A2:00:00 <asiekierka> and Pascal a bit
A2:00:12 <Maveric> You'll be better off going to Python
A2:00:14 <Parthon> takes me a day to learn a language now
A2:00:17 <Maveric> A lot easier to learn
A2:00:22 <asiekierka> :/
A2:00:25 <Parthon> python is the bomb
A2:00:31 <Maveric> Parthon: language using the same paradigm?
A2:00:32 <asiekierka> Gimmie python tutorials NOW
A2:00:38 <Maveric> Eh
A2:00:39 <Parthon> but getting a game finished is more important
A2:00:44 <Maveric> How to think like acomputer scientist: Python
A2:01:00 <Maveric> iirc that's a pretty mellow book
A2:01:00 <Parthon> Maveric: anything in the object oriented or procedural paradigms
A2:01:11 <asiekierka> Also Python needs you to download it
A2:01:15 <asiekierka> while C apps are standalone
A2:01:18 <Parthon> like, cobol, fortran or lisp could cause me problems :P
A2:01:25 <Maveric> :P
A2:01:32 <Maveric> guh
A2:01:42 <Maveric> I can't think of the one language that'd give you the most problems
A2:01:49 <Parthon> brainfuck?
A2:01:49 <Maveric> You define rules
A2:01:54 <Maveric> haha :P
A2:01:59 <asiekierka> I like BF
A2:02:07 <asiekierka> If it had networking support I would code the game in it :P
A2:02:10 <Maveric> I think the most complex brainfuck program was actually made by a lisp program
A2:02:21 <asiekierka> The most complex BF program is 2mb
A2:02:28 <asiekierka> made by a Basic to BF converter
A2:02:31 <Parthon> that's the problem with BF, it's complex and doesn't have good support
A2:02:33 <asiekierka> The Basic program was 2.7kb though
A2:02:40 <asiekierka> BF IS NOT A REAL LANGUAGE
A2:02:42 <asiekierka> it's an esoteric language
A2:02:52 <Parthon> it's turing complete

10A6:39:30 * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5C3C5.versanet.de) has joined #minecraft
A6:39:31 <Visiiri> I am exploring the depths of mIRC
A6:39:34 <Visiiri> Ohai!
A6:39:38 <cryzed> Hey
A6:39:38 <Visiiri> I wanted to talk to you.
A6:39:43 <cryzed> Me? Really?
A6:39:47 <Visiiri> Yeah.
A6:39:48 <Visiiri> Really.
A6:39:52 <Visiiri> SURPRISE!
A6:39:52 <cryzed> mhrly
A6:39:53 <Visiiri> :O
A6:39:54 <cryzed> What about
A6:40:01 <Visiiri> Your admin scripts.
A6:40:07 <cryzed> yes, there's a problem?
A6:40:10 <Visiiri> I know a total of nothing about them.
A6:40:16 <cryzed> Wow that's pretty much
A6:40:16 <Visiiri> I don't even have python.
A6:40:26 <Visiiri> But I could.
A6:40:28 <cryzed> Why don't you just follow the instructions given then?
A6:40:31 <Visiiri> I'm not an idiot.
A6:40:39 <Visiiri> I just wanted to know about how they work.
A6:40:45 <cryzed> Well
A6:40:55 <cryzed> the scripts basically (simplified) monitor the output of the server executable
13A6:40:59 * Misterangry hands SteGriff a cookie
A6:41:07 <cryzed> you know when you open the java executable
A6:41:11 <cryzed> there's this console output
A6:41:16 <cryzed> xxyyzz says: blabla
A6:41:20 <Visiiri> The console?
A6:41:21 <SteGriff> thanks
A6:41:21 <cryzed> xxxyyzz admin: blabla
A6:41:23 <cryzed> yes
A6:41:24 <Visiiri> With the server up?
A6:41:26 <Visiiri> Ah yeah.
A6:41:33 <cryzed> I catch that output (stderr output stream)
A6:41:35 <cryzed> filter it
A6:41:38 <cryzed> parse the line
A6:41:46 <cryzed> and call callbacks (functions) if there's a special event
A6:41:54 <cryzed> The plugins have constant access to this output stream
A6:42:14 <cryzed> so they can run on their own without relying on only one stream
A6:42:15 <cryzed> ._.
A6:42:27 <cryzed> for example
A6:42:29 <Visiiri> A little over my head, but I get the concept.
A6:42:34 <cryzed> a says: b
A6:42:36 <cryzed> this get's parsed
A6:42:43 <cryzed> name = a
A6:42:47 <cryzed> action = says
10A6:42:47 * citricsquid (sam@client-81-97-78-58.mcr-bng-013.adsl.virginmedia.net) has joined #minecraft
10A6:42:48 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
A6:42:49 <cryzed> line = b
A6:43:11 <cryzed> if b is a valid key in a dictionary (the commands dictionary)
A6:43:17 <cryzed> it calls the given command
A6:43:19 <cryzed> !run
A6:43:21 <Visiiri> Ah.
A6:43:21 <cryzed> for example
A6:43:31 <Visiiri> Quite similar to even mIRC in that way.
A6:43:34 <Visiiri> lol
A6:43:52 <cryzed> I don't really know about mIRC seeing as I'm using Linux and therefore can't use mIRC without fiddling with WINE
A6:44:16 <Visiiri> So could you add a "/" command to it that isn't shown in game, but still causes an action?
A6:44:17 <cryzed> So, did that help you?
A6:44:24 <cryzed> No, that won't work unfortunately
A6:44:30 <cryzed> The output won't show up in the console
A6:44:38 <Visiiri> Hm.
A6:44:40 <cryzed> I would have to filter the tcp packets from the server to the client
A6:44:43 <cryzed> with a proxy in between ._.
A6:44:53 <Visiiri> Not really worth it then.
A6:44:56 <cryzed> But I'll just wait for Lua scripting
A6:45:02 <cryzed> And then I can do all this stuff
A6:45:07 <cryzed> without all that crap
A6:45:13 <cryzed> There ARE people who did that tho
A6:45:15 <cryzed> JTE
A6:45:18 <cryzed> for example
A6:45:52 <cryzed> Anything else?
A6:46:10 <cryzed> Good then I'll continue my rant
A6:46:14 <Visiiri> lol
A6:46:14 <cryzed> Why the fuck is there no blog post :O
A6:46:21 <cryzed> Notch said he would work 3 days from now on
A6:46:28 <cryzed> and he was not a single time on here, right?
A6:46:38 <Visiiri> I haven't seen him all night.
A6:46:44 <Visiiri> Wich is quite the while.
A6:46:52 <cryzed> yes, I think he's slacking off
A6:47:01 <Visiiri> I am developing a dumbass slap alias to pass time >.>
A6:47:02 <citricsquid> he starts on minecraft 3 days a week tomorrow/.
A6:47:04 <cryzed> First he is sick then he makes a week break ._.
A6:47:17 <cryzed> citricsquid: he said fri, sat, sun - right?
A6:47:28 <cryzed> Do that Visiiri  :D
13A6:47:33 * Visiiri slaps cryzed around a bit with a My mathbook.
A6:47:36 <Visiiri> :O
A6:47:38 <Visiiri> it's lame.
A6:47:45 <citricsquid> cryzed: tuesday thurs friday
A6:47:56 <cryzed> Oh then I misread it apparently
A6:48:09 <cryzed> he jumps a day?
A6:48:11 <citricsquid> Starting August 1, I will work three full days per week (Tuesday, Thursday and Friday) on Minecraft, in addition to the time I now put in during my free time and on weekends, all made possible because of the impressive amount of pre-orders the game has received.
A6:48:17 <citricsquid> cryzed: he has his other job.
13A6:48:27 * Visiiri slaps cryzd around a bit with a monkey
A6:48:31 <cryzed> You are a co-developer
A6:48:34 <cryzed> ?
A6:48:38 <cryzed> Visiiri: that hurts!
A6:48:40 <citricsquid> no?
A6:48:41 <Visiiri> lol
A6:48:48 <cryzed> citricsquid: because you said "I"
A6:48:56 <citricsquid> it'scopy pasta
A6:48:58 <citricsquid> from the blog
A6:49:01 <Visiiri> I feel he was quoting.

A6:49:35 <cryzed> Cueball: obviously not elsewise I wouldn't be ranting but kissing his feet ._.
A6:49:39 <Visiiri> What is that?
A6:49:41 <Cue> FFFFF
A6:49:45 <Cue> :(

A6:49:50 <Cueball> uhmm
A6:49:53 <Cueball> its a big pipe system
A6:49:57 <Cueball> that replicates a pattern
A6:49:57 <Visiiri> I want to work on the minecraft chat scripts...
A6:50:03 <Visiiri> I don't think he'd let me though.
A6:50:12 <Visiiri> I don't think I've dug deep enough for it.
A6:50:23 <cryzed> longer chat-messages ftw, also better UI
A6:50:23 <Visiiri> Actually, I haven't looked into it at all.
A6:50:54 <Visiiri> I was going for local chat, shouting, messages, OP, and, if it goes that far, clans.
A6:51:04 <cryzed> the [cryzed] clan
A6:51:06 <cryzed> glorious
A6:51:10 <Visiiri> lol
A6:51:11 <Plinky> Mhmm
A6:51:20 <Plinky> Yay for finishing my tree fort
A6:51:27 <Visiiri> I think I could do that on mIRC...
A6:51:35 <Plinky> It only got griefed once, then I accidently flooded it >.>
A6:54:41 <Visiiri> Hmmmm...
A6:55:34 <Plinky> I hate griefers

A6:59:08 <Plinky> Goodbye everyone XD
A6:59:15 <Visiiri> That means that I couldn't hack into the server, ban the OP's, and set up bots to control it :<

A7:10:40 <ZomBuster> what would that be
A7:10:42 <asiekierka> Basically a 2D ASCII sandbox 
A7:10:43 <asiekierka> BUT
13A7:10:46 * ez is confused and want to sleep
A7:10:48 <asiekierka> 1) You can save the work to your PC
A7:10:53 <asiekierka> 2) You can have a lot of "2D boards"
A7:10:59 <asiekierka> which can be variously linked
A7:11:17 <asiekierka> 3) The 2D boards can be up to 256x256
A7:11:38 <ZomBuster> uuh and what is the gameplay
A7:11:42 <asiekierka> No gameplay
A7:11:43 <asiekierka> just sandbox
A7:11:45 <asiekierka> chatting
A7:11:46 <asiekierka> building stuff
A7:11:47 <asiekierka> etc
A7:11:47 <ZomBuster> I can make an ASCII sandbox in notepad too

A7:13:57 <citricsquid> just set myself on fire

A8:23:59 <gdude2002> Yes.
A8:24:00 <gdude2002> lol
A8:24:06 <Maveric> Thinking about writing a program that reads the game log for events (connect, diconnect, admin commands, etc) and writes it to a db, allowing you to search users for messages, commands used, time etc. Would you be interested in using it?
A8:25:39 <PuyoDead> I've been hoping for something like that
A8:25:45 <Maveric> and a webapp that you could just go like, search user and it comes up with chat history, commands used (if they're an op), ip's used and such
A8:25:56 <Maveric> It'd use very little resources too
A8:26:18 <citricsquid> I'm sure I've already seen similar

A8:26:58 <citricsquid> actually, maybe I imagined it
A8:27:03 <Maveric> Lol
A8:27:11 <Parthon> no, you are right
A8:27:15 <Parthon> it was a log analyser
A8:27:37 <Maveric> project still active?
A8:27:57 <Maveric> or publicly available?
A8:28:06 <Parthon> not sure
A8:28:15 <Parthon> I remember what it looked like, but I couldn't tell you the name of it
A8:28:19 <Maveric> Hmm, I'll still write it
A8:28:25 <Parthon> I think it was IRCstats .. or something .. but it was for irc
A8:28:29 <Parthon> and only irc
A8:28:33 <PuyoDead> yea, there's an irc log parser
A8:28:41 <Maveric> Oh, that's not what I'm talking about

A9:38:33 <doohan> Weekend of making an playing games
A9:38:38 <SteGriff> tigjam is an annual jam held by TIGSource
A9:38:51 <citricsquid> I don't like games that much and I suck at making stuff, haha. 
A9:39:02 <SteGriff> I found out about MC via TIGs
A9:39:38 <ez> what u think, should we make Announcement forum so that noone can reply to posts in there?
A9:39:39 <SteGriff> http://tigsource.com/articles/2009/06/11/minecraft-alpha
A9:40:04 <ez> or maybe that's boring? I just thought since then u see the correct order in which things were announced
A9:40:37 <citricsquid> ez: I could make the forum list them in order of posting, not in order of latest reply.
A9:40:39 <citricsquid> that could work well.

A10:47:40 <SteGriff> Anyone else have this game?

A10:48:17 <SteGriff> and then make some sort of tourist attraction ther
A10:48:22 <Onforty> Wtf Quatroking
A10:48:30 <SteGriff> where you are allowed to put the benches and the flowers wherever you like
A10:48:35 <Quatroking> stegriff: I first read terrorist attraction

A10:49:55 <SteGriff> not actually true
A10:50:03 <SteGriff> you get to buff a helicopter though

A11:21:46 <Quatroking> ffffuuu
A11:22:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Is dat what you were painting?  Or did you PS that together?
A11:22:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> If that's a painting, I'm impressed
A11:22:09 <Quatroking> and I tought that my little brother was good for something at last
A11:22:28 <PuyoDead> oh, hah, no way, I couldn't paint that

A11:25:23 <Quatroking> well
A11:25:32 <citricsquid> mac address bans
A11:25:35 <Quatroking> I'm pretty sure the client is able to detect a MAC adress
A11:25:36 <citricsquid> for the umpteenth time
A11:25:37 <citricsquid> are useless
A11:25:49 <gear> Quatroking: just filter your brother from minecrafting
A11:25:51 <Quatroking> Why, may I ask
A11:25:55 <gear> problem solved
A11:26:15 <vede> Actually mac-bans aren't useless.
A11:26:15 <citricsquid> banning by information the client passes is stupid
A11:26:25 <citricsquid> vede: they can be spoofed?
A11:26:28 <Quatroking> citricsquid what the hell
A11:26:30 <vede> If they are useless then so is every other method of banning.
A11:26:40 <Quatroking> ip's are passed through the clients too
A11:26:40 <ZomBuster> burn his computer problem solved
A11:26:43 <vede> Because pretty much everything can be spoofed.
A11:26:44 <citricsquid> vede: Every method of banning, besides account based IS useless
A11:26:53 <Quatroking> zombuster: i've got money in that pc
A11:26:55 <vede> So why even have them?
A11:27:04 <ZomBuster>  remove your money first then
A11:27:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> account based... New account [any name] any pass [fake e-mail like fuck] DONE!
A11:27:06 <citricsquid> because people think they do something.
A11:27:10 <vede> To keep out the people who don't know how to spoof their mac address?
A11:27:17 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: yes, but not when we have paid only servers :)
A11:27:27 <Quatroking> zombuster: why would I take out the PSU, GPU, and HDD
A11:27:33 <ZomBuster> :)
A11:27:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then again, any admin who doesn't use both IP and account bans every time is useless
A11:27:39 <citricsquid> vede: So you think people can't follow a tutorial? Determined griefers will bypass it all, it'll make them MORE determined.
A11:27:54 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: seen the topic with the guy only banning IP saying mc was hacked? mao
A11:27:56 <citricsquid> lmao*
A11:28:03 <vede> I'm saying that with it you could keep out MORE of the LESS determined griefers.

A11:38:57 <Quatroking> i did it from a free host, using about 5 lines of php
A11:39:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Still very traceable
A11:39:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> And 5 lines of code means nothing
A11:39:27 <PsYc]-[oZ> still noob :D
A11:39:28 <Quatroking> apparantly msn crashes when trying to say "you received a mail " over 1000 times at once
A11:39:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> when you can make each line as long as you'd like in some languages

P5:41:49 <fleshBasedProcessor> aera, what exactly does your finite water move, because it seems a little finicky. 
P5:42:04 <UnknownX> The tree looks like it was shot, pulverized and killed.
P5:42:30 <aera> fleshBasedProcessor: it will only move directly down or down and across 1
P5:42:31 <Animator> Poor tree.
P5:42:56 <Animator> The water in Minecraft should also have currents.
P5:43:11 <UnknownX> The tree has a giant chunk taken out of it
P5:43:12 <aera> i've had people saying it should have currents, momentum, etc
P5:43:23 <aera> thing is, they cost a lot to simulate :)
P5:44:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> causes some major problems for filling holes or making waterfalls. Take a look at this thread: http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=1672
P5:44:28 <fleshBasedProcessor> it isn't finite but it is better than the current system
P5:44:44 <fleshBasedProcessor> maybe you can marry your system and it to make something good.

P5:45:45 <Visiiri> Hey.
P5:46:30 <Visiiri> Hey?
P5:46:35 <TrueWolves> I can fix the tree unknown if I learn how to reset it over the server, possabiliy with filezilla
P5:47:30 <aera> fleshBasedProcessor: i don't see how that's an improvement
P5:47:31 <Animator> There's an easier way to fix the tree.
P5:47:48 <Animator> Water and some tender loving care. It'll grow back.
P5:47:57 <Animator> Hell, maybe the tree likes the scar.
P5:48:07 <Animator> Makes him look badass to the other trees.
P5:48:10 <fleshBasedProcessor> Thing flow a bit more realistically. Easier to make things like waterfalls. slightly harder to grief
P5:48:29 <aera> my water works like that
P5:48:30 <Animator> And then he can make up stories about that scar with the other trees.
P5:48:31 <aera> it falls first
P5:48:33 <aera> then spreads
P5:48:49 <Animator> "See this scar? I got it in a battle with 20 griefers. And I still won."
P5:48:57 <aera> if you want it to spread properly, i.e. flood that plane, my inifinite water works like that

P10:28:33 <mooogle> This is probably the dumbest possible question someone could ask, but since you can't see, what do you "see"? Is it just like us if we closed our eyes, as in simply blackness, or... what? I guess its always confused me a bit... Having sight makes it hard for me to imagine not having sight, if that makes sense at all.
P10:28:33 <mooogle> This is a difficult question to answer since I've never been able to see anything. As far as I understand it, my brain simply doesn't receive visual information from my eyes, so it's just an absence.

P11:04:29 <mooogle> yeah, definitely. i sort of lol'd at this part:
P11:04:29 <mooogle> Do you have theories or feelings about what sight is? Or what it means to see something? I imagine that if someone told me I was lacking a sense named "ugnito" I would not be able to understand what "ugnito" was, no matter how someone explained it to me, because I lack that sense. If someone says this object is "fleg" because of ugnito, it seems as incomprehensible, potentially, as someone telling a blind person "this object
