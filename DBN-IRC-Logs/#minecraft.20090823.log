A5:09:18 <LG_Legacy> I'm guessing Notch is going to add a Death room (Via Leet World.) Or spectating, or maybe just you explode and watch other players after you watch your death.
A5:09:37 <Marach> like in UT2004 Invasion!
A5:09:46 <08Notch> spectator mode is an interesting idea, but it might prove too frustrating
A5:09:51 <LG_Legacy> It might
A5:09:52 <08Notch> it's mainly going to be a social experience
A5:09:55 <Marach> all players spawn at beggining of the wave
A5:09:56 <Snowman> Yeah spectate would be cool, and having to stay spectating for like 10 minutes before you respawn
A5:09:59 <08Notch> and to get cut away from what makes it fun..
A5:10:13 <LG_Legacy> Unless..
A5:10:14 <Roadcrosser> NOTCH"
A5:10:16 <08Notch> so instead a global maximum death pool for example (but not that, that's a bad idea) might work

A5:11:26 <potato> the player's skin melts off and they turn into a skeleton!
A5:11:29 <Marach> fall is currently instant
A5:12:08 <potato> after you die in survival, you should turn into a skeleton
A5:12:28 <Snowman> Would be cool, and then try to kill the remaining players

A6:01:57 <ChJees> No way to get your hands on them D:
A6:02:12 <Snowman> You can get them with memory editing

A6:02:28 <kronflux> I wish you could download em or something
A6:02:31 <Gnarly_> Doesn't it save it in App_Data on your computer?
A6:02:55 <kronflux> not a clue. I think its more server-side, since you can load up saved maps anywhere
A6:03:02 <kronflux> at least, I think you can :p
A6:03:14 <Gnarly_> Oh so you can load maps on different computers?
A6:03:25 <Gnarly_> So it must be stored on Notch's servers then.

A8:05:33 <GreyIBlackJay> Check distance for speedhacks is possible, I guess.
A8:05:35 <citricsquid> GreyIBlackJay: Easily.
A8:05:37 <Piecat> idk
A8:05:49 <Piecat> sometimes I get kicked for hacks when im not using any
A8:05:54 <citricsquid> If you validate every piece of user input, IE what the client sends to the server, you can see everything you do.
A8:06:12 <GreyIBlackJay> Validating every piece of user input could make it a little inefficient, however.
A8:06:18 <Gnarly> what port is this ice on ?

A8:06:40 <GreyIBlackJay> I probably should be getting to sleep

A8:18:58 <GreyIBlackJay> A question popped into my head, might as well ask.
A8:19:12 <Gnarly> now pop a cap into your head
A8:19:17 <Gnarly> Might as well do it.
A8:19:19 <GreyIBlackJay> In the latest version of the client that you have, have you fixed the render so that it doesn't screw up as it does?
A8:19:27 <Magnulus> Uhm... That's great Gnarly.
A8:19:30 <GreyIBlackJay> In the current version, that is.
A8:19:48 <Testvan> what screw up
A8:19:50 <Magnulus> How does the render screw up? (I'm just curious)
A8:20:04 <GreyIBlackJay> Have you noticed that when you look at textures from afar
A8:20:18 <GreyIBlackJay> That they sort of show this web in the render?
A8:20:26 <GreyIBlackJay> Like, it's a wave or something?
A8:20:29 <GreyIBlackJay> Distorting the texture?
A8:20:35 <08Notch> you mean the moire? =D
A8:20:39 <GreyIBlackJay> Suppose
A8:20:43 <08Notch> no, I don't have any plans of fixing that!
A8:20:46 <GreyIBlackJay> D:
A8:20:55 <08Notch> I know, I know, it's a bit weird to like that effect, but I really do :D
A8:21:03 <GreyIBlackJay> Hm.
A8:21:04 <08Notch> Doom had it, Quake 1 had it. :D
A8:21:07 <Gnarly> notch you should release signs right now
A8:21:10 <Gnarly> you really should..
A8:21:14 <Magnulus> Actually, Notch, I have a question about the engine.
A8:21:24 <Testvan> notch: is your 3-d rendering writting for a square window? because it looks like the paralax gets messed up on the edges of the rectagualar game window 
A8:21:37 <GreyIBlackJay> There are many things he should release. Personally that first expansion he mentioned on his blog sounds awesome to me.
A8:21:48 <GreyIBlackJay> Levers, winches, etc would be lovely
A8:21:50 <GreyIBlackJay> :D
A8:21:51 <Magnulus> It seems to render everything even when you can only see a tiny fraction of the level. Is this something you're working on optimising?
A8:22:20 <GreyIBlackJay> I think I know what you're talking about, Magnulus
A8:22:28 <08Notch> Testvan: No, it's written for widescreen. The applet is widescreen.
A8:23:04 <Testvan> i only really notice when i working on castles 
A8:23:05 <GreyIBlackJay> I'm guessing you're talking about how it renders unseen faces still, even though it's eventually scrapped?
A8:23:16 <offset> Backface culling
A8:23:27 <GreyIBlackJay> Sure, if that's the technical term.
A8:23:33 <08Notch> hm?
A8:23:40 <08Notch> you mean player models?
A8:23:46 <offset> Basically if you don't see it on screen it isent rendered
A8:23:56 <GreyIBlackJay> Hmm.
A8:24:06 <08Notch> Magnulus: Anyway, you're probably asking for occlusion culling
A8:24:14 <GreyIBlackJay> It shouldn't need to draw the textures when there are blocks around you, though.
A8:24:16 <Magnulus> That's possible, yeah.
A8:24:21 <08Notch> the first experiment I did with that ended up taking MORE time than just rendering the blocks would
A8:24:33 <Gnarly> Notch hasn't yet let the "Server knows best" quote sink into his head.
A8:24:34 <ZomBuster> odd
A8:24:41 <08Notch> so I went from 500 fps to 300 fps, but it rendered far less
A8:24:42 <GreyIBlackJay> Such as, Notch, I'm assuming you had played Infiniminer, since several places are saying Minecraft is based off of it
A8:24:55 <08Notch> Gnarly: Err.. I've been saying that since day one. ;)
A8:25:08 <Gnarly> Well then why do you do so much client sided work.
A8:25:08 <08Notch> actually, I've said "never trust the client, assume it's compromized"
A8:25:18 <GreyIBlackJay> Hooray!
A8:25:24 <08Notch> because I haven't imlemented movement verification on the server yet
A8:25:25 <GreyIBlackJay> You're not screwing up like Infiniminer did!
A8:25:25 <GreyIBlackJay> :D
A8:25:31 <Gnarly> You should :s
A8:25:35 <08Notch> I know, and I will. =)
A8:25:40 <08Notch> I've mentioned it several times in the blog
A8:25:40 <Gnarly> Okay. =D
A8:25:44 <GreyIBlackJay> Infiniminer is way too client-reliant.
A8:25:46 <Magnulus> So it's spending more time figuring out what's to be rendered than it takes for it to just render everything? Crazy.
A8:25:48 <citricsquid> there's a blog?!
A8:25:57 <Snowman> ...
A8:26:02 <GreyIBlackJay> Notch's dev blog?
A8:26:02 <Gnarly> oh lord.
A8:26:03 <Snowman> DUH
A8:26:09 <GreyIBlackJay> http://notch.tumblr.com/
A8:26:09 <GreyIBlackJay> ?
A8:26:12 <Snowman> YOU don't know Notch has a blog?
A8:26:20 <offset> Sarcasm meter?
A8:26:32 <offset> :D
A8:26:36 <GreyIBlackJay> If that was sarcasm, he was too late for it.
A8:26:37 <GreyIBlackJay> Lol
A8:26:40 <Magnulus> I guess also I'm wondering if there's a chance of some form of LOD in the plans, like combining voxels when far away or flat textures when you can't see the texture anyway. But again, I guess that could have the same problem that occlusion rendering does.
A8:26:46 <GreyIBlackJay> Wait
A8:26:48 <GreyIBlackJay> Nevermind.
A8:27:10 <08Notch> Magnulus: Yeah, each individual chunk renders VERY fast. And keep in mind, I'm optmizing the engine for slightly smaller maps than people are creating now in creative mode. ;)
A8:27:20 <GreyIBlackJay> Gee, I'm getting into terminology I know little about.
A8:27:25 <Magnulus> Heheh, yeah.
A8:27:29 <08Notch> Yeah, there's a simple fix I can do there where I join vertical strips of the same texture
A8:27:32 <offset> probably too complex for something that works fine as is
A8:27:38 <GreyIBlackJay> Ah well
A8:27:41 <GreyIBlackJay> I'm off to sleep
A8:27:43 <08Notch> but when I say "simple", I mean "boring". ;)
A8:27:59 <Gnarly> Boring makes perfect.
A8:28:03 <GreyIBlackJay> Lol
A8:28:10 <Gnarly> Specially in mindcraft.
A8:28:16 <Gnarly> Boardness goes a long way.
A8:28:22 <GreyIBlackJay> The useless experiments are always the fun ones.
A8:28:23 <charrr> Notch, will signs be in MP before or after your trip?
A8:28:35 <GreyIBlackJay> You know there's a grain of truth in there
A8:28:50 <GreyIBlackJay> Oh right, before I sleep

A10:45:24 <Marach> files after extracting are placed in remp folder

A10:45:37 <Snowman> oh cool the clouds :D
A10:45:41 <vede> Or you can use 7-zip.
A10:45:49 <Snowman> rename to zip? You can open jar files with winzip
A10:45:51 <vede> I recommend 7-zip, since it allows you to directly edit the files.
A10:45:53 <Marach> yeah but i turned it off
A10:46:01 <Marach> i have 7xip too
A10:46:06 <vede> Then use that.
A10:46:14 <vede> Right-click -> 7-zip -> Open archive
A10:46:26 <vede> Then just double-click the file you want to edit.
A10:46:46 <Marach> ...
A10:47:00 <Snowman> Works with winzip too afaik

P12:26:46 <08Notch> ZomBuster: I think it's decent, but it feels a bit dated.
P12:26:53 <08Notch> the guns have a nice feel to them, mostly
P12:26:56 <Bradness> Notch, are you going to release the MC server source?
P12:26:58 <Niggy> yeah
P12:27:04 <vede> So you don't mind distributing tilesets, do you, Notch?
P12:27:04 <citricsquid> Notch: Will purchasing after sept 1st. still let people play survival beta?
P12:27:11 <Niggy> maybe i buy the game too
P12:27:14 <offset> Definitely doesn't live up to the Wolfenstein name sadly
P12:27:16 <Niggy> or blockland
P12:27:18 <08Notch> vede: No, as long as it's just the tileset
P12:27:20 <offset> but its okay for a bit of fun
P12:27:22 <Kouki> Notch i can speak you in private room conversation ?

P12:27:47 <ZomBuster> yeh decent  is a good description
P12:28:00 <vede> Me and a friend did a medieval roleplay to see what tiles would be needed for a medieval tileset.
P12:28:04 <vede> It was pretty awesome.
P12:28:05 <PuyoDead> I've heard almost solid bad things about the new wolfenstein
P12:28:18 <08Notch> it's not a bad shooter, imo. It just isn't a great one either
P12:28:19 <Niggy> whats wolfenstein
P12:28:21 <PuyoDead> which is sad, becuase I play the hell out of those games
P12:28:24 <offset> It's idtech 4 made by Raven - don't get too excited :P
P12:28:30 <08Notch> hehe
P12:28:34 <PuyoDead> well, the MP is apparently terrible. as in, with al lthe changes made

P12:28:38 <offset> id should have done it
P12:29:06 <PuyoDead> funny thing is, enemy territory is get a bit of a flood as of late
P12:29:08 <Katnipz2> notch do you like pocky?
P12:29:08 <ZomBuster> they improved on the engine quite well, feels like U3 sometimes
P12:29:11 <Bradness> Notch, I PM'ed you some questions =P
P12:29:13 <Real> citricsquid had a good question but Notch seems to have missed it D:
P12:29:27 <offset> True, I think it was still a dangerous move considering the title

P12:29:30 <PuyoDead> err, getting
P12:29:36 <Katnipz2> haha
P12:30:01 <Real> so citricsquid you might be able to guess what word i won my fifth grade spelling bee with
P12:30:02 <Marach> im going to distribute modified terrain.png
P12:30:04 <ZomBuster> citric I think that's an obvious answer :P

P12:30:18 <Katnipz2> is that awesome?

P12:40:54 <mail2345> ?
P12:40:58 <PuyoDead> the archives pulls it off much, much better
P12:41:01 <vede> Real, when you start the game, you're only allowed to build/destroy in a certain area, denoted by a red fence.
P12:41:06 <mail2345> how, if only admins can undo
P12:41:12 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: Archives is awesome :D
P12:41:15 <vede> The server will automatically undo changes made outside the red fence.
P12:41:16 <mail2345> also i agree with puyopo
P12:41:17 <PuyoDead> yes, it is
P12:41:25 <mail2345> the archives need to have more recourses
P12:41:31 <aera> mail2345: more resources?
P12:41:33 <Niggy> notch if you would add the destroy times like here:http://notch.tumblr.com/post/162878409/status-update-video     The number of griefer would be crushed
P12:41:36 <Real> vede: Interesting. Are people able to earn the ability to build outside the reed fence?
P12:41:39 <mail2345> as in, a better host
P12:41:43 <vede> Yes.
P12:41:51 <aera> mail2345: or, improve my code so it doesn't memory leak, too :)
P12:41:53 <mail2345> so more of the wolrds can have physics
P12:41:57 <mail2345> oh, that too
P12:41:58 <Real> Hmm. Doesn't seem to bad.
P12:41:59 <aera> but yeah, it's pushing my bandwidth cap and CPU

P12:43:21 <Kouki>  I also wanted to know if it to exist a script for prevent the drainage of the lava and the water
P12:43:22 <mail2345> and delete old level
P12:43:23 <ZomBuster> just copy the server_level.dat into the server directory
P12:43:38 <mail2345> Kouki, none of the scripts have acces to the ingame engine
P12:43:52 <Kouki> ...
P12:44:00 <mail2345> that are public avialiable
P12:44:01 <Kouki> WoM is a illegal server ?
P12:44:06 <Gaeel> Well my no-mod server should go back up within a week.
P12:44:07 <mail2345> if they distribute
P12:44:12 <Kouki> okay
P12:44:12 <PuyoDead> I only figured out what the hell was going on in the archives by wandering around for a long time
P12:44:19 <aera> is WoM a java hack around the original code then?
P12:44:21 <mail2345> and if notch gets angry he could unplug it from the listings
P12:44:30 <aera> PuyoDead: yes, I'm gonna improve the wobsite
P12:44:37 <aera> it's kinda evolved
P12:44:42 <Kouki> Wom java hack??
P12:44:44 <mail2345> i'm not sure how wom is setup
P12:45:00 <PuyoDead> yea, just for the last time I visited to test, and the next time when the full on server was up, it was vastle improved
P12:45:00 <aera> well, did WoM use the original server classes and modify them, or start completely from scratch, is the question
P12:45:02 <Gaeel> Some people have their own server software
P12:45:08 <aera> if it's the latter, it's legal
P12:45:12 <aera> if the former, it's illegal
P12:45:18 <Kouki> oka lol
P12:45:23 <mail2345> SERVER SCRIPTS != SERVER SOFTWARE
P12:45:27 <mail2345> just to clarify
P12:45:32 <mail2345> server scripts are legal

P12:45:38 <Kouki> Why to WOM is not deleted ?
P12:45:38 <aera> yeah, that's a tough one to get people to realise, mail2345 :)
P12:45:40 <08Notch> actually, modifying the server software isn't illegal. Distributing the changes is
P12:45:41 <Kouki> WHy*
P12:45:49 <Kouki> aokay
P12:45:49 <Real> citricsquid: I understand your angst. Despite that, I'm more inclined to agree with the restricted-type servers now. But I'm sure I will change my opinion once we're in beta.
P12:45:55 <aera> Notch: indeed, i was clarifying in the case of changes :)
P12:45:55 <mail2345> like cMss, ServerOp, Adura's perl
P12:45:59 <Gaeel> They analyzed the inputs and outputs from the server and wrote their own program that does the same
P12:46:00 <08Notch> =D
P12:46:35 <mail2345> server software is like JTE's The Archives And WoM
P12:46:35 <citricsquid> Real: Heh, I have no problems with restrictions IF we can build freely. Places like WoM mean I can't freely build what I want, whereas in the archives you can just go into a new world and build all you like there, but you can't fuck with other peoples stuff. That is the proper way to approach it, imo.
P12:46:52 <mail2345> that require block ownership to do automatically
P12:47:14 <mail2345> as I belive the only anti-grief tools should just assist with the admin's job

P12:47:21 <PuyoDead> I think the idea of restriction is too limited. as in, you enter a sever, and have to wait for someone to deem you worthy to build/destroy. it's no different from prisons, except for walking around
P12:47:23 <mail2345> block deletion warnings
P12:47:27 <mail2345> and uhh, puyo
P12:47:30 <Gaeel> I run my server in a python launcher, I'll release it when it's annotated and a little more elegant

P12:49:11 <PuyoDead> hah
P12:49:20 <aera> i've thought about block ownership
P12:49:29 <aera> but that's really quite hard to store efficiently
P12:49:29 <Gaeel> liq3 nice idea, I'll link my server to IRC if I can
P12:49:43 <aera> Gaeel: our server is linked :)
P12:49:45 <Gaeel> aera, like ulysses mod for Gmod
P12:49:50 <liq3> Gaeel: Well, just make sure it's a user option to turn on or off. :P
P12:49:56 <PuyoDead> if you do toy with it, let us know how the map size/bandwidth is affected, since that seems to be the fallback argument
P12:50:15 <Gaeel> I was thinking a "/irc Blahblah" command
P12:50:29 <liq3> aera: Ownership is easy to code, it just doubles map size if it's per block. 
P12:50:47 <Gaeel> What about marking areas as "read-only"
P12:50:51 <liq3> Gaeel: Yeh, but you forget the other way around. :P
P12:50:52 <mail2345> how do you store the username efficently?
P12:50:55 <citricsquid> liq3: Yeah, but what do you store? Username? IP?
P12:50:55 <aera> liq3: that assumes you only have 255 owners
P12:51:01 <liq3> Gaeel: That could be much easier on RAM.
P12:51:13 <Gaeel> So if someone makes something cool, an admin can "save" it
P12:51:14 <liq3> citric: you could have a list of players... Like, "liq3 - 341"
P12:51:20 <liq3> and thenj ust store 341 on the block data.
P12:51:22 <aera> you could use 2 bytes per block, and get 16225 onwers
P12:51:26 <Gaeel> It would only take one bit
P12:51:33 <liq3> but yeh 1 byte only 255 ppl. ;/
P12:51:51 <citricsquid> liq3: That would add extra overhead though, because it'd have to work out the username based upon the userid with the block and then check if they matched.
P12:51:55 <aera> besides, i can imagine it getting REALLY annoying on shared structures

P12:52:26 <mail2345> that would be for admin blocks
P12:52:43 <liq3> citric: Nope, it'd only add a small amount (like, one array access). The actual overhead would be so small it's negligable.
P12:52:45 <Gaeel> aera, umod for gmod allows you to list friends who can touch your props
P12:52:46 <mail2345> hmm, if you have attentive admins, you could select areas to lock
P12:52:59 <aera> i much prefer having discrete worlds
P12:53:21 <Gaeel> So if I want to build with you for example, I add you and you add me
P12:53:24 <liq3> aera: yeh, I agree. It's much easier to code and uses a lot less memory too.

P2:36:53 <Kszchroink> ah sweet idea
P2:36:56 <Kszchroink> dats smart
P2:36:58 <Meizlizard> If you use a word often, it completes for you.
P2:37:00 <Meizlizard> Also
P2:37:11 <Meizlizard> You can type the begginning of a long word
P2:37:15 <Meizlizard> then mispell it
P2:37:22 <Meizlizard> and it will correct to the whole thing
P2:37:49 <Meizlizard> You can also enable a feature that turns two spacebar hits into a period and a space
P2:37:57 <Meizlizard> To end sentences quickly.

P4:09:20 <ZomBuster> odd
P4:10:19 <Xeros> Which reminds me... I think for survival mode there should be an option for the "max fog distance" which will make it harder and not give other players who have awesome computers so much of an advantage lol

P4:39:47 <liq3> rapidshare? that's like the scum of file shahring.
P4:40:01 <liq3> everytime i see somenoe link to it i groan -_-
P4:40:10 <liq3> and facepalm.
P4:40:14 <citricsquid> rapidshare is awesome if you're premium :D
P4:40:22 <citricsquid> fast downloads, easy interface and free money!
P4:40:22 <liq3> that's my point
P4:40:23 <liq3> i'm not.
P4:40:27 <liq3> pfft
P4:40:28 <citricsquid> liq3: you're rubbish!
P4:40:35 <liq3> willhostforfood has all that, and it's free.
P4:40:35 <liq3> :p
P4:40:41 <citricsquid> they give money?!
P4:40:45 <Iguana> Fre e money?!
P4:40:46 <liq3> ...rapidshare gives money?
P4:40:52 <Iguana> FREE MONEY?!
P4:40:55 <liq3> what's the point of going premium then? :p
P4:40:58 <liq3> i mean
P4:41:00 <liq3> chargin for it.
P4:41:07 <Iguana> ...still...FREE MONEY!?
P4:41:12 <citricsquid> if you get referals, 2 euro per paid customer you get
P4:41:14 <liq3> it's like "BUY PREMIUM FOR $10, AND WE'LL GIVE YOU $15 BACK!!!!!11111eleveneleven"
P4:41:16 <citricsquid> I got 8 :D
P4:41:36 <Iguana> Wait. The premium refers other?
P4:41:52 <Iguana> And they include your name in the singup thingy?
P4:42:02 <Iguana> THEN you haz moneyz?
P4:42:04 <liq3> citric: you're friends are as stupid as you! only reason you made money. ;]
P4:42:15 <citricsquid> liq3: friends?! Where?!
P4:42:28 <liq3> i'm assuming the ppl who signed up to rapidshare
P4:42:35 <liq3> unless you threatened random people or something.
P4:42:46 <citricsquid> nah, just people buying from a file I uploaded
P4:42:49 <citricsquid> don't know who it was
P4:43:06 <liq3> also, 16 euros/

P6:26:46 <mail2345> watch
P6:27:05 <mail2345> a ping
P6:27:09 <Quatroking> a ping is the time it takes for one computer to send a signal to an other computer through the internet

P6:27:24 <mail2345> is a computer eqivilient of "ARE YOU THERE?"
P6:27:25 <Quatroking> lower = better
P6:28:03 <Snowman> ping is measures in ms, milliseconds 
P6:28:37 <Xeros> I first learned of ping in StarCraft. lol
P6:28:38 <Quatroking> uh
P6:28:38 <Shawnachu> So the chat auto boots if it doesn't recieve a "ping" within a certain amount of time?
P6:28:47 <Snowman> yup
P6:28:55 <mail2345> yes if it thinks you lagged out
P6:28:57 <Shawnachu> Oh
P6:29:02 <Shawnachu> I see
P6:29:14 <mail2345> just setup a custom ctcp version reply
P6:29:15 <Snowman> The server sends pings to the computer, when it doesnt receive anything back for 180 seconds, it kicks
P6:29:23 <mail2345> try it.
P6:29:34 <Quatroking> I remember thinking that a high ping was good, when I was about 10 years old
P6:29:36 <Shawnachu> So just idle for 3 minutes?
P6:29:39 <mail2345> anyway, ping timouts are because i'm in hawaii
P6:29:39 <Quatroking> heh
P6:29:40 <mail2345> and no
P6:29:46 <mail2345> your computer has to idle

P6:30:11 <Shawnachu> Wait
P6:30:17 <Snowman> Lol quatro
P6:30:18 <Shawnachu> 180 ms or seconds?
P6:30:23 <Quatroking> the server sends pings to your computer every few secs to check if its still on
P6:30:24 <Snowman> milliseconds
P6:30:32 <Snowman> wait
P6:30:43 <Quatroking> if it doesn't get a ping back for 180 seconds, it kicks you
P6:30:44 <Snowman> if it doesnt receive anything for 180 seconds, you are kicked
P6:30:48 <Snowman> lol
P6:30:49 <mail2345> 180ms
P6:30:53 <Quatroking> and 180 milliseconds is the same as 1,8 second, suckers

P6:59:56 <Iguana> I don't know any.
P7:00:06 <Iguana> SOMEONE GIVE ME A TUTORIAL SITE SO I CAN BE SMART
P7:00:07 <Snowman> challenging? Was the simplest thing I've ever seen
P7:00:09 <GreenHoopla> I know Java :3
P7:00:21 <GreenHoopla> Simple Java, but Java nontheless
P7:00:41 <Snowman> I know how to make like appelts and shit
P7:00:45 <Bloo> Ugh. Someone help me stop. I know I can't save it, yet I'm building a sailship that's anchored in the water outside of my seaside chataeu.
P7:00:47 <Magnulus> As far as programming goes, HTML is simple.
P7:00:57 <mail2345> python is okay
P7:01:01 <mail2345> and html != programming
P7:01:05 <smn> .
P7:01:11 <mail2345> unless you count javascript
P7:01:12 <LBrocklehurst> yeah, that ^^
P7:01:19 <mail2345> as part of html
P7:01:25 <smn> which would be insane
P7:01:26 <Snowman> javascript is the shittiest shit ever invented

P7:01:31 <Magnulus> But with the later iterations of HTML (I'm old-school, so I'm talking about post-2000) can get confusing.
P7:01:34 <Xeros> I don't think I'm too interested in HTML, I'm trying to learn my way towards game programming and artificial intelligence.
P7:01:39 <mail2345> anyway, get python
P7:01:50 <mail2345> though lisp is used more for ai
P7:01:55 <LBrocklehurst> Start simple then Xeros
P7:01:57 <Magnulus> Well, then HTML is pointless for you, Xeros. ^_^
P7:02:00 <LBrocklehurst> Bit of Game Maker haha
P7:02:01 <mail2345> it really is a bad idea to use lisp as a starting language
P7:02:06 <mail2345> game maker
P7:02:07 <mail2345> no
P7:02:15 <citricsquid> Snowman: I used to think that, then I watched JavaScript: The Good Parts and now I fucking love javascript
P7:02:20 <Xeros> Ahaha people were talking about Game Maker yesterday... they say it corrupts you hehe
P7:02:23 <citricsquid> when starting from the ground up, it's awesome
P7:02:24 <LBrocklehurst> Coding in Game Maker is fucking horrible
P7:02:25 <Magnulus> I've seen some good games made on Game Maker, to be honest.
P7:02:33 <mail2345> i saw this from a person graduating from gm to lua "actor.Health = actor.Health"
P7:02:41 <mail2345> and good games are the exception
P7:02:43 <mail2345> not the rule
P7:02:45 <Magnulus> Game Maker is not supposed to be a coder's tool.
P7:02:52 <Magnulus> Well, to SOME degree, yes.
P7:03:01 <mail2345> do not use game maker
P7:03:04 <smn> i have started to like javascript
P7:03:04 <mail2345> it does corrupt
P7:03:20 <LBrocklehurst> Game Maker is great to start out with
P7:03:25 <Xeros> That's it I'm starting simple. Assembly Code here I come.
P7:03:28 <smn> especially when i got into js-object-orientation. it's so weird, it's awesome.
P7:03:29 <LBrocklehurst> Like, to learn how things go together
P7:03:37 <Magnulus> Good games are the exception all across the board, really. 
P7:03:48 <Xeros> Actually I learned a lot from Game Maker, but just the drag-n-drop part of it. Never got into the coding.
P7:03:50 <mail2345> start with python
P7:03:52 <mail2345> good
P7:04:03 <Magnulus> The majority of games of any kind are mediocre or worse.
P7:04:05 <mail2345> don't get into the coding, that's the corrupting part from what i can tell
P7:04:14 <citricsquid> smn: I hated it so much before, but I did exactly what the video said was wrong, I just jumped in and didn't bother learning anything.
P7:04:24 <LBrocklehurst> Thankfully I'm totally uninterested with coding
P7:04:25 <smn> >:D
P7:04:30 <LBrocklehurst> More about the 3D modelling
P7:04:41 <Xeros> Alright alright Python it definitely is first. So is it... free? I don't really know how it works, like... how do I start heh ^.^
P7:04:48 <citricsquid> I love programming, but my brain is shit :D
P7:04:55 <LBrocklehurst> Of course it's free :P
P7:05:07 <smn> the only thing i ever really hated about js is the differences in code execution
P7:05:11 <Xeros> If I get Python...can I name it Monty?
P7:05:13 <smn> in different browsers.
P7:05:18 <mail2345> python is foss
P7:05:25 <mail2345> and there are monty python refs in it

P7:16:20 <Xeros> Actually I bet if Minecraft stays so simple.. it could easily become the next 4d game hehe.. some... holographics... thing idk :P
P7:16:29 <LBrocklehurst> Oh no wait

13P7:20:33 * PuyoDead just made a 0D game
P7:20:35 <PuyoDead> there, done
P7:20:38 <GreenHoopla> So did I.

P7:20:55 <GreenHoopla> Pid?
P7:20:55 <LBrocklehurst> haha

P7:20:58 <Snowman> 3.14D
P7:21:27 <mail2345> anyway, braid is not 4D
P7:21:31 <mail2345> due to the fact
P7:21:33 <GreenHoopla> Wow, WoM always has awesome stuff on their servers.
P7:21:54 <mail2345> ... who wants to play #wolfhunt ?
P7:21:58 <PuyoDead> you move back and forth along a timelime, hence, you move throughout 4D
P7:22:08 <GreenHoopla> Wolfhunt is...?
P7:22:15 <mail2345> a game
P7:22:24 <mail2345> where you try to find out who the wolf is
P7:22:25 <GreenHoopla> O rly
P7:22:27 <mail2345> and kill them
P7:22:34 <GreenHoopla> Well thats nice.
P7:22:36 <LBrocklehurst> So what're the general solutions when you can't get servers to work?

P7:51:25 <fleshBasedProcessor> windows XP. Thank god its not vista
P7:51:36 <fleshBasedProcessor> I think I've got some orientation thing now, got to go.
P7:51:40 <Snowman> What's so bad about Vista?
P7:51:41 <liq3> mail2345: windows > everything else for games.
P7:51:47 <liq3> Snowman: Everything.
P7:51:57 <Snowman> No, tell me
P7:52:05 <citricsquid> I like vista
P7:52:09 <Snowman> Same
P7:52:10 <liq3> Right after you tell me what's good about it. ;]
P7:52:11 <mail2345> but they don't want you to play games
P7:52:15 <mail2345> do they ?
P7:52:27 <citricsquid> Easy to use, fast enough when you have good hardwarer
P7:52:28 <citricsquid> it looks good
P7:52:30 <liq3> mail2345: I have no idea what you weree talking about. :D
P7:52:34 <citricsquid> and supports games,.
P7:52:36 <Snowman> Well they've cleaned up and grouped alot of the old xp menus
P7:52:41 <PuyoDead> my machine is too old for vista
P7:52:54 <liq3> citric: that good hardware thing is a trick MS has been pulling for years. They made Windows slow, to force ppl to buy new hardware. ;/
P7:52:55 <PuyoDead> it runs like absolute balls
P7:53:00 <citricsquid> the majority of people who think vista suck are trying to run it on 512mb of ram.
P7:53:02 <PuyoDead> but, win7 is pretty much fine. go figure
P7:53:15 <citricsquid> liq3: then why does win7 run so well?
P7:53:27 <liq3> citric: Because they released no one will buy another shit windows?
P7:53:44 <liq3> From everything I've heard, Vista failed, horribly.
P7:53:50 <PuyoDead> I only have 1.5GB of RAM, so it's no surprise. plus, my video card is a fossil
P7:53:51 <citricsquid> have you used it?
P7:53:52 <Snowman> Windows 7 is what Vista should have been tbh
P7:53:52 <Chrstfer> i have 3gb of ram and it runs like a fucking DREAM
P7:54:02 <liq3> citric: My sister used to have it on her PC.
P7:54:04 <liq3> Used to.
P7:54:15 <Snowman> How much ram did she have?
P7:54:15 <PuyoDead> I only used vista for a little while, and really, I wasn't impressed
P7:54:19 <liq3> I had to upgrade it to windows XP, because it more or less made her PC unusable.

P7:54:31 <Chrstfer> you need high end hardware for it, buts its a good OS truly
P7:54:36 <mail2345> i have 2GB or ram and an intergred card
P7:54:38 <PuyoDead> the constant nagging, the lack of control, the constant hardware lag
P7:54:58 <Snowman> You can turn the constant naggin off with like 5 clicks
P7:55:14 <PuyoDead> most of it, yes
P7:55:22 <mail2345> err how about reverse compatability issues
P7:55:27 <mail2345> i like my old games
P7:55:28 <citricsquid> There is bad stuff about vista, but underneath the bad stuff it functions well enough to be used properly.
P7:55:30 <PuyoDead> but some won't go away, even in win7
P7:55:34 <Snowman> Start > Search (UAC) > Click > Turn Off > Confirm
P7:55:45 <Snowman> TADA
P7:55:51 <PuyoDead> we all know that, Snow
P7:55:57 <liq3> citric: there is no incentive to upgrade. Actually, there's incentive to NOT upgrade.
P7:55:59 <Snowman> But most people are too stupid to do that and they whine about it
P7:55:59 <PuyoDead> seriously, how many years has it been out?
P7:56:09 <Snowman> 2? 3? idk
P7:56:20 <citricsquid> liq3: after using vista I don't like xp now, it lacks. Thankfully I'm upgrading to 7 at the weekend.
P7:56:32 <mail2345> must
P7:56:34 <mail2345> meeet
P7:56:48 <mail2345> 1 yr without formatting
P7:56:48 <mail2345> goal
P7:57:02 <liq3> citric: I won't be upgrading until games force me.
P7:57:30 <PuyoDead> I think the reason so many people hated vista, is the promise it made to work so well, that simply didn't happen. as in, the "vista capable" mess
P7:57:37 <citricsquid> liq3: why? xp compared to w7 from what I've seen and heard from friends is so well worth it
P7:57:53 <citricsquid> I liked xp to vista enough to dislike XP now.
P7:57:54 <liq3> citric: why upgrade? I don't need anything else.
P7:58:11 <liq3> the only reason I'd upgrade is if it was faster, and that's not gonna happen till pigs fly.
P7:58:11 <PuyoDead> everything works in xp for me, hence why I'm not upgrading yet
P7:58:16 <Snowman> it's too bad Windows 7 is like 120 dollars :/

P8:00:34 <mail2345> well
P8:00:42 <Snowman> ILL CODE SNOWOS AND ITLL BE SO AWESOME EVERYONE WILL DIE OF IT
P8:00:54 <PuyoDead> linux has made some great progress over the past few years, but I still don't consider it ready for mainstream desktop use
P8:00:54 <mail2345> in terms of technicall supiority linux is awesome. in terms of compatability windows is awesome
P8:00:54 <Snowman> in 2046
P8:01:02 <citricsquid> I don't think they all suck, but I've yet to see a good complete OS that doesn't need improvements.
P8:01:05 <liq3> mail2345: basically.
P8:01:23 <Snowman> Oh citric btw, Windows 7 does NOT come with an internet browser
P8:01:28 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: I see linux, in its current form, as something for people who enjoy tinkering and playing around.
P8:01:31 <liq3> Windows is a bloated OS that is functionally terrible, but has good UI and compatability. Linux has terrible UI and little games.
P8:01:38 <Snowman> So put the Firefox installation file on a usb flash drive
P8:01:45 <PuyoDead> plus, honestly, the linux community can be some great people, but there's a large chunk of them that will drive away any newcomers

P8:02:18 <Snowman> Opera was whining about IE having all the users
P8:02:20 <PuyoDead> last I heard, they really aren't bundling it with a browser
P8:02:25 <citricsquid> mind you, I keep installers on backup anyway :)
P8:02:28 <liq3> Seriously, MS is so big and powerful, there is no way it fucks up that badly accidently.
P8:02:32 <liq3> It's making windows suck ON PURPOSE.
P8:02:36 <Snowman> lemme look up the post i read
P8:02:39 <citricsquid> liq3: It was a legal requirement
P8:02:41 <citricsquid> in the EU
P8:02:47 <PuyoDead> yea, just EU
P8:02:54 <citricsquid> they got told they can't distribut IE with the OS
P8:02:56 <liq3> citric: they could package ANY free browser with it.
P8:02:59 <citricsquid> has to be on a different disk
P8:03:09 <PuyoDead> disc!
P8:03:10 <liq3> or even have a bat file run the first time windows start, to DL a free browser (or IE).

P8:04:19 <citricsquid> microsoft have a right to distribute their software with it
P8:04:25 <citricsquid> they don't prevent a different browser
P8:04:26 <citricsquid> silly eu
P8:04:40 <mail2345> but they encorage the use of their browser
P8:04:44 <Snowman> Well, at least that will make more people get FF

P8:04:46 <mail2345> but eh

P8:05:24 <mail2345> new game of wolf hunt
P8:05:24 <citricsquid> and they can distribute IE installed etc.
P8:05:48 <citricsquid> the ruling was that if you install w7 from a disc (!) it can't force IE to be installed

P10:18:11 <vede> Wergeldt has been obsolete since gluboldt was introduced, I didn't know it was even still around.
P10:18:50 <Eagle> Shut up vede XD
P10:19:56 <vede> Ever since ldtcorp bought the gluboldt manufacturers, though, farbaldt has been superior from price-versus-value perspective.
P10:20:08 <vede>  :D
P10:22:01 <liq3> Xeros: I think you mean "girls", not "songs" ;].
P10:22:35 <liq3> vede: ldtcorp gluboldt what now?
P10:22:49 <vede> Yeah.
P10:23:01 <vede> ldtcorp bought the out the guys who manufacture gluboldt.
P10:23:15 <liq3> ...
P10:23:17 <liq3> what?
P10:23:21 <vede> Gluboldt is by far the best on the market, but ever since that, it's been pricey as hell.
P10:23:23 <liq3> i have no idea what either are. :P
P10:24:00 <vede> So most people stick with farbaldt, which is still relatively cheap, while the high-and-mighty rich folks can have the gluboldt, which easily makes up for the lost customers on gluboldt.
P10:24:12 <liq3> ...
P10:24:28 <vede> In case you didn't know, I'm making all this shit up off the top of my head.
P10:24:33 <liq3> yeh, i thought so.
P10:24:38 <vede> Farbaldt and gluboldt and wergeldt.
P10:25:13 <liq3> It's just, it's rather terrible when it turns out you're actually talking about something real, and I thought you weren't. :P
P10:25:18 <liq3> So why I didn't say anything. xD

P10:36:41 <mail2345> and well.
P10:36:56 <vede> Does it randomly say, like, if a person sees the wolf kill someone by chance or something occasionally?
P10:37:13 <vede> Like, in a PM, "You manage to hide, but you see X become a wolf and devour Y."
P10:37:21 <mail2345> err if your a seer
P10:37:28 <vede> That's lame.

P10:37:57 <mail2345> hmm
P10:37:58 <Super-Dot> Goo goo gajoob
P10:38:03 <mail2345> i'll go suggest that
P10:38:22 <vede> And then, possibly, someone ELSE could see the witness OR the wolf enter that location.
P10:38:28 <vede> It would help to breed suspicion.
P10:40:00 <vede> So, PM dude101 "You are in the woods and see BadBoy2 become a wolf and devour HaplessDolt1985" and then PM MisterManbaby "You saw dude101 enter the woods last night, could he be the killer?" or maybe replace "dude101" with "BadBoy2" randomly.
P10:40:04 <liq3> vede: Yes, there's a game like that in Starcraft, "Phantom", where one player is a phantom and has to kill everyone else. It usually results in everyone hitting pop cap, then everyone killing one person one at a time.
P10:40:33 <vede> Or possibly do a night message to say "Rumors are circulating that X/Y entered the woods last night, could they be the wolf?"
P10:40:41 <vede> Where X or Y are either the wolf or the witness.

P11:32:18 <mail2345> anyway, just ajust it
P11:32:29 <MiniManz> adjust "what" exactly?
P11:32:35 <mail2345> idk
P11:32:46 <MiniManz> Super helpful
P11:32:50 <mail2345> maybe your comp just doesn't like the script
P11:33:08 <MiniManz> So is there another similar script?
P11:33:24 <MiniManz> Other than cmss
P11:33:27 <mail2345> adura's
P11:33:54 <MiniManz> where can i get that? foru-OHWAITHAHA
P11:33:59 <mail2345> http://adurah.com/minecraft/mcadmin/latest/
P11:34:09 <mail2345> you need perlzors
P11:34:12 <MiniManz> linux?
P11:34:15 <mail2345> perl
P11:34:19 <Adura> Works with Windows/Cygwin, too.
P11:34:53 <MiniManz> thats cool, perl cant find a damned download
P11:35:04 <MiniManz> Sorry, we looked high and low and just could not find the file /perl5/news/2009/perl-5.10.1.html. 
P11:35:35 <mail2345> you need POE
P11:35:42 <MiniManz> perl AND poe?
P11:35:44 <mail2345> and some other stuff
P11:35:49 <mail2345> POE is a perl libary
P11:35:55 <Adura> You get it from cpan.
P11:35:59 <MiniManz> DO I also need pink hair and have to be 4 foot 5 and be able to do a blackflip handstabd while singing the nation anthem?
P11:36:03 <MiniManz> Anything SIMPLER?
P11:36:08 <mail2345> waht are the other perl dependancies?
P11:36:17 <mail2345> really not that hard
P11:36:32 <MiniManz> No but I dont want to install loads of different shit just for one thing
P11:36:42 <MiniManz> I hate doing that especially whena  terrible script (dexters) doesnt work
P11:36:43 <mail2345> serverop dislikes some compys
P11:36:46 <mail2345> no
P11:36:50 <mail2345> it;s your computer
P11:36:54 <MiniManz> No.
P11:36:56 <mail2345> wait is it 64 bit?
P11:36:57 <Adura> Well, doesn't that other script require .NET anyays?
P11:36:59 <MiniManz> I cant think of a logical reason fo that
P11:37:08 <MiniManz> "Hmm I'm a program, I dont like you so im not gonna work"
P11:37:15 <mail2345> becasue serverop dislikes 64 bit.
P11:37:17 <MiniManz> .NET is ONE thing
P11:37:19 <mail2345> as in will not work
P11:37:20 <MiniManz> Im 32 bit
P11:37:27 <Adura> .NET is a lot of crap.
P11:37:29 <MiniManz> So there is no reason it shouldnt work
P11:37:29 <TheOne> I got it to run on a 64bit
P11:37:51 <mail2345> Windows is iffy
P11:38:09 <mail2345> system configs can get a bit uhh weird
P11:38:11 <MiniManz> There is still no reason. Now, is there any OTHER scripts?
P11:38:17 <mail2345> no.
P11:38:22 <mail2345> just cMss
P11:38:28 <MiniManz> I hate cmss
P11:38:30 <mail2345> Adura's perl and ServerOp
P11:38:32 <mail2345> why?
P11:38:42 <MiniManz> I used it and it was just terrible
P11:38:48 <MiniManz> Lots of useless crap
P11:38:54 <mail2345> i loaded cmss on serverop on my own server, and use adura's for my free hosting
P11:39:02 <mail2345> you could remove those
P11:39:05 <TheOne> so get rid of the usless crap
P11:39:05 <mail2345> with a simple #
P11:39:17 <mail2345> it's the easiest to modify
P11:39:17 <MiniManz> Adurah....net is ONE easy to install thing
P11:39:27 <MiniManz> Aduras script is 2 thing I have never messed with before
P11:39:32 <MiniManz> whoops sorry
P11:39:32 <mail2345> no just one
P11:39:35 <mail2345> perl
P11:39:38 <mail2345> you get perl working
P11:39:42 <MiniManz> but you said something else too
P11:39:49 <mail2345> it's just a few commands to get the libs working
P11:39:50 <Adura> It's just a module you get from cpan.
P11:40:13 <MiniManz> I really dont want to go through so much shit when dexters script COULD be working perfectly fine
P11:40:30 <mail2345> eh for me, cpan is easy, just load it up type "install <package>" and done
P11:40:37 <mail2345> but that's on a *nix box
P11:40:59 <MiniManz> Im on windows
P11:41:02 <Adura> Poor you.
P11:41:06 <MiniManz> I just want something easy like dexters
P11:41:13 <Adura> Running a server on Windows... heh.
P11:41:18 <MiniManz> Im not going to learn fuckign rocket science and brain surgery just to get this crap running
P11:41:22 <mail2345> ugh
P11:41:28 <mail2345> it's not taht hard to install perl
P11:41:29 <TheOne> one day I hope to be done with windows...
P11:41:31 <Adura> Alright, as you see fit.
P11:41:32 <mail2345> or so i heard
P11:41:35 <MiniManz> Now if you can step down from your elite linux crown to help thad be super
P11:41:39 <triddin> so mail2345: what's citric's client?
