P10:31:44 <Perogi> did you ip ban me THAT time?
P10:32:10 <TrueWolves> ???
P10:32:16 <Darkebrz> Perogi
P10:32:24 <Perogi> Dark banned me on NewFrontier server because he hates me
P10:32:24 <Darkebrz> Got IP-banned on my server
P10:33:05 <TrueWolves> your welcome on Yggdrasil if you follow rules and don't make potholes
P10:33:24 <Perogi> I like that rp/economy server :(
P10:33:31 <Darkebrz> Eh
P10:33:32 <Darkebrz> Wtf
P10:33:35 <TrueWolves> yeah, I ran the first rp server...
P10:33:39 <TrueWolves> it lasted... 2 days
P10:33:39 <Darkebrz> Perogi didnt get added again
P10:33:42 <TrueWolves> but it was private
P10:33:49 <Darkebrz> Perogi, karma is a bitch
P10:34:00 <Perogi> karma? did I make you feel sad?
P10:34:08 <Darkebrz> Hm?
P10:34:16 <Darkebrz> Why would I be sad?
P10:34:17 <TrueWolves> I ran one accualy back when servers were 3 days old, but I think it being private made it hard to keep it going
P10:34:27 <Darkebrz> You grief a server and it follows you
P10:34:31 <Perogi> well you said karma, implying that I did something wrong to you and you are returning the favor
P10:34:40 <Perogi> lol wtf I griefed a server and Eagle forgave me
P10:34:45 <Darkebrz> Thats called revenge
P10:34:56 <Perogi> you're not god 
P10:35:05 <Darkebrz> I am not implying that I am god
P10:35:07 <Perogi> you don't get to dish out revenge because you're always right
P10:35:15 <Darkebrz> Sure
P10:35:18 <Perogi> you do when you say you are dealing revenge for wrongs that were not commited against you
P10:35:22 <Darkebrz> But it was my opinion that you should be banned
P10:35:33 <Perogi> no shit
P10:35:56 <Darkebrz> Meh

P10:42:31 <FSlSlayer> So hmmm... can i ask question on how servers work for minecraft?
P10:42:44 <Darkebrz> Sure
P10:43:06 <FSlSlayer> Apparently my private one i made was single player
P10:43:16 <FSlSlayer> is it always single player or is it possible to make it multi?
P10:43:27 <liq3> Private is ONLY multi.
P10:43:33 <FSlSlayer> actually
P10:43:35 <FSlSlayer> i made my own
P10:43:37 <FSlSlayer> and it's single.
P10:43:44 <liq3> Then it's not a private server.
P10:43:53 <FSlSlayer> public=false
P10:43:56 <Darkebrz> Slayer, what do you mean?
P10:44:04 <Darkebrz> Nobody else can join?

P10:44:50 <Darkebrz> Oh
P10:44:51 <Darkebrz> Hehe
P10:44:53 <Darkebrz> Slayer
P10:44:57 <Darkebrz> Your server just doesnt work
P10:45:01 <Perogi> fsi that means your server isn't connected
P10:45:09 <Darkebrz> If the server url is wrong, or if the server is down
P10:45:13 <Perogi> if minecraft can't find a server at the url it just sets up a single player game
P10:45:13 <Darkebrz> It directs it to singleplayer
P10:45:14 <FSlSlayer> no the server works
P10:45:16 <FSlSlayer> ohh
P10:45:18 <Darkebrz> No it doesnt
P10:45:24 <FSlSlayer> How do i fix my server?
P10:45:26 <Perogi> you should check your ports
P10:45:31 <Perogi> or double check the url for your server
P10:45:35 <FSlSlayer> already forwarded.
P10:45:38 <Perogi> hm
P10:45:56 <Darkebrz> I really dont know

P10:48:54 <Darkebrz> ?
P10:48:56 <FSlSlayer> so hmm
P10:49:07 <FSlSlayer> i think it may be a firewall issue
P10:49:13 <Darkebrz> Slayer, are you _sure_ that thats the right link?
P10:49:20 <liq3> Slayer, it's either filewall or your ports aren't forwarded.
P10:49:26 <Saer> Oh hello Darkebrz
P10:49:30 <liq3> Or the link is wrong. :p
P10:49:30 <Pl0x> has slayer checked the forums?

P10:52:46 <Darkebrz> Okay
P10:52:54 <Darkebrz> Saer, you should give it to Pl0x :p
P10:53:00 <Pl0x> yes he should.
P10:54:05 <Pl0x> Please?
P10:54:09 <TrueWolves> pl0x, have you seen Yggdrasil?

P11:03:22 <Saer> to be honest, I don't think he will enforce the rules.
P11:03:22 <Darkebrz> :0
P11:03:27 <Saer> Since it isn't his own rules.
P11:03:29 <Darkebrz> Saer
P11:03:32 <Pl0x> not if i sewed you on the grounds of hacking.
P11:03:34 <Saer> It is the rules of the former administrator.

P11:03:50 <Darkebrz> That enforce the rules
P11:03:58 <Pl0x> but it wouldn't be up 24/7
P11:04:01 <Saer> Meh, if the guy doesn't respond by tomorrow.

P11:31:33 <Darkebrz> Hehe
P11:31:59 <Darkebrz> Apocalyptic theme
P11:37:15 <Saer> I just thought of something awesome
P11:37:22 <Saer> Odds are someone already wantedto do it
P11:37:27 <Saer> but I think I can pull it off
P11:37:52 <Perogi> whats is it Saer?
P11:37:54 <Saer> it is called "Anti-greifing"
P11:37:54 <Saer> You spam blocks all over
P11:38:03 <Saer> It is like, awesome.
P11:38:09 <Darkebrz> Erm
P11:38:12 <Darkebrz> That is griefing
P11:38:16 <Perogi> lol ya
P11:38:18 <Saer> ... it is/
P11:38:19 <Saer> ?
P11:38:23 <Perogi> its a method of griefing
P11:38:29 <Perogi> you spam ugly pink blocks all over the place
P11:38:34 <Darkebrz> Griefing is the act of intentionally causing someone else grief
P11:38:35 <Saer> I thought griefing is when you just destroy everyone elses stuff
P11:38:39 <Darkebrz> no
P11:38:41 <Saer> Oh....
P11:38:50 <Saer> That makes sense now...
P11:38:52 <Perogi> destroying or just generally making stuff look ugly
P11:38:54 <Saer> I get it...
P11:39:02 <Darkebrz> Why
P11:39:04 <Saer> Thanks
P11:39:06 <Perogi> really greifing is just fucking up other peoples stuff in a way the do not want
P11:39:10 <Darkebrz> Did you anti-grief everywhere?
P11:39:20 <Saer> Oh, well, my idea was to just randomly build blocks all over
P11:39:21 <Saer> no
P11:39:25 <Perogi> lol
P11:39:28 <Saer> lol
P11:39:34 <PuyoDead> like when someone runs all over placing blocks everywhere for no particular reason
P11:39:39 <Perogi> that doesn't solve anything! :P
P11:39:39 <PuyoDead> there ya go
P11:39:52 <Saer> replace anti-grief with ejaculate in Darkebrz last
