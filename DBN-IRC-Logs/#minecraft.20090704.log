A12:07:25 <TrueWolves> Hia redshift
A12:07:39 <NgLF> because Ive been around here for a while?

A12:08:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> good night
A12:08:26 <Jat> hey do you think a geforce 2 can run minecraft?
A12:08:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
A12:08:33 <Jat> :(
A12:08:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe
A12:08:39 <Jat> :|
A12:08:47 <vdgmprgrmr> No, definitely not.
A12:08:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> show me your excited face
A12:08:59 <Jat> <:|
A12:09:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> you look sad soldier
A12:09:21 <Jat> no minecraft for me sir :(
A12:09:23 <TrueWolves> checking it our Red
A12:09:24 <vdgmprgrmr> My normal computer has a Geforce 5 and it can't run MC all that well.
A12:09:42 <TrueWolves> but I've had super lag ever scense sound was added, with mute not helping
10A12:09:45 * mkinzee (Mibbit@c-98-234-245-142.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:09:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> i am sad too
A12:09:52 <Jat> why?
A12:10:03 <mkinzee> Yo can anyone help with some java fatal error 7 crap?
A12:10:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> because i don't have an xbox360
A12:10:25 <TrueWolves> out^
A12:10:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
A12:10:52 <mkinzee> YO CAN SOME1 HELP ME WITH JAVA FATAL ERROR 7?
A12:10:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> not really
A12:11:04 <Sanjuaro> Turn off caps lock first.
A12:11:27 <mkinzee> I did but no1 bothered to repond w/o caps on
A12:11:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> and you thought it was gonna help you somehow huh padre
A12:11:51 <Sanjuaro> That's because Annihilator told us he didn't have a 360.
A12:11:56 <Sanjuaro> Which was more important at the time.
A12:12:13 <Jat> did you do a google search for it?
A12:12:18 <Sanjuaro> But have you tried re-installing/updating/having sex with Java?
A12:12:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> obviously not
A12:12:25 <mkinzee> already did
A12:12:29 <mkinzee> latest version
A12:12:36 <Jat> what is a java fatal error 7?
A12:12:37 <mkinzee> doubled checked firefox plugin
A12:12:53 <mkinzee> Fatal error occured (7): com.mojang.minecraft.MinecraftApplet
A12:13:00 <mkinzee> occurs on all browsers
A12:13:12 <mkinzee> uninstalled and reinstalled java to latest version
A12:13:16 <Jat> did you look up on google what a java fatal error 7 is?
A12:13:24 <mkinzee> it's applet specific
A12:13:41 <mkinzee> aka not applicable to all java applets; only mc
A12:13:54 <Jat> oh
A12:14:00 <Jat> thats weird
A12:14:09 <mkinzee> can't start up mc cuz of that
A12:14:36 <Jat> oh now i see
A12:14:36 <Sanjuaro> This means that Minecraft is pregnant with your Java but your Java doesn't want the child and refuses to pay child support once the baby applet is born.
A12:14:57 <mkinzee> bs
A12:14:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> reset your system until the error no longer occurs
A12:15:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> do this repeatedly
A12:15:11 <mkinzee> i killed java and brought in a new one
A12:15:23 <mkinzee> and the new one likes children
A12:15:30 <Sanjuaro> Okay, that's good.
A12:15:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> well there's your problem
A12:15:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> call the cops, they have to deal with it
A12:15:45 <Sanjuaro> Let me try Googling it for you.
A12:16:02 <mkinzee> already did

A12:18:35 <mkinzee> but no server from the master server list works
A12:19:33 <Eagle> "Woah its the earth!"
A12:21:17 <Jat> sorry i was busy installing then promptly uninstalling ghc
A12:21:20 <Jat> what annihilator?
A12:21:27 <mkinzee> hmmm
A12:21:35 <mkinzee> the problem seems to be coming from adding the www.
A12:21:41 <mkinzee> perhaps its something with my router?
A12:22:01 <Jat> annihilator why ddi you say my name?
A12:22:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> i was asking
A12:22:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you
A12:22:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> had a 360
A12:22:17 <Jat> no
A12:22:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> which is far
A12:22:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> superiorly far important
A12:22:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> than any topic coexisting
A12:22:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> in this channel
A12:22:49 <Jat> i do not have any modern consoles
A12:23:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> well i should get one then
A12:23:10 <mkinzee> nope
A12:23:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> ... should i
A12:23:14 <mkinzee> prolly not the router
A12:23:19 <Jat> what does me not having one have to do with you getting one?
A12:23:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> well first of all you are not very excited
A12:24:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> second of all fez is going to be released on xbla
A12:24:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> thirdly you probably don't care either so i'm going to sleep
A12:24:28 <AnnihilatorBeta> good night
A12:24:28 <Jat> if youre going to get a console i guess an xbox 360 would probably be the one to get from what ive seen of the availability and quality of games of the various consoles
A12:24:37 <Sanjuaro> I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life.
A12:24:39 <Jat> but im obviously not an expert on the subject
A12:25:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> sanjuaro, assuming you have a 360, is it/would it be worth it?
A12:25:32 <Sanjuaro> I have only a Wii but don't even use it. I'm a sole PC gamer so you'd be better off asking someone else.
A12:25:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> me too
A12:25:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> but you know how i feel right now
A12:26:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're making more and more console exclusives than ever
A12:26:20 <Sanjuaro> Well this is just me but if I bought a 360 I wouldn't even really play it too much.
A12:26:31 <Sanjuaro> And console only games that are out I just get emulators to play them.
A12:26:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> same, i'd rather stick with pc
A12:27:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> but damn, console exclusives of my favourite games makes me sad, very sad
A12:27:36 <Sanjuaro> The only games I want to play that are only for consoles are Siren, the Fatal Frame series, and I've been dying to re-play Pikmin.
A12:28:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe i just wanna play fez when it gets on xbla, but whatever
A12:28:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> good night to you all (for real this time)
A12:28:20 <Jat> pikmin <3
A12:28:25 <Jat> also night annihilkator

13A3:13:28 * JTE adds a /nick command.
A3:13:50 <Meizlizard> Why do people even bother griefing the planetarium?
A3:17:02 <JTE> Because their favorite movie is Penis in Space.
A3:18:25 <Meizlizard> This one dude was cutting a hole in the top
A3:18:38 <Meizlizard> I found out where he set his respawn
A3:18:48 <Meizlizard> And put a hole under it :D

A3:31:35 <JTE> Erm.
A3:31:38 <JTE> Command.
A3:32:00 <JTE> If you use /nick, it tells you what your nick is. If you use /nick <something> it sets your nick to <something>
A3:32:10 <JTE> and then whenever you say anything, it appears from that name instead!
A3:32:20 <JTE> But it doesn't change the name over you head. :<

A3:49:19 <citricsquid> You can track everytime a person places a block can't you?
A3:49:54 <JTE> vdgmprgrmr: You are in a twisty maze of passages, all alike. 
A3:50:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Ah.
A3:50:42 <JTE> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xyzzy
A3:52:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah I know what xyzzy IS.
A3:52:13 <JTE> So mine just writes "Nothing happens."
A3:52:32 <JTE> Which is the message embedded in my very IRC client.
A3:52:59 <vdgmprgrmr> But the messages in different programs vary, so I was curious.
A3:53:46 <vdgmprgrmr> O_O
A3:53:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I think I got angles working...
A3:54:08 <JTE> I having trouble figuring out how to tell what players do with blocks
A3:54:25 <citricsquid> Is there not a difference between place and delete?
A3:54:41 <JTE> Message number 5 seems to have the coordinates for when a player "does something with this block"
A3:54:50 <JTE> But it ONLY has the coordinates, and nothing else. O_o;
A3:55:00 <JTE> No block type, not even a difference between place and delete.
A3:55:08 <UnknownX> is there a diamond miner post count?
A3:55:26 <JTE> UnknownX: Sick of being a gold digger?
A3:55:29 <UnknownX> yes
A3:55:38 <UnknownX> i have enough gold
A3:55:57 <citricsquid> pffft, only got 39 posts!
A3:56:09 <JTE> Oh, hey, I found the byte that is 0 on delete and 1 on place and the byte next to it that has the block type
A3:56:12 <JTE> How did I miss that?! O_o;
A3:56:36 <citricsquid> lmao
A3:56:55 <citricsquid> but yeah, you should track how many blocks are placed and how many are deleted then output it to PHP or something, that'd make for awesome :D

A3:58:18 <vdgmprgrmr> No...

A3:58:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Nah, ten should work.

A4:22:25 <JTE> It works.
A4:22:31 <JTE> Rather...

A6:22:19 <Dossy> Anyone see 8/10 cats? :|
A6:22:44 <citricsquid> jimmy carr is as funny as abortion.
A6:22:53 <citricsquid> worst "comedian" ever.
A6:23:15 <Dossy> He was pretty harsh on MJ last night :o
A6:23:15 <Rroff> hmm
A6:23:23 <Rroff> hes a bit tasteless sometimes
A6:23:38 <Rroff> but ignoring that, as a comedian hes by far one of the funniest
A6:23:48 <Dossy> Not really :|
A6:23:58 <Rroff> whos better?
A6:24:01 <citricsquid> you suck, his jokes aren't clever or humorous :( His fake laugh is even worse.
A6:24:03 <Dossy> Sean Lock :p
A6:24:10 <Rroff> sean lock
A6:24:12 <Rroff> lol
A6:24:18 <Dossy> Wat.
A6:24:20 <Dossy> He is awesome :|
A6:24:52 <Rroff> ocassaionally
A6:25:17 <Rroff> problem is
A6:25:22 <Dossy> But yeah, last night he said that he felt the same way about MJ dying as Princess Diane, he couldn't give a shit :|
A6:25:33 <Rroff> he'd be much funnier if he knew when to let a joke lie and leave your imagination to do the rest
A6:25:43 <Rroff> which is why Jimmy Carr is so masterful as a comedian
13A6:26:06 * Dossy is with citric on this one.
A6:26:16 <citricsquid> Rroff: It's like listening to a kid in a playground, he just tells a few lines long joke and it ends there, he doesn't do real clever jokes.

A6:26:27 <Rroff> lol
A6:26:32 <Rroff> no offense but
A6:26:49 <Rroff> jimmy carr has by way some of the cleverest and subtle jokes ever
A6:26:55 <citricsquid> link? =D
A6:27:03 <Rroff> ok his taste is somewhat dubious
A6:27:07 <Rroff> which kinda ruins it sometime
A6:27:27 <citricsquid> wait, his jokes are subtle?!
A6:27:33 <Rroff> yeah
A6:27:47 <Rroff> loads of times he setups up jokes so he can just slightly hint at an earlier joke
A6:28:00 <Rroff> and you see it in a whole new light, without him even explaining it
A6:28:01 <Siiseli> no, apple have some of the best jokes ever
A6:28:16 <Siiseli> one of them is macbook air
A6:28:16 <Rroff> I guess it depends on your sense of humour
A6:28:21 <citricsquid> Maybe I should watch some of his stuff then :D I've only ever seen him on 8/10 cats and a few other things, not watched him properly.
A6:28:30 <Rroff> can we all agree allan carr is like an old lady rabbiting on and seriously not funny?
A6:28:31 <Dossy> Siiseli: Lol'd
A6:28:43 <Dossy> He's bad on 8/10 Cats
A6:28:49 <Dossy> Yeah, he is, tbh
A6:29:08 <Dossy> And I'm pretty sure 'allan' is 1 L :p
A6:29:10 <citricsquid> lol alan carr sux.
A6:29:22 <Rroff> thing I hate about jimmy carr is how often he goes for the shock value
A6:29:29 <Rroff> when hes clever enough to spin a joke without using it
A6:29:30 <Dossy> Yeah, like he did last night
A6:29:52 <Rroff> as a person hes a bit of a tosser really
A6:30:12 <Dossy> Yeah, he's not one of those people you'd want to meet...
A6:30:16 <Dossy> Lee Evans on the other hand :o
A6:30:29 <Rroff> his comedy is prolly a bit too polished for some peoples' taste
A6:30:54 <Rroff> personally I prefer it to the average stand up act

A8:06:59 <citricsquid> heh, clever idea

A8:08:28 <cryzed> citricsquid: yeah ... hrmm
A8:08:30 <Tsuta> so, I wanted to host a server fer my friends and myself, but when I run it and try to connect to it, it says that is fails to connect ):

A10:13:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> ][ in BBCode pisses me off

A10:13:20 <Jat> its very hard to have tolook at the name list and try to remember a weird name good enough to ban
A10:13:37 <Jat> and if i spell it wrong i have to go back and look at it and try to remember it again
A10:13:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> hold tab while you type
A10:13:55 <Jat> hard to tping too
A10:24:26 <Jat> i think i know how to write a backup thing in just a few batch files in windows

A10:26:16 <PuyoDead> I've only made one "fairly" complicated batch file for backing up certain new file types on a microsd, so that's about the extent for me

A11:24:43 <Jat> its funny though how theyre talking about it being about god and just trying to get the people to believe in god some way except that in buddhism there is no god
A11:26:30 <PuyoDead> yea, last I checked, Buddhists aren't theists
A11:26:41 <PuyoDead> as someone else said
A11:26:49 <PuyoDead> <mnx> might as well throw in a jedi and a scientologist.
A11:26:59 <Jat> well they technically are kinda but it depends on what your idea of a theist is
A11:27:07 <PuyoDead> <mnx> on second thought, the pilgrimage to coruscant or xenu's battleworld might be cost-prohibitive.
A11:27:20 <Jat> they do not believe in a god but they do have what would normally be considered religious beliefs
A11:27:42 <PuyoDead> it's more of a philosophy, than a religion
A11:27:50 <Jat> for instance one of the original goals of buddhism was to break the cycle of reincarnation introduced in hinduism
A11:28:02 <PuyoDead> either way, piss poor idea for a show
A11:28:05 <Jat> lol
A11:28:31 <PuyoDead> "hey, let's take these people and change their entire way of thinking!"
A11:28:36 <PuyoDead> no problem
A11:29:19 <Jat> actually now that i think about more real buddhism is indeed quite a real religion but it is practiced to different extents by different people so for some people it is more of a philosophy than a religion
A11:29:52 <PuyoDead> it definitely does not fit into the format of that show, anyway
A11:30:08 <Jat> and those religious leaders that try to convert the atheists will always or almost always fail because atheists are famous for being stubborn lol

P1:36:37 <Adura> Alright, feel free to continue in the thread with AlLnAtuRalX.
P1:38:52 <Jat> wouldnt that be easy to do by just adding a little bit to the perl script?
P1:39:06 <JTE> Adura: By the way, I'm writing this in Perl... o.o
P1:39:15 <C418> : C418 says: I hate you all you fucking idiots.
P1:39:17 <Adura> Yep, I just want to know the way it should be implemented.

P1:39:53 <Adura> Perl is nice, if you get it.
P1:40:15 <Jat> i keep forgetting why i dont learn perl
P1:40:33 <Jat> it might be because i use windows and as i recall it was kind of a pain in the ass on windows
P1:40:37 <Adura> It's very sigil-y.
P1:40:50 <Jat> also i dont remember if there were any tutorials on it that didnt use linux or unix
P1:40:59 <Jat> although i guess i could have used cygwin...
P1:41:07 <Adura> You can do Perl on Windows with Straberry Perl or Cygwin.

P1:41:20 <Adura> My script requires Cygwin.
P1:41:36 <Jat> yeah but i think the problem may have been finding tutorials or something that actually made sense in windows
P1:41:58 <Adura> It shouldn't matter that much.
P1:41:59 <Jat> i dont think i thought of cygwin
P1:42:04 <Adura> The basic syntax and structure.
P1:42:17 <Jat> yeah i dont remember exactly why i didnt learn it
P1:42:19 <Jat> it was a while ago
P1:42:24 <Jat> it may have been different reasons
P1:42:51 <Jat> anyway if i ever do try again ill use cygwin definitely
P1:43:18 <Jat> im not sure if i thought of that before
P1:43:35 <fanta> AlLnAtuRalX, irc chat. that why i wrote internal channel. only mc admins should be able to join that channel

P1:44:09 <stone_age> is somebody here OP there
P1:44:19 <Jat> wow what a cioncidence
P1:44:34 <fanta> most of the time i have to channels: one public, one for internal stuff
P1:45:00 <Adura> Makes sense though, it's an admin script.
P1:45:18 <JTE> mmm...
P1:45:44 <stone_age> can i see a users emial adress ?
P1:45:55 <stone_age> a minecraft user
P1:46:10 <fanta> it would help a lot, being able to kick, ban users via irc 
P1:46:33 <Adura> From a staff channel, yeah. That's a good implementation.
P1:46:35 <Jat> a users email address?
P1:47:01 <Jat> be careful of banning users from irc
P1:47:07 <stone_age> yeah
P1:47:11 <Jat> unless youre absolutely sure theyre a griefer
P1:47:54 <fanta> i guess if more than one person starts complaining about $user why not
P1:48:17 <Jat> it depends on the individual situation i guess
P1:48:30 <Jat> its still possible the user is innocent even if two or three people call them a griefer
P1:49:06 <Jat> especially if people start getting their friends to join a server and then all of them start calling everyone a griefer just to get everyone banned
P1:49:10 <Adura> It's not unlike votekick.
P1:49:44 <fanta> in my case i run a private server and i actually know most of the users. so as soon as one of them complains i kick them. but still you could talk straight to the user thats being messing around
P1:49:58 <fanta> its like your an the server. only being blind ;)

P1:50:41 <fanta> that no admin is around when they join
P1:50:50 <fanta> in most of the time i just idle
P1:51:07 <fanta> in the background and i am too late
P1:51:24 <fanta> but if i had an irc bot, i would have hightlights
P1:51:45 <fanta> i would know, if some joins, says hello, wants to be free, whatever
P1:52:24 <cryzed> Does someone know if the log logs java exceptions?
P1:52:36 <cryzed> I wanted to write a Python script which regularly checks if there is a certain string in there
P1:52:40 <cryzed> for example
P1:52:41 <cryzed> Exception in thread "
P1:52:43 <Rroff> it spits out a log on java exception
P1:52:47 <cryzed> and then restarts the server
P1:52:49 <Rroff> called hs_* iirc

P1:53:36 <cryzed> "When there is an exception - restart"
P1:53:52 <Rroff> only place I get java exceptions logged is in hs_err_pid#####.log
P1:53:54 <Adura> You might have an issue with the port being bound still.
P1:54:11 <cryzed> Adura: this only happens if you kill the process

P2:12:50 <JTE> Or just constantly moving or changing blocks.
P2:12:51 <Super-Dot> So you can build and break blocks in realtime without needing to move a mob?
P2:13:04 <Super-Dot> Because then you could do animations :O
P2:13:07 <JTE> I can build and break blocks anywhere.

P3:55:56 <Super-Dot> Would it be at all possible to do it the other way around?
P3:56:42 <JTE> Convert multiplayer maps to singleplayer ones? ... ... I'm not sure.

P4:09:46 <Super-Dot> Anti-Grief Easy Cleaning Spray
P4:10:02 <ZomBuster> impossible to grief
P4:10:09 <ZomBuster> and when someone griefs it
P4:10:14 <ZomBuster> I build it twice as abig
P4:10:25 <Super-Dot> Impossible to wipe, maybe
P4:10:37 <Super-Dot> But most griefing entails destroying a third of a structure

P9:07:21 <Jat> ?
P9:07:58 <Dilt> while most people paid about 14 dollars in USD for the game, I paid 15 in a special arrangement! ... because paypal oesn't know how to pay from two sources

P9:16:44 <Tsuta> what a shame, the server I like apparently has the spawn point blocked off now ):
P9:17:09 <JTE> .. I could totally get around that.

P9:17:54 <Tsuta> I like that server, it had a cute little city on it qq
P9:18:17 <Jat> admin blocks suck :(
P9:18:25 <Tsuta> yeah D:
P9:18:41 <JTE> In fact, ... it probably wouldn't even be that much effort to cause holes to magically appear whenever you go walking into any walls at the same height as you, then re-build them behind you...
P9:19:00 <Jat> the one good use i can think of for admin blocks is putting them underneath a spawn area to prevernt spawn area griefing where the players can fall through
P9:19:27 <JTE> The one good use I can think of for admin blocks is spleef arenas :33
P9:19:32 <Jat> that too
P9:19:38 <Jat> also making admin only spleef arenas lol
P9:19:47 <JTE> Especially those ones with water features.
P9:19:50 <Jat> only admins can break or create the blocks
P9:19:51 <JTE> I <3 water features.
P9:20:01 <Jat> you mean water that you fall into?
P9:20:28 <JTE> I mean water that you break one block and it goes flowing through a series of pipes around in circles and then down into a little area. :3
P9:20:42 <Jat> oh yeah cool
P9:20:49 <Tsuta> like dominos... with water
P9:20:50 <JTE> A maze of plant decorations, even.
P9:20:54 <Jat> one mistake and everything is fucked up though
P9:21:11 <JTE> Then make no mistake.
P9:21:18 <Tsuta> does anyone know who the admin is of bunte steine? :O
P9:21:55 <Jat> hey! with your thing for manipulating server and client communication you could make it so that the server has blocks to direct the water for water features like that
P9:22:02 <Jat> but make it so that the client doesnt see them!

P10:34:46 <Icalasari> ...I see it
P10:34:52 <Icalasari> ...Damn, I am blind as a bat
P10:35:29 <Jat> i like bats
P10:35:34 <Jat> theyre cute
P10:35:34 <Super-Dot> Bats are cool
P10:35:38 <Super-Dot> Minecraft needs bats
P10:35:43 <Jat> yes!
P10:35:49 <Jat> blocky bats that fly around in the caves
P10:36:16 <Super-Dot> JTE!
P10:36:21 <Super-Dot> You need to make bats.
P10:36:26 <Super-Dot> Out of purple blocks.
P10:36:29 <Super-Dot> Which fly around.
P10:36:37 <Jat> they would have to be pretty big bats
P10:36:44 <Super-Dot> Just three blocks
P10:36:49 <Jat> and it would create tons of chunk updates
P10:36:52 <Super-Dot> One for the body, two for the wings
P10:37:04 <Super-Dot> Just six chunk updates every step
P10:37:15 <Jat> six times number of bats
P10:37:21 <Super-Dot> Hmm, true
P10:37:33 <Jat> and i dunno how long it takes for chunk updates to be done
P10:38:34 <Super-Dot> Well there's nothing wrong with chunk updates
P10:39:34 <Jat> even a modest amount can cause lag
P10:39:39 <Jat> sadly
P10:40:01 <Super-Dot> Well there are a million chunk updates in multiplayer all the time
P10:42:07 <Jat> yeah but not as many as a flock of bats

P10:46:42 <Super-Dot> Oh hmm
P10:46:54 <Super-Dot> I would have thought I'd get notification emails for that
P10:47:18 <JTE> IRC PMs, not message board.
P10:47:21 <JTE> but okay.
P10:47:40 <Super-Dot> Oh, I responded to the first two ingame
P10:47:44 <JTE> Would you know anyone who has or would make for me, a dungeon map thing which I could program stuff like doors and traps into? :3
P10:48:09 <Super-Dot> And then I was confused about the third because I don't remember getting disconnected, so I might have been eating at the time
P10:48:13 <Jat> hopefully soon i will be able to start making things like that easily
P10:48:29 <Jat> but at the moment i am learning a new language
P10:48:30 <Super-Dot> *first three
P10:48:32 <Super-Dot> *fourth
P10:48:48 <Icalasari> >.> Great, my IP address has different numbers from the beginning numbers for the site
P10:48:59 <JTE> Jat: I have the ability to make blocks DISAPPEAR and APPEAR ON THEIR OWN. :o
P10:49:00 <Jat> what do you mean?
P10:49:03 <Icalasari> 192.168.1___ is what it wants
P10:49:14 <Icalasari> 24.64.116.157 is what I have
P10:49:21 <Jat> wait you mean you want something to make actualy interactive dungeons?
P10:49:26 <Super-Dot> And then I already saw the events of the second-to-last screenshot ingame
P10:49:31 <Super-Dot> And then I am confused by the last
P10:49:33 <JTE> No, I want somebody to make the dungeon itself.
P10:49:40 <Jat> oh yeah thats what i was talking about
P10:49:47 <JTE> I'll do the interactive part of it :3
P10:49:56 <Super-Dot> Because I have no idea what "Only Four Can Ladder" means
P10:49:59 <JTE> Including messages and fake players.
P10:50:06 <Jat> well hopefully it wont take me too long before i can get around to doing that
P10:50:11 <Jat> i supposed i could technically do it now
P10:50:19 <Jat> but i would rather wait D:
P10:50:27 <JTE> Kay. :P
P10:50:30 <JTE> ... Hmm.
P10:50:37 <Jat> im sure there are plenty of programmers less shitty than me
P10:50:49 <JTE> I should make it automatically kill or respawn you when you fall into a lava block.
P10:51:07 <Jat> can you do that?
P10:51:13 <JTE> I can do anything, Jat.
P10:51:13 <Jat> i mean can you teleport people?
P10:51:21 <Jat> well it depends on what the client accepts :D
P10:51:25 <JTE> /tp does it, so I can too.
P10:51:32 <Jat> oh yeah i forgot
P10:51:35 <Jat> silly me
P10:51:51 <JTE> I can even override your save point
P10:51:53 <Super-Dot> You can teleport OTHER people?

P10:52:15 <Jat> jte if you can do all of this why not just write a dungeon thing of your own?
P10:52:31 <Super-Dot> (I have no idea why everyone wants a /fetch command)
P10:52:32 <JTE> That's what I'm trying to say, Jat. I want to write it on my own.
P10:52:37 <Jat> oh
P10:52:38 <JTE> I need the actual dungeon MAP.
P10:52:43 <Jat> ooohhh
P10:52:43 <JTE> I am not a builder, I'm a programmer.
P10:52:47 <Jat> i see
P10:52:47 <JTE> I can not build. :<
P10:53:14 <Jat> you want a program  that will let you design the map or you want someone to do the actual designing?
P10:54:07 <Jat> lol i think im getting confused D:
P10:54:24 <JTE> I don't care how it gets made, I want a dungeon map. The map itself. The server_level.dat.
P10:54:32 <Jat> oh ok
P10:54:42 <JTE> I am not a good designer, I am not a good builder, so in order for it to be PRETTY and AWESOME, someone else needs to do that part.
P10:54:47 <JTE> I just make it MOVE and ALIVE.
P10:55:03 <JTE> ... With automatic self-clearing lava floods and anything else we can brainstorm.
P10:55:12 <Jat> if there were an easy fast way to make gui programs i would gladly do it
P10:55:22 <Super-Dot> You could put up a web page with your instructions and an accompanying server
P10:55:37 <Jat> but i have yet to find something that is really good for fast easy program development with a gui
P10:55:40 <Super-Dot> Op a few people and let people collaborawesome
P10:56:03 <Jat> unless you know of a language or system jte?
P10:56:59 <Super-Dot> I wish I could run the server
P10:57:10 <Jat> ive for a while liked the idea of making a minecraft map editor and i had dungeon building in mind
P10:57:24 <Super-Dot> There are already map editors on the forum
P10:57:33 <Jat> yeah but i mean a better one
P10:57:35 <Jat> a nicer one
P10:57:50 <Jat> one that would be good for dungeon building
P10:58:15 <Super-Dot> Well the game itself is good for dungeon building, I think
P10:58:36 <Jat> not as easy as using a (good) map editor though
P10:58:45 <Super-Dot> I guess
P10:58:53 <Jat> and also you dont get quite the same views you can get with a map editor
P10:58:59 <Jat> and planning and stuff
P10:59:27 <Age1> Halo.
P10:59:31 <Jat> hi
10P10:59:37 * Age1 is now known as Age
P11:01:48 <Super-Dot> But srsly, bats
P11:01:56 <Super-Dot> Three blocks to a bat
13P11:01:59 * JTE tests /fetch
P11:02:04 <Super-Dot> They could be flying around
P11:02:14 <Super-Dot> And you have to jump on things in order to reach them
P11:02:27 <Super-Dot> And if you manage to delete the middle part of the bat, it dies
P11:02:42 <Super-Dot> And if you manage to delete the wing, it becomes Less Good At Flying
P11:03:29 <Super-Dot> Hmm
P11:03:31 <Jat> that sure is complicated
P11:03:49 <Super-Dot> It's not that complicated conceptually
P11:03:56 <Super-Dot> But it would take a while to implement
P11:04:54 <Super-Dot> So a good dungeon would be a dungeon that accommodates many players rather than one player
P11:04:54 <Jat> yeah thats what i mean
P11:05:15 <Super-Dot> I don't have that much experience with multiplayer dungeons
P11:06:03 <Jat> lol MUDs
P11:06:24 <Jat> make people just use text commands with no ability to move on their own
P11:11:01 <JTE> There we  gooo, I have /fetch. :3
P11:11:23 <Super-Dot> Hooray
P11:11:33 <Jat> yay :D
P11:11:41 <JTE> Super-Dot: The lack of black blocks annoys me verily.
P11:11:58 <Super-Dot> Yeah, me too
P11:12:20 <Super-Dot> What's really annoying is that admincrete is the closest to black we have
P11:12:34 <Super-Dot> So you have ops making pixel art out of admincrete sometimes
P11:12:51 <Super-Dot> Which is [capslock]really stupid[/capslock]

P11:13:03 <JTE> Heh.
P11:13:52 <JTE> So the list of commands thus far is /me, /fetch, /nick, /spawn, /mineral, and the beginnings of /record.
P11:14:01 <JTE> And colors work in nicks now :3~
P11:14:43 <Super-Dot> /record? /spawn?
P11:14:49 <Super-Dot> Colors :D
P11:15:34 <Super-Dot> The color syntax is kind of annoying right now
P11:15:46 <Super-Dot> Would "/blue [message]" make sense?
P11:16:20 <Super-Dot> Actually, maybe it's good that it's annoying
P11:16:29 <Super-Dot> Since fewer people will abuse it
P11:16:55 <Super-Dot> Hmm

P11:25:54 <JTE> It's a lot less annoying than it was originally.
P11:26:42 <Super-Dot> Yeah, but you still have to memorize sixteen color
P11:26:43 <Super-Dot> s
13P11:27:11 * JTE kills Java
P11:27:25 <Super-Dot> Literally or figuratively?
P11:27:54 <Super-Dot> Or figuratively because you had to do it literally?
P11:28:15 <Super-Dot> Because that happens to me all the time
P11:28:35 <JTE> .. okay, so color codes at the end of ANYTHING is a bad idea.

10P11:39:46 * Spazzo is now known as AwaySpazzo
P11:40:02 <Super-Dot_iPod> Those fireworks sound like gunshots
P11:40:12 <Super-Dot_iPod> And those ones sound like explosions
P11:40:51 <Super-Dot_iPod> Those ones sound like thunder
P11:40:57 <JTE> And those ones sound like nazi marching
P11:41:20 <Super-Dot_iPod> And those ones sound like when you delete a stone block
