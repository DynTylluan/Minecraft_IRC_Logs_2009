A12:05:35 <Peroggi> just yelling and screaming OMG ITS A FALLACY THEREFORE I IS SMART
A12:05:41 <Peroggi> that is not proper use of fallacys
A12:05:50 <mail2345|semi-afk> how about you click on the goddam link

A12:11:49 <Peroggi> cya

A12:12:29 <TheOne> Depends on the troll...
A12:12:36 <Peroggi> hmm I suppose
A12:12:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> of coruse everone would ignore loblon
A12:12:49 <mail2345|semi-afk> or the like
A12:12:50 <TheOne> Need to be funny first...
A12:12:57 <vede> I think people seem to jump to "troll!" far too quickly.
A12:13:07 <Peroggi> the correct word is alarmist vede
A12:13:12 <Peroggi> this community is full of them :O
A12:13:16 <mail2345|semi-afk> i think the word is subtle
A12:13:17 <vede> I mean, first sign of a person disagreeing with you, they're a troll.
A12:13:21 <mail2345|semi-afk> ugh
A12:13:26 <Colain> I live ina  giant bucket.
A12:13:27 <mail2345|semi-afk> if he disagreed with me, i'm fine
A12:13:35 <Peroggi> ya vede its kinda annoying sometimes, but mostly funny
A12:13:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> but if he goes ahead and makes coments about heroin, and ignores my points
A12:13:44 <vede> First time someone says something stupid, they're a troll.
A12:14:23 <UnknownX> The sky is pink
A12:14:34 <Peroggi> is the sun setting unknown?
A12:14:36 <Colain> heroin is a female hero :D
A12:14:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> stupid != true
A12:14:40 <mail2345|semi-afk> troll*
A12:14:40 <PuyoDead> the meteors, they have begun!
A12:14:47 <vede> They might have a terrible grasp on when and when not to make jokes, or might not be the best debaters, but honestly, NOT EVERYONE WHO IS ANNOYING IS A TROLL.
A12:15:06 <Peroggi> indeed
A12:15:11 <vede> I believe trolling implies malicious intent, not mere stupidity.
A12:15:15 <Peroggi> a troll purposefully causes grief or bad feelings to someone else
A12:15:17 <Peroggi> such as myself
A12:15:31 <vede> So, you admit to being a troll, yeah?
A12:15:37 <Peroggi> ... no
A12:15:39 <Peroggi> :O
A12:15:55 <Colain> Remind me never to add you guys to The List.
A12:15:57 <UnknownX> Peroggi you hurt my feeling earlier when you said you were going to sue me
A12:16:07 <mail2345|semi-afk> i think you don't need reminding
A12:16:08 <Peroggi> :( I sawwy I apologize
A12:16:14 <Peroggi> now is the sun setting? is that why sky is pink?
A12:16:19 <UnknownX> No
A12:16:23 <Peroggi> why is sky pink
A12:16:25 <UnknownX> The sky is black
A12:16:29 <Peroggi> wtf you said it was pink
A12:16:30 <vede> Colain, you're aware that "The List" is immature and stupid, right?
A12:16:38 <Colain> No.
A12:16:40 <Peroggi> what exactly is The List
A12:16:45 <UnknownX> Vede: Notch said it was cool
A12:16:46 <vede> Well, I'm now informing you.
A12:17:06 <Peroggi> guis wat is The List
A12:17:11 <Peroggi> and why does it demand capital letters
A12:17:14 <UnknownX> List of kool kids
A12:17:20 <vede> It's a list of Minecrafters who are "cool".

A12:17:47 <Peroggi> this is evidence to my claim that the minecraft community is extremely elitist
A12:17:57 <vede> It achieves NOTHING AT ALL beyond letting people feel better than everyone else.
A12:18:03 <UnknownX> Vede: Its a list of minecrafters who colain thinks is "cool
A12:18:05 <UnknownX> "
A12:18:07 <Peroggi> elitism >.>

A12:18:58 <PuyoDead> you're both wrong
A12:19:01 <Peroggi> but it was Alex's project

10A12:19:54 * Lukus is now known as Colain
A12:19:57 <Colain> I don't see the problem
A12:19:57 <Peroggi> well it made me laugh for a few seconds so I guess
A12:20:03 <mail2345|afk> back to afkness
A12:20:09 <vede> I had no lulz.
A12:20:11 <Peroggi> THE PROBLEM
A12:20:19 <Peroggi> IS THAT YOU MUST REFER TO IT USING CAPITALS AS IF ITS IMPORTANT
A12:20:32 <UnknownX> Dah List
A12:20:42 <PuyoDead> YOU FORGOT BOLD
A12:20:42 <Colain> It makes it look cooler I believe.

A12:21:14 <Peroggi> damn you unknown and your secret text manipulation
A12:21:22 <UnknownX> TD tl;dr
A12:21:38 <vede> ... I guess Nettalk doesn't display bold text.
A12:22:29 <Peroggi> lol
A12:22:40 <PuyoDead> aww, nevermind on that last one
A12:22:50 <UnknownX> ?
A12:22:57 <PuyoDead> --- #minecraft :Cannot send to channel; colors are not permitted on #minecraft

12A12:24:03 * Rian_Carnarvon (Jarerex@S0106002129ab40ae.vc.shawcable.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:24:04 <PuyoDead> I just did a test, nothing important
A12:24:08 <UnknownX> So we never saw it
A12:24:15 <PuyoDead> guess not
A12:24:22 <PuyoDead> it just said ALSO, COLOR
A12:24:29 <UnknownX> Nope
A12:24:32 <UnknownX> Didn't appear
A12:24:36 <Hiturunk> Well, I've been googling and have yet to find a fix for my problem.
A12:24:52 <UnknownX> The server probably has a bad map
A12:25:02 <Hiturunk> I can't even start the game.
A12:25:22 <Peroggi> Hiturunk use the WoM custom client
A12:25:25 <PuyoDead> what's the error?
A12:25:28 <Hiturunk> The procedure entry point ??_V@YAXPAX@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library
A12:25:33 <TheOne> tried a fresh install of java?
A12:25:36 <Hiturunk> Yep.
A12:25:38 <PuyoDead> holy... no idea what that one is
A12:26:07 <vede> Peroggi, you shouldn't be marketing a damn custom client on the IRC.
A12:26:18 <PuyoDead> that actually isn't very wise
A12:26:23 <Peroggi> I'm not marketing it I'm trying to help Hit
A12:26:28 <PuyoDead> at least, not when active ops are on

A12:26:51 <PuyoDead> legal or not isn't the issue
A12:26:54 <vede> I wouldn't even do it at all, since most of the people here are decidedly anti-hacks/custom clients.
A12:27:01 <Peroggi> >but you are probably right
A12:27:23 <Peroggi> I will avoid doing such a thing in the future kaaay
A12:27:34 <PuyoDead> kaaay
A12:27:34 <TheOne> Hiturunk: Using Firefox or Ie or tried both?
A12:27:46 <PuyoDead> I, on the other hand, am going to go look for more meteors
A12:27:51 <UnknownX> Oh no Peroggi!
A12:27:55 <Peroggi> WAT WAT WAT

A12:31:35 <Hiturunk> I've tried it in multiple browsers.
A12:31:41 <Hiturunk> Chrome, FF, And IE.
10A12:31:49 * Perogi is now known as Darke
A12:31:54 <Peroggi> don't use Chrome
A12:32:03 <mail2345|afk> wom's "client" is a wrapper.
10A12:32:11 * mail2345|afk is now known as mail2345|semi-afk
A12:32:13 <Hiturunk> I like Chrome, My browser is irrelevant to the issue regardless.
A12:32:34 <mail2345|semi-afk> indeed, so using a wrapper won't help. it's java's fault
A12:32:44 <Peroggi> Chrome is made by google and they are allowed to log your key strokes with it
A12:32:56 <mail2345|semi-afk> chrome is OSS
A12:33:05 <Peroggi> it used to say in licensce agreement but I think they changed it to be more vague
A12:33:20 <mail2345|semi-afk> chrome is open source
A12:33:20 <Hiturunk> I'm not typing in anything I don't want seen, So..
A12:33:33 <Peroggi> ah well
A12:33:38 <mail2345|semi-afk> if your worried of privacy, compile it yourself
A12:33:42 <Peroggi> I guess I sometimes look up questionable things

A12:34:41 <Colain> QUATROKING IS AFK :O

A2:53:15 <Matimal> Definitely. I've played the Hell out of it.
A2:53:48 <UnknownX> Now its got heaven in it!
A2:54:33 <Matimal> It realized my wicked ways and renounced my ability to play it. At least it still functions at work.
A2:55:20 <Matimal> But that was the main reason why I was making a server. I wanted to have a private server for my work friends and I.
A2:56:15 <Basic> What happens when you start Minecraft?
A2:56:45 <Matimal> It just shows the BG image and never loads the applet.
A2:57:47 <Matimal> And I'm quite certain I've played it on my PC since I updated Java last. Is there a more recent update that is messing with people??

A6:23:05 <Siiseli> it is
A6:23:09 <Visiiri> I do want to speak to him, honestly.
A6:23:10 <C418> I made the right music for the wrong game mode

A6:25:31 <C418> and I doubt you have enough money to buy that
A6:25:37 <C418> maybe go with fl studio or reason
A6:25:39 <C418> those are cheap enough
A6:25:48 <Visiiri> how much is it?
A6:25:56 <C418> the normal version was like 400
A6:26:00 <C418> but theres not much innit
A6:26:03 <Visiiri> Oh wow.
A6:26:06 <C418> the full blown one is 700
A6:26:09 <Visiiri> Jesus!
A6:26:19 <citricsquid> that r cheap for software
A6:26:22 <Visiiri> Hahaha I don't think mine costed even $100.
A6:26:26 <C418> but fl studio is just like 280
A6:26:30 <Visiiri> It's US software >.<
A6:26:31 <C418> and reason about 400
A6:26:34 <postlogic> FL Studio is quite good.
A6:26:40 <doohan> Wait....the guys that made ft2 then went on to make chronicles of riddick?
A6:26:43 <UnknownX> Adobe makes you pay like $3000
A6:26:48 <Visiiri> Yeah!
A6:26:51 <C418> yeah, if you can get the hang of fl studio, you should go with that
A6:26:52 <doohan> funky
A6:26:57 <Visiiri> I got photoshop, and it's nowhere near it's value.
A6:27:02 <C418> oh yeah
A6:27:03 <Visiiri> CS4^^^
A6:27:11 <Visiiri> I'm happy with Acid.
A6:27:13 <C418> the guys that made riddick were the original devs of ft2
A6:27:13 <postlogic> C418: Ever tried MilkyTracker and the likes?
A6:27:18 <Visiiri> I'm too stupid to be able to mess with that.
A6:27:26 <doohan> C418, that's crazy stuff

A6:30:36 <Visiiri> :<
A6:30:37 <Visiiri> FIne.
A6:30:48 <Maxloader> u guys know if there will be some sort of user-level restrictions?
A6:30:58 <Maxloader> like, guest, superuser, admin
A6:31:07 <Maxloader> so guest cannot delete superuser blocks
A6:31:18 <Maxloader> would stop griefers dead in their path
A6:31:41 <C418> I don't think an overly complex server admin system would do much
A6:31:46 <doohan> So would having, I dunno, some sort of private server.
A6:31:54 <Visiiri> I do not believe that will be implemented into the normal server scripts.
A6:32:17 <Visiiri> lo
A6:32:18 <Maxloader> what can he do about griefers then
A6:32:18 <Visiiri> l
A6:32:20 <citricsquid> I'll rage quit minecraft if it happens

A8:47:49 <Quatroking> actually I think smoke can be made using current stuff
A8:48:33 <ZomBuster> fire would be cool
A8:48:33 <Quatroking> the tiny chunks that you normally see when removing blocks, in black with a 50% alpha, zigzagging up
A8:49:02 <Quatroking> the chunks use physics right
A8:49:06 <UnknownX> osici: yes or no?
10A8:49:24 * Basic (adamsahlin@90-231-237-26-no109.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
A8:49:26 <osici> yes, just let me know what to do
A8:49:28 <ZomBuster> depends how he made that, if you want fire and smoke it's probably a good idea to make a complete particle system
A8:49:28 <Quatroking> make the smoke a chain of max. 10 tiles, then we can make chimneys!
A8:49:55 <Quatroking> I wonder if the current particle system would be capable of producing such thing
A8:49:56 <Quatroking> hmm

A8:50:38 <08Notch> i haven't tried. =)

A8:51:23 <08Notch> of course :D
A8:51:41 <citricsquid> #25272D would be better
A8:52:24 <Quatroking> pure black with 50% alpha is a half transparant, causing it to appear gray on whatever surface you place it

A9:26:49 <TrueWolves> Multiplayer survival is going to be made of win on some servers
A9:26:50 <citricsquid> then search for minecraft.net

A10:08:56 <gear|stuff> clever
A10:08:58 <08Notch> if I could get the user to enter their screen size and monitor->eye distance, I could make it perfect. :D
A10:09:12 <gear|stuff> could you make a slider
A10:09:13 <08Notch> btw, see the armor pieces on those mobs? ;D
A10:09:15 <gear|stuff> to adjust distance
A10:09:22 <Visiiri> What are the mobs?
A10:09:24 <doohan> I can't see :(
A10:09:27 <Visiiri> What is their functions?

A10:09:48 <doohan> What are you talking about?
A10:09:49 <08Notch> it's really two sliders.. eye separation (based on screen size and real life eye separation) and distance to the monitor
A10:10:06 <Basic> gaah, wurm crashes with both graphic settings
A10:10:14 <gear|stuff> well you could make a calibration screen

A10:37:38 <SteGriff> I fear the natural conclusion of being able to add bits onto your avatar's head.

A10:39:09 <Bob_ross> but i have nightmares cuz of them
A10:39:12 <Bob_ross> they scare me

A10:42:53 <citricsquid> don't focus on the subject and zing, found the "mindfuck" instantly.

A10:43:05 <PuyoDead> personally, I like this one: http://officeofstrategicinfluence.com/upload/camo1.jpg
A10:43:24 <PuyoDead> title pretty much gives it away anyway

A10:46:02 <liq3> ah

A10:46:55 <Hamelin> Hm, maybe it's just  the colors
A10:47:08 <PuyoDead> brown lizard on the left side, it has a sort of arrowhead pattern on its back
A10:47:38 <08Notch> wow, really?

A10:48:02 <ZomBuster> to show its really there
A10:48:06 <Hamelin> anyway, I've got these and the image isn't 3d for me, the shades are different I gues http://www.berezin.com/3D/images/anaaviator.jpg
A10:48:12 <08Notch> oh wow
A10:48:32 <08Notch> there's a lot of compression artifacts in that screenshot
A10:48:44 <08Notch> those glasses are the same type as I have
A10:49:01 <08Notch> and if your monitor sucks (mine does) or your glasses do (mine does too a bit), you get a lot of ghosting
A10:49:11 <Hamelin> reeally? Hmm weird, because I was using the nvidia 3d stuff earlier and while it didn't work great it did work
A10:49:40 <08Notch> it's hard for me to see 3d in that still screenshot as well. the compression adds a lot of crosstalk noise
A10:49:45 <08Notch> and that ruins the depth
A10:50:09 <Hamelin> that could be it.

A11:03:07 <fleshBasedProcessor> works great for me
A11:03:31 <08Notch> C418: What's wrong with it?
A11:03:36 <Siiseli> I tried playing something with 3d glasses
A11:03:38 <08Notch> there's a lot of jpeg compression, but beside that..
A11:03:43 <Siiseli> it didn't really make a difference
A11:03:59 <C418> I'm no expert. but I thought near moving things have a higher difference between blue and red than things that are further away
A11:04:18 <fleshBasedProcessor> are you using blue-red 3d glasses with the blue on the right eye?
A11:04:20 <08Notch> and they do. =)
A11:04:28 <IceFlinger> Notch
A11:04:34 <IceFlinger> I'm looking at your "homepage"
A11:04:40 <C418> but why are the trees so extremely apart?
A11:04:41 <IceFlinger> And I actually played that L4D game you made
A11:04:46 <bob_ross> all those 4k games are so coooool
A11:04:47 <IceFlinger> Before I knew you existed
A11:04:49 <IceFlinger> Awesome
A11:04:59 <08Notch> because they're far apart, C418.
A11:05:14 <08Notch> something infinitely far apart should be the same distance apart on the monitor as your eyes are in real life.

A11:05:32 <PuyoDead> I didn't even notice that... it does look "backwards"
A11:06:08 <fleshBasedProcessor> What I really like is his hexagonal logic CA, but I still can't figure out how to redirect truth values anywhere without creating an interference loop.
A11:06:26 <smn> as in, the players' colors close to the cam are close together, while the trees' colors are further apart
A11:06:32 <smn> which seems.. kinda odd

A11:06:58 <C418> well, I always thought it was the other way around
A11:06:58 <08Notch> if the objects in the game are exactly the same distance away as your monitor is, the colors should match up
A11:07:00 <smn> i have no 3d glass stuff whatsoever so i can
A11:07:01 <C418> let's see
A11:07:03 <smn> not try that
A11:07:07 <08Notch> and close than that, they'll intersect in the other direction

A11:07:38 <IceFlinger> From what I've seen it looks awesome
A11:08:12 <08Notch> C418: That one has the colors reversed from what I used.
A11:08:29 <08Notch> so there probably are several "standards"
A11:08:45 <smn> for 3d view, there are many
A11:08:52 <IceFlinger> Notch, the 3d thing looks cool, but I can't try it.

P12:25:14 <IceFlinger> That when you push it, simulates the water flow in minecraft, and puts water tiles whereever they'll end up once you load the map
P12:25:33 <IceFlinger> so if you put one water tile above the grass in a map
P12:25:37 <IceFlinger> and you push the button
P12:25:44 <osici> uh so flood fill that doesn't go up?
P12:25:51 <osici> yeah i guess
P12:25:52 <IceFlinger> yeah
P12:26:07 <IceFlinger> The same can also be said for grass
P12:26:20 <osici> you could do that now by 2d flood filling the top level, and then 3d flooding underneath
P12:26:20 <IceFlinger> Put grass where it will end up, take it away where it won't survive
P12:26:39 <osici> hmm, will look into that
P12:26:41 <IceFlinger> Yeah, but the use I was thinking of it was checking if you made a mistake
P12:26:47 <IceFlinger> And if water will ruin the map

P2:34:15 <iPope> Cause us premiums need more shit to play with
P2:34:22 <SteGriff> hear hear
P2:34:23 <Adammm> Heeeeeeeeeell yeeeeeeea
P2:34:30 <PuyoDead> will survival testing be for paid users?
P2:34:31 <SteGriff> We premiums!
P2:34:33 <killer> were did the demi come from?
P2:34:37 <iPope> Puyo: yes :D
P2:34:40 <doohan> I am fairly premium
P2:34:45 <IceFlinger> Notch
P2:34:45 <doohan> You can't afford this shit.
P2:34:50 <iPope> how does that work?
P2:34:50 <IceFlinger> Are you there now?
P2:34:51 <SteGriff> Puyodead: premiums get a week of survival preview before it goes public
P2:34:53 <PuyoDead> neat, even more incentive to get people to buy
P2:34:58 <Lmaoboat> demilich is a floating magical skull
P2:35:00 <IceFlinger> I wanna but
P2:35:01 <doohan> A week?
P2:35:01 <08Notch> more than a week
P2:35:05 <doohan> Woo!
P2:35:06 <08Notch> since I'm on indonesia
P2:35:07 <IceFlinger> Just because I know it's gonna turn out awesome
P2:35:09 <PuyoDead> sounds like 3 weeks to me
P2:35:11 <doohan> A week and a day?
P2:35:11 <iPope> I thought we get to test?
P2:35:17 <Visiiri> D:
P2:35:19 <Visiiri> Dammit.
P2:35:19 <IceFlinger> Notch, I had a question
P2:35:19 <08Notch> probably around a month or so. maybe more if there are a lot of bugs. ;)
P2:35:21 <Adammm> Anyone wanna see the death star i made?
P2:35:22 <Visiiri> Nobody cares about me.
P2:35:23 <Adammm> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=eef4214018cd72e439c0746c63e48df8
P2:35:25 <08Notch> shoot
P2:35:26 <PuyoDead> ahh, I see
P2:35:26 <SteGriff> I'm just quoting the blog ;P
P2:35:26 <Visiiri> Nobody will wait for me.
P2:35:35 <Adammm> that's my server w/ the death star lol
P2:35:35 <08Notch> i care about you!
P2:35:36 <Visiiri> Nobody will just give me the shit.
P2:35:36 <IceFlinger> What's gonna happen with the water physics?
P2:35:41 <Visiiri> I have to beat it out of my dad.
P2:35:43 <IceFlinger> What direction are you going with that
P2:35:44 <08Notch> I'm still going to fix it
P2:35:48 <08Notch> I don't know when yet
P2:35:51 <08Notch> before the game is done
P2:35:51 <killer> i dont think there is a demidracolitch

P2:36:13 <IceFlinger> How do you expect it to turn out

P2:36:28 <PuyoDead> that's the "show marker line" under settings
P2:36:28 <Lmaoboat> lines show where you left off
P2:36:32 <Zachariasmith> Vissiri: YOU BROKE MY INTERNETS!
P2:36:35 <Zachariasmith> :P
P2:36:36 <iPope> Or are you releasing finished survival
P2:36:36 <iPope> Notch: After the initial release of survival will you stop working on it?
P2:36:42 <PuyoDead> I'm not if there's a rule behind when it draws, I think it's just for reference
P2:36:48 <SteGriff> Ah, ok
P2:36:49 <08Notch> depends on how fun it is
P2:36:52 <SteGriff> That's kinda useful

P2:38:16 <ONI> I want the mustache
P2:38:18 <PuyoDead> hah
P2:38:23 <08Notch> lol. they will be slow, they will be numerous
P2:38:25 <PuyoDead> that book is magnificent
P2:38:47 <Zachariasmith> ok cool
P2:38:49 <Zachariasmith> Notch: Will you need to eat food to live?
P2:39:01 <osici> will all the game modes by multiplayer and singleplayer?
P2:39:01 <Lmaoboat> Hey notch, have you considered doing the infiniminer type liquid?
P2:39:04 <Zachariasmith> like shrooms?!?
P2:39:11 <ONI> Will we get Guns
P2:39:13 <08Notch> Zachariasmith: Yes, food is the only way to regain health

13P2:39:36 * Zachariasmith agrees
P2:39:39 <08Notch> there's no stamina
P2:39:45 <Lmaoboat> it was it's uses
P2:39:45 <iPope> ONI: It will be fantasy so no guns
P2:39:47 <Zachariasmith> ok
P2:39:57 <iPope> Notch: will we gte cannons and other seige engines
P2:39:57 <08Notch> bows and arrows
P2:40:00 <Haggle> Can there be CROWWBOWS?
P2:40:01 <08Notch> maybe
P2:40:02 <Haggle> woops
P2:40:04 <08Notch> maybe
P2:40:06 <Haggle> I ment crossbows
P2:40:13 <iPope> Lol
P2:40:15 <LKA> crowbars
P2:40:15 <LG_Legacy> I hope there is bows and arrows soon
P2:40:17 <Lmaoboat> mainly since to flows and doesn't explode horizontally 
P2:40:23 <LKA> crowbar crossbows
P2:40:29 <08Notch> I'm planning on keeping the tech tree pretty shallow.
P2:40:30 <IceFlinger> LKA I was just about to say crowbars
P2:40:32 <LKA> we need BOMB ARROWS
P2:40:36 <iPope> I have this epic vision of huge fortress's with cannons and shit
P2:40:39 <LKA> like we're really playing zelda
P2:40:46 <LG_Legacy> Notch, mind?
P2:40:47 <ONI> and Punching Arrows
P2:40:49 <Lmaoboat> but water is just a distraction at this point
P2:40:55 <PuyoDead> that'd be good, I imagine a large one at release would cause a massive influx of "WHAT DO I DO!?"
P2:40:55 <08Notch> what, LG_Legacy?
P2:41:13 <LG_Legacy> Question:
P2:41:31 <LG_Legacy> With this LUA coming, what do you think that the people will end up making as the most popular or creative?
P2:41:52 <08Notch> probably something much more cool than I could ever guess
P2:41:59 <IceFlinger> LUA?
P2:42:02 <LG_Legacy> Yeah
P2:42:02 <SteGriff> Superhero server
P2:42:02 <iPope> Notch how much stuff will you put into survival, like clothing and weapons
P2:42:03 <IceFlinger> Like Garrysmod?
P2:42:03 <LG_Legacy> LUA
10P2:42:10 * Veronika (person@cpe-075-178-087-124.ec.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P2:42:13 <SteGriff> Lua, not LUA
P2:42:16 <PuyoDead> I'm guessing it won't be long before a full on FPS mod hits. quake and/or cs style
P2:42:18 <killer> legacy i think your underestimating lua 
P2:42:20 <08Notch> iPope: Not too much. I want the game to be somple
P2:42:25 <IceFlinger> LUA != Lua?
P2:42:33 <SteGriff> It's not an acronym
P2:42:37 <SteGriff> it's a word
P2:42:37 <IceFlinger> oh
P2:42:39 <iPope> Notch: Okay, will there be survival mod support?
P2:42:42 <fleshBasedProcessor> It means moon in some language
P2:42:47 <08Notch> quite possibly, yes. =)
P2:42:52 <PuyoDead> wouldn't that be luna?
P2:42:53 <Veronika> Oh boy! I can finally ask all the questions I've been dying to ask, now.
P2:42:55 <iPope> UFCKING AWESOME
P2:43:06 <SteGriff> flesh, did you begin to talk to me about brainfuck yesterday?
P2:43:06 <IceFlinger> UFCKING
P2:43:10 <Haggle> Can we have blood and gore? with skull aplosions?
P2:43:16 <fleshBasedProcessor> When Lua support comes out my grades are going to take a hit due to all the mods I'll be making
P2:43:17 <iPope> yeh and you better believe it
P2:43:17 <killer> lua us moon in i think Brazilian 
P2:43:18 <08Notch> no, haggle. =)
P2:43:22 <Haggle> GOD DAMMIT
P2:43:23 <08Notch> I'm going clean and friendly
P2:43:25 <IceFlinger> The best thing to come out of lua and garrysmod is wiremod
P2:43:27 <PuyoDead> that'll probably end up under modding
P2:43:34 <IceFlinger> I'd love so see something like that in Minecraft =O
P2:43:35 <Lmaoboat> make people gib jusst like terrain blocks
P2:43:36 <chrstfer> notch
P2:43:39 <chrstfer> wassup?
P2:43:39 <fleshBasedProcessor> and yes, I was talking about braifuck, it is my 2nd favorite esoteric language
P2:43:47 <iPope> IceFinger: WireBlock, my first project i think
P2:43:49 <08Notch> favorite? Malbolge?

P2:44:27 <08Notch> dinner was awsome, then I played some episode 2, finally got the little man in space achievement
P2:44:29 <iPope> Killer you mean awesome
P2:44:29 <LG_Legacy> Oh great..
P2:44:33 <fleshBasedProcessor> my favorite is befunge.
P2:44:34 <LG_Legacy> I gotta work on a dell laptop again
P2:44:35 <LG_Legacy> :l

P2:44:46 <Haggle> Bob Ross!
P2:44:51 <08Notch> yes, IceFlinger. =D FINALLY
P2:44:52 <IceFlinger> Luck yD=
P2:44:53 <Haggle> Hi.
P2:44:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> I actually designed a processor that would run native brainfuck code
P2:44:58 <killer> ummm
P2:44:59 <08Notch> yes, bob_ross
P2:45:01 <Zachariasmith> i hate that gnome
P2:45:02 <IceFlinger> That's the hardest one by far
P2:45:02 <Zachariasmith> :P
P2:45:06 <iPope> Lol, was it fleshbased
P2:45:06 <Veronika> Really? Tiles that let me make smooth stairs (no jumping) is about the only thing I want. :(
P2:45:07 <bob_ross> do you have steam, notch?
P2:45:10 <IceFlinger> I tried doing the grub one and was off by 3 D=
P2:45:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> but I chickened out because I don't know anything about electrical engineering
P2:45:16 <08Notch> i missed TWO grubs on that run as well :-(
P2:45:17 <iPope> See what i did there :P
P2:45:22 <SteGriff> fleshbasedprocessor: OMG that's you?! I was on your site all day
P2:45:23 <08Notch> I'm never getting that achievement
P2:45:32 <08Notch> no way I'm going through that AGAIN
P2:45:37 <Zachariasmith> lol
P2:45:38 <bob_ross> Notch, you have xbox 360?
P2:45:42 <08Notch> i do
13P2:45:45 * Visiiri slaps bob_ross around a bit with a large trout
P2:45:45 <Lmaoboat> I hate antlions
P2:45:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> no, I don't have any website yet, some one else had that idea too?
P2:45:47 <Visiiri> Dumbass.
13P2:45:47 * IceFlinger facepalm
P2:45:48 <PuyoDead> oh god, little man in space is a rough one
P2:45:52 <08Notch> fleshBasedProcessor: That's insanely awesome. :D
P2:45:53 <iPope> Notch: did you consider other languages for minecraft, like python
P2:45:55 <bob_ross> DUDE! you should add me
P2:46:00 <bob_ross> gamertag: soapycheese
P2:46:03 <bob_ross> spelled as is
P2:46:09 <08Notch> iPope: No, I'm in love with java. =)
13P2:46:10 * IceFlinger facepalm again
P2:46:15 <SteGriff> fleshbasedprocessor: unfortunately, yeah. http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/bfcpu.html
P2:46:19 <iPope> Notch: I meant scripting
P2:46:20 <LG_Legacy> Don't wish me luck Puyo
P2:46:23 <08Notch> I did consider C++ for extra speed, but the applet support convinced me
10P2:46:29 * r4dio (radioactiv@host138-3-dynamic.9-87-r.retail.telecomitalia.it) has joined #minecraft

P2:46:34 <LG_Legacy> A. I don't believe in luck B. Their hard-drive just basically decieded to delete a windows file
P2:46:37 <fleshBasedProcessor> damn, I though I was unique.
13P2:46:38 * SteGriff has the epiphany that he needs to learn Lua. Like, now.
P2:46:38 <08Notch> lua seems to be very popular
P2:46:53 <PuyoDead> it was a simple "I hope you do well", but whatever
P2:46:56 <iPope> I think python is simpler and friendlier, and its got classes :D
P2:46:57 <LG_Legacy> :P
P2:47:00 <PuyoDead> take it how you will
P2:47:00 <r4dio> asdighoj apocalypse is comin
P2:47:01 <LG_Legacy> I don't make things simple
P2:47:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> I should learn lua too, but I already know a couple other langauages so I'm just hoping I'll be able to figure it out.
P2:47:20 <08Notch> bob_ross: My account is locked, I changed my cc details
P2:47:32 <killer> lua is very flexible and easy to figureout 
P2:47:33 <bob_ross> oh
P2:47:35 <iPope> fleshBasedProcessor: Its pretty easy
P2:47:35 <08Notch> yeah, that's my plan too, fleshBasedProcessor. =)
P2:47:39 <bob_ross> what do you mean?
P2:47:43 <bob_ross> can you tell me in PM?
P2:47:52 <PuyoDead> oh crap, my cc changed too... my account is probably the same
P2:47:53 <08Notch> I'd rather talk in here. =)
P2:48:02 <chrstfer> notch, which is coming first, Lua or survival?
P2:48:07 <08Notch> survival
P2:48:08 <Lmaoboat> Notch: what exactly is your goal for survival?
P2:48:09 <iPope> Survival
P2:48:11 <bob_ross> sorry, i have ADD, or maybe not.
P2:48:17 <IceFlinger> Gahhh I hate FTP
P2:48:29 <08Notch> Lmaoboat: I have this weird vision in my head, it's pretty much the same since I played infiniminer and started the project.
13P2:48:30 * PuyoDead eats cheese
P2:48:51 <chrstfer> notch is there gonna be a survival free mode?
P2:48:51 <08Notch> I KNOW it can become an awesome game. Basically, you build stuff and get attacked by really nasty wildlife
P2:49:01 <IceFlinger> Uploading maps to my garrysmod server is always such a pain D=
P2:49:02 <chrstfer> not free to play, but free as in, no goal?
P2:49:16 <08Notch> yes, right now it has no goal at all
13P2:49:16 * bob_ross - The Chuck Norris Of Painting
P2:49:17 <PuyoDead> it sounds interesting already
12P2:49:30 * CheesusChrist (rhhb@159-140.dsl.iskon.hr) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P2:49:32 <08Notch> I've got a feeling it might feel empty without a goal, but we'll see
P2:49:33 <Lmaoboat> A feeling I love in games is when you set up a small  stronghold surround by dangerous enemies
P2:49:34 <chrstfer> is there gonna be a mode to keep it like that?
P2:49:45 <chrstfer> like 3 modes instead of 2
P2:49:48 <08Notch> if there's a goal, it's going to be optional
P2:49:56 <PuyoDead> I think it'll be good to start, at least. to learn how things work out
P2:49:57 <chrstfer> YAY
P2:50:03 <fleshBasedProcessor> chrstfer, Notch doesn't really have plans. If things are fun, they will stay in the game.
P2:50:09 <chrstfer> yay
P2:50:09 <08Notch> i'd love a goal just to see people speedrun it. =)
P2:50:14 <PuyoDead> hah
P2:50:14 <IceFlinger> Also notch I doubt you care much, but after I get my 360, the next thing I buy will be minecraft
P2:50:15 <chrstfer> lol
P2:50:19 <bob_ross> g2g, cut grass and eat food
10P2:50:24 * bob_ross is now known as bob_ross-AFK
P2:50:26 <chrstfer> i love this game
P2:50:31 <08Notch> IceFlinger: I care. =)
P2:50:33 <SteGriff> Notch: As long as _progress and acheivement is rewarded_ there need not be an object to still provide an enjoyable experience, for me.
P2:50:58 <PuyoDead> honestly, one of the things that impressed me the most when first playing this was the movement physics
12P2:51:02 * Cyanide (Mibbit@71-14-180-111.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)

P2:51:06 <PuyoDead> it felt much more natural
P2:51:12 <08Notch> SteGriff: Yeah, but I'm thinking of games like sim city and so. There's progress and constant fun, but after a while there's really no point in playing it
10P2:51:12 * Cyanide (Mibbit@71-14-180-111.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
P2:51:19 <08Notch> and you don't feel compelled to play again from the start either
P2:51:23 <chrstfer> notch, maybe instead of an major goal it could be open ended achievment based game'
P2:51:25 <IceFlinger> also 1365 sales
P2:51:28 <IceFlinger> That's a LOT of money
P2:51:32 <08Notch> but in something like, say, nethack, you lose a LOT
P2:51:39 <08Notch> but you know there's a goal, so you keep playing. and dying.
P2:51:40 <SteGriff> I take your point
P2:51:40 <IceFlinger> I'm jealous notch d=
P2:51:44 <PuyoDead> infiniminer -and- blockland both feel like I'm running on ice, with greased shoes
P2:51:49 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch, can you give me some tips on your hexagonal logic thing. I try and I try but I can't figure out how to redirect truth values without creating an interference loop.
P2:51:53 <08Notch> IceFlinger: Yeah, it's a lot. =)
P2:52:09 <08Notch> fleshBasedProcessor: Redirect? Hold on, lemme build something..
P2:54:16 <fleshBasedProcessor> I wonder if I can create a full adder. Or anything really.
P2:54:26 <Lmaoboat> Notch: just how simple do you mean when you say you're keeping it simple?

P2:55:13 <fleshBasedProcessor> thanks
P2:55:55 <fleshBasedProcessor> this thing is going to take over my day now. Good thing I didn't have any plans anyway
P2:56:04 <08Notch> haha
P2:56:07 <Veronika> So there's no way we can get some stair tiles in the near future? :(
P2:56:12 <08Notch> I built a four bit full adder in it once
P2:56:27 <08Notch> (well, I chained four full adders)
P2:56:33 <fleshBasedProcessor> wireworld was pretty cool too, but the logic gates were just slightly too complicated
P2:56:48 <fleshBasedProcessor> Maybe I'll try to make a clocked 4 bit counter or something

P2:57:06 <08Notch> Veronika: sorry.. I want it too, but I need to make some decisions about how tiles should work
P2:57:18 <08Notch> and I want to wait until survival is more complete before doing that
P2:57:42 <Veronika> Alright. I guess I can wait.
P2:57:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> Are you still considering a databyte like you mused on a long time back, or do you not want to double the map data?
P2:57:53 <iPope> I want mod support, i have awesome visions for a wiremod :D
P2:57:59 <PuyoDead> completely off topic: did anyone else see the perseids meteors last night?
P2:58:02 <08Notch> that's the decision, fleshBasedProcessor. =)
P2:58:06 <08Notch> I could just add new tiles for stairs
P2:58:22 <08Notch> but adding a second byte has a LOT of potential for goodness
P2:58:32 <08Notch> but it also doubles level data size
P2:59:03 <IceFlinger> Oh, I tried tht hex thing
P2:59:10 <IceFlinger> I kinda understood what was going on
P2:59:11 <r4dio> wut
P2:59:12 <fleshBasedProcessor> a data nybl would have some usefullness, if slightly less awesome.

P2:59:21 <IceFlinger> I don't know what I should try doing though.
P2:59:29 <08Notch> you mean four bits?
P2:59:31 <IceFlinger> I just made an inmut go in a loop
P2:59:45 <r4dio> my head is explodin 1111
P3:00:10 <fleshBasedProcessor> isn't that what 4 bits are called
P3:00:21 <Visiiri> Notch, if you're going to have the beards and stuff, you need to double the peoples resolution.
P3:00:30 <08Notch> maybe. I don't think it's very standard.
P3:00:39 <08Notch> Visiiri: No way, pixels = good. =D
P3:00:49 <PuyoDead> that's what I like to hear
P3:00:59 <Visiiri> Yeah, but the glasses looked like shit.
P3:01:02 <08Notch> haha, yes
P3:01:10 <08Notch> the hair looks pretty cool when separated, though
P3:01:11 <PuyoDead> hence: be more creative
P3:01:12 <Veronika> Notch, any plans to open source this, or solicit outside help (while retaining control, of course)?
P3:01:16 <Visiiri> it covered the whole head, because the whole head was only 3 of the glasses D:

P3:01:51 <PuyoDead> heh
P3:01:56 <Visiiri> Although, I'd love goggles.
P3:02:04 <Lmaoboat> Notch: I think you should make it so building bases and cooperation is necessary, via things like a need for "Shelter" and dangerous mobs. Having player build shelter makes it feel like it's you against nature
P3:02:19 <08Notch> yes, Lmaoboat, I agree. =D
P3:02:26 <Zachariasmith> agree'd
P3:02:37 <08Notch> writing that AI is going to be interesting, hehe
P3:02:46 <Zachariasmith> will ther be any player vs player stuff
P3:02:56 <08Notch> it's probably going to degenerate into people realizing that single columns of rock is better than anything else, haha
P3:02:57 <Veronika> Notch: What about 'donation' contributors? I wouldn't mind helping a bit just for some mention in the credits. :)
P3:02:57 <Zachariasmith> like some guys steal resouces from other people
P3:03:01 <08Notch> yes, Zachariasmith. =)
P3:03:05 <Lmaoboat> maybe when you first start, you are forced to find a cave or a basic shalter
P3:03:07 <Zachariasmith> ok cool
P3:03:15 <08Notch> Veronika: I'm having far too much fun. :D
P3:03:21 <PuyoDead> maybe make it so food/resource storage is needed?
P3:03:21 <Lmaoboat> then you start making bigger forts
P3:03:30 <Lmaoboat> with small farms or wells or something
P3:03:31 <Veronika> True. I just want to work on the boring areas like network security.
P3:03:33 <PuyoDead> that way people would have to build forts for storage/to stay alive
P3:03:41 <08Notch> yeah, and if you have to go get wood for arrows, you can't stay sheltered in

P3:52:59 <geekahedron> sigh
P3:53:05 <geekahedron> nothing is hackproof in this game
P3:53:12 <Visiiri> Not yet, at least.
P3:53:16 <geekahedron> unless you double layer it

P3:53:28 <Visiiri> :D
P3:53:33 <geekahedron> but two layers is the range of the sponges anyway
P3:53:37 <geekahedron> which kills the effect
P3:53:45 <Visiiri> Actually, I am trying to talk aera into making me an admin script
P3:53:45 <SteGriff> How did you do it Visiir?
P3:53:55 <Visiiri> There's a method I figured out
P3:54:00 <geekahedron> there are a few ways
P3:54:12 <geekahedron> all have to do with exploiting the clipping
P3:54:13 <Visiiri> I can't reveal my secretes. GRIEFERS will know.
P3:54:20 <Visiiri> *cough* LG *cough*
P3:54:20 <SteGriff> Is true

P3:54:46 <Visiiri> I'm going to talk aera into making me an admin script
P3:54:56 <Visiiri> where being inside OP blocks gets you kicked
P3:55:03 <Visiiri> so they become impassable
P3:55:11 <Visiiri> Simple enough, and he could easily do it.
P3:55:43 <Evil-Ville> Do people still use those terrible spawn jails
P3:55:48 <Visiiri> Yeah.
P3:56:01 <Visiiri> They stop some griefers, at least.
P3:56:12 <Veronika> Only the griefers without hacks.
P3:56:16 <Parthon> the crap ones
P3:56:20 <Visiiri> Witch is "some"
P3:56:21 <killer2329> how are th- ...  never mind i dont want to start this again 
P3:56:23 <geekahedron> depends on the hacks too
P3:59:00 <aera> Visiiri: I don't do admin scripts, only servers :)
P3:59:12 <aera> besides, people could just spawn outside the admin blocks
P3:59:33 <Visiiri> What do you mean?
P3:59:39 <Visiiri> How could they spawn outside it?
P4:00:15 <Visiiri> I've not seen teleporting clients.
P4:00:20 <Evil-Ville> Put a block on your feet and hit respawn maybe
P4:00:59 <Visiiri> Can you build blocks on your feet?
P4:01:02 <Visiiri> I don't think you can.
P4:01:09 <geekahedron> depends on the size of the jail
P4:01:14 <Visiiri> Yeah.
P4:01:16 <geekahedron> if you can jump, you can
P4:01:22 <Visiiri> yeah.
P4:01:26 <Visiiri> But you can't jump in mine.
P4:01:27 <geekahedron> but, if you jump, and you do that
P4:01:38 <Evil-Ville> I am sure there's a hack to do it
P4:01:40 <geekahedron> you just get respawn above the block
P4:01:52 <geekahedron> is the spawn point client side
P4:02:00 <Visiiri> Aera, would you be so kind as to accept this challenge?
P4:02:43 <geekahedron> it's not just about spawn prisons though
P4:02:49 <aera> I'm too busy filling in my tax return ATM
P4:02:59 <geekahedron> what started the conversation was deleting a sponge that's surrounded by admin blocks
P4:03:03 <aera> and while it's possible to make a teleporting client, you're right, I've not seen one
P4:03:03 <geekahedron> and flooding a map

P4:03:19 <Visiiri> I don't know if we can prevent that though.
P4:03:23 <aera> stopping people deleting admin blocks is easier
P4:03:35 <Visiiri> But people can change them to air
P4:03:36 <aera> provided you intercept all the packets :)
P4:03:36 <geekahedron> you don't have to delete the admin block if you can clip through it
P4:03:46 <Visiiri> Yeah.
P4:03:46 <aera> indeed
P4:04:04 <Visiiri> My client you'd just press "Ctrl Z" and it'd turn the admin block to air.
P4:04:07 <aera> even a noclip-stopper wouldn't stop me from making a client that send the blockchange command
P4:04:23 <aera> the only way is to have admin ability for any block type

P4:04:37 <geekahedron> which would be awesome
P4:04:54 <Visiiri> But they'd all have to look at least a little different, no?
P4:04:57 <geekahedron> i'd be happy with admin sponge and glass
P4:05:38 <Visiiri> Aera, you don't have to do it now, or have to do it. I was hoping that it wouldn't be too hard, with your portal
P4:05:43 <Veronika> There just needs to be an admin bit per block to determine if it can be deleted or not.
P4:05:45 <Visiiri> scripts already almost doing it.
P4:06:08 <geekahedron> yeah, that
P4:06:22 <Visiiri> I'm out for a bit.
10P4:06:27 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|CombatArms
P4:07:02 <Veronika> How big (file size) is a map, currently?
P4:07:17 <geekahedron> depends on the size of the map
P4:07:29 <geekahedron> 2-16KB or so
P4:07:52 <Veronika> Really? Why was Notch so worried about file size, then?
P4:08:27 <08Notch> more like 200+ kb..
P4:08:35 <08Notch> or 150kb+
P4:08:38 <08Notch> and that's compressed size
P4:08:50 <geekahedron> i guess my maps aren't very full yet
P4:10:04 <Veronika> So, one bit for admin permission, three bits for block angle, hmm. What else?
P4:10:06 <Super-Dot> Will adding the fabled extra byte to the blocks slow down the game at runtime?
P4:10:17 <Super-Dot> Or will it just make the initial download longer?
P4:10:24 <geekahedron> block angle?
P4:10:34 <Veronika> Block angle. Corner blocks. Roof, slopes, etc.
P4:10:37 <geekahedron> there's not any block angle currently, is there?
P4:10:47 <killer2329> block pos
P4:10:47 <geekahedron> or you're talking about adding that
P4:10:48 <Veronika> No, there's not. But I'm hoping it gets added eventually. :)
P4:11:13 <Super-Dot> Why three bits for block angle?
P4:11:22 <Super-Dot> Updown?
P4:11:34 <Veronika> Hmm. Actually, probably need more than that for all the possible angles.
P4:11:41 <killer2329> pitch yaw roll
P4:11:59 <geekahedron> one bit for full/angled block
P4:12:00 <Veronika> I was just thinking up and down for all four directions. But then there's also vertical angels.
P4:12:08 <killer2329> you would need 9

P4:14:02 <geekahedron> no, four
P4:14:11 <Veronika> 9 BYTES? Only if you're being sloppy about it.
P4:14:11 <killer2329> how 4?

P4:14:58 <killer2329> you cant yes/no threw 3 axis of 360degries

P4:15:15 <Super-Dot> Notch Notch! I has a question
P4:15:25 <geekahedron> as the three direction bits get used only for angled blocks
P4:15:28 <geekahedron> and wasted in full blocks
P4:15:49 <Super-Dot> Hm, I guess he's gone
P4:16:10 <Veronika> Well, it would compress well if there's lots of non-angled blocks in a row.

P4:23:17 <Super-Dot> AllNaturalX said he'd be willing to host such a server
P4:23:19 <Parthon> yah
P4:23:38 <Parthon> I'd have to hack something up quickly for the walls
P4:23:41 <Super-Dot> The whole server would flip upside-down every hour

P4:24:35 <Parthon> you can have upside down water, the problem is that water like that is grief bait
P4:24:47 <Super-Dot> I figure you could turn the water into ore when flipping it upside-down
P4:24:48 <killer2329> and gravity blocks would have interesting effects
P4:24:51 <Zachariasmith> maybe just finitewatter
P4:24:55 <Super-Dot> And back into water when it comes down again
P4:25:10 <Zachariasmith> gravity blocks would be interesting
P4:25:20 <Super-Dot> But the simplest route would be to start off with no water

P4:26:26 <Super-Dot> The problem is that gravity effects don't get fired automatically
P4:26:51 <Super-Dot> I wonder if there's a way to fire them manually without a custom server like JTE's
P4:27:06 <killer2329> add a block and remove it
P4:27:26 <Super-Dot> Yeah, but then you have to add and remove a jillion blocks
P4:27:49 <Super-Dot> How many ore types are there? Three?
P4:27:59 <Zachariasmith> yup
P4:28:00 <killer2329> ya
P4:28:01 <Parthon> three
P4:28:10 <Super-Dot> Then it might be best to convert sand to ore as well
P4:28:14 <Super-Dot> Water, lava, sand

P4:28:57 <Zachariasmith> yeah and roads
P4:29:28 <Super-Dot> Huh, most people I've seen use wood bricks for floors and grey cloth for roads
P4:29:41 <Super-Dot> Or admincrete -_-
P4:30:11 <Zachariasmith> i remember when wood looked like bricks
P4:30:12 <Zachariasmith> :P

P4:30:35 <Zachariasmith> yeah but not as much
P4:30:40 <Super-Dot> Ah, k
P4:30:47 <Parthon> it used to be really bricky
P4:30:54 <Zachariasmith> i had a sweet idea for a game
P4:30:55 <Super-Dot> I think he's trying to shy away from modern-looking things

P5:42:01 <Darkebrz> I JUST DROVE A JET SKI
P5:42:02 <Darkebrz> IT WAS FUN
P5:42:21 <Veronika> ... Anyone else calculate out how much money all the purchases adds up to, yet?
P5:42:35 <Darkebrz> Is it really that hard?
P5:42:43 <Veronika> No, but it's surprising.

P5:42:57 <Evil-Ville> A lot of it goes to taxes
P5:43:02 <Darkebrz> 1369x10=13690
P5:43:07 <Darkebrz> Really not that much
P5:43:34 <Darkebrz> Oops
P5:43:43 <Darkebrz> Its a lot more than that :P
P5:43:45 <Veronika> It's only been out four months or so, correct?
P5:43:48 <Darkebrz> Like 20k
P5:43:48 <osici> For a part time job for a couple of months though its pretty good
P5:44:16 <citricsquid> You need to account for swedish taxes and paypal fees, if you want to work out how much notch gets
P5:44:37 <Veronika> Still, it's nothing to completely disregard. Unless swedish taxes are absolutely outrageous.
P5:44:52 <citricsquid> if you do 1369 X 9.99 (euros) = 13 676.31, then 40% of that is what notch has in his pocket.

P5:45:02 <Razorlance> I'd say it's pretty good part time wage.
P5:45:07 <citricsquid> about 5% for paypal fees, about 55% for swedish taxes
P5:45:41 <Razorlance> 55%? that seems pretty high
P5:45:59 <citricsquid> thats what notch said sweden taxes are, very high :(
P5:46:33 <Veronika> Is the cost of living there lower or something, then?
P5:46:35 <citricsquid> "28.89%-59.09%"
P5:46:38 <citricsquid> according to wikipedia
P5:46:49 <citricsquid> probably depends on how much he earns in total.
P5:47:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> that really sucks
P5:48:35 <Zachariasmith> hmmm... modding hl2 doesnt seem that hard which is good for shark week!
P5:48:36 <Zachariasmith> :D
P5:48:45 <Razorlance> That's a stern tax system. The cost of living must be lower as Veronika says
P5:49:04 <citricsquid> here in the UK it's similar
P5:49:15 <citricsquid> depends on what he earns though, Notch could earn quit a bit considering his real job
P5:49:18 <citricsquid> which could affect it a lot
P5:49:29 <Razorlance> Yeah, but we've only got two bands, 22% and 40%

P5:49:57 <citricsquid> UK is from 0 to 50%
P5:50:02 <citricsquid> I think 50% is over 100k though
P5:50:14 <citricsquid> but we also have NI
P5:50:34 <citricsquid> ...and council tax, not sure if that includes in the 50% rate tho.
P5:50:57 <Razorlance> Yeah, I was only thinking of income tax, I suppose it all adds up.
P5:51:10 <vede> As far as I know taxes here are way, way lower than over there...
P5:51:23 <citricsquid> 40% of income over 37k a year.
