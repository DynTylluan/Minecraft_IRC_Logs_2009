A4:19:25 <Parthon> that sounds like severe lag on the upstream
A4:19:55 <Edur> oh no, no lag "(or my destroys works with some many hours delay)" was just an idea for => <Parthon> that would be why, someone flooded it with water

A5:48:43 <smn> :D
A5:48:50 <Deiz> Duplication of effort
A5:48:53 <Deiz> rsnapshot can do that
A5:49:30 <smn> well well
A5:49:51 <Deiz> Admittedly I haven't used it
A5:49:59 <Parthon> should I show notch that level?
A5:50:12 <smn> but rnsapshot doesn't stop the server, then copy the backup, then start the server again with 1 click, does it! :D
A5:50:29 <citricsquid> notch won't care he's only in it for the money *giggle*
A5:50:32 <smn> !
A5:50:38 <Deiz> Why stop the server, to avoid the data when it's being written?
A5:51:16 <smn> nah, it's required to stop the server in order to replace server_level.dat, isn'tit
A5:51:38 <Parthon> smn: it does that?
A5:51:50 <Deiz> Oh, I thought you meant you stopped it every time you backed up the data
A5:51:59 <Deiz> Yeah, loading data necessitates restart
A5:52:30 <Deiz> Minecraft needs a lot of admin features.
A5:52:41 <Deiz> Loading without restarting is pretty important
A5:52:45 <smn> rightyy
A5:53:02 <citricsquid> Wouldn't load without restart cause problems on clientside?
A5:53:19 <Parthon> yes
A5:53:28 <Deiz> Potentially, anyhow
A5:53:47 <Deiz> Level data isn't propagated fully except on join
A5:54:04 <Deiz> So you might have people with different versions of the level, and the server would only propagate changes
A5:54:09 <Deiz> And you'd end up with a mess.
A5:54:40 <Deiz> Still, making it work shouldn't be hard
A5:54:51 <Deiz> Load level, tell clients to pull a full new copy, done
A5:54:53 <smn> <citricsquid> Wouldn't load without restart cause problems on clientside? <-- nah, i guess the level is in the ram, server_level.dat is only read on server startup
A5:55:04 <smn> afterwards its write-only
A5:55:20 <Deiz> That's a possibility, too
A5:55:25 <smn> that
A5:55:27 <smn> 's why
A5:55:34 <Deiz> The server doesn't necessarily need the level in RAM at present
A5:55:37 <smn> your level is overwritten as soon as you replace the current server_level.dat
A5:55:39 <Deiz> Since everything is clientside
A5:55:49 <Parthon> vdgmprgrmr: are you familiar with the server_level file?
A5:56:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Sort of.
10A5:56:32 * Edur_ (Mister@wrzb-5f75ba24.pool.einsundeins.de) has joined #minecraft
A5:56:33 <vdgmprgrmr> 64x255x255 characters ranging from ASCII 0-18 or somewhere.
A5:56:44 <Parthon> yah
A5:56:55 <Parthon> but how to get it out of and put it back into the .dat file?
A5:57:05 <vdgmprgrmr> No idea.
A5:57:12 <smn> well first unzip it, then edit it, then save it, then gzip it
A5:57:14 <smn> or sth.
A5:57:18 <smn> ^^
A5:57:31 <vdgmprgrmr> I just extracted it with 7-zip and opened the file in the resulting folder with notepad.

A5:57:44 <Parthon> that's not a good idea :P
A5:57:48 <smn> nah, don't use notepad, you need a hexeditor
A5:58:02 <smn> :>
A5:58:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, it had all the proper characters in it.
A5:58:14 <vdgmprgrmr> And even then, I probably wouldn't edit it manually anyway.
A5:59:34 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't have a hexeditor that I know of.
