A4:23:15 <MoDx> Long time no see :D
A4:23:22 <Visiiri> If each kid got no more than a medium lego set, the sleigh is moving 321,300 tons.
A4:23:44 <Visiiri> On land, reindeer can only pull 300 pounds max.
A4:24:03 <asiekierka> haha
A4:24:09 <LKA> Visiiri is the resident Stop Having Fun Guy
A4:24:10 <asiekierka> But below is someone else proving that it IS possible
A4:24:15 <LKA> he's off to go smack children's dreams down
A4:24:17 <Visiiri> That means santa needs 2,143,000 reindeer, increasing the payload to 353,430 tons.
A4:24:25 <Visiiri> lol
A4:24:34 <Visiiri> Hahaha.
A4:24:36 <Visiiri> More math now.
A4:24:46 <asiekierka> Santa would have to Fedex a number of packages ahead of time, since he would not be able to fly into Air Force Bases, or into tower-controlled areas near airports. He's get shot at over certain sections of the Middle East, and the no-fly zones in Iraq, so he'd probably use DHL there. Subtract some more homes. 
A4:25:54 <Visiiri> A craft of 353,000 tons, traveling at 650 miles per second creates an enormus air resistance. This would heat up Mr. Claus like a spaceship entering the atmosphere.
A4:26:03 <aera> hmm, lesson of the day is "don't let lots of people overload your newly-written and still-buggy physics"
A4:26:04 <Visiiri> Conclusion: If there is a santa, he's toast.
A4:26:10 <aera> used up all of my server memory! 
A4:26:29 <asiekierka> Santa's delivery run (speed, payload, etc.): These all suffer from the dubious supposition that there is only one Santa Claus. The name "Santa" is obviously either Spanish or Italian, two ethnic groups which are both overwhelmingly Catholic. The last name Claus suggests a joint German/Italian background. His beginnings, battling the Burgermeister Meisterburger, suggest he grew up in Bavaria (also predominantly Catholic). The Kaiser

A4:31:13 <Visiiri> Watcha doing now?
A4:31:14 <08Notch> yes?
A4:31:17 <08Notch> lol
A4:31:21 <asiekierka> oh, hi Notch
A4:31:26 <Visiiri> I want to know what to expect :D
A4:31:35 <UnknownX> Visiiri seems very interested in what your doing
A4:31:49 <UnknownX> He must be trying to find you
A4:31:55 <Visiiri> >:-D
A4:31:57 <Visiiri> lawl no.
A4:32:01 <UnknownX> Hes going to stalk you
A4:32:02 <Visiiri> I just like this stuff.
A4:32:19 <UnknownX> >:(
A4:32:23 <asiekierka> I know
A4:32:23 <UnknownX> You are
A4:32:32 <Visiiri> I am going to go into buisness in this industry at some point, and knowing the limitations of scripts and codes would be a shear advantage.
A4:32:43 <asiekierka> Visiiri is Santa and he wants to pull off excuses to have anyone not know how he does it!
A4:32:51 <Visiiri> I was talking to Cryzed about his admin scripts yesterday.
A4:33:02 <Visiiri> Quite amazing how people think to do stuff that way...
A4:33:30 <asiekierka> Notch, could you please add colored glass?
A4:33:30 <Visiiri> He worked around the current limitations, while I would have set off to change them.
A4:33:50 <Visiiri> How do you propose he shout do that?
A4:33:55 <Visiiri> *should
A4:33:59 <asiekierka> I only asked him
A4:34:05 <asiekierka> whether he can
A4:34:10 <Visiiri> Ohok.
A4:34:12 <Visiiri> Sorry.
A4:34:13 <UnknownX> Why don't you make colored glass?
A4:34:28 <asiekierka> ...Notch doesn't like people hacking Minecraft
A4:34:29 <asiekierka> lol
A4:34:31 <Visiiri> Because colored glass would change the beyond's color, right?
A4:34:39 <aera> it's probably possible with allocation of new block types and some new textures, but lighting in color... heh
A4:34:47 <Visiiri> Tint it, if you will?
A4:34:53 <asiekierka> Well, i was just thinking of coloring the current glass
A4:34:57 <asiekierka> and making new glass textures
A4:35:03 <UnknownX> Just modify it
A4:35:10 <asiekierka> Modify minecraft?
A4:35:15 <asiekierka> or the terrain.png
A4:35:21 <UnknownX> terrain
A4:35:24 <asiekierka> *AHEM*
A4:35:28 <Visiiri> But is it going to be like looking through a peice of blue plastic?
A4:35:34 <asiekierka> I don't want a different color of glass
A4:35:34 <Visiiri> >.> Forget it.
A4:35:43 <asiekierka> I want colored glass in addition to the normal glass
A4:35:56 <UnknownX> Then change your cloth
A4:36:08 <asiekierka> But then I would be able to see everything from the inside...
A4:36:10 <asiekierka> ...wait...
A4:36:13 <asiekierka> ...that's actually a hack
A4:36:22 <asiekierka> making everything look like glass
A4:36:27 <Visiiri> >.>
A4:36:33 <UnknownX> ...
A4:36:41 <Visiiri> Notch, what sort of image do the blocks get the texture from?
A4:36:51 <MoDx> I once erased all textures from the terrain.png :D

A4:37:14 <MoDx> normal
A4:37:15 <aera> question is, does the engine support the alpha channel properly, though?
A4:37:23 <MoDx> Nope
A4:37:25 <MoDx> I think
A4:37:28 <aera> translucency in 3D is hard...
A4:37:35 <asiekierka> I am considering making my own sandbox game
A4:37:38 <asiekierka> But 1) i'm lazy
A4:37:44 <asiekierka> 2) no programming language "works" for me
A4:37:47 <Visiiri> If it's just a PNG, then you can make it transparent.
A4:37:49 <MoDx> lol
A4:37:52 <asiekierka> 3) see 1) and 2)
A4:37:59 <asiekierka> 4) Didn't check out Python yet though
A4:38:02 <peerkoel> the alpha channel turns to black
A4:38:04 <aera> yay python!
A4:38:05 <Visiiri> It won't turn out very nice.
A4:38:05 <MoDx> Yea
A4:38:07 <aera> ahem
A4:38:08 <MoDx> Tried that
A4:38:10 <peerkoel> at least it does for skin images
A4:38:21 <MoDx> For blocks too
A4:38:47 <MoDx> Anyone knows when Legacy comes online ?
A4:38:55 <asiekierka> I'm still considering a 2D sandbox game but I don't think it would be any fun
A4:39:04 <Visiiri> I'm sure that if you could fetch two textures and make one transparent in JS it would work.
A4:39:04 <asiekierka> Except if there was a simple language to program the 2D objects in
A4:39:15 <asiekierka> Visiiri: Java != JS
A4:39:15 <peerkoel> there already is a nice 2D sand game
A4:39:23 <asiekierka> A 2D multiplayer sandbox
A4:39:30 <asiekierka> as in, online
A4:39:34 <peerkoel> ok
A4:39:36 <peerkoel> dooo iiiiit
A4:39:39 <asiekierka> I was thinking of making it 3D but you can only see 2D
A4:39:47 <asiekierka> You need "passages" to go to different layers

A4:40:08 <Visiiri> Sidescrolling.
A4:40:15 <Visiiri> You can't build anything from top down.
A4:40:22 <asiekierka> er, topdown... not topdown
A4:40:28 <asiekierka> bird eye view i meant
A4:40:30 <asiekierka> like in nethack
A4:40:36 <Visiiri> Ohok.
A4:40:44 <Visiiri> >.<
A4:40:47 <asiekierka> If the birdeye version turns out good
A4:40:51 <asiekierka> I may add a sidescrolling mode
A4:40:52 <Visiiri> I'ma go to sleep now.
A4:40:58 <Visiiri> I'm going to wake up soon.
10A4:41:04 * Visiiri is now known as Visiiri|Sleep
A4:41:05 <aera> I think the sandbox idea only works properly in 3D, personally, you get the feel for buildings then
A4:41:13 <UnknownX> I feel very tired but i dont want to go to sleep
A4:41:36 <asiekierka> aera: Yeah
A4:41:36 <UnknownX> the irc is much more interesting right now
A4:41:42 <asiekierka> But then it would be a cheap ripoff of minecraft
A4:41:47 <asiekierka> Which I _DON'T_ want it to be
A4:41:50 <aera> if minecraft's sandbox mode ever becomes abandoned and unused, I'll write a custom client to go with my custom server, but I'm very happy _not_ to do all that work right now
A4:41:54 <aera> ah, indeed
A4:42:07 <asiekierka> Actually, I wanted to write a custom minecraft client
A4:42:27 <asiekierka> Which could allow skins for users without a purchased copy of minecraft :P
A4:42:39 <aera> yeah, that's really treading on toes
A4:42:47 <UnknownX> That would go against Notch's will
A4:43:18 <aera> still, writing a custom client _and_ server means you're basically rewriting everything, so at least you put some effort in, I guess
A4:43:28 <08Notch> feel free to make clones, that's just cool. =)
A4:43:31 <aera> it becomes more stealing the game idea than stealing the game
A4:43:34 <asiekierka> eh?
A4:43:38 <asiekierka> Sadly I can't grasp OpenGL
A4:43:39 <08Notch> what area said. =)
A4:43:54 <asiekierka> so i can't quite do 3D games
A4:44:01 <aera> heh, I always try, and get bored
A4:44:03 <08Notch> download history on paypal doesn't work at all
10A4:44:05 * utilitas (vyo.rad@gw.i2net.cz) has joined #minecraft
A4:44:08 <08Notch> it always times out
A4:44:09 <Garreett> OpenGL, hggghn
A4:44:13 <aera> paypal is generally sucky
A4:44:33 <asiekierka> yup....
A4:44:37 <asiekierka> I would need a simpler way to do 3D
A4:44:41 <asiekierka> or just go and do 2D
A4:44:42 <UnknownX> But wouldn't that go against what you said in your blog if he made something that gave free users what paid users get?
A4:44:52 <utilitas> hi
A4:44:57 <aera> UnknownX: if you actually bother to put in the hours to write a whole new client...
A4:45:04 <asiekierka> aera: The point being with a custom client, it supports minecraft's protocol
A4:45:14 <aera> well, yes, a common protocol is Good
A4:45:22 <aera> but I imagine the protocol ain't done yet
A4:45:26 <asiekierka> The point is
A4:45:32 <asiekierka> Some blocks wouldn't be supported in minecraft
A4:45:35 <asiekierka> and some won't in my client
A4:45:45 <aera> yup, and there you have the story of divergent standards
A4:45:51 <aera> see: HTML
A4:45:52 <UnknownX> I want to see this finite water
A4:46:11 <aera> UnknownX: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f052712ff7a1f86b59f1b251c81aca25
A4:46:24 <asiekierka> agh
A4:46:25 <asiekierka> no
A4:46:39 <08Notch> yeah, a custom client that gives away what I want to charge for is very much against my will
A4:46:45 <08Notch> however, it probably isn't illegal
A4:46:59 <asiekierka> The point is, it wouldn't be updated as fast as yours
A4:47:04 <aera> indeed not - however, someone investing the time in writing one and giving it away for free when there's a paying userbase? unlikely
A4:47:05 <asiekierka> Change something in the protocol and BAM! doesn't work
A4:47:16 <Garreett> And the whole Minecraft community would hate you if you released it :P
A4:47:21 <asiekierka> Lol
A4:47:27 <08Notch> damnit paypal
A4:47:29 <asiekierka> Why?
A4:47:36 <asiekierka> I wouldn't do survival mode and stuff
A4:47:40 <asiekierka> just stuff related to the sandbox
A4:47:41 <Plinky> Notch will minecraft get a graphics ramp up before release or some graphics options?
A4:47:50 <08Notch> no, the graphics will be this level
A4:48:00 <asiekierka> this simple level?
A4:48:00 <asiekierka> YAY
A4:48:24 <asiekierka> Ugh.... Tried
A4:48:26 <Plinky> :( I want the option of high quality blocks. :P
A4:48:29 <asiekierka> Plinky: I don't
A4:48:35 <asiekierka> I'd like the option of custom block skins though
A4:48:45 <asiekierka> And to have some of them free, some paid
A4:49:07 <asiekierka> I wanted to make an ASCII skin
A4:49:12 <asiekierka> makes minecraft look like ascii chars
A4:49:24 <aera> it'd be nice just to have more block types, using indigo cloth for my water spouts is a bit odd :)

A4:49:42 <08Notch> more block types are definitely coming. =)
A4:49:48 <asiekierka> What about programming blocks
A4:49:51 <asiekierka> blocks which you can program
A4:49:56 <asiekierka> to do something automaJICKly
A4:50:01 <08Notch> yeah, hopefully =D
A4:50:04 <utilitas> every OP realy needs an invulnerable admin block
A4:50:13 <utilitas> that is like glass
A4:50:31 <asiekierka> Notch: are you doing Minecraft alone or do you have help? =)
A4:50:38 <Garreett> I'd like the possibility for any block to be invunerable
A4:50:39 <aera> or better, use the high bit of the block byte to mark it as invulnerable
A4:50:43 <aera> yes, that
A4:50:45 <08Notch> alone, asiekierka
A4:50:47 <asiekierka> oh
A4:50:48 <asiekierka> :/
A4:50:58 <utilitas> Garreett:what about plants? :D
A4:51:25 <asiekierka> also, does any of you know an easy way to program with 3D?
A4:51:31 <Plinky> I
A4:51:36 <asiekierka> what is it
A4:51:46 <asiekierka> Except Game Maker
A4:51:57 <utilitas> and i got a router problem
A4:52:01 <Plinky> Notch, will the game be paid for or will you add sort of bonus stuff to buy?
A4:52:02 <Garreett> Invincible plants of dooooom!
A4:52:09 <utilitas> the guide on the forums with the program and all isn
A4:52:15 <utilitas> isnt working at all
A4:52:24 <Garreett> I'd say XNA was pretty easy for 3D projects, asiekierka
A4:52:27 <08Notch> once you've bought the game, all updates are free. There won't be any micro transactions or any purchaseable ingame upgrades
A4:52:42 <Plinky> There will be a free version right?
A4:52:43 <MoDx> Damn, I want to buy the game...
A4:52:48 <MoDx> I don't have paypal :D
A4:52:51 <UnknownX> What if you make minecraft 2?
A4:52:55 <Plinky> And if so will it have some updates sometimes?
A4:53:02 <UnknownX> You don't need paypal
A4:53:07 <utilitas> alot of people have been asking me if i need to buy the game to host
A4:53:10 <MoDx> I'd like to see limited-paypal version
A4:53:12 <asiekierka> I'm thinking about using XNA for my game
A4:53:15 <08Notch> however, I could imagine selling other things related to minecraft, like a minecraft book or a poster or if those papercraft dolls start to take off, those things
A4:53:20 <MoDx> limited-free*
A4:53:34 <asiekierka> What do you think about using XNA
A4:53:36 <08Notch> If I make a minecraft2, it'll be a very different game
A4:53:47 <peerkoel> eeew, number in name :(
A4:53:53 <Plinky> Notch what about my question? :P
A4:54:00 <utilitas> and im imagining minecraft probably  year later.
A4:54:00 <08Notch> there will be a free version of the game, yes, but it will be limited
A4:54:04 <peerkoel> call it morecraft
A4:54:06 <asiekierka> If I made a custom client, it won't be PC
A4:54:06 <08Notch> lol
A4:54:07 <Plinky> Like how limited?
A4:54:10 <utilitas> pulse spleef and all
A4:54:12 <asiekierka> Maybe Miinecraft for the Wii
A4:54:13 <Plinky> Certain block types?
A4:54:17 <asiekierka> Wii DOES need a minecraft client
A4:54:18 <Garreett> it's alright, the only problem is that you need to use Mono if you're running it on Linux/Mac
A4:54:37 <08Notch> not decided, plinky. I like to have a fairly large free version of the game
A4:54:45 <Plinky> Yeah
A4:54:49 <asiekierka> also, bleargh C#
A4:55:06 <Plinky> Seeing so I won't be able to buy it... I'ld love a huge free version :P
A4:55:07 <Garreett> pff, C# is just C++ with more .Net
A4:55:10 <aera> my personal platform of choice is Python + Panda3D
A4:55:13 <utilitas> after custom blocks there should be empty block slots.
A4:55:20 <aera> but take that with some salt, since I never finished a game
A4:55:21 <utilitas> so we can make our own
A4:55:21 <08Notch> It's very very unlikely that i'd make a minecraft sequel. I'd rather keep updating the core game
A4:55:29 <utilitas> yes
A4:55:34 <aera> how exactly could you make a sequel, anyway? :/
A4:55:36 <08Notch> but I might make spinoffs, like an android or iphone single player version
A4:55:38 <asiekierka> aera: Is it simple?
A4:55:44 <asiekierka> Cuz Python is quite multiplatform
A4:55:51 <peerkoel> iCraft
A4:55:52 <asiekierka> I think there's even a Python port for the Wii
A4:55:55 <aera> asiekierka: no game programming is _simple_, but it's more painless than other ones
A4:56:04 <aera> and they have fantastic tutorials and docs
A4:56:05 <asiekierka> Well, 2D game programming is simple
A4:56:07 <Garreett> Have to make it open-source if you're using Python though
A4:56:14 <aera> no you don't
A4:56:16 <asiekierka> I wanted to do it anyway
A4:56:17 <asiekierka> :P
A4:56:19 <Plinky> But yeah Notch, what I would love to see is block updates (optional) that make the blocks more high quality. :P
A4:56:20 <utilitas> I think minecraft is a legendary game,like Hexcelle
A4:56:29 <utilitas> Hexcelle is in it
A4:56:30 <Garreett> well, unless you use a Python compiler, but what's the sort of speeds you get on them?
A4:56:32 <peerkoel> aren't there any java programmers here?
A4:56:32 <08Notch> you mean higher resolution textures?
A4:56:37 <utilitas> its first steps
A4:56:47 <Plinky> Yeah
A4:56:51 <asiekierka> i'm not a person that wants $$$ for his game :P
A4:57:07 <08Notch> well, that won't fit to well with the style of the other things in the game, like the clouds and the player skins
A4:57:31 <utilitas> being OP'ed +/- 15 times isn't easy
A4:57:36 <asiekierka> Also, I'm thinking how would ASCII work in 3D
A4:57:40 <ez> hi all :)
A4:57:42 <utilitas> :D
A4:57:48 <mezo> notch, you've read "the selfish gene" haven't you?
A4:57:49 <peerkoel> hi ez
A4:57:55 <utilitas> hi
A4:57:56 <08Notch> hey ez
A4:57:59 <Garreett> I saw an article on a 3D Ascii roguelike awhile ago
A4:58:02 <08Notch> I haven't mezo. =)
A4:58:02 <Garreett> I'll see if I can dig it up
A4:58:07 <ez> <3 Notch
A4:58:11 <utilitas> asie and what about your server?
A4:58:18 <08Notch> <#
A4:58:21 <mezo> talks a lot about that smallest piece you mentioned
A4:58:22 <08Notch> er... <3
A4:58:28 <Garreett> ah
A4:58:29 <Plinky> And Notch
A4:58:29 <08Notch> oh cool. =)
A4:58:30 <Garreett> http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=83
A4:58:30 <ez> what about passwords for private servers instead? so they visible but password needed? =)
A4:58:39 <Plinky> Can you bump up the height limit? XD
A4:58:45 <asiekierka> utilitas: duhh
A4:58:50 <08Notch> Plinky: Well, no. :D
A4:58:58 <asiekierka> I'm ATM thinking how to do ASCII 3D the FPS way
A4:58:58 <Visiiri|Sleep> >.> I can't sleep.
10A4:59:02 * Visiiri|Sleep is now known as Visiiri
A4:59:06 <asiekierka> cuz I want to limit myself to 16 colors
A4:59:08 <08Notch> that'd require a largeish rewrite, and I don't think the current limit is too low
A4:59:08 <asiekierka> and 256 chars
A4:59:12 <aera> Garreett: viewable source code != open source
A4:59:15 <utilitas> first we need passworded servers,custom blocks,whispers and admin glass
A4:59:20 <aera> but, you can encrypt it, or "compile" it
A4:59:36 <aera> where compile = bundle the interpreter with the code on the back of it as one exe
A4:59:41 <asiekierka> I could possibly design an object programming language for minecraft :P
A4:59:42 <ez> admin glass is like lowest on the need-list
A4:59:45 <Visiiri> Hmmmm...
10A4:59:47 * ParOut is now known as Parthon
A4:59:50 <Garreett> that'd be pretty easy to break though
A4:59:57 <aera> Garreett: so are jars
A4:59:58 <08Notch> damn, hibernate isn't very easy at all! :-O
A5:00:00 <utilitas> but admin glass is the highest on mine
A5:00:03 <mezo> ooo, dedicated dev day
13A5:00:03 * Visiiri knows a fair bit about the chatting...
A5:00:05 <asiekierka> Programming objects to do stuff isn't as low, right?
A5:00:12 <Plinky> Narh Notch, I just don't like building down to build up XD
A5:00:12 <Garreett> and that's why Java is faaaaaail :P
13A5:00:13 * Visiiri could come up with some chat scripts...
A5:00:21 <ez> utilitas: more important that survival mode? :P
A5:00:33 <utilitas> ofc first survival then all that
A5:00:46 <utilitas> survival is ALWAYS on top
A5:00:47 <asiekierka> Also, I am still preferring a sidescrolling 2D sandbox
A5:00:49 <08Notch> screw this database crap, this is killing me
A5:00:55 <asiekierka> With programmable objects
A5:00:59 <08Notch> first food purchase, then survival mode work instead.
A5:01:04 <asiekierka> You can program them to work like in Super Mario Bros, for example
A5:01:07 <asiekierka> That would be fun
A5:01:07 <08Notch> ez: Are you busy, or can I call you? =D
A5:01:16 <aera> I don't see why you'd want to heavily protect the source code, Garreett
A5:01:18 <ez> why screw the database when u got me? :D
A5:01:21 <Visiiri> Moving blocks would be fun...
A5:01:27 <ez> call me!
A5:01:28 <08Notch> because you're at work
A5:01:32 <aera> people will crack it anyway, and when they do, you're like everyone else
A5:01:34 <ez> having lunch break
A5:01:38 <asiekierka> Visiiri: Yeah
A5:01:42 <ez> yeh ur right lol
A5:01:45 <utilitas> it would be nice if we could import our own music and backround
A5:01:46 <asiekierka> I wanted to help a certain person in doing that... :P
A5:01:55 <asiekierka> utilitas: Music would be too much lag probably IMO
A5:02:00 <asiekierka> But backgrounds could be possible
A5:02:03 <08Notch> I don't mind people playing around with the source code. I mind people distributing changes to it (and it's illegal, too!)
A5:02:05 <utilitas> but backround yes
A5:02:11 <mezo> so what have i missed if i havent played minecraft in a month
A5:02:18 <asiekierka> A lot?
A5:02:19 <08Notch> people will always play around, and why should I stop people from having fun with my game if they've bought it?
A5:02:24 <ez> hi mezo !
A5:02:27 <Visiiri> Actually, music wouldn't make too much lag if we limit the file size and type.
A5:02:28 <mezo> harlo
A5:02:31 <utilitas> im looking on the theme of the week space and im saying it would be 1337 if the backround would be space
A5:02:43 <asiekierka> utilitas: It would be 1337 if you could modify gravity, too
A5:02:47 <asiekierka> So you can float in space
A5:02:51 <utilitas> yes
A5:02:54 <asiekierka> Of course, gravity mods SERVER-SIDE
A5:02:55 <Visiiri> .wav > .mp3
A5:03:02 <mezo> people still making the same counterproductive suggestions i see
A5:03:06 <Garreett> Suppose, but if you're a big business distrubuting a product, you'd want to protect your product's copy protection/CD key licensing from being broken
A5:03:07 <aera> actually, client handles all the physics...
A5:03:13 <08Notch> the new level file format has support for custom sky, fog and cloud colors, btw. :D
A5:03:17 <asiekierka> aera: But as in
A5:03:24 <aera> Garreett: and it will be anyway - there's dedicated groups
A5:03:24 <asiekierka> The client can't change gravity
A5:03:27 <asiekierka> the ops/admins can though
A5:03:32 <Visiiri> Aera, then everyone would have to have the client.
A5:03:37 <08Notch> the gravity intensity could be included in the level file as well
A5:03:37 <Visiiri> He was speaking of server.
A5:03:46 <asiekierka> Notch: What about a custom tileset?
A5:03:54 <aera> I know, I was just saying you'd transmit new gravity settings
A5:03:56 <utilitas> its more like PR2 and incredibots2 in one
A5:03:58 <aera> not simulate it all server-side!
A5:03:58 <08Notch> That's on the backburner, I haven't properly evaluated it yet
A5:04:00 <Garreett> aye, but companies still keep doing it anyway ^^
A5:04:02 <mezo> stop insisting on customizing everything
A5:04:06 <08Notch> I will say custom tilesets are unlikely, though
A5:04:14 <asiekierka> mezo: Well, OK
A5:04:14 <aera> Garreett: indeed - I prefer not to waste my time
A5:04:16 <asiekierka> So designtime!
A5:04:21 <utilitas> we need some ingame minigames too
A5:04:21 <mezo> every server i join is going to have a different eyesore texture set
A5:04:26 <08Notch> and now, I go buy some food and get some fresh air
A5:04:36 <08Notch> (I agree with mezo. Listen to mezo)
A5:04:38 <peerkoel> hmm food
10A5:04:44 * ChJees (Mibbit@85.238.198.172) has joined #minecraft
A5:04:48 <Visiiri> Get a good taste in dark blue and green while you're at it >.>
A5:04:51 <asiekierka> So, should I make my sandbox game 2D (looks good) or 3D (looks worse)
A5:04:56 <ChJees> rawr
A5:04:59 <mezo> people are like children when it comes to customization, always wanting more, needing none
A5:05:02 <mezo> hold fast, notch!
A5:05:06 <Garreett> 2.5D?
A5:05:11 <asiekierka> 2.5D...?
A5:05:18 <utilitas> what about 4D?
A5:05:23 <08Notch> mezo: I'm trying. But look at what CS did for HL..
A5:05:25 <asiekierka> 4D? 4D is 3D+time
A5:05:25 <Garreett> Doom-esque projection is 2.5D
A5:05:26 <Visiiri> Switch between topview and downview!
A5:05:26 <asiekierka> :)
A5:05:35 <utilitas> and 10D?
A5:05:40 <08Notch> lol 10d game
A5:05:41 <aera> I think the key is to give people just enough customisability
A5:05:44 <asiekierka> utilitas: That would require 10^10 computers
A5:05:45 <Garreett> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D
A5:05:46 <utilitas> frpom 10D its infinite
A5:05:48 <mezo> but look at what weapon mods, warcraft mode, price customizing etc did to CS
A5:05:52 <utilitas> from*¨
A5:05:54 <asiekierka> Also, 2.5D could work
12A5:05:55 * MoDx (chatzilla@starget.radionet.ee) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5.1/20090715094852])
A5:05:57 <Plinky> Notch could we have sun positioning in levels too?
A5:05:58 <asiekierka> Basically flat panels
A5:05:58 <Plinky> t:P
A5:06:09 <08Notch> no, the lighting is very simplistic on purpose
A5:06:10 <mezo> we've already talked about this before so i wont get too excited right now
A5:06:15 <utilitas> asie:like in Duke Nukem 3D
A5:06:17 <asiekierka> But I don't quite like the pain of 3D programming
A5:06:22 <asiekierka> also i didn't play either
A5:06:31 <Plinky> Fair enough
A5:06:41 <utilitas> characters are 2D and objects are 3D
A5:06:46 <08Notch> there's a new lighting engine half-written somewhere in the code
A5:06:50 <asiekierka> Well, there wouldn't be any objects
A5:06:54 <asiekierka> And the characters are ASCII
A5:06:57 <utilitas> and 1D games exist
A5:07:00 <mezo> final thought: customization on the level of sandbox -> survival is good, customization in superfluous aesthetics or areas that imbalance gameplay are bad
A5:07:00 <08Notch> supporting stuff like glowing lava and lamps
A5:07:01 <asiekierka> Tetris 1D
A5:07:03 <ChJees> oh Notch is here
A5:07:04 <Plinky> I had another suggestion but they have been suggested already XD
A5:07:07 <aera> Notch: ooh, good
A5:07:08 <08Notch> but it bugged out a LOT with close fog levels
A5:07:12 <aera> heh
A5:07:22 <Plinky> Lighting on = fog off?
A5:07:23 <asiekierka> Remember it's ASCII
A5:07:25 <08Notch> and it got very slow in certain circumstances, like when repetedly opening/closing a deep well
A5:07:26 <asiekierka> everything would be 2D
A5:07:27 <Garreett> Tetris 1D is awesome
A5:07:33 <asiekierka> But you could tile it in 3D blocks
A5:07:38 <mezo> there's wells now?
A5:07:38 <asiekierka> But still, I can't quite do 3D :(
A5:07:44 <mezo> i really should play
A5:07:50 <08Notch> mezo: A 1 dile deep pit, I mean
A5:07:53 <08Notch> *tile
A5:07:55 <mezo> o
A5:07:55 <utilitas> generation blocks would be cool too...
A5:07:59 <08Notch> as in a deep column
A5:08:01 <Plinky> Also Notch, will we have curved edge blocks?
A5:08:08 <mezo> i see
A5:08:10 <Plinky> Or like triangle blocks?
A5:08:12 <08Notch> Plinky: I want oddly shaped blocks, yes
A5:08:19 <Plinky> Sweet :P
A5:08:21 <08Notch> no smooth ones, as I want the blocky feel
A5:08:22 <ChJees> Minecraft totally needs bounce blocks
A5:08:28 <Plinky> Ahh fair enough
A5:08:30 <utilitas> haha
A5:08:32 <Garreett> Triangle blocks would be good for walking up surfaces without having to jump
A5:08:34 <08Notch> but I'm not sure if they're NEEDED for the game or not
A5:08:41 <asiekierka> Nothing is NEEDED
A5:08:43 <Plinky> Will you be adding in things like jump blocks?
A5:08:45 <08Notch> yes, garreett, that's the best reason for adding them
A5:08:47 <asiekierka> Programming objects would be USEFUL though
A5:08:50 <08Notch> no jump blocks, no. =)
A5:08:54 <mezo> you still adamantly against that uhh what was it.. terrain offset thingy
A5:09:04 <mezo> the one that made the game look like an acid trip for a bit
A5:09:07 <utilitas> im imagining the un perfect futuristic castles of custom blocks in the future of minecraft
A5:09:12 <08Notch> Haha. Not as much as I was before
A5:09:16 <Visiiri> Notch, is there anything that I can do to help?
A5:09:18 <asiekierka> I don't think a 2D sidescrolling sandbox would be bad
A5:09:18 <Visiiri> At all?
A5:09:21 <asiekierka> but it would be boring
A5:09:23 <08Notch> I tried enabling it as a secret setting in the client, but it bugged out a lot with water
A5:09:26 <mezo> i still really like it, if it can be done ideally
A5:09:30 <asiekierka> A 3D one would be fun, but it would be boring FOR ME
A5:09:38 <utilitas> hmmm
A5:09:40 <mezo> but i understand the complications i think
A5:09:48 <08Notch> Visiiri: Well, yes, you can encourage people to try the game and report bugs to me. :D
A5:09:56 <ChJees> Notch are you going to make water and liquids work like in Dwarf Fortress?
A5:09:56 <Visiiri> Alright :D
A5:09:57 <asiekierka> Notch: What about me?
A5:10:03 <utilitas> we sure need propeler blocks
A5:10:06 <08Notch> ChJees: Yes, finite water is coming
A5:10:12 <asiekierka> We need to program blocks
A5:10:17 <asiekierka> then Notch will not need to do ANY custom blocks
A5:10:31 <asiekierka> WE would do them
A5:10:36 <Visiiri> First bug: With the client, when someone flies, out of the server upwards and you TP to them it puts you under the map and locks you in place.
A5:10:38 <aera> how do liquids work in dwarf fortress? /me copies
A5:10:38 <Garreett> welll
A5:10:48 <mezo> asiekierka: no
A5:10:49 <Garreett> When finite water comes in, we might be able to make logic gates.
A5:10:53 <08Notch> aera: toady one wrote a great article on it. Google. =D
A5:10:59 <Visiiri> So you need to run an update that makes the client obsolete.
A5:11:09 <asiekierka> Garreett: Finite water?
A5:11:12 <08Notch> i definitely want stuff like pressure plates and levers and doors, so you can make dungeons. :D
A5:11:14 <aera> my current finite water attempts are... sticky
A5:11:18 <mezo> FFFFFFFFFF
13A5:11:23 * mezo is excited again, just like that
A5:11:24 <aera> ahh, DK2 memoeries
A5:11:27 <asiekierka> What IS finite water
A5:11:28 <08Notch> but that's post-release.
A5:11:34 <mezo> dude
A5:11:35 <Plinky> Will there be weapons later on Notch?
A5:11:37 <utilitas> haha yea aera
A5:11:40 <08Notch> yes, in survival mode.
A5:11:42 <ChJees> Aera, the water in DF  follows quite simple rules :P
10A5:11:42 * MoDx (chatzilla@starget.radionet.ee) has joined #minecraft
A5:11:43 <mezo> level design should totally be in release
A5:11:44 <Visiiri> Finite water isn't realistic, but the thing we have now isn't either.
A5:11:53 <utilitas> DK3 will never be this year
13A5:11:54 * Visiiri just came up with an idea...
A5:11:55 <Plinky> Will there be a way to make them?
A5:11:55 <08Notch> mezo: That's feature creep. I'm not going to have that.
A5:11:57 <asiekierka> Well, there is no INfinite water
A5:12:04 <utilitas> bullfrog is dead so no more cool stuff
A5:12:05 <asiekierka> But yeah, I like the idea of logic gates
A5:12:22 <08Notch> but having a big update after release with Dungeon Mode would be nice, wouldn't it? =)
A5:12:23 <utilitas> just infinite water and finite water
A5:12:25 <aera> aha! they have water levels
A5:12:25 <mezo> i guess what i mean is an expansion on sandbox mode, and the ability to "compile" maps to be played in "mode where rules of life apply"
A5:12:32 <ChJees> Teh Notch, will there be dragons ;p?
A5:12:32 <08Notch> all tiles (except, say, wood) would be indestructable
A5:12:35 <aera> with that, my water would definitely be more realistic
A5:12:36 <mezo> not a 3rd 'mode' altogether
A5:12:42 <08Notch> and then you can make dungeons with monsters and loot
A5:12:46 <08Notch> and coop with friends
A5:12:51 <Visiiri> I'm going to post a topic in the forum so I wont be interrupted.
A5:13:00 <aera> ChJees: yes, the rules are as simple as mine, apart from their levels
A5:13:00 <mezo> no lie, dungeon mode is by far the thing i'm most looking forward to
A5:13:01 <asiekierka> mezo: Do it yourself :)
A5:13:01 <utilitas> and be brutaly killed by some mutant frogs
A5:13:03 <Garreett> Mode where the rules of Conway's Game of Life apply? :P
A5:13:11 <aera> and since minecraft has only one kind of water, no levels for me :(
A5:13:17 <mezo> just creating an entire level from scratch, compiling it, and having people try to do whatever it is the level wants them to do
A5:13:24 <08Notch> it'd be survival mode without the ability to destroy walls, plus the new tiles like pressure plates
A5:13:27 <asiekierka> Garreett: Code a custom server for it
A5:13:43 <08Notch> but it's a bit early to talk about it. =)
A5:13:47 <ChJees> Bewbs
A5:13:48 <utilitas> pressure plates > pulse
A5:13:51 <mezo> asiekierka: do what myself exactly?
A5:13:53 <08Notch> I need to focus on survival mode, the original plan
A5:14:05 <Garreett> that'd actually be an interesting level generator
A5:14:05 <mezo> good idea
A5:14:13 <ez> yeh, but so much fun , look forward to that as well, that's what I first thought of when on my first map =)
A5:14:17 <Garreett> Random seed + Conway's Game of Life
A5:14:22 <mezo> same ez
A5:14:22 <asiekierka> mezo: The functions you want
A5:14:25 <utilitas> everybody just should CODE CODE CODE stupid crap till notch releases survival
A5:14:32 <asiekierka> yes
A5:14:33 <08Notch> ok, consider the Dungeon Pack to be an official expansion pack. =)
A5:14:35 <ChJees> lol
A5:14:40 <utilitas> :O
A5:14:42 <ez> wanted others to try out the maze I made lol
A5:14:44 <utilitas> I GONNA SUICIDE
A5:14:45 <mezo> i was always walking around my single player map just envisioning what a place would be for in survival mode
A5:14:47 <08Notch> (for free, sometime after release)
A5:14:48 <ChJees> Im coding a simple collision engine myself ;p
A5:14:53 <mezo> or in "rules of life apply" mode, i should say
A5:14:55 <ez> remember my maze Nothc? =)
A5:14:58 <ez> Notch even
A5:14:58 <08Notch> yes, ez. =)
A5:15:03 <08Notch> it'd make a great dungeon

A5:15:24 <tortele> Hi everyone.

A5:15:32 <utilitas> we still need an anti griefer/hacker system

A5:15:39 <mezo> and oxygen
A5:15:40 <Garreett> I've been thinking of writing a Minecraft map -> HL2 .VMF format
A5:15:52 <Garreett> would be an... interesting experiment, to say the least.
A5:16:05 <asiekierka> Hmm... AAAAGHH
A5:16:10 <asiekierka> Stupid 2D/3D decision
A5:16:20 <Plinky> Well Notch
A5:16:28 <mezo> asiekierka: that wasn't really a function i was talking about
A5:16:29 <Plinky> I'll be expecting alot from the later stuff.
A5:16:31 <utilitas> and did anybody here played hexcelle?it could be a perfect game like this
A5:16:34 <mezo> it was more of like, an entire point of the game
A5:16:34 <Plinky> You better not stuff up XD
A5:16:49 <ChJees> Garreett, don't make a lot  of brushes then ;p
A5:17:23 <Garreett> I won't use brushes, I'll use <insert ominous music> THE CARVE FUNCTION.
A5:17:27 <utilitas> asie: make it 2D and it's done
A5:18:31 <asiekierka> utilitas: But I'm not sure if it will be fun... but nah
A5:18:41 <asiekierka> Replacing the 3rd dimension with the ability to move between maps is good enough

A5:19:46 <DustPox> Shoulda known
A5:19:46 <Visiiri> Wait no- Visiiri
A5:19:46 <DustPox> D:
A5:19:47 <ChJees> Oh well, before nomming on lasagna i will solve a thing in my collision system :3

A5:20:04 <DustPox> So uhm
A5:20:12 <ez> Visiiri, did you search the forums for similar suggestion before you posted that?
A5:20:13 <DustPox> I have some idea's
A5:20:14 <asiekierka> Jane isn't here to help you
A5:20:16 <DustPox> where do I place these?
A5:20:16 <ChJees> When do ZomBuster usually login?
A5:20:19 <asiekierka> DustPox: To my game
A5:20:21 <DustPox> I got ideas for minecraft.
A5:20:32 <asiekierka> ... I don't think Notch has TIME at this time period to accept ideas
A5:20:38 <Visiiri> Go the the forum and look for the "Suggestions" forum.
A5:20:38 <DustPox> That's too bad
A5:20:51 <DustPox> For one, I think triangular cubes would work.
A5:20:57 <DustPox> Like, a sliced square.
A5:21:06 <Visiiri> lol Triangular cubes.
A5:21:07 <DustPox> and.. a greater selectino
A5:21:10 <Visiiri> Notch isn't listening.
A5:21:10 <ez> Please SEARCH the forums for topics already made on what u have to suggest and post in there instead of making new one
A5:21:13 <utilitas> we need a minigame in it too...but that later
A5:21:14 <DustPox> see how we can only select one cube at a time?
A5:21:22 <DustPox> why not have a selection grid
A5:21:25 <mezo> minigame what
A5:21:26 <DustPox> of 9 cubes.
A5:21:36 <Visiiri> Because the game is about humans more than a god power.
A5:21:40 <DustPox> so we can raise/lower the field 9x9x9x9 at a time
A5:21:44 <Visiiri> It's not Sims
A5:21:49 <utilitas> various minigames like tetris

A5:22:29 <Plinky> XD
A5:22:29 <Garreett> WE REQUIRE FOUR DIMENSIONS.

A5:22:54 <utilitas> then
A5:23:00 <Visiiri> Second is horizontal. That's X
A5:23:06 <Visiiri> Third is depth. That's Z.
A5:23:06 <utilitas> this is actualy 4D
A5:23:18 <Visiiri> There is no fourth dimension.
A5:23:23 <utilitas> because without time it wouldn't work
A5:23:25 <ChJees> A dimension into a dimension
A5:23:26 <utilitas> THERE IS
A5:23:30 <Plinky> Fourth is T
A5:23:31 <asiekierka> Yay, my SDL code works
A5:23:31 <utilitas> tine
A5:23:33 <Plinky> Time
A5:23:35 <utilitas> time
A5:23:37 <ChJees> Ewww
A5:23:38 <asiekierka> WE REQUIRE 10D!
A5:23:39 <Garreett> Trine?
A5:23:39 <ChJees> SDL
A5:23:44 <DustPox> But I think it would be truly awesome if there is a selection grid of 9Â² cubes.
A5:23:44 <asiekierka> ChJees: What?
A5:23:53 <asiekierka> What's wrong with SDL?
A5:23:54 <Visiiri> Time isn't a fourth dimension. That wouldn't work.
A5:23:54 <utilitas> WE REQUIRE -1D!
A5:24:00 <ChJees> COMPLEX
A5:24:00 <Visiiri> Time isn't a perspective.
A5:24:02 <asiekierka> utilitas: WE REQUIRE piD!
A5:24:09 <asiekierka> ChJees: SDL is the simplest i've found for freepascal
A5:24:13 <asiekierka> and it's multiplatform
A5:24:15 <ChJees> lol
A5:24:16 <Plinky> This is actually the fourth dimension

A5:24:20 <Plinky> Time*
A5:24:24 <utilitas> yes

A5:25:42 <Plinky> We are
A5:25:45 <Plinky> XD
A5:25:48 <DustPox> what was the command to change your nickname again?
A5:25:57 <utilitas> DustPox:Don't count on it...because wolfram absorbed it

A5:26:33 <DustPox> Apparantly I can't pick my registered nickname
A5:26:35 <utilitas> Time is so relevant/irelevant
A5:26:55 <utilitas> we know what time it is but we don't know what will it do.
A5:26:57 <DustPox> Please stop talking about physics time and dimensions
A5:27:04 <utilitas> WHY?!
A5:27:06 <Visiiri> Please stop complaining.

A5:27:31 <Visiiri> Your opinion on what we should and shouldn't do isn't valued and should stop being mentioned.
A5:27:32 <Plinky> ...
A5:27:42 <DustPox> I bet 99% of you don't know what the shit your talking about.
A5:27:42 <DustPox> Can you think?
A5:27:43 <DustPox> Considering the human brain is made out of atoms and particles
A5:27:52 <Evilgrim> I dont. ^_^
A5:27:52 <DustPox> atoms and particles move in probablistic ways.
A5:28:05 <DustPox> so.. everything we do/say/think is probable
A5:28:06 <utilitas> and atoms and particles are out of pure energy that is out of tought
A5:28:17 <utilitas> :)
A5:28:21 <DustPox> nothing exists out of thought.
A5:28:21 <Plinky> Visiiri
A5:28:29 <utilitas> how can you be sure?
A5:28:29 <Plinky> It depends on the type of space
A5:28:33 <asiekierka> Okay, now I can draw the tilemap
A5:28:43 <DustPox> If something existed out of thought I'd have a an extra penis now.
A5:28:48 <Visiiri> Actually, everything exists out of though. you see, feel, hear, taste, and smell things through your brain.
A5:28:54 <utilitas> space and time is like a human made game
A5:28:59 <Visiiri> Who are we to say that what we "see" is reality?
A5:29:07 <utilitas> it can bug alot or just stop for a while
A5:29:11 <DustPox> No, you simply become aware
A5:29:18 <utilitas> no
A5:29:23 <utilitas> you can't control it
A5:29:35 <utilitas> tought is not what we think in our heads
A5:29:35 <DustPox> Years ago, an idian would simply see the water move

A5:29:41 <DustPox> not the ship that caused it to move
A5:29:43 <utilitas> its the essence of time and space
A5:29:47 <Garreett> Minesweeper is NP complete
A5:29:49 <DustPox> because he doesn't know what a ship is
A5:29:54 <utilitas> its gathers automaticly
A5:29:56 <Garreett> according to that.
A5:30:04 <DustPox> but anyways

A5:55:40 <Visiiri> Close.
A5:55:48 <Visiiri> zombot, DustPox?
A5:55:48 <ZomBot> so, i think of dustpox?
A5:56:05 <Visiiri> Hmmmm...
A5:56:21 <Visiiri> Chickens are feathery lesbians.
A5:56:21 <LKA> zombot, barnacles
A5:56:21 <ZomBot> zombot, what is breaking news: nasa to vede.
A5:56:33 <Visiiri> zombot, dust?
A5:56:33 <ZomBot> zombot, dustpox?
A5:56:39 <Visiiri> >.>
A5:56:46 <Visiiri> I need to have jane do this now.
A5:56:55 <Visiiri> What bot code do you use?
A5:56:59 <ZomBuster> seeborg
A5:57:03 <Visiiri> TY
A5:57:39 <do0han> Notch how possible would a treasure hunt mode be?
A5:58:09 <do0han> You know like you get a clue at certain places about the location of the next clue?
A5:58:25 <do0han> I guess when you get the lue scripting in that should be possible right?
A5:58:38 <asiekierka> So the rendering code is completed
A5:58:58 <ZomBuster> cool gamemode idea
A5:59:18 <ZomBuster> would be kind of hard if the treasure is 1 block
A5:59:20 <Visiiri> It would be fun, but what is the challenge?
A5:59:30 <DustPox> Yo
A5:59:30 <DustPox> I'm here
A5:59:35 <Visiiri> Still?
A5:59:36 <asiekierka> Visiiri: Finding it
A5:59:41 <ZomBuster> in combination with survival maybe
A5:59:42 <asiekierka> I made a simple maze hunt
A5:59:46 <asiekierka> on a map
A5:59:55 <asiekierka> It was fun and the three people that tried it
A5:59:59 <asiekierka> always fell into one of the traps
A6:00:03 <asiekierka> The prize was access to a throne room
A6:00:04 <asiekierka> lol
A6:00:05 <MoDx> What do you think about my forum - http://lots-o-lava.netii.net/index.php
A6:00:06 <aera> do0han: that's possible with current minecraft tech + and a custom server, so I'd say it's possible 
A6:00:15 <Visiiri> Oh. Traps. Anything other than that and the clues?
A6:00:21 <Visiiri> Maybe minigames.
A6:00:27 <Visiiri> SPleef against bots would be good.
A6:00:29 <Visiiri> Challenges.
A6:00:29 <do0han> Well you'd need tro be able to interact with things.
A6:00:36 <Visiiri> The obstical course from hell.

A7:08:46 <Visiiri> Some grass never grows, some takes hours, some takes seconds.

A7:08:48 <tortele> Grass. Grow. Faster.
A7:08:52 <Visiiri> How is it determined?
A7:08:53 <Zuriki> My whole world flooded
A7:08:59 <UnknownX> Growing grass is based on a very advanced algorithim
A7:09:28 <Visiiri> Like what?
A7:09:42 <Visiiri> brb
A7:09:50 <asiekierka> Visiiri: ((rand()+3)*1048576) 1/10 minutes to grow grass

A7:20:02 <08Notch> probably never, do0han
A7:20:04 <Schwerpunk> Massive, underground veins of naturally occurring crack.
A7:20:05 <do0han> Like you can have a portal on a server that transfers you to another one?
A7:20:08 <utilitas> HAHAHA
A7:20:19 <do0han> So you could in theory have giant maps
A7:20:26 <utilitas> go to The Archives
A7:20:26 <Schwerpunk> It makes you unable to stop playing Minecraft.
A7:20:34 <Zuriki> do0han I said that.
A7:20:35 <LKA> are 512x512 maps really not big enough for you people
A7:20:36 <Schwerpunk> So, pretty much the same thing as now.
A7:20:36 <LKA> ._.
A7:21:24 <utilitas> No LKA..WE WANT 10K MAPS!!!!

A8:00:06 <Visiiri> Is there a specail script to determine?
A8:00:06 <UnknownX> Notch is always yellow
A8:00:12 <Visiiri> Ohok.
A8:00:19 <UnknownX> Notch is yellow across every server
A8:00:26 <Visiiri> It's just that "admins.txt" tricked me. <,<
A8:00:34 <aera> Visiiri: my server has multiple levels of admin
A8:00:39 <Visiiri> How do you do that?
A8:00:45 <asiekierka> There should be a "solid-only admin"
A8:00:46 <aera> it's written from the ground up...

A8:28:50 <Compo> NO
A8:28:51 <Quatroking> using HACKS
A8:28:52 <Compo> D:
A8:28:55 <gear|work> its like a term for security blanket

A8:28:58 <Zuriki> Go kick him
A8:29:01 <Ausfriend> kick him in the face\
A8:29:02 <PuyoDead> go delete them

A8:29:10 <Compo> Wait, Notch are hacks actually allowed?
A8:29:12 <gear|work> shut him out from the router
A8:29:13 <Quatroking> I IS NOT HAPPY

A8:29:22 <Compo> for now.
A8:29:24 <Dilt|Eee> compo: allowed?
A8:29:25 <Ausfriend> STOP NINJAING ME
A8:29:26 <Quatroking> hmm
A8:29:28 <08Notch> Compo: Well..
A8:29:28 <Ausfriend> SERIOUSLY
A8:29:31 <PuyoDead> yea, just add a block for him
A8:29:35 <Dilt|Eee> that's a term you need to stop using
A8:29:37 <08Notch> they're not illegal
A8:29:39 <Quatroking> its possible to block him through my router?
A8:29:39 <PuyoDead> or whitelist yourself, heh
A8:29:45 <Dilt|Eee> unless you mean allowed in a computer science standpoint
A8:29:46 <Dilt|Eee> then yes
A8:29:46 <Compo> But you don't like them ?
A8:29:52 <08Notch> but I don't like hacks and will help server admins prevent them as much as I can
A8:29:53 <Dilt|Eee> they are allowed because they are exploits that are not fixed
A8:30:04 <Compo> okay.
A8:30:07 <08Notch> better movement verification code, for example, so you can't fly or wallclip

A8:30:34 <Quatroking> we shall nuke it
A8:30:35 <Zuriki> No distribution
A8:30:35 <08Notch> That's highly not ok, and is illegal to distribute
A8:30:42 <Haggle> I
A8:30:44 <Haggle> I
A8:30:46 <Haggle> dammit
A8:30:47 <Compo> Lol, ok
A8:30:48 <Zuriki> Notch
A8:30:50 <Haggle> I keep hitting enter
A8:30:56 <08Notch> that said, I understand why people use it
A8:31:02 <Zuriki> Btw, it downloads the Jar from your server
A8:31:04 <Zuriki> :3
A8:31:06 <Dilt|Eee> not technically, notch... so long as it was properly made independantly
A8:31:08 <Quatroking> I've recently managed to obtain the client, notch, do you want the file?
A8:31:09 <Eagle> Haggle: I just read it as you studdering.
A8:31:09 <Zuriki> So it stays up to date
A8:31:11 <Zuriki> :P
A8:31:15 <Haggle> I'm so happy what you wrote notch, about dungeons, thats all.
A8:31:20 <Haggle> dammit
A8:31:21 <08Notch> yay haggle
A8:31:22 <Ausfriend> Naughty Quatroking
A8:31:23 <Ausfriend> :P
A8:31:24 <Dilt|Eee> we never agreed to an eula, and something to interact with your server isn't inherently illegal
A8:31:29 <08Notch> Dilt|Eee: It wasn't..
A8:31:30 <Haggle> I forgot to read what I wrote
A8:31:34 <Evilgrim> Yes? XD
A8:31:35 <Quatroking> ausfriend: pretty easy, I asked my little brotehr to mail me the client
A8:31:38 <citricsquid> There's many many clients and hacks floating around :(
A8:31:38 <Quatroking> zomg
A8:31:39 <Dilt|Eee> they reverse engineered your client code?
A8:31:39 <Quatroking> zing
A8:31:41 <Quatroking> and done
A8:31:47 <Ausfriend> It was on google a while ago
A8:31:55 <Compo> ....Thoughts, Anyone ? http://miburl.com/WlE7Wym 
A8:32:02 <Evilgrim> Sorry.. Was still trying to get custom maps working.
A8:32:05 <Evilgrim> Yes Zuriki?
A8:32:21 <Zuriki> You're a buffoon
A8:32:23 <citricsquid> Compo: meh, I don't like having any exclusive admin types, but I guess the idea is good.
A8:32:31 <08Notch> yes, dilt.
A8:32:35 <Zuriki> "It's Gzipped but 16MB in size"
A8:32:36 <Dilt|Eee> well zing
A8:32:42 <Zuriki> Hence forth not Gzipped
A8:32:43 <Dilt|Eee> that's illegal if i ever saw it
A8:32:44 <Quatroking> so notch, you want it? its yours my friend, as long as you have enough rupees
A8:32:51 <Quatroking> but you can get it for free I guess
A8:32:59 <Eagle> I hate it when people want me to look through glass, the glass texture really gets in the way of me seeing. :/
A8:32:59 <Evilgrim> Yeah its working now.
A8:33:01 <08Notch> no, reverse engineering is not illegal
A8:33:05 <08Notch> nor do I think it should be.
A8:33:07 <Dilt|Eee> it is in america
A8:33:09 <Ausfriend> Rupees suck
A8:33:14 <08Notch> Quatroking: No, I don't want it
A8:33:20 <Quatroking> okay

A8:33:26 <Eagle> Quatro: XD
A8:33:32 <08Notch> but thank you =)
A8:33:35 <Quatroking> I only have it for observation purposes :/
A8:33:36 <Compo> Yeah I don't really want any kind of 'prop protection', or more admin blocks, But I do think a transparent admin block is neccessary..
A8:33:43 <Compo> :/
A8:33:45 <Dilt|Eee> uh
A8:33:46 <Quatroking> didn't even try to use it yet
A8:33:49 <Zuriki> I only have it incase my internet dies D:
A8:33:55 <asiekierka> Ok... simple map editing schema is done
A8:33:58 <Quatroking> zuriki is a bad person you see
A8:34:00 <asiekierka> Taking a break from mah pc
A8:34:01 <Dilt|Eee> security through obscurity isn't effective, notch, you should get it and see how it works so you can fix it
A8:34:13 <Zuriki> I don't use it though?
A8:34:16 <PuyoDead> I imagine he knows :P
A8:34:18 <Dilt|Eee> unless you're worried that it's a virus or something
A8:34:20 <Quatroking> still, you're baaaad
A8:34:23 <08Notch> I do know. =)
13A8:34:34 * Dilt|Eee nods then
A8:34:34 <Zuriki> Well Quatroking is... ugly.

A8:34:50 <Quatroking> zuriki: oh no I'm not
A8:34:50 <08Notch> griefing is bad, of course, as that ruins the game for others
A8:34:51 <citricsquid> fun is the enemy.

A8:39:13 <Ausfriend> A dragon got into my fort

A8:39:59 <Ausfriend> You can't trap a dragon, it's like defying gravity

A8:40:14 <Eagle> Make a trapdoor into a lava pit.
A8:40:15 <Dilt|Eee> ", and it comes free with every puchase of Minecraft"
A8:40:20 <08Notch> I call it an expansion pack because I want to actually FINISH the game before I start adding a bunch of features
A8:40:30 <Ausfriend> I had no lava
A8:40:33 <08Notch> I don't want to get stuck in "version 0.9.99.93a" like other games tend to do
A8:40:34 <Ausfriend> i was on an Ice map
A8:40:35 <ZomBuster> so its survival first then that stuff
A8:40:36 <Eagle> Dig down far enough. :P
A8:40:38 <gear|work> you had no lava!?
A8:40:42 <Ausfriend> Nah
A8:40:45 <Ausfriend> i wanted hard mode

A8:41:00 <ZomBuster> carp D:
A8:41:07 <Eagle> Notch, you need to add carp to the final game.
A8:41:09 <tortele> ???
A8:41:16 <Ausfriend> I lost atleast 3 migrations worth of dwarves to carp
A8:41:17 <Quatroking> what steam offer
A8:41:21 <Evilgrim> Heehee. DF.
A8:41:22 <citricsquid> Snowman: nope, I'd buy it if I wasn't poor :( (trackmania right?)
A8:41:25 <Snowman> Trackmania 50% off
A8:41:28 <Zuriki> Isn't a carp a fish
A8:41:31 <Evilgrim> Yup.
A8:41:32 <Ausfriend> Yeah
A8:41:32 <Quatroking> ...so
A8:41:34 <Evilgrim> Evil fish..
A8:41:34 <Zuriki> And not really that big
A8:41:35 <Ausfriend> they're known to kill dragons.
A8:41:39 <Snowman> its an awesome game
A8:41:41 <Quatroking> trackmania forever is cooler
A8:41:43 <ZomBuster> murdere entire fortresses
A8:41:53 <offset> Carp get pretty big
A8:41:56 <Zuriki> Fish = Live in water

A11:06:48 <Maveric> How'd you go about makingf your own one?
A11:07:06 <Suffragium> Really, what is the difference between .org, .com and .net?
A11:07:06 <Suffragium> :o
A11:07:22 <AlexVMiner> .org is an organization

A11:07:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wait, what?
A11:07:38 <asiekierka> My game's progressing

A11:07:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm a bit confused
A11:07:47 <Maveric> No
A11:07:53 <Suffragium> Com is prob community
A11:07:53 <Suffragium> But
A11:07:57 <Suffragium> What is the difference?
A11:07:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> com is company
A11:08:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> org is organization
A11:08:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> net is network
A11:08:04 <Suffragium> I mean, all sites are the same
A11:08:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> biz is business
A11:08:06 <Maveric> I was just thinking
A11:08:15 <PuyoDead> .xxx is failed
A11:08:21 <Maveric> is things ending in .au is for australia
A11:08:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Actually, com is commercial
A11:08:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A11:08:30 <Maveric> trhey made it somehow.. was wondering how you go about making one
A11:08:35 <PuyoDead> also, gov
A11:08:38 <Maveric> I want to have .glom
A11:08:40 <Suffragium> Whatever, what is the difference between them?
A11:08:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> none
A11:08:51 <Suffragium> Expect the names
A11:08:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some domains are restricted, eg gov and edu

A11:48:07 <Quatroking> It feels a bit like stealing to me, I don't even have an own copy of it

A11:51:00 <08Notch> that's coming, UncleBibby. =)
A11:51:05 <UncleBibby> neato

A11:51:17 <Darkebrz> Notch, theres so much stuff that you seem to have planned
A11:51:28 <08Notch> yes =)
A11:51:28 <Katnipz> he is god :O
A11:51:37 <08Notch> I usually develop games pretty fast
A11:51:37 <Darkebrz> What are you working on mainly right now?
A11:51:40 <Katnipz> *bow*
A11:51:41 <asiekierka> I'm making my own 2D sandbox game ATM
A11:51:46 <UncleBibby> he is goddess probably
A11:51:56 <08Notch> I've lost a bit of speed over the last three weeks, but I'm getting back up to speed now. =)
A11:52:07 <Suffragium> Notch, is there a possibility that admins can create admin blocks out of every block?
A11:52:07 <Katnipz> yay
A11:52:14 <08Notch> right now, it's the inventory and resource management in survival mode
A11:52:20 <08Notch> no, Suffragium
A11:52:20 <Suffragium> Like yellow and wood admins blocks
A11:52:24 <Suffragium> alright
A11:52:49 <UncleBibby> Notch, is sweden awesome?
A11:52:52 <Suffragium> true, admins could probably go berzerk
A11:52:57 <Katnipz> maby a thing that lets you put a reason for a ban
A11:52:57 <08Notch> yes, I think it is.
A11:52:58 <Suffragium> but it could prevent griefers
A11:53:05 <mooogle> notch, will survival be treater more of a FPS or an RPG? maybe a mixture of both?
A11:53:06 <Katnipz>  /kick
A11:53:06 <asiekierka> Hmm
A11:53:09 <asiekierka> Stupid SDL mouse
A11:53:11 <Suffragium> With admins I mean OPs btw

A11:53:14 <Viter> http://i26.tinypic.com/2rca8zp.jpg
A11:53:18 <08Notch> a mixture, mooogle. It'll be pretty laid back
A11:53:24 <mooogle> thats good :)
A11:53:26 <08Notch> well, and difficult, hehe
A11:53:43 <08Notch> i like difficult games. Ideally it should be fun enough that you don't mind losing
A11:53:46 <Suffragium> Im happy that it will be difficult
A11:53:48 <08Notch> (see nethack, mega man)
A11:53:58 <mooogle> haha megaman 6 for life <3
A11:54:00 <UncleBibby> I like megaman
A11:54:01 <mooogle> and megaman 2
A11:54:03 <Suffragium> Megaman ftw
A11:54:03 <vede> I never liked losing in megaman.
A11:54:05 <Viter> i get http://i26.tinypic.com/2rca8zp.jpg when i try to launch the server program, i updated java and .net framework, ran it as admin, and NONE if it works (I'm on windows 7 64 bit)
A11:54:06 <vede> Not one bit.
A11:54:07 <Katnipz> will you have to eat in survivale?
A11:54:15 <Katnipz> or drink
A11:54:16 <08Notch> yes, food is the only way to regain health
A11:54:20 <08Notch> no drinking needed
A11:54:24 <Katnipz> kay
A11:54:25 <UncleBibby> cool
A11:54:35 <Suffragium> Will you get fatigue which can be regained by sleeping?
A11:54:40 <08Notch> eating food = instant health regain
A11:54:50 <08Notch> no sleeping needed, but I like the idea of furniture
A11:54:54 <Suffragium> Yeah
A11:54:59 <Viter> any help? :/
A11:55:04 <Suffragium> Cooking food n' stuff
A11:55:07 <Katnipz> :| the blocks are to big to make furniture
A11:55:08 <vede> I never LIKED Nethack, but I liked Rogue, and dying in Rogue I didn't mind.
A11:55:08 <Nalok> Furniture yes
A11:55:13 <Nalok> and fire
A11:55:15 <Suffragium> Regaining health faster or something

A11:56:23 <mooogle> aphex twin, octopus project, mstrkrft, and back moth super rainbow are my favorites :3
A11:56:24 <Viter> any help... (and i bought the game btw <.<)
A11:56:43 <UncleBibby> I love how easy it is to edit skins
A11:56:52 <Suffragium> Yeah
A11:56:54 <Suffragium> Its awesome
A11:56:55 <Katnipz> agh the forums are down still :[ can  someone send me a link to that level genirator?
A11:56:57 <peerkoel> unfortunately, buying the game does not entitle you to more tech help
A11:57:03 <asiekierka> It should
A11:57:06 <Suffragium> But, there should be a feature which allows 3d skin editing :)
A11:57:06 <Viter> yeah sadly
A11:57:08 <Suffragium> would be awesome
A11:57:20 <Suffragium> might be hard to make something like that tho

A11:57:47 <Miclee> I just wish that we could increase the resolution of our skins.
A11:57:47 <Quatroking> for example, hats

A11:57:52 <Quatroking> boots

P3:07:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> aera's server?
P3:07:05 <MANCHiLD> Nevermind where, I'm asking.
P3:07:10 <citricsquid> for what purpose would you need mac os x server? o.0
P3:07:13 <MANCHiLD> Its not touching any code.
P3:07:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Hell if I know citricsquid 
P3:07:20 <MANCHiLD> Just displaying said code differently.
P3:07:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Mac OS X is solid, BSD based, and easy to configure
P3:07:28 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: is it for the apple fags? :D
P3:07:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> MANCHiLD, all the other hacks work in the same way
P3:07:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch still don't like them
P3:07:55 <MANCHiLD> So changing font colour is a negative?
P3:07:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, it does have a lot of advantages, maybe if it was $200 it would be fine....
P3:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes I think soo
P3:08:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> so*
P3:08:30 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: I've always thought linux to be the best, what sort of stuff would you use os x for?

P4:58:32 <citricsquid> oh, your nick should have been oped?

P4:58:45 <citricsquid> if that's what you mean.

P5:00:11 <doohan> It's ok, I think it's something either notch or c418 have to ask chanserv to do

P5:00:51 <citricsquid> doohan: Your nick has been oped, so when you connect and identify it should op you fine. Try logging back in and identifying... It works fine for me.

P5:32:09 <fleshBasedProcessor> What Notch did today is far from being survival mode, but even that would make role play servers 20 times better.
