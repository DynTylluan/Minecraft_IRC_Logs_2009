A12:12:37 <mail2345> bit of an insight
A12:12:44 <mail2345> I was remenided of a quote
A12:12:49 <anon_amazing> is there a way to reset the map without deleting the map file maually
A12:12:59 <mail2345> from somewhere regarding the number of planetes
A12:13:08 <mail2345> something on the lines of
A12:13:24 <mail2345> "every man can have his own heaven, or his own hell"
A12:13:31 <mail2345> from aera's server
A12:14:05 <anon_amazing> is there a way?
A12:14:18 <Quatroking> heh, I'm so goddamn cruel.
A12:14:36 <mail2345> ?
A12:14:39 <mail2345> and
A12:14:43 <mail2345> go rename the file
A12:14:47 <LG_Legacy> Yep
A12:14:50 <mail2345> but from ingame
A12:14:51 <Quatroking> I'm drawing a picture of a dead woman, with a crying child next to it
A12:14:55 <mail2345> just restart fast.
A12:14:56 <LG_Legacy> Oh wait
A12:14:57 <LG_Legacy> Wait
A12:15:04 <LG_Legacy> I think he means reset his current map
A12:15:18 <LG_Legacy> If you want it to back to where it was in the first place, you need a backup or orignal file.
A12:15:25 <anon_amazing> no
A12:15:26 <LG_Legacy> Either that or lots of griefing
A12:15:30 <anon_amazing> i just want it to regenerate a new one
A12:15:33 <LG_Legacy> Oh
A12:15:37 <LG_Legacy> Then rename server_level
A12:15:40 <LG_Legacy> To anything
A12:15:45 <anon_amazing> so it has to be done manually
A12:15:47 <LG_Legacy> As long as it isn't server_level.dat you're fine.
A12:15:50 <anon_amazing> theres no / command?
A12:15:54 <LG_Legacy> Nope..
A12:15:57 <anon_amazing> damnit
A12:16:01 <LG_Legacy> Dedi?
A12:16:05 <anon_amazing> yeah
A12:16:10 <LG_Legacy> FTP Rename it
A12:16:10 <anon_amazing> my friend is hosting it
A12:16:15 <anon_amazing> and i dont have access to it
A12:16:28 <LG_Legacy> Quick Fix for Access problems: Hamachi + Remote Desktop
A12:16:28 <mail2345> err
A12:16:38 <mail2345> sheel access works fine
A12:16:39 <LG_Legacy> Works better than team viewer on some occassions.
A12:16:44 <LG_Legacy> 'some'
A12:16:45 <mail2345> or pay JTE for his godly server
A12:16:50 <LG_Legacy> Heh
A12:17:00 <mail2345> which has /load
A12:17:08 <mail2345> along with alot of epicness

A1:25:52 <LG_Legacy> Internal/Router ip's can change, are you sure the Dos/Cmd prompt ip matches your router in the port-forward config?

A1:28:48 <LG_Legacy> From my view: I don't care, or give a shit. Male or not. The topic should be dropped because we shouldn't care about this issue/matter. If zuriki is male or not, it's the person who makes them the person they are, not a gender. It's not a thing to worry about.

A1:29:14 <Quatroking> RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!
A1:29:17 <Plinky> Looks sick.
A1:29:31 <Plinky> And I agree. Quatroworld is addictive XD
A1:29:32 <UnknownX> LG your defending Zuriki so you must care
A1:29:32 <LG_Legacy> Hm interesting.
A1:29:39 <Quatroking> by the way guys, derrek #11 is coming tomorrow
A1:29:48 <LG_Legacy> No connection..
A1:29:49 <smn> resistance, as in, the game, really IS futile.
A1:29:50 <JP89> I figured it may have been from not updating java, but why not act until now is just weird.  So I did update my java, but that obviously made no difference.
A1:29:58 <Quatroking> I just made it but I'm too lazy to throw it online today
A1:30:06 <LG_Legacy> Something prevents us from joining, some program/hardware.
A1:30:31 <Plinky> Quatroking: You already have #11
A1:30:31 <LG_Legacy> There may be a extra setting on in your Router, or the ports are opened twice (Excluding two protocolls.)
A1:30:37 <Plinky> Don't you mean #12?
A1:30:47 <LG_Legacy> Plinky, don't correct quatro :(
A1:30:49 <JP89> Something... I was on my server just building stuff when it happened, so I didn't monkey with any settings.
A1:30:54 <Quatroking> oh, yeah
A1:30:58 <Quatroking> #12
A1:31:10 <LG_Legacy> Weird.
A1:31:24 <Plinky> It better be good.
A1:31:25 <Plinky> XD
A1:31:35 <LG_Legacy> Something still blocks it, check all firewalls/anti-virus/spyware and check the router one final time in all settings, if you have to re-port forward.
A1:31:40 <Marach> umm  wtf?
A1:31:47 <JP89> Ok.
A1:31:52 <LG_Legacy> What Marach?
A1:32:02 <Marach> nvm xD
A1:32:19 <JP89> Will re-doing the port forwarding have any side-effects?
A1:32:28 <smn> ladies and gentlemen: warld of worcraft.
A1:32:39 <Marach> i ported a ruguelike game to psp now im too lazy to release it yaawn
A1:32:43 <LG_Legacy> Re-enabling them may re-open them again.
A1:32:57 <LG_Legacy> They might be closed for some off-the wall reason.
A1:33:03 <Plinky> Quatro, sue Darke
A1:33:06 <JP89> Ok.  Well I'll go through everything.  Brb.
A1:33:17 <Plinky> His comics have sme of the same lines as you
A1:33:20 <LG_Legacy> Crack pot theory: Your router silently reset itself, and the internal ip changed and you don't know it.
A1:33:21 <Plinky> youes*
A1:33:23 <Plinky> yours*
A1:33:52 <LG_Legacy> Your comics*
A1:34:49 <Quatroking> yeah yeah

A1:35:28 <LG_Legacy> ?
A1:35:34 <Plinky> Quatro, better be good then.
A1:36:22 <JP89> No, if it had reset itself, then the current password I have set shouldn't have let me onto the router settings.
A1:37:36 <LG_Legacy> Thats why i say Crackpot theory
A1:39:03 <Plinky> Yay for writing side quests for a game.

A3:10:56 <TD|Blah> I can, I suppose.
A3:10:59 <LG_Legacy> Ah don't worry about it.
A3:11:00 <Cameron> I already gave him the easy steps.
A3:11:05 <Cameron> Just connect directly to your modem.

A3:14:43 <Cameron> Isn't is already released?
A3:14:49 <amongothers> i mean non-alpha
A3:14:52 <amongothers> full production
A3:14:57 <Cameron> When it gets released.
A3:14:59 <God_of_death> im running cable to the modem to my computer if that helps
A3:15:18 <amongothers> i will hope so
A3:15:24 <amongothers> thinking about buying it
A3:15:31 <amongothers> any perks
A3:15:42 <amongothers> or ?
A3:15:46 <amongothers> "?"
A3:15:49 <amongothers> typo
A3:16:12 <amongothers> or is it just the ability to choose a skin
A3:16:29 <Cameron> Just a skin.
A3:16:40 <Cameron> Worst 10 euros I've spent so far.
A3:16:44 <Cameron> :\
A3:16:46 <Super-Dot> There will be more perks down the line
A3:16:53 <Super-Dot> Skin is the only current perk, though
A3:17:00 <amongothers> but it is half off for when the real deal comes out
A3:17:02 <Cameron> Some skins are kickin rad though.
A3:17:04 <amongothers> that's a plus
A3:17:11 <Super-Dot> My skin is kickin' rad
A3:17:16 <amongothers> do you get access to source code if you buy?
A3:17:17 <Cameron> No, its not.
A3:17:31 <amongothers> or is there anyone to make additions
A3:17:33 <amongothers> or mods
A3:17:35 <God_of_death> and im left in the dust....
A3:17:40 <Cameron> That you are.
A3:17:52 <TD|Blah> God_of_death: Check your channel tabs.
A3:18:23 <amongothers> whatever
A3:18:29 <Super-Dot> amongothers, Lua scripting will allow you to make your own game modes it seems
A3:18:38 <amongothers> really?
A3:18:42 <amongothers> how does that work
A3:18:52 <Cameron> Go learn how to code lua first.
A3:18:55 <Super-Dot> Not sure, there aren't any details yet
A3:19:09 <amongothers> so that isn't something people are working on now
A3:19:16 <Super-Dot> Nope
A3:19:29 <Parthon> Cameron: dang, and I thought I got good value for being able to support the development of a game I really enjoy playing :S
A3:19:33 <amongothers> i'm guessing notch (if i am referencing him correctly) is the only developer
A3:19:35 <Super-Dot> Right now, the best way to mod is to rewrite the server from scratch and mod that
A3:19:43 <Parthon> but all you got was a custom skin .. that sucks
A3:19:44 <Super-Dot> He's the only developer, yeah
A3:19:54 <amongothers> good point parthon
A3:19:59 <amongothers> i forgot about that
A3:20:10 <Super-Dot> Notch is a cool cat
A3:20:12 <Cameron> The funny thing is, its incredibly boring now from lack of updates.
A3:20:16 <amongothers> That really is one of the most important parts of it
A3:20:38 <Parthon> the next update will be a huge one
A3:20:38 <amongothers> were updates more common before?
A3:20:44 <Cameron> Yes
A3:20:47 <Super-Dot> It's quiet right now because he's working on a whole new game mode
A3:20:48 <Parthon> like once every 3 days
A3:20:58 <amongothers> how old is it again
A3:21:07 <Parthon> may
A3:21:07 <amongothers> at least since it was remotely useable online
A3:21:14 <Parthon> oh, june
A3:21:14 <amongothers> fun
A3:21:18 <Super-Dot> Right now, the most interesting new things are custom servers and skins
A3:22:05 <amongothers> you have to set up your own server to modify i'm guessing
A3:22:13 <amongothers> can't do it in single player
A3:22:30 <amongothers> I'm not in a position to set up port forwarding
A3:22:33 <amongothers> sucks, really
A3:23:39 <amongothers> whatever

A4:31:39 <JoeyJo0> lol
A4:31:53 <JoeyJo0> aera
A4:31:58 <venn177> Notch, but ^ and & are supported through the console, just cannot be typed in-game.

A4:32:10 <08Notch> oh, they can't?
A4:32:15 <venn177> No
A4:32:17 <08Notch> then it's probably a problem with the lwjgl inputs
A4:32:21 <aera> well, & because it's a colour-code, perhaps?
A4:32:24 <Plinky> I can't run a 512 cube on any server if it is really detailed.
A4:32:38 <JoeyJo0> Another guy and I are working on a server software which allows you to place a special map daemon on a machine with loads of RAM, and the server which handles the clients on a VPS with a huge bandwidth.
A4:32:38 <aera> ahh, limit to loading the map format, then
A4:32:41 <08Notch> about memory usage for the levels:
A4:32:51 <08Notch> it's more than just the uncompressed data, it's the polygon data as well
A4:33:04 <aera> JoeyJo0: well, I have a server that uses the same RAM amount no matter the level size
A4:33:06 <vede> Troo.
A4:33:22 <08Notch> and polygon data can take up a lot more than just the map data
A4:33:28 <JoeyJo0> Even if you add more worlds?
A4:33:29 <venn177> Hmm...
A4:33:38 <08Notch> it would be possible to make it only render the nearest area, but that's outside the scope of this game
A4:33:42 <Plinky> Notch, can we atleast have a larger file size allowance sometime?
A4:33:47 <08Notch> but it would make for an interesting game engine
A4:34:09 <08Notch> i don't remember adding a max file size, so I'm guessing it's a bug
A4:34:16 <08Notch> what happens when the file is too big?
A4:34:20 <JoeyJo0> It doesn't work
A4:34:24 <venn177> Any chance you throw in a couple new admin commands: Mute and one that teleports someone to you
A4:34:24 <Plinky> Crashes the browser.
A4:34:25 <JoeyJo0> It just crashes
A4:34:26 <08Notch> how doesn't it work?

A4:34:40 <LG_Legacy> Half of the time:
A4:34:43 <08Notch> ok, so it's probably a memory issue..
A4:34:44 <LG_Legacy> Java won't load
A4:34:49 <aera> issue with the java unserializer, perhaps?
A4:34:50 <LG_Legacy> Or it gives you an error in the console
A4:34:57 <08Notch> what error, LG_Legacy?
A4:35:09 <LG_Legacy> Unsure. But i believe memory errors are related to uh..
A4:35:11 <LG_Legacy> -checks faw-
A4:35:13 <venn177> And because I love asking questions, will you ever fix the spawn "glitch"?
A4:35:23 <08Notch> which glitch do you mean?
A4:35:25 <JoeyJo0> There's a spawn glitch?
A4:35:29 <LG_Legacy> Yes there is
A4:35:31 <venn177> where you set your spawn somewhere
A4:35:33 <LG_Legacy> You respawn in two set blocks
A4:35:33 <venn177> put blocks on it
A4:35:36 <venn177> and it puts you on top of it
A4:35:42 <08Notch> that's intentional
A4:35:43 <JoeyJo0> How is that a glitch?
A4:35:51 <venn177> Hence why I put it in quotes
A4:35:59 <LG_Legacy> Afaik: Ram issue = Buffer.overflow
A4:36:05 <vede> Uh, so why fix it if it isn't broken, yeah?
A4:36:09 <venn177> everyone uses it to get out of spawncages/into places people don't want them
A4:36:20 <Plinky> Venn
A4:36:28 <vede> A good spawn prison can't be spawned out of.
A4:36:30 <Plinky> Make the soawn jail doule layered
A4:36:39 <venn177> I do, but I still hear bitching from my OPs all day
A4:36:42 <Plinky> With an empty room at the top
A4:36:47 <Plinky> double*
A4:36:52 <JoeyJo0> venn: Hackers can escape too.
A4:36:52 <Plinky> I'm one of your ops LD
A4:36:54 <Plinky> :D*
A4:37:05 <venn177> Of everything, though, my two biggest wishes are a "teleport to me" command and "mute"
A4:37:12 <LG_Legacy> Hm..
A4:37:17 <LG_Legacy> I just hatched an idea
A4:37:28 <LG_Legacy> Notch should develop a 'Suggestion box' <_<
A4:37:34 <Plinky> Haha
A4:37:47 <venn177> Isn't that what the IRC is?
A4:37:47 <venn177> :D
A4:37:51 <vede> That would be... the forum section for suggestions...
A4:38:04 <LG_Legacy> A box in which he may check, delete, read messages.
A4:38:08 <LG_Legacy> Or you know
A4:38:09 <LG_Legacy> Email
A4:38:20 <LG_Legacy> It rules out so many things
A4:38:21 <Plinky> What about a weekly radio show where Notch answers questions sent in through IRC pms?
A4:38:26 <08Notch> haha
A4:38:30 <JoeyJo0> lol
A4:38:30 <venn177> Oh God
A4:38:33 <LG_Legacy> Heh..
A4:38:33 <venn177> that would be hilarious
A4:38:38 <JoeyJo0> "ASK NOTCH!"

A4:43:21 <venn177> Oh, Notch, why does Minecraft have the fisheye thing going on?
A4:43:28 <venn177> I've always noticed, always wondered, finally have a chance to ask.
A4:43:55 <08Notch> it pulls the camera back like 0.2 meters
A4:44:06 <vede> Yeah I noticed that before.
A4:44:09 <venn177> Yeah, but WHY? The whole fisheye thing seems a tad pointless.
A4:44:11 <vede> Why does it do that?
A4:44:12 <08Notch> it's to add parallax when looking around
A4:44:19 <LG_Legacy> Hm... interesting.
A4:44:23 <vede> Parallax?
A4:44:24 <LG_Legacy> Twilight MMO? God dammit
A4:44:29 <LG_Legacy> The worlds coming to an end
A4:44:33 <08Notch> and when I tried it, I found myself getting much more immersed in the game than with a normal camera
A4:44:33 <venn177> It turned out to be a hoax
A4:44:35 <08Notch> so I kept it. :D
A4:44:43 <Super-Dot> Where does Minecraft spend most of its processing time?
A4:44:51 <Super-Dot> Graphics or gameplay?
A4:44:59 <Super-Dot> Because it already takes up 100% of my CPU
A4:45:18 <Super-Dot> So I'm wondering if 3D would make it take up 200%

A4:45:33 <08Notch> graphics, without a doubt
A4:45:45 <venn177> that's why a single F press makes any computer capable of playing it
A4:45:56 <Plinky> Mhmm, anyway did LG_Legacy ever say the error?

A4:46:02 <LG_Legacy> Afaik: Ram issue = Buffer.overflow

A4:46:11 <Plinky> Cool
A4:46:22 <08Notch> LG_Legacy: I'm looking at it now, there's no fixed buffer in that code so far
A4:46:31 <08Notch> I think I could just increase the max ram available to the applet.

A4:46:57 <venn177> Another question (because I haven't asked enough yet): Why does the server host, in order to be able to join their own server, have to have verify names turned off?
A4:47:02 <Visiiri> What's goin on, mates?
A4:47:04 <Plinky> Notch is the max map size 1024 cubed?
A4:47:11 <venn177> We're strip searching Notch
A4:47:15 <venn177> 's brain
A4:47:18 <Super-Dot> Would Minecraft run a lot faster if it ran at a much lower resolution?
A4:47:22 <Visiiri> I don't believe there is a max.
A4:47:23 <vede> I don't have to turn verify-names to false to play on my own server...
A4:47:42 <08Notch> venn177: Because a direct ip connection (which some people need to be able to connect to their own servers) don't use the name verification code on the server
A4:48:01 <venn177> Ffffuck. Will it ever be changed? I hate having verify names off.

A4:49:07 <venn177> doesn't help that my router is about 30 years old

A4:49:10 <08Notch> i can, though. yay me.
A4:49:21 <Visiiri> Simply steal the connection from a wired neighbor. Then you have two IP's at your command :D

A4:53:24 <Colain> I has to sleep
A4:53:29 <vede> One block = 1m and the player = 1.7m right?
A4:53:30 <Super-Dot> I think most games shy away from using real-world units
A4:53:40 <JoeyJo0> Why's that?
A4:53:44 <Super-Dot> Since everything uses crazy proportions
A4:53:51 <Plinky> Vede the player can fit on one block I believe right?
A4:53:56 <venn177> Yes
A4:53:59 <Super-Dot> Yeah, vede 
A4:54:02 <LG_Legacy> Huh i just got a crazy idea

A4:54:13 <Visiiri> :O
A4:54:16 <Plinky> Oh
A4:54:18 <Super-Dot> How thick is the player?
A4:54:22 <venn177> one block is 3ftx3ft
A4:54:24 <08Notch> venn177: Server edits are way cool, but I'm a bit worried about losing creative control before I'm even done with the game.
A4:54:26 <LG_Legacy> I was right
A4:54:37 <LG_Legacy> bugmenot has one minecraft account
A4:54:37 <08Notch> once the game is done, it's not as important, but I want to have a chance at least.
A4:54:53 <venn177> Notch: Thank you, I was banning people for flyhacking because the general concensus was that you hated them
A4:54:56 <Super-Dot> It's probably banned
A4:54:57 <08Notch> flyhacks are bad if they're used to grief, and I will help give tools to prevent it. People will be able to disable the tools if they really like the hacks, though
A4:55:16 <08Notch> but that's on a server level
A4:55:20 <venn177> Notch, just when I thought the money was going to your head, you bring us back down to earth
A4:55:38 <Plinky> Notch is good like that.
A4:55:48 <venn177> He's never going to abandon us, like Data and Cortex Command
A4:55:52 <08Notch> oh, it IS going to my head.

A4:56:00 <08Notch> I'm struggling to stay focused.
A4:56:02 <venn177> that bastard got his money, stopped updating his game, and just works out all day
A4:56:02 <vede> Notch is the bestest game developer ever made, yeah.
A4:56:07 <Visiiri> I am thinking about modifying a client. You can fly and run at super speeds, but you can't mess with blocks.
A4:56:12 <Plinky> And Notch, will single player have a custom map gen soon?

A4:58:02 <Visiiri> I can't prevent that.
A4:58:08 <Plinky> Notch, like options to generate islands, mountains and stuff like that?

A4:58:50 <Visiiri> I never looked into this.
A4:58:58 <08Notch> yeah, I want to add more options for it, I don't know when I will be able to do it, though
A4:59:01 <08Notch> it's a fair bit of work

A5:07:11 <08Notch> some people like playing with that. you shouldn't let it worry you too much. =)
A5:07:12 <Colain> Super-dot should be on the list.

A5:08:33 <Colain> Like the list Notch?
A5:08:34 <Super-Dot> Meanwhile, I will use "it"
A5:08:34 <LG_Legacy> I said it shouldn't matter whether zuriki is female or not, and to drop the subject.
A5:08:41 <LG_Legacy> Now if you will actually drop it...

A5:39:45 <Plinky> To play at school tomorrow
A5:40:00 <UnknownX> I beat the final boss

A5:40:06 <UnknownX> It was hard
A5:40:08 <venn177> I don't have school for another 3 weeks
A5:40:08 <venn177> :D
A5:40:26 <Plinky> I'll put cave story on my PSP
A5:40:28 <Plinky> Worth it?
A5:40:35 <Masu> Most certainly.
A5:41:05 <venn177> Cave Story is the best thing on the PSP
A5:41:09 <UnknownX> Hey guys i know why notch isn't waking up!
A5:41:39 <UnknownX> Hes in my closet
A5:41:56 <Masu> If you like "Cave Story" you should also try "La-Mulana". And "Spelunky".
A5:42:11 <Plinky> Masu do they have PSP ports
A5:42:13 <Plinky> ?*
A5:42:19 <Masu> I'm not sure.
A5:42:24 <venn177> the difference is Cave Story is retail-game quality
A5:42:33 <Masu> That's true.
A5:42:45 <venn177> it's also one of the best platform shooters I've ever played
A5:42:47 <UnknownX> I'm so getting the wii port
A5:42:48 <venn177> like the old Metroids
A5:42:56 <Plinky> Gotta find my psp > computer cable
A5:43:11 <venn177> I want a PSP
A5:43:13 <Masu> "Lyle in Cube Sector" is good too.
A5:43:15 <venn177> just so I can put Vista on it
A5:43:41 <Masu> It's another "Metroid" like platformer.
A5:43:45 <UnknownX> The Wii version is supposed to have completely better graphics
A5:43:47 <Visiiri> :O
A5:43:51 <Visiiri> WIll someone help me?
A5:43:55 <Plinky> Fiybd ut
A5:43:56 <Visiiri> I need help.
A5:44:06 <Masu> Isn't the "Wii" port made by Nifflas?
A5:44:22 <Masu> The guy that made "Knytt" and "Within a Deep Forest"?
A5:44:29 <Plinky> Any other good games I can put on my PSP that don't need cracking.
A5:44:30 <UnknownX> No
A5:44:46 <Visiiri> No halp for Vis?
A5:44:48 <Masu> It's on his website, I belive.
A5:44:49 <Super-Dot> No, Masu, it's ported by Nicalis
A5:44:53 <Masu> Ah.
A5:45:11 <UnknownX> The wii version is going to be a wiiware game
A5:45:15 <Super-Dot> Nifflas is related to Nicalis somehow, though

A5:47:07 <Visiiri> Is it?

A5:53:24 <Masu> "Tyrian" is freeware I think.

A9:50:14 <gear> the biggest problem is "COULD NOT CREATE AN ADDITIONAL INSTSANCE SERVER"

A11:54:18 <Cameron> What?
A11:54:20 <gdude2002> lol.
A11:54:23 <Cameron> Changing the line size does that.
A11:54:24 <osici> for line and brush density, change the value and then hit enter afterwards
A11:54:26 <Cameron> Not line density.
A11:54:29 <osici> its like airbrush
A11:54:38 <IceFlinger> If it's 2, and you click 2 point, the line will be 2 blocks thick
A11:54:43 <osici> make sure you hit enter <--- this is dumb and i will fix it

P6:28:02 <Eagle> Could it be
P6:28:05 <Eagle> the best RPG ever?
P6:28:14 <PuyoDead> very close, yes
P6:28:24 <Eagle> ... Then what's the best?

P6:29:09 <PuyoDead> no such thing as a "best" type of game. just a selection of a lot of good ones
P6:29:14 <Eagle> :O
P6:29:27 <Eagle> Well then, Earthbound is up there.
P6:29:30 <PuyoDead> but I'm hard pressed to say if I like Earthbound of Mother 3 better
P6:29:42 <Eagle> I personally liked Earthbound better.

P6:31:06 <Eagle> Daggerfall is really hard to control. ):
P6:31:11 <LG_Legacy> Not really

P6:33:34 <PuyoDead> that's nice

P6:34:31 <PuyoDead> I've not really messed with many mods for it
P6:34:44 <Darkebrz> Well, when you have beaten the game 3 times...
P6:34:46 <PuyoDead> but the ones I tried last was really good. Research and Development
P6:34:50 <Darkebrz> You do it again!
P6:34:56 <PuyoDead> *one
P6:35:04 <Eagle> Zombie Panic! Source is a good one.
P6:36:59 <LG_Legacy> It is
P6:37:02 <LG_Legacy> So is synergy
P6:37:07 <Eagle> Synergy is very fun.
P6:37:08 <LG_Legacy> But i recommend a certain horror mod for Hl1
P6:37:20 <LG_Legacy> Something with the name 'monsters' i forgot
P6:37:23 <LG_Legacy> I'll look it up later
P6:37:31 <LG_Legacy> But i know that it's creepy as fuck.
P6:37:36 <PuyoDead> playing HL2 with the portal gun was fun stuff
P6:37:38 <Eagle> Ugh how do you do Level 6
P6:37:40 <Eagle> Honestly
P6:37:40 <PuyoDead> buggy, but fun
P6:38:04 <Eagle> Portal Gun? HL2? How? O.o
P6:38:21 <Eagle> Console?
P6:38:36 <PuyoDead> there was some kind of trick with combining the files between the two to get it, that was a long time ago I did that

P6:39:32 <JudgeRAW00> I've seen him on about 5 servers.
P6:39:35 <JoeyJo0> There is no way to get the Portal gun without using Portal.
P6:39:38 <JudgeRAW00> and all he's done is grief
P6:39:43 <JoeyJo0> Not even Garry got permission from Valve.
P6:39:51 <LG_Legacy> Ah ha

P6:39:54 <LG_Legacy> I found it.
P6:40:05 <LG_Legacy> Also
P6:40:11 <LG_Legacy> Find the model/skins for portal gun
P6:40:17 <LG_Legacy> Anyways

P6:55:04 <Evil-Ville> Only thing I liked about RS was telling newbies that if they give me their stuff I can let them join my clan

P7:02:53 <TrueWolves> Nah, There are some RPGs that are very non-hack/slash
P7:02:54 <BoogtehWoog> Using that logic, any game is an RPG, though.
P7:02:59 <PuyoDead> exactly
P7:03:04 <BoogtehWoog> This is an RPG.
P7:03:05 <Snowman> Click and point rpg's
P7:03:07 <BoogtehWoog> I am playing BoogtehWoog.

P7:03:30 <geekahedron> that's not technical, that's hopelessly vague
13P7:03:33 * Snowman is playing Real Life
P7:03:33 <LG_Legacy> I'm a Diablo person, so i automatically see it as that.
P7:03:35 <PuyoDead> hence, moot point
P7:03:57 <Eagle> Assassin's Creed is an RPG in the same way that Oblivion is an RPG
P7:04:15 <LG_Legacy> Doesn't oblivion follow the 'stats system'?
P7:04:24 <Eagle> And?
P7:04:34 <geekahedron> assassin's creed doesn't
P7:04:46 <Eagle> That's not what I was comparing them with. :P
P7:04:51 <LG_Legacy> I know this
P7:04:57 <LG_Legacy> But they're different rpgs for this right?
P7:05:04 <Eagle> Sure they're different
P7:05:27 <JudgeRAW00> How the hell is Assassin's Creed an RPG at all?
P7:05:29 <Eagle> But they're both RPGs in the same sense. So what if it's not top-down perspective.
P7:05:34 <PuyoDead> most RPGs are considered the turn based, level up stuff. obviously, it's too vague a term to try to be technical about it
P7:05:37 <LG_Legacy> I'm confused as well; judge but i let it go.
P7:05:45 <geekahedron> RPG says nothing about perspective...
P7:05:48 <BoogtehWoog> Know what is in top-down perspective? Baldur's Gate.
P7:05:48 <snaggles> most =/= all
P7:05:50 <LG_Legacy> Not always turn based?
P7:05:51 <BoogtehWoog> We should all be playing it.
P7:06:01 <vede> Sadly, generally RPG means it has stats.
P7:06:03 <Eagle> XD BoogtehWoog
P7:06:08 <FNugget> Role Playing: a role
P7:06:15 <vede> Not that any actual roleplaying is involved.
P7:06:16 <PuyoDead> it's too vague a term to try to be technical about it
P7:06:19 <BoogtehWoog> :3
P7:06:25 <geekahedron> only if you interpret it vaguely
P7:06:38 <LG_Legacy> Dungeons and Dragons Heroes. >_>
P7:06:40 <snaggles> copypaste:
P7:06:43 <PuyoDead> which everone here is doing
P7:06:45 <snaggles> 2) Short for role-playing game, it is a game genre where one or more players adopt a role and act it out in a virtual reality. Usually in an RPG game, you will set out on an adventure or quest, and multiplayer RPG games allows gamers to complete these quests with other gamers as allies over the Internet or as a LAN game. 
P7:06:47 <JudgeRAW00> Role-playing games have stat building and customization as a main part of the game.
P7:06:57 <vede> My interpretation is that an RPG is any game in which the role you play is the focus of the game.
P7:07:00 <PuyoDead> "OMG YOU LEVEL UP ITSRPG"
P7:07:23 <geekahedron> that's not true any more than a game where you walk on a flat surface has to be considered a platformer
P7:07:27 <Eagle> In Assassin's Creed you go around and kill all of the 'bad' people
P7:07:36 <Eagle> You are Altair
P7:07:40 <JudgeRAW00> If you put it that way any video game is a role playing game
P7:07:48 <Eagle> That is your role. You're on a quest to assassin people.
P7:07:51 <vede> Nope.
P7:08:00 <PuyoDead> Super Mario Bros. is an RPG by that definition
P7:08:05 <snaggles> yes
P7:08:10 <snaggles> a platforming rpg
P7:08:12 <PuyoDead> hence, MOOT POINT
P7:08:13 <geekahedron> it is not
P7:08:28 <vede> SMB focuses on the platforming aspect.
P7:08:29 <geekahedron> an RPG is not defined as "a game in which you play a role"
P7:08:42 <Eagle> HOW ABOUT: Assassin's Creed is a 3D Action/RPG except it doesn't have stats and crap.
P7:08:43 <Eagle> There
P7:08:48 <geekahedron> that is neither the denotation nor connotation of the term "RPG"
P7:08:56 <LG_Legacy> Hm
P7:08:59 <Evil-Ville> I played some pacman earlier today, what a wonderful RPG
P7:09:03 <Eagle> We can stop being definition nazis any time now.
P7:09:04 <geekahedron> the "stats and crap" are what makes an RPG
P7:09:04 <LG_Legacy> I think i played too many games with stats then.
P7:09:14 <vede> Hey, geekahedron, you're aware of what RPG stands for, right?
P7:09:15 <LG_Legacy> Oh well back to Diablo II
P7:09:17 <PuyoDead> going full circle back to my point
P7:09:21 <Evil-Ville> There's nothing RPG about Assassin's Creed I am sorry
P7:09:26 <Eagle> <Eagle> We can stop being definition nazis any time now.
P7:09:28 <geekahedron> the term is not defined by the words that comprise it
P7:09:32 <PuyoDead> "<PuyoDead> not in the normal definition of it"
P7:09:59 <LG_Legacy> God what have i done :l
P7:10:07 <FNugget> guys, i foudn this awesome RPG. you walk around and place blocks, and remove blocks. its awesome
P7:10:11 <Eagle> Awesome. By ending the arguement we have stopped chatting in the IRC. :O
P7:10:12 <Nalok> I'M ON A BOAT
P7:10:26 <LG_Legacy> JESUS CHRIST IT'S A BLOCK, GET IN THE CAR.
P7:10:27 <vede> In my experience, Assassin's Creed isn't really very "RPG"ish in the sense that RPG is normally used.
P7:10:29 <PuyoDead> done the rare task of finding a topic where anyone can argue any certain point of it, since there is no real definition of it
P7:10:30 <Nalok> Also any good servers up? I'sa board
P7:10:48 <LG_Legacy> I lost my definition of 'good servers' nalok
P7:10:57 <Eagle> PuyoDead: I have another: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE.
P7:10:58 <TrueWolves> Nalok, Yggdrasil is up
P7:11:00 <vede> Good servers stopped existing long ago.
P7:11:10 <LG_Legacy> Fun in minecraft stopped existing long ago.
P7:11:16 <LG_Legacy> I'm waiting on lua
P7:11:37 <LG_Legacy> Just minecraft is honestly, kind of boring. Build, dig, destroy. Kind of simplized.
P7:11:42 <TrueWolves> Yggdrasil is fun =D
P7:11:44 <Darkebrz> Er
P7:11:45 <Eagle> I think Notch forgot that his new job is to work on Minecraft.
P7:11:46 <Darkebrz> Is it just me
P7:11:48 <TrueWolves> It's one of a kind =3
P7:11:49 <Snowman> We need survival
P7:11:53 <Darkebrz> Or did breaking the tower just go offline?
P7:11:57 <Darkebrz> Snowman: End of month :D
P7:11:59 <Nalok> But it makes my computer 'splode True
P7:11:59 <vede> The only "good server" is a server that you host on your own, and to which you invite a few friends.
P7:12:06 <Darkebrz> If we don't have a playable version by then
P7:12:06 <Snowman> I know
P7:12:07 <vede> Otherwise, pretty much every server sucks.
P7:12:14 <LG_Legacy> Not even that Vede. :l
P7:12:18 <LG_Legacy> I tried it, got bored.
P7:12:18 <Darkebrz> Then good luck, because Notch is gonna leave for a month
P7:12:21 <TrueWolves> Ahhh, sorry Nalok ;.;
P7:12:22 <LG_Legacy> Only on the very first day i played
P7:12:37 <LG_Legacy> Fascinated with tunneling and finding new ways to prevent flooding or the unknown
P7:12:47 <LG_Legacy> Danger and excitement, but now i know what lies beyond and it bores me.
P7:12:51 <vede> If you find Minecraft so boring, why do you like it?
P7:13:00 <LG_Legacy> Who said i did?
P7:13:04 <LG_Legacy> I'm neutral about it
P7:13:06 <Eagle> LG_Legacy this is just sandbox mode, mind you. :P
P7:13:10 <LG_Legacy> I use to love it, so meh :P
P7:13:18 <snaggles> thats why i paid for the game
P7:13:21 <vede> <LG_Legacy>Fun in minecraft stopped existing long ago.

P7:13:47 <PuyoDead> don't do it, man
P7:13:49 <LG_Legacy> Okay it only existed in me <_<
P7:13:50 <Eagle> You can't complain about an alpha stage game and say it's boring without people criticizing you.
P7:13:54 <PuyoDead> hah, yup, that was dumb all right
P7:13:57 <LG_Legacy> MEh i know this
P7:14:00 <LG_Legacy> Thats why i say:
P7:14:01 <PuyoDead> you won't find it here
P7:14:02 <LG_Legacy> I'm waiting for lua
P7:14:20 <not> anyone got the fly hack for minecraft
P7:14:24 <PuyoDead> no
P7:14:26 <Eagle> Not, go away
P7:14:32 <not> anyone else?
P7:14:34 <Nalok> Once CTF and Zmbie Survival come out, all shall be fun again

P7:14:34 <Eagle> This isn't the place for it.
P7:14:37 <not> its for my own serve
P7:14:40 <not> lol
P7:14:44 <TrueWolves> No one has it =/
P7:14:45 <vede> Someone PROBABLY does, but srsly, this ain't the place.
P7:14:45 <Eagle> Not, don't ask here
P7:14:46 <not> google didnt help to much
P7:14:48 <TrueWolves> look it up on google
P7:14:59 <not> like i already havent
P7:15:02 <Eagle> not the hack originated on facepunch
P7:15:02 <Darkebrz> OKay
P7:15:07 <Darkebrz> NO DISCUSSING OF HACKS
P7:15:17 <Darkebrz> That is a rule
P7:15:20 <not> y
P7:15:20 <TrueWolves> By rule of Notch
P7:15:24 <TrueWolves> Notch said so
P7:15:25 <TrueWolves> =/
P7:15:29 <Evil-Ville> It's not even hard to find if you're not a retard
P7:15:32 <PuyoDead> multiple times, at that
P7:15:34 <snaggles> everybody and their mother hacks
P7:15:37 <Eagle> There's no reason to find it anyway
P7:15:41 <Snowman> You know, if you put a virus in those hacks, a lot of people would be infected by now
P7:15:45 <snaggles> yes
P7:15:49 <Eagle> Notch is going to get rid of hacks in an update soon anyways
P7:15:55 <snaggles> a lot of incompetent people
P7:15:57 <Snowman> Yeah, can't wait for it
P7:15:59 <Darkebrz> Eagle: Not right now
P7:16:01 <Snowman> stupid hacks
P7:16:01 <TrueWolves> Every new hack is going to die sooner or later
P7:16:03 <Eagle> *coughif he updatescough*
P7:16:07 <Darkebrz> He is working on survival currently
P7:16:11 <Snowman> Btw guys, I'm off

P7:16:17 <not> but new ones will keep comign
P7:16:25 <TrueWolves> But they will keep dying
P7:16:25 <Eagle> So?
P7:16:41 <Evil-Ville> I remember two months ago when survival was supposed to be done in a week or two
P7:16:42 <Darkebrz> When survival comes out, Im not going to allow hacks on my server
P7:16:44 <TrueWolves> and there is only so many ways to make a hack, sooner or later they will get less common
P7:16:48 <not> they will always exist
P7:16:52 <TrueWolves> always
P7:16:56 <TrueWolves> but they will get less and less common
P7:16:58 <PuyoDead> <not> they will always exist
P7:17:01 <PuyoDead> no shit?
P7:17:07 <PuyoDead> you mean... software gets hacked?
10P7:17:18 * kalanosh (chatzilla@70.116.81.247) has joined #minecraft
P7:17:21 <Eagle> Until, you know, Notch fixes it so the server can detect hax more easily
P7:17:25 <not> lol
P7:17:34 <snaggles> somebody said that notch said he can fix the fly hacks, but not necesarily the run hacks
P7:17:36 <not> but hacks will still be made
P7:17:47 <not> and be usuable
P7:17:49 <Eagle> But they will be much much much harder to make
P7:17:57 <not> people make antihack dections
P7:17:58 <Eagle> And so they will be much much much less common
P7:18:05 <kalanosh> he can fix all the hacks, he just hasn't been working on plugging the holes in the client
P7:18:07 <PuyoDead> he'll remove current ones upon server updates, but more will pop up. but considering the VERY large gap between the last update, it's not wonder they've populated so much
P7:18:13 <not> detection*
P7:18:15 <Eagle> And plus once lua is out, people will make antihax mods and such
P7:18:27 <PuyoDead> *no
P7:18:28 <Eagle> In other words: Not, go away. :P
P7:18:30 <snaggles> and you might have to create your own custom server script just to run the hacks
P7:18:40 <vede> I had a server recently.
P7:18:44 <not> lol  f u :)
P7:18:52 <snaggles> lol good argument
P7:18:54 <vede> Some people got on and actually left because I said hacks weren't allowed.
P7:19:06 <snaggles> meh, i'll play without hacks
P7:19:13 <snaggles> i only use them to get around
P7:19:14 <PuyoDead> those are called "spoiled kids". also, "idiots"
P7:19:17 <vede> That's like, "Aww cheating is against the rules this suuuuuucks"
P7:19:22 <not> i just need the fly for my sserver

P7:19:34 <Darkebrz> Hacks are only useful for getting around
P7:19:37 <not> nothing wont be a city
P7:19:37 <snaggles> or make it in omen
P7:19:39 <Darkebrz> not: Stop asking for hacks
P7:19:48 <Darkebrz> Continue to ask and I will alert an op
P7:19:53 <not> im not asking anymore
P7:19:53 <PuyoDead> you can ask all day, you'll just get an eventual ban

P7:37:29 <snaggles> even when using firefox?

P7:38:15 <LG_Legacy> You know what i wouldn't mind?
P7:38:24 <LG_Legacy> A pop-up that would be enjoyable, something from /b/ maybe.
P7:38:31 <snaggles> then i learned how to be computer smart
P7:38:35 <LG_Legacy> Pop-up: 'Gentlemen?'
P7:38:41 <snaggles> just randomly?
P7:38:44 <LG_Legacy> Meh

P8:03:19 <doctorwho42> anyone got info about how to host with a MAC?

P8:06:25 <Eagle> Problem solved.
P8:06:40 <doctorwho42> how many servers can 1 person run?
P8:06:44 <Evil-Ville> Quatroking is this year finally the year of linux desktop

P8:07:48 <Eagle> Google's making an OS? :O
P8:07:52 <Quatroking> considering adobe is being paid to develop for chrome OS, there's a huge chance they're porting over their programs
P8:07:53 <Eagle> Didn't know that.
P8:07:58 <Darkebrz> Chrome OS isn't meant to be replacing windows or mac
P8:08:00 <Quatroking> What, haven't you been following the tech news?
P8:08:08 <Quatroking> Darke: then what is it.
P8:08:11 <Darkebrz> It is for developing countries >_>
P8:08:14 <Super-Dot> It'll be hilarious and awesome if Chrome OS becomes popular
P8:08:15 <Quatroking> To browse the fucking itnernet?
P8:08:25 <Quatroking> darke thats bullshit
P8:08:38 <Quatroking> africa can't afford fucking pc's
P8:08:51 <Super-Dot> Darkebrz, I think you're thinking of the OLPC/XO laptop
P8:09:08 <Quatroking> google did sponsor such a thing tho
P8:09:12 <Quatroking> If I remember good

P8:09:38 <Quatroking> the half-dead kids that make your clothes, that is
P8:10:24 <Super-Dot> Quatroking, what's all this about Adobe and Chrome?
P8:10:46 <Quatroking> Google is working with adobe on Chrome OS
P8:11:17 <Quatroking> considering flash player is already supported for Linux, there's a pretty big chance adobe is porting over their programs
P8:11:29 <Quatroking> I mean, what would they else do?
P8:11:36 <Super-Dot> Where'd you learn that they're working together?
P8:11:42 <Quatroking> on their blog?
P8:11:54 <Quatroking> http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-chrome-os-faq.html
P8:12:02 <Quatroking> The Google Chrome OS team is currently working with a number of technology companies to design and build devices that deliver an extraordinary end user experience. Among others, these companies include Acer, Adobe, ASUS, Freescale, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba.
P8:12:20 <Eagle> http://www.downloadsquad.com/photos/google-chrome-os/2175677/
P8:12:24 <Super-Dot> Huh, interesting
P8:12:56 <Super-Dot> My guess is that they're working to get Flash working properly and little else
P8:13:10 <Super-Dot> Since the whole point of Chrome OS is that it's nothing but a browser
P8:13:11 <Quatroking> Isn't flash already working fine?
P8:13:22 <Quatroking> I never have problems with it when I'm busy on Ubuntu
P8:13:24 <Eagle> The UI looks too minimalistic for my tastes.
P8:13:33 <Eagle> Google Chrome OS's.

P8:41:33 <LG_Legacy> Uh huh..

P8:41:48 <Quatroking> eh
P8:41:58 <Quatroking> try singleplayer.
P8:42:02 <PickYerPoison> Umm, I've only tried one so far...I'll go try another server and then singleplayer.
P8:42:11 <Quatroking> if that also doesn't work then shit goes wrong somewhere
P8:42:12 <LG_Legacy> Yes try single player, or try mine: http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=42b877f9c9d4d4bda5f9afb402f028c3
P8:43:23 <LG_Legacy> At some servers, the servers level can be too big for java to load, and it blows itself up.

P8:43:32 <Quatroking> alright

P8:44:27 <Quatroking> which could be caused by lack of ram.
P8:44:33 <LG_Legacy> Why would it?
P8:44:42 <PickYerPoison> I've got the latest Java, but I only have 512 MB of RAM.

P8:51:08 <Evil-Ville> firefox is such a memory hog
P8:51:13 <snaggles> ^yes
P8:51:21 <Quatroking> firefox uses a lot of ram indeed
P8:51:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> one reason i'm using chrome
P8:51:45 <snaggles> chrome gets the equivalent of adblock and greasemonkey, right?
P8:51:46 <Quatroking> I'm not using chrome because it lacks options
P8:51:51 <Darkebrz> Chrome is awesome
P8:52:01 <Quatroking> I want to be able to customize my browser
P8:52:03 <Darkebrz> But it doesn't have stumbleupon ;_;
P8:52:07 <snaggles> those are the two main addons i use for firefox
P8:52:16 <LG_Legacy> Hm..
P8:52:18 <Evil-Ville> I should start using chrome since I never use plugins anyways
P8:52:19 <Darkebrz> snaggles: It doesn't
P8:52:23 <Darkebrz> It has greasemonkey
P8:52:25 <Darkebrz> Not adblock
P8:52:27 <snaggles> D:
P8:52:39 <LG_Legacy> I use to be a fan of Avant (A light resource IE Based browser) But it locks up alot
P8:52:55 <snaggles> meh
P8:53:18 <snaggles> i dont trust google much, and chrome doesnt get adblock, so I probably wont switch very soon
P8:53:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> k
P8:55:13 <Evil-Ville> You don't trust google?
P8:55:32 <Darkebrz> Google is freaking unreliable man
P8:55:43 <PickYerPoison> Hrm. It's still unresponsive on Firefox. But now the game window is updating, because I don't get the words "This game requires Java to run" trailing across the screen when I scroll down.
P8:56:10 <snaggles> as in, i dont trust that google wont do anything with what i type into their search bar
P8:56:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's k
P8:56:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> look through chrome's source
P8:56:39 <AnnihilatorBeta> compile it

P9:56:15 <Nate^-^> cool
P9:56:21 <LG_Legacy> Most linksys routers have a homepage which is: 192.168.1.1
P9:56:27 <Nate^-^> ya
P9:56:27 <LG_Legacy> We're going to try to port-forwards.

P10:00:47 <LG_Legacy> Protocol: Both
P10:01:01 <LG_Legacy> IP Address: This one is a little tricky
P10:01:22 <Nate^-^> k
P10:01:23 <LG_Legacy> Mainly to find out what you put in, you gotta go to Run. Put in Cmd, wait for the black box to come up, put in ipconfig, and let it load.
P10:01:37 <Nate^-^> alright
P10:01:46 <LG_Legacy> You'll find Ip-Addres. Normally it should say like 192.168.1.101 or something, the last three digits are the ones you put in the IP-Addres in your Router Page
P10:02:05 <LG_Legacy> Beware resetting your router, or turning it off will change those three digits, so if something doesn't work you may need to check it again one day.
P10:02:18 <LG_Legacy> And usually last: Enabled: Check it.
P10:02:19 <Nate^-^> ok
P10:02:39 <LG_Legacy> You can hit Save Settings when you're done, and it will save it. Warning: You may disconnect for a brief 3 - 5 seconds.
P10:02:49 <Nate^-^> ok
P10:03:04 <Nate^-^> thats it?

P10:09:57 <LG_Legacy> Or if someone else beats me to it.
P10:10:03 <LG_Legacy> If not*
P10:10:47 <LG_Legacy> Cause i know a few select of us could probably run a forum and keep it contained.
P10:11:15 <LG_Legacy> Or you know..
P10:11:16 <Azjherben> Well
P10:11:27 <LG_Legacy> We get a forum up with a domain again and have citric run it through.

P10:14:52 <PuyoDead> nope
P10:14:54 <LG_Legacy> If he ever fires back up the forums with evertyhing on it, we will have all of the old stuff back and everyone will want to go there.
P10:15:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> well, nobody bothers
P10:16:06 <LG_Legacy> Look i'm not trying to be against the idea myself, i'm just saying people will probably just go back to the orignal and the effort will be wasted in the end, unless you plan on it just being a 'sub forum' or something for your forum.

P10:18:34 <Azjherben> that's fine
P10:18:35 <Daidoji> they don't have an official forum
P10:18:36 <LG_Legacy> For as example i could easily put a sub-forum in my acquantices domain, and it would be a 'temporary' or 'unoffical'
P10:18:44 <Daidoji> but there's several fan forums
P10:18:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> i haven't been on recently actually
P10:19:01 <LG_Legacy> Which reminds me..
P10:19:04 <LG_Legacy> Need to get a banner for it
P10:19:20 <LG_Legacy> Heyyyy
P10:19:23 <LG_Legacy> Thats what we can do next
P10:19:26 <Azjherben> This won't just be about minecraft, that way, it won't seem like a compitition
P10:19:30 <LG_Legacy> Make banners for our forums, and like little minecraft sigs.
P10:19:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> whatever you're planning to do
P10:19:39 <Azjherben> Besides, I have played other games
P10:19:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> expect controversy
P10:19:50 <Azjherben> Crap
P10:19:58 <LG_Legacy> Thats fine then if you're planning to have it like a 'sub' forum Azjh

P11:37:26 <mib_drygkq> its hard to have the same sense of scope
P11:37:30 <mib_drygkq> as older games
P11:37:41 <LG_Legacy> A good oldschool example is Zelda OoT, back then... they made it long and good. Halo 3 ? It was alright, bit short though.

P11:40:20 <mail2345|semi-afk> as I said, the first step is to get bartpe working up
