A1:16:41 <greenslimy> Notch was actually on?
A1:17:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Indeed.
A1:17:42 <Darkebrz> Yep
A1:17:58 <greenslimy> 4 real? he's never on anymore >.>
A1:18:06 <vdgmprgrmr> He's been sick.
A1:18:15 <greenslimy> I know
A1:18:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Today he got on and was all liek "yo gaiz im sick and stuff".
A1:19:05 <vdgmprgrmr> He'll probably be on more when he's less sick.
A1:19:50 <greenslimy> You're not talking to a 2 y/o here :o
A1:21:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Always assume you're talking to idiots.
A1:22:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Also I just read Notch's post about eyes.
A1:22:06 <greenslimy> I always do
A1:22:09 <JTE> Heh.
A1:22:35 <vdgmprgrmr> And he says that a 24fps film of a finger will show a focused finger in 24 locations, but that's not true.
A1:22:54 <greenslimy> Not ALWAYS true
A1:23:02 <JTE> Not in real life, but in videogames yes.
A1:23:04 <JTE> :P
A1:23:22 <JTE> Real life has no fps. Has no frames. :(
A1:23:35 <JTE> Everything is motion blurred so finely we don't even notice.
A1:23:47 <vdgmprgrmr> It'll show a blurry finger in 24 locations, since the amount of the time the shutter on the film was open (or the thingy for digital film) will capture the finger in multiple locations.
A1:24:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, I'd still say that the human BRAIN only processes images at a limited speed.
A1:25:05 <greenslimy> I like to HIGHLIGHT words ;)
A1:27:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Which can be measured. The eye, due to the way light affects the things on it, won't have a specific speed, since it would work like a piece of film that's always got the shutter open. (In simplistic terms.) So the brain will just process what happens to be on the eye at any given time and will produce a certain amount of mental images per second. The reason for the blurring of different objects depending on where
A1:27:13 <vdgmprgrmr>  you look would be the relationship of the angle of the eye to the object being observed.
A1:27:57 <vdgmprgrmr> If you took a camera and had it FOLLOW a moving finger, the finger wouldn't be blurred, the background would.

A1:28:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Basically, Notch's eyes post is crap, despite how awesome he may be.

A1:30:27 <vdgmprgrmr> (Of course, the camera's focus would have to be tuned with each frame if you wanted to simulate an eye with it, which is difficult to do without a set computer-run pattern behind it, or if you're using a "camera" with a brain behind it.)
A1:31:38 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm not gonna say the eye can't see more than 30fps, since eyes tend to vary from person to person.
A1:32:04 <vdgmprgrmr> And because it's not the eye that results in the difference, it's the brain.
A1:33:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, isn't the abbreviation of hertz Hz, not HZ?
A1:33:50 <vdgmprgrmr> That kinda threw me for a loop a second or so.
A1:33:56 <greenslimy> What if he's not saying Herts?
A1:34:13 <greenslimy> same thing >.> herts = hertz
A1:35:14 <vdgmprgrmr> What else is he saying?
A1:35:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Er...
A1:35:23 <greenslimy> Idk
A1:35:24 <vdgmprgrmr> What else would he be saying?
A1:35:35 <greenslimy> Hey Zeke?

A6:44:39 <ez> hey Angelo
A6:44:43 <Angelo> hey ez
A6:44:56 <ez> Im just at home sick, no vacation, but still not working hehe
A6:45:04 <Angelo> why does my server keep crashing! >.<
A6:45:06 <ez> not as fun as vacation tho :P
A6:45:27 <citricsquid> my life is one big vacation :D
A6:46:58 <Snowman> stfu, get back to developing you :p
A6:48:58 <Angelo> omg 
A6:49:06 <Angelo> they really need to do something about griefers
A6:49:11 <Angelo> my whole server is griefed >.<
A6:49:18 <citricsquid> ...like that?
A6:49:39 <citricsquid> I meant what*
A6:49:45 <Angelo> everything
A6:49:50 <citricsquid> as in, "what can they do about griefers"?
A6:49:57 <Angelo> oh.
A6:49:58 <Angelo> ban then
A6:50:04 <Angelo> block protection
A6:50:08 <Angelo> thats a good idea
A6:50:18 <citricsquid> that'd be abused more though.
A6:50:30 <Angelo> that you cannot delete each others blocks except if you are an admin or a friend of someone
A6:50:43 <Angelo> GOD DAMNIT
A6:50:55 <citricsquid> Angelo: Then I could put down loads of blocks as a greifer and you wouldn't be able to delete them unless you were OP...
A6:51:06 <Angelo> i know
A6:51:07 <citricsquid> I could build in your stuff and you'd not be able to fix it
A6:51:15 <citricsquid> that's worse than the current griefing...
A6:51:17 <Angelo> yessssssss
A6:51:25 <Angelo> no
A6:51:43 <citricsquid> I'd rather rebuild my stuff than not be able to build because someone has put unbreakable blocks all over my stuff.
A6:51:52 <Angelo> for fuck sake is there any option to only let people you trust + people that bought the game in?
A6:51:59 <Angelo> still, letting it be public
A6:52:01 <citricsquid> private.
A6:52:07 <citricsquid> How would that work?
A6:52:13 <Angelo> LUA
A6:52:30 <citricsquid> how would a script know if you knew the person?
A6:52:30 <peerkoel> keep your server private
A6:52:33 <peerkoel> simple as that
A6:52:51 <_spondy> an "allow liat" perhaps
A6:52:53 <citricsquid> Every solution to griefing presented has had flaws and works out at disadvantaging legitimate players than the current situation.
A6:52:54 <_spondy> list*
A6:53:01 <Angelo> peerkoel, not anyone wants something like a private server.
A6:53:01 <citricsquid> _spondy: why not just private then?
A6:53:08 <Angelo> and an allow list is exactly what i mean
A6:53:10 <citricsquid> private IS an allow list
A6:53:13 <peerkoel> you do apparently
A6:53:19 <citricsquid> you ALLOW people you want in by giving them the URL
A6:53:28 <Angelo> NO
A6:53:31 <_spondy> then hmm true
A6:53:34 <peerkoel> <Angelo> for fuck sake is there any option to only let people you trust + people that bought the game in?    <-- that is a private server
A6:53:35 <Angelo> i still want every person that bought the game in
A6:53:37 <_spondy> but he wants payong users to
A6:53:51 <Angelo> that bought the game and dont know the link peerkoel?
A6:53:55 <Angelo> without having them on msn?
A6:53:57 <citricsquid> there's a lot of paid players who grief...
A6:53:58 <peerkoel> so you want people you trust OR people who bought the game in
A6:54:00 <ez> payong users :D
A6:54:02 <Angelo> i want public, but only people that bought it can get in
A6:54:13 <Angelo> yes
A6:54:14 <citricsquid> angelo: That has been suggested before and might happen
A6:54:21 <Angelo> GOOOD.
A6:54:24 <citricsquid> private, public and paid only :D
A6:54:27 <peerkoel> then set verify-names
A6:54:27 <Angelo> until then, no server hosted by me. >.<
A6:54:34 <Angelo> its on.
A6:54:44 <Angelo> and i dont know what it does either
A6:55:04 <peerkoel> oh I see, there is no distinction between registered and registered+preordered
A6:55:18 <peerkoel> so you're stuck on that
A6:55:42 <citricsquid> personally I don't see why you'd block free players, there are just as many people who paid and grief.
A6:55:53 <peerkoel> true
A6:55:54 <Angelo> name one
A6:55:58 <peerkoel> citricsquid
A6:56:00 <peerkoel> :P
A6:56:01 <Angelo> lol
A6:56:06 <Angelo> anyway
A6:56:06 <citricsquid> I can't name any free griefers... doesn't mean they don't exist
A6:56:07 <peerkoel> nah he's ok
A6:56:13 <Angelo> you can trust people that bought the game more than free players.
A6:56:15 <Angelo> thats my point.
A6:56:29 <Angelo> less chance that someone griefs your stuff or places nazi signs all over the place
A6:56:39 <peerkoel> you could also enable your firewall
A6:56:42 <Angelo> i dont know why people like them anyway
A6:56:44 <peerkoel> so people can't get in
A6:56:54 <Angelo> ...
A6:56:55 <citricsquid> if you hate it that much, make a new player box and only let friends in.
A6:56:55 <peerkoel> but the server will keep sending out heartbeats
A6:57:05 <peerkoel> so your server will climb up in the list
A6:58:23 <Angelo> i have 3 problems with this game, which is really needed to get fixed or something: server crashes at 13/15 and 12/12, griefers, people making nazi signs all over the place.
A6:59:15 <peerkoel> that last thing is hard to fight
A6:59:24 <Angelo> i know
A6:59:27 <Angelo> and its annoying me
A6:59:40 <Angelo> i dont know why people like these things anyway.
A6:59:50 <citricsquid> What annoys me is nobody seems to understand that griefing is something that will always exist, it's impossible to stop unless you don't allow anyone to join your server.
A7:00:10 <Angelo> how did they do it in garrys mod then? ^_^
A7:00:12 <citricsquid> You can prevent it to an extent, but if someone wants to grief they will.
A7:00:16 <Angelo> thats right, prop protection
A7:00:23 <citricsquid> and how fun is gmod? It isn't.
A7:00:27 <Angelo> it is :D
A7:00:41 <citricsquid> besides the fact that mc and gmod are entirely different
A7:00:51 <citricsquid> you need to be able to mess with others blocks in minecraft
A7:00:55 <citricsquid> if that wasn't allowed the game would suck
A7:01:03 <Angelo> why?
A7:01:08 <Angelo> cause you like to grief
A7:01:09 <Angelo> ?
A7:01:18 <citricsquid> oh yes of course angelo.
A7:01:39 <peerkoel> because in every sandbox, content is volatile
A7:01:45 <citricsquid> No, because minecraft is a collaborative game, I get bored building alone for 6 hours but with other people it's great fun.
A7:01:57 <citricsquid> If you want to build alone without people touching your blocks, go singleplayer.
A7:02:04 <Angelo> if they dont fuck up your stuff.
A7:02:20 <Angelo> i want to play with people. but i dont want people to mess my stuff up completely
A7:02:20 <citricsquid> Angelo: I play privately when I want to build proper things
A7:02:40 <Angelo> i dont care
A7:02:45 <Angelo> i like playing with other people
A7:02:47 <citricsquid> There are forums, there's IRC, there's instant messaging, set up a private server and play with friends you trust. It's what I do when I want to build properly.

A7:03:17 <citricsquid> I don't see why the game should be turned into some gay ass overly complicated game because some people don't like the idea of playing privately and would much rather make the game boring for everyone else.
A7:03:29 <Angelo> i want to meet people i dont know yet. i tought thats were multiplayer was for in casual games. well, guess i was wrong and just get back to playing the old gmod and meeting people there.
A7:03:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yup... Go back to gmod plz
A7:04:12 <citricsquid> Angelo: Play publicly but don't cry when someone breaks your castle, if you're building for an ego boost then play pirvately and post screenshots on the forums.
A7:04:37 <Angelo> jeez, this game sucks even more then i expected .

A7:04:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Somebody call the waaaaaambulance
A7:05:10 <citricsquid> so he can't stay around to argue his point of view? What an excellent person.
A7:06:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm sick of it... Sick of these 10 year olds crying out for change because they have fun in other people seeing their shit, not in building.  And I'm sick of them using GMod as an argument.  I've said it MANY times and I'll say it again.  Go back to gmod please.  Leave us alone
A7:07:06 <citricsquid> I don't have a problem with suggestions on how to stop griefing, but I get really annoyed when every suggestion will turn the game into some game where we have no freedom and can't build what we want. I don't see why they think such suggestions are a good idea when we have private servers now.

A7:10:42 <peerkoel> ok.. so what is gmod?
A7:10:55 <citricsquid> http://www.garrysmod.org/ :D
A7:11:01 <peerkoel> thanks
A7:11:44 <vdgmprgrmr> OMG some people just don't like seeing things they made destroyed
A7:11:48 <vdgmprgrmr>  O_O
A7:12:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> Okay.  Who the fuck put a spawn prison in Reddit Public?
A7:13:21 <peerkoel> so what does gmod have to do with minecraft or minecraft gameplay?
A7:13:29 <citricsquid> it's a sandbox
A7:13:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Both are sandboxy games.
A7:13:31 <citricsquid> where anything you make
A7:13:34 <citricsquid> only you can change
A7:13:41 <citricsquid> so if you put a barrel down, nobody else can mess with it
A7:13:57 <citricsquid> which clearly wouldn't work in minecraft.
A7:14:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, I'm being constantly amazed at how much more fun coding is when the things you write actually WORK.
A7:14:17 <vdgmprgrmr> CONSISTENTLY.
A7:14:22 <peerkoel> ah. gmod.org showed me just a bunch of tags and screens
A7:14:29 <peerkoel> gmod.com is more info
A7:14:54 <peerkoel> so what are you working on then vdgmprgrmr 
A7:15:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I've been just adding crap to this here game of mine for the past three days and not a single thing hasn't worked after just one or two runs.
A7:15:24 <peerkoel> awesome :)
A7:15:43 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm making an action-y roguelike-ish game.
A7:16:05 <peerkoel> euh, I think my desktop is caving in

A10:02:39 <Quatroking> Now I have to wait for further instructions of the shop itself to complete my order >:C
A10:03:24 <Minerman> D:
A10:03:43 <citricsquid> poorly built online store if it can't handle such outcomes
A10:03:52 <Quatroking> It was on Paypal itself
A10:04:07 <Quatroking> my browser crashed thus rendering the session invalid
A10:04:25 <Quatroking> the shop got the order, but not my payment
A10:04:40 <citricsquid> That wouldn't happen; if your payment is passed what you do after is irrelevant, a well built store using the Paypal API can handle users sessions becoming invalid. if the shop didn't get your payment the order shouldn't be used, silly store.
A10:04:41 <Quatroking> thankfully their support is rather fast
A10:04:43 <citricsquid> just re-order?
A10:04:51 <Quatroking> It didn't pass yet
A10:05:43 <Quatroking> I'm first waiting on a reaction on the support ticket I sent in

A10:19:04 <Dossy> citricsquid: True dat.
A10:19:23 <citricsquid> minerman: what do you want as MOTD?
A10:19:24 <Quatroking> the only anime products are the totoro things, lucky star and the silver/grey tachikoma
A10:19:34 <citricsquid> still too much anime :D
A10:19:38 <ZomBuster> with this electric fly swapper im god of the insects
A10:19:51 <Quatroking> I love electric fly swappers
A10:19:53 <Minerman> uhh. what.
A10:20:02 <Minerman> Ironic
A10:20:10 <Minerman> I'm actually a door-to-door electric fly swapper salesman
A10:20:21 <Minerman> We just released a Super EX Edition model
A10:20:54 <Minerman> Which has spring-powered whatever-a-fly-swapper-does action!

A10:23:18 <citricsquid> I spend all my money on servers, coke and Dr Pepper.
A10:23:34 <Minerman> Why coke AND Dr. Pepper?
A10:23:41 <Quatroking> Can't wait for december when they start selling the suprise boxes

A10:29:41 <Dossy> citricsquid: But it's way too hard :\
A10:29:50 <Minerman> But I've had no experience with C# so my opinion shouldn't count
A10:30:24 <Dossy> Everyone says you can do more with C++ but everything uses C# as far as I can see :|
A10:30:34 <Dossy> XNA, ASP, etc
A10:30:47 <Dossy> What can you actually do with C++ :|
A10:31:38 <ZomBuster> anything
A10:32:59 <Minerman> C++ is the Chuck Norris of programming languages
A10:33:08 <Minerman> And by that, I mean it shits rainbows.
A10:33:32 <Dossy> So, C# shits marshmallows in comparison?

A11:49:24 <Quatroking> To be honest, I HATE it.

P12:51:25 <JTE> MULTIPLE MAPS ON A SINGLE SERVER, EACH WITH THEIR OWN PLAYERS AND MAP FLAGS.
P12:51:25 <JTE> With the ability to change maps without having to reconnect, some maps being read-only, some maps being for resource-gathering (break-only), some maps being for organized construction (only break your own stuff), etc.

P12:52:36 <citricsquid> doesn't it kill us with chunks?
P12:52:40 <LF> I'm half expecting michael jackson to burst out of his coffing and start dancing to thriller
P12:52:53 <citricsquid> LF: haha, been discussing exactly that with a friend :D
P12:52:54 <JTE> It acts like when you first connect and load the map.
P12:52:57 <citricsquid> it'd be an excellent comeback
P12:53:02 <LF> Yeah
P12:53:09 <LF> Especially if he was actually a zombie
P12:53:31 <LF> Also JTE that sounds amazing
P12:53:31 <JTE> So it has the loading bar. And the motd. Which I can change based on which map you're going to.
P12:54:06 <JTE> Oh and I also managed to make it so /op and /deop change your ability to break admin blocks without having to reconnect. Plus /adminbreak for toggling that without losing your admin status.
P12:54:32 <JTE> So now admins can play spleef too. :3
P12:54:37 <citricsquid> :D
P12:55:36 <JTE> Should I make it so every player gets their own unique sandbox map they can invite others to with a command or something?
P12:57:02 <JTE> A map wouldn't be loaded while empty and each player would get only one sandbox map of a set size, of course, so it shouldn't be much trouble. :P
P12:58:20 <JTE> XD Everyone could have admin power on their own map, too ... Then this would start becoming some kind of super-server, huh?
P12:59:04 <citricsquid> that'd be awesome
P1:00:17 <JTE> ^^; I probably shouldn't mention that I still don't have grass, plants, or liquids working yet... I'm coding my own server from scratch for this, and it's much better written and more organized than the original proxy thing, though still in Perl.
P1:00:44 <JTE> ... so it's hopefully not gonna eat my cpu alive and lag to death as much no mores.
P1:01:11 <CMD_Bob> Sounds pretty darn cool.
P1:04:08 <JTE> Oh, and I added a /showself command which sends you messages about your own character, so you can see a ghost of yourself where everyone else sees you due to network lag. And a /hide command which silently kills your character to everyone else and lets you move around invisibly until you use it again.
P1:04:53 <JTE> Am looking into having the server constantly control your character so you can 'spectate' people or something, but the outlook isn't so good.
P1:05:57 <JTE> And Notch doesn't want me distributing my server so everyone's still forced to use his. :<

P1:10:27 <Rroff> I had to write my own customer login form to prevent 43543535 bots signing up
P1:10:31 <postlogic> I checked the first few.
P1:10:42 <citricsquid> If they're for a webserver. then yes, but the ones spamming minecraftforum are home IPs
P1:10:51 <postlogic> That sucks.
P1:11:19 <Rroff> even with a decent login captcha I was getting 1000 a day
P1:11:39 <postlogic> Yeh, CAPTCHA isn't enough anymore :/
P1:11:48 <citricsquid> captcha is useless
P1:11:50 <Rroff> I added some visually hidden fields and stuff
P1:11:57 <citricsquid> if a human can read it, it can be built for a bot to read it
P1:12:03 <Rroff> bots always fill atleast one of them out so far
P1:12:16 <citricsquid> best method is to require email activation + randomised questions + checking headers.
P1:12:17 <Rroff> bet eventually they will start checking for visibility
P1:12:19 <postlogic> CAPTCHA is not useless, it's just defenseless against the more sophisticated ones.
P1:12:45 <CMD_Bob> A shame that all our modern image reading software is used to sell shitty dick pillz
P1:12:53 <postlogic> Yeh.

P2:22:00 <LF> by the way (I understand this is damn near impossible) but how about a dwarf fortress mode
P2:22:19 <ZomBuster> survival would be a bit like that
P2:22:50 <LF> O_o
P2:22:51 <LF> How
P2:23:07 <LF> Well I get how it is
P2:23:17 <LF> But I mean a full on build a settlement and stuff
P2:23:30 <LF> with mobs than join and take up jobs
P2:23:39 <ZomBuster> ooh
P2:23:56 <LF> and other random mobs like goblins that attack
P2:24:02 <cryzed> "this is damn near impossible"
P2:24:04 <ZomBuster> nah the player plays the dwarfs
P2:24:11 <cryzed> well atleast the job thingy I'd guess
P2:24:18 <cryzed> oh okay
P2:24:20 <LF> Not really
P2:24:25 <cryzed> So you play in a team are Dwarfs
P2:24:27 <LF> It just requires AI coding
P2:24:29 <cryzed> and defend your castle
P2:24:32 <cryzed> against trolls :D?
P2:24:43 <LF> you've never played dwarf fortress have you?
P2:24:58 <cryzed> LF good Ai coding. How are they supposed to know how YOU want something to look like?
P2:25:04 <cryzed> No I never did actually
P2:25:09 <cryzed> Oh wait
P2:25:10 <cryzed> I did
P2:25:14 <LF> Not how I want it like
P2:25:14 <cryzed> I think
P2:25:40 <Siiseli> does anyone here know why a certain game in epsxe bugs out like.. in splitscreen mutliplayer, the other screen goes black
P2:25:45 <LF> (Well to be honest I've never played an extended game due to the lack of a GUI and I'm bad with remembering all the controls but I know a lot about it)
P2:25:56 <cryzed> Can I run it with WINE? I'd guess so, right?
P2:26:07 <LF> DF? Guessing so
P2:26:13 <LF> It's only an ASCII game
P2:26:40 <cryzed> why would it requiere "~100MB Disk Space," when it is only 5,42mb in size
P2:26:48 <LF> Heh
P2:26:49 <cryzed> Does the map take up that much size?
P2:26:53 <LF> Yes
P2:26:56 <cryzed> Oh
P2:27:05 <LF> Precisely why it's damn near impossible to implement
P2:27:13 <cryzed> Well yeah, I remember. I once started it it generated the map for like 10 minutes
P2:27:21 <cryzed> and then I didn't know what to do
P2:27:22 <LF> It can take up to an hour
P2:27:37 <cryzed> Is it fun to play? How long can you play it?
P2:27:39 <cryzed> weeks?
P2:27:41 <cryzed> months?
P2:27:43 <LF> Um
P2:27:47 <cryzed> Somehow gives me this impression
P2:27:56 <cryzed> of long-term game
P2:27:59 <LF> Like I said I find it hard to get in to due to the lack of any major GUI
P2:28:28 <cryzed> Well there is a GUI more or less
P2:28:32 <cryzed> It's like curses I'd gues
P2:28:34 <cryzed> *guess
P2:28:39 <cryzed> or it IS curses
P2:28:42 <cryzed> I don't know
P2:28:44 <LF> But quite simply when one fortress dies you just start again on the same map
P2:29:12 <cryzed> gonna read that up sometime
P2:29:30 <LF> DF wiki: http://dwarf.lendemaindeveille.com/index.php/Main_Page

P2:33:01 <Darkebrz> Angelo, Im on Tyokos new server :D
P2:33:12 <cryzed> There are several BufferOverflows, the "Port Already in use" issue"
P2:33:13 <Angelo> dark its back on btw.
P2:33:17 <cryzed> It has some Memory Leaks
P2:33:24 <cryzed> Very heavy on CPU
P2:33:30 <cryzed> tell him to improve/fix that stuff :(
P2:33:33 <citricsquid> My servers crash after a few days :(
P2:33:34 <Angelo> that port already in use issue is caused by fucked up sockets (in sate FIN_WAIT1)
P2:33:42 <Angelo> i told him already
P2:33:45 <cryzed> Angelo: yes
P2:33:47 <Angelo> my server crashes all the time.
P2:33:56 <cryzed> Angelo: what did he say to the port issue?
P2:34:07 <Angelo> that he'd look into it
P2:34:20 <Angelo> same with the crash when someone joins
P2:34:22 <cryzed> Angelo: because I wrote myself a rather big python script which does all these tasks for me
P2:34:32 <cryzed> Angelo: Backup the map, restart the server on crash
P2:34:39 <cryzed> Angelo: announcements in the channel
P2:34:55 <cryzed> Angelo: but when it tries to automatically restart this fucking port issue is a problem
P2:35:01 <Angelo> my server must be restarted manually (in case of fin_wait1 sockets)
P2:35:07 <cryzed> Angelo: mine too
P2:35:21 <cryzed> Angelo: I somewhere read that you can alternatively wait 10 minutes
P2:35:25 <cryzed> Angelo: any truth to that?
P2:35:29 <Angelo> doesnt work for me
P2:35:41 <Angelo> i just reboot the linux server and wait 5 minutes
P2:35:44 <cryzed> Angelo: yeah for me neither :(. I googled aswell, no fix - workaround for that
P2:35:49 <Angelo> before it has been started back up
P2:36:28 <Angelo> damn..
P2:36:39 <citricsquid> Easiest thing to do is switch the port up 1 num and when you're giving people the URL, use something like mydomain.com/minecraft and switch where that links.
P2:36:53 <Angelo> no
P2:36:57 <Angelo> thats a damn workaround
P2:37:04 <Angelo> just reboot ur complete linux box
P2:37:14 <citricsquid> and take down 16 other minecraft servers? noty.
P2:37:28 <citricsquid> ...I meant 3.
P2:37:29 <Angelo> switching port is stupid too
P2:37:37 <cryzed> Angelo: I think I just found a workaround
P2:37:40 <citricsquid> how come? Disadvantages?
P2:37:42 <Angelo> ?
P2:37:58 <Angelo> no, becuase i only have 1 port forwarded
P2:38:03 <Angelo> cryzed: what?
P2:38:15 <cryzed> Angelo: I'm looking into it right now

P3:37:36 <victory> Hello? ANyone know the answer to this?
P3:37:52 <citricsquid> There's a thread in the forum somewhere
P3:37:55 <citricsquid> involves editing registry
P3:38:00 <citricsquid> because of how Java runs under vista 64
P3:39:02 <victory> well i i will look for it, but i haven't found one yet. 
P3:39:11 <victory> Thanks to you, I have a new keyword to search me :)
P3:39:14 <victory> for*
P3:40:08 <victory> I found the one where you have to add path commands.
P3:40:17 <citricsquid> that's it, I think :D
P3:40:18 <victory> I allready did that and now i have a whole new problem.
P3:40:30 <victory> it's not the 'java' is not recognized.
P3:40:38 <victory> now it's "main" ect.

P4:28:04 <Daidoji> well you're out of luck
P4:28:11 <Dexter> Yup
P4:28:12 <Daidoji> you have to reset the router to change ports anyway
P4:28:14 <Dexter> Brute force it
P4:28:23 <Daidoji> so they're gonna get booted off regardless
P4:28:50 <Dexter> Can you wait until they aren't using it to reset it?
P4:29:24 <Dexter> Or find out who set the password and get that information

P6:39:06 <akuryo> ?
P6:39:10 <akuryo> MC Party?
P6:39:28 <akuryo> Â¿
P6:39:31 <Joat> I posted on the forums about it. Nobody seems to be commenting on it.
P6:39:49 <Joat> There's no way for me to tell if people like it, hate it, or are even trying it.
P6:40:25 <Joat> I was hoping to get some sort of opinion on MC Party, as well as on a new idea sorta based on it.
P6:40:41 <Joat> The thread: http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=574
P6:41:04 <Joat> It's a sort of challenge mode for Minecraft.
P6:41:33 <Joat> Loosely based on Mario Party. It's more of a series of minigames than an actual game. It's meant to be played alongside Minecraft.
P6:41:45 <akuryo> erm
P6:41:48 <akuryo> what the fuck is it
P6:42:04 <Joat> That's what I was just explaining.
P6:42:27 <akuryo> erm
P6:42:31 <akuryo> basically
P6:42:38 <akuryo> it's just a website that tells you what to do
P6:42:40 <akuryo> erm...
P6:42:48 <akuryo> you could also make your own server you know
P6:43:15 <Joat> Nope. Not allowed to open ports, for one thing. For another, it's more complex than that.
P6:43:43 <akuryo> erm
P6:43:49 <akuryo> i do not understand it anyway
P6:43:58 <akuryo> what does this site exactly do
P6:44:01 <akuryo> it tells rules?
P6:44:04 <akuryo> about minigame you invent
P6:44:19 <Joat> The screenshot will give you some idea.
P6:44:45 <akuryo> CPU are only based on...
P6:44:50 <akuryo> randomness
P6:44:54 <akuryo> about some time
P6:45:08 <Joat> CPU times are roughly random. The times are set per challenge.
P6:45:23 <akuryo> erm.
P6:45:32 <akuryo> i know what is to make a project
P6:45:35 <akuryo> invest time in it
P6:45:43 <akuryo> i suppose the timers and stuff i based on JS
P6:45:57 <Joat> Yes. This is Javascript.
P6:46:01 <akuryo> but i personally don't find this fun, and i'm rating from a third eye view
P6:46:10 <Joat> Third eye view?
P6:46:22 <akuryo> third eye view yeah
P6:46:23 <akuryo> i mean...
P6:46:25 <akuryo> i'm rating it as a player
P6:46:29 <Joat> Ah.
P6:46:41 <akuryo> i'm just telling you that i'm rating it as a player
P6:46:59 <akuryo> because i know how it feels when someone just... rate it like shit, without seeing the work behind
P6:47:17 <Joat> Well, what can I do to improve it? Or do you think the entire concept is out?
P6:47:18 <akuryo> it mays have some potential
P6:47:25 <akuryo> erm...
P6:47:42 <akuryo> i'm thinking =/
P6:47:42 <Joat> What I really need is advice for improvement. I've been flying blind so far, because of no input.
P6:47:57 <Joat> So I have no idea what things have been a step in the right direction.
P6:48:24 <akuryo> i admit what you want to do actually is make some web tool/game for minecraft yeah?
P6:48:44 <akuryo> i think the concept is going in a wrong time, but you're like me, hungry of projects =)
P6:48:52 <akuryo> you may do cool tools for minecraft
P6:48:53 <Joat> I'm not sure I understand what you just said...
P6:48:57 <akuryo> erm...
P6:49:02 <akuryo> so, first, i think the concept is out
10P6:49:05 * LKAFK is now known as LKA
P6:49:08 <Joat> What do you mean by "tool"?
P6:49:13 <akuryo> a tool like...
P6:49:19 <akuryo> you know, the skin uploader...etc
P6:49:20 <Joat> I cannot add functionality to the game itself. That would be illegal.
P6:49:36 <akuryo> i'm not sure it will be considered as illegal, but you may do cool stuff
P6:49:50 <Joat> Not to mention, I know very little of java, and Notch wouldn't let me modify the game anyway.
P6:49:52 <akuryo> what you could do actually is a map uploader
P6:50:01 <akuryo> so...
P6:50:22 <Joat> I cannot create anything that directly interacts with the Minecraft applet.
P6:50:30 <akuryo> i can.
P6:50:38 <akuryo> i'll try to code an uploader
P6:50:41 <akuryo> you have to code the web part

P6:51:02 <akuryo> and make them out when requested
P6:51:05 <Joat> BDD?

P6:51:15 <akuryo> sorry, french abreviation lol
P6:51:18 <akuryo> more like DB =)
P6:51:31 <Joat> Now, what do you mean by a map uploader?
P6:51:37 <akuryo> erm
P6:51:39 <Joat> And me coding the web part?
P6:51:45 <akuryo> so...
P6:51:59 <akuryo> i'll tell you how the whole thing will work
P6:52:05 <akuryo> in my side : the software
P6:52:23 <akuryo> first it reads maps that have been saved in personnal folders(temporary folder actually)
P6:52:30 <akuryo> it hexa read them, and then send to the server
P6:52:36 <akuryo> you store them into a DB
P6:52:50 <akuryo> like....
P6:52:56 <akuryo> name / author / map
P6:53:07 <akuryo> map must be 256x256x64 sized tough
P6:53:11 <Joat> Ah. So it's an online map storage.
P6:53:15 <akuryo> yeah
P6:53:29 <Joat> I'll think on that idea.
P6:53:36 <akuryo> i mean...
P6:53:39 <akuryo> if you do not have access to the server itself...
P6:53:43 <akuryo> you can do something very simple

P6:54:56 <akuryo> no wait... you can put headers
P6:55:01 <Joat> I'm pretty sure PHP uses HTML headers.
P6:55:05 <akuryo> yeah no worry
P6:55:10 <akuryo> the blank page is for reading

10P6:55:36 * UnknownX (chatzilla@66.247.218.200) has joined #minecraft
P6:55:38 <akuryo> we need ID | name | author | map

P6:55:50 <akuryo> i'll need a blank page sending ONLY the map ok?
P6:55:51 <JTE> Okay, now I just need to smoothly scale up the heightmap like you would an image...
P6:56:06 <akuryo> it's pretty simple
P6:56:08 <akuryo> sql request
P6:56:12 <akuryo> just print the map
P6:56:14 <akuryo> nothing else
P6:56:33 <Joat> "Print the map"? You mean store it?
P6:56:33 <akuryo> i'll read the page, add header and footer for the map, and send it into the temporary folders
P6:56:37 <akuryo> no no
P6:56:38 <akuryo> print it
P6:56:40 <akuryo> on the page
P6:56:50 <Joat> Oh, the information?
P6:57:01 <akuryo> like if you access it with a web browser, you'll only the map
P6:57:05 <akuryo> i mean...
P6:57:08 <akuryo> the numbers
P6:57:38 <JTE> Hehe.
P6:58:01 <akuryo> actually...
P6:58:02 <Joat> Well, like I said, I'll think over the idea you have given me. You have been very helpful. However, I need multiple opinions before I throw out MC Party for good.
P6:58:12 <akuryo> ok.
P6:58:18 <akuryo> anyway...
P6:58:24 <akuryo> you could do a simple uploading website
P6:58:29 <akuryo> but only for maps
P6:58:39 <Joat> After all, NO game can get positive reviews from EVERYONE.
P6:58:41 <akuryo> so 5mb max
P6:58:52 <akuryo> erm
P6:59:02 <akuryo> depends of if the review is serious or not
P6:59:10 <akuryo> but i think a perfect game is actually possible
P6:59:17 <vdgmprgrmr> You are wrong.
P6:59:23 <akuryo> i'm right
P6:59:36 <akuryo> who dislike for example...
P6:59:36 <ZomBuster> oh dear
P6:59:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Human nature begs to differ.
P6:59:43 <akuryo> little big planet
P6:59:49 <akuryo> noone can dislike this game
P6:59:58 <vdgmprgrmr> It's a PS3 exclusive.
P7:00:06 <akuryo> this make this game pure shit.
P7:00:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I hate exclusives.
P7:00:07 <akuryo> =(
P7:00:20 <akuryo> some time ago i written in .txt 20 points
P7:00:20 <Quatroking> I decided to no longer save money for a PS3
P7:00:26 <akuryo> which would make my perfect game
P7:00:37 <akuryo> LBP has 19/20
P7:00:41 <akuryo> which is totally awesome
P7:00:45 <ZomBuster> and what are you going to spend it now then Quatroking?
P7:00:46 <akuryo> but the main point is mising
P7:00:48 <akuryo> on PC...
P7:00:50 <Quatroking> I stopped saving up because it would take over 2 months to find a shop that has them in stock
P7:00:56 <vdgmprgrmr> You might wanna note that people will tend to dislike things simply because they are popular.
P7:00:57 <Quatroking> ZomBuster, hold on
P7:01:08 <vdgmprgrmr> And if something is disliked by ANYONE, it is imperfect somehow.
P7:01:09 <akuryo> quatro
P7:01:09 <Quatroking> I have a shopping list
P7:01:10 <ZomBuster> oh come on cant be that hard to get one :P
P7:01:17 <akuryo> you want a PS3 for 25â‚¬ + 7â‚¬ ?
P7:01:23 <akuryo> all new
P7:01:31 <akuryo> packaged
P7:01:32 <akuryo> ...etc
P7:01:40 <akuryo> and every game you want for free with the purchase
P7:01:44 <akuryo> and i'm actually not joking.
P7:01:48 <Quatroking> Sure
P7:02:00 <akuryo> do you mind if assurances lose money?
P7:02:20 <UnknownX> this is why you draw a line on a piece of paper and only allow yourself to see it and you love it so it makes it perfect
P7:02:29 <Quatroking> What is an assurance again (The weak Dutchmen don't understand your hard English)
P7:02:35 <ZomBuster> verzekering
P7:02:43 <akuryo> erm
P7:02:46 <Quatroking> That's insurance
P7:02:51 <ZomBuster> oh eh
P7:02:52 <akuryo> i'm not even sure it's a english word lol
P7:02:59 <akuryo> erm

P7:04:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, I'd say that any piece of media (game or film or music or whatever) that is liked by everyone on the planet has the capacity for far too much power for any one entity.

P8:04:10 <Adurah> Jails were meant to be filled, gotcha.
P8:04:14 <JTE> And dry ice was made to burn your skin off, nya.
P8:04:15 <Quatroking> I can buy dry ice?
P8:04:26 <PuyoDead> just act like you're a school
P8:04:48 <JTE> The idea is, I want my server to be everything that every tool in existence thusfar does and more. Generate maps, apply filters, automatic backups, the works, almost entirely in-game... :3~ It'll be sooo cool.
P8:04:56 <Adurah> Well, I guess your map generator issues would come down to how random you want a map to look.
P8:05:07 <PuyoDead> unless you have a way to get to temperatures of under -80°C or so
P8:05:15 <JTE> I'd just be happy for it to look 'natural'. :(

P8:52:59 <Adurah> Alright, but am I seeing through the water, or is the water not leveling out?
P8:53:02 <JTE> Water is just what appears under a certain height.
P8:53:08 <JTE> The water is level.
P8:53:15 <Adurah> Oh, alright.
P8:53:18 <Adurah> Then it's fine.

P8:54:12 <JTE> With functions I hand wrote thinking this was a GOOD idea.
P8:54:29 <JTE> But it's not, because with the land going up and down like this, there's no flat parts to build on
P8:54:50 <Adurah> You'll have to make some erosion function.
P8:55:50 <JTE> I don't know how to erode. :(
P8:56:05 <JTE> It was hard enough to figure out how to Raise.
P8:56:07 <Adurah> Well, can't say I'd know how to either.
P8:56:56 <JTE> All I know is wind slowly flattens land starting with the most jagged parts, and water cuts deep into the ground but not very wide (which is the opposite)...

P9:09:14 <Jat> next time you get the error try dumping the memory usage through the console and then forcing garbage collection and see how much of a difference it makes maybe?

P9:11:02 <AlLnAtuRalX> killall java_vm, killall opera (or firefox-bin), sudo rm -rf /tmp/minecraft.net, sudo rm -rf /tmp/www,minecraft,net, and clear cache ont eh browser

P9:42:23 <Adurah> And wait for someone to not trigger the lava flood.
P9:42:36 <Super-Dot> :O
P9:42:47 <Super-Dot> There's a single tile of lava somewhere or something?
P9:43:02 <Adurah> Yeah, that thing in the sky.

P9:44:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> let's flood
P9:44:12 <Super-Dot> Oh boyoboy
P9:44:20 <Super-Dot> Just leave my window closed
P9:44:59 <Adurah> Eventually as the server goes up the list someone will try to join.
P9:45:31 <Super-Dot> Servers start at the bottom and work their way up as other servers go down?
P9:45:39 <Adurah> For the most part.
P9:45:45 <Super-Dot> That's neat
P9:47:33 <Super-Dot> So I've been thinking about a concept for a Spleef server
P9:47:42 <Super-Dot> It would be 16x16x16
P9:47:57 <Super-Dot> The very top layer would be grass
P9:47:59 <Adurah> That's certainly a server for it.
P9:48:22 <AnnihilatorBeta> make the whole map 16x16x16 great fun for the whole family
P9:48:33 <Super-Dot> And when people finish spleefing, they're all at the bottom
P9:48:40 <Adurah> Here comes someone...
P9:48:41 <Super-Dot> (Hey, someone joined!)
P9:48:57 <Super-Dot> What's gone?
P9:49:11 <Adurah> They were here before, when someone triggered the lava block.

P9:49:29 <Super-Dot> Wheeee
P9:49:53 <Super-Dot> And an admincrete staircase appears, leading up to an admincrete Spleef platform
P9:50:13 <Super-Dot> And when everyone's ready, someone types "go" or "start"
P9:50:28 <Super-Dot> And the staircase disappears and the platform turns to grass
P9:50:49 <Super-Dot> So it's basically two levels, loaded when someone types a keyword
P9:51:12 <Super-Dot> Cool, my cave is becoming more hospitable
P9:51:38 <Super-Dot> Oh jang
P9:51:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> hospitable
P9:51:48 <Super-Dot> He's building a building right next to me
P9:51:55 <Super-Dot> And I can't enter :(
P9:52:10 <Adurah> Well, kind of thing you have to deal with in such a small map.
P9:52:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> break through his walls
P9:52:30 <Super-Dot> Oh wait, I can extend the building
P9:52:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> say you're koolaid man and he'll let you in
P9:53:53 <Super-Dot> He asked a question and I can't reply D:

P9:54:57 <Adurah> Want a kick?
P9:55:24 <Super-Dot> That'd be cool!
P9:55:55 <Super-Dot> Awesome
P9:56:05 <Super-Dot> Now I can move my mouse
P9:56:25 <Super-Dot> Let's see if it works in Firefox
P9:57:07 <JTE> http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/3195/forestu.png -- I think I made it plant a liiiittle bit too many trees...
P9:57:21 <Adurah> Greenpeace.
P9:57:55 <Super-Dot> Curses
P9:58:02 <Super-Dot> Still doesn't work
P9:58:32 <Super-Dot> That wouldn't work
P9:58:42 <Super-Dot> It's a problem with a Java update
P9:58:58 <Adurah> Oh, crap.
P9:59:11 <Adurah> Downgrade Java?
P10:00:00 <Super-Dot> That seems like the solution, yeah
P10:00:09 <Super-Dot> I wonder if that's easy on a Mac
P10:00:25 <Adurah> Oh, no idea about Macs...
P10:01:44 <Super-Dot> Haha, skin yeah
P10:01:59 <Super-Dot> I think it's a really cool map
P10:02:21 <Adurah> Certainly is unique currently.
P10:03:51 <Super-Dot> Oh gee this is a challenge
P10:03:56 <Super-Dot> Moving down one block
P10:04:02 <Super-Dot> So that I can fit under the roof

P10:04:58 <Adurah> Or, outside of it. :P
P10:05:13 <Adurah> People will spawn in there.
P10:05:33 <Super-Dot> Nope, people will spawn above it
P10:05:39 <Adurah> Oh...?
P10:05:41 <Super-Dot> Though they'll break in immediately
P10:05:46 <Adurah> Put a solid there?
P10:05:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> no, bye
P10:06:05 <Super-Dot> Oh hmm
