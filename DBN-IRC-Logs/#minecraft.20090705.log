A12:11:35 <Tsuta> I like the music

A3:03:53 <Zolyx> So yeah, did I miss anything this past week or so
A3:05:54 <Super-Dot> You missed Notch in his Notchmobile
A3:06:13 <Super-Dot> It's pretty sweet, it drives on the ground and also in the sky
A3:06:25 <Zolyx> o.O
A3:06:56 <Zolyx> Notch gets all the cool stuff
A3:07:06 <Super-Dot> Yeah
A3:07:08 <Zolyx> First a yellow MP nick, now THIS
A3:07:30 <Zolyx> Abuse of power, that's what I call it :p

A3:15:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I still think Minecraft+music is not a good idea.

A3:15:44 <Super-Dot> vdgm also hates babies
A3:15:47 <Super-Dot> and freedom
A3:16:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Yup.
A3:16:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Er...
A3:16:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait.
A3:16:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Shit.
A3:17:00 <Super-Dot> I was wary of the idea of music, but it turned out to be surprisingly unobtrusive
A3:17:02 <Super-Dot> For me
A3:17:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I think it would be best to just have ambient sounds.
A3:17:50 <Super-Dot> A sensible viewpoint
A3:18:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Wind wooshing when you're at a high altitude, birds chirping when you're near wood/leaves.
A3:18:52 <Zolyx> That would be a good addition
A3:19:17 <Super-Dot> That would be neat
A3:19:21 <Zolyx> I guess in time the music will be made optional anyway
A3:19:31 <vdgmprgrmr> It already is optional...
A3:19:35 <Zolyx> Though, it puts me very much in mind of Darwinia :) Which is nice
A3:19:42 <Super-Dot> I maintain that Spleefing music is needed
A3:19:44 <Zolyx> Is it? Oh
A3:20:01 <Super-Dot> You can mute all sounds with M
A3:20:08 <Super-Dot> But you can't turn off only the music
A3:20:14 <vdgmprgrmr> I think Minecraft's range of different activities can't possible be summed up in one, or even ten, twenty different tracks.
A3:20:25 <vdgmprgrmr> (That is, its intended range of activities.)
A3:21:03 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, random dungeon-crawls, zombie-defense, CTF, wilderness survival ALL IN ONE GAME...
A3:21:12 <Super-Dot> It's a voxel playground
A3:21:23 <Super-Dot> It's pretty much a platform
A3:21:58 <vdgmprgrmr> And you'd need TONS of music tracks to cover all the things people can do, whereas simple noises based on the blocks around you would fit most everything, probably.
A3:22:22 <Super-Dot> Yeah
A3:22:30 <Super-Dot> Although
A3:22:49 <Super-Dot> In a Spleef arena, deleting a block should play a guitar chord
A3:23:03 <Super-Dot> And deleting a block that a player is standing on would cause a riff
A3:23:15 <vdgmprgrmr> That would be hilarious.
A3:23:15 <Super-Dot> (electric)
A3:23:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Make a map set it to Spleef-mode ON, and suddenly block-deletion noises change from standard to Spleefy.
A3:24:00 <vdgmprgrmr> 'Tis a good idea, methinks.
A3:24:02 <Super-Dot> Haha
A3:24:26 <vdgmprgrmr> bee-arr-bee
A3:24:59 <Super-Dot> There are a bunch of ways Minecraft could benefit if there were a way to tell the game "this three-dimensional region is a Spleef arena"
A3:27:08 <Zolyx> Being a well-sheltered individual, I have no idea what a Spleef is, or how to care for one
A3:27:17 <Zolyx> Do they eat lettuce?
A3:27:32 <Super-Dot> Haha
A3:27:44 <Super-Dot> Yes they do
A3:27:54 <Super-Dot> Spleef is a sport
A3:28:03 <Super-Dot> Basically, you make a floating floor
A3:28:11 <Super-Dot> And a bunch of guys stand on it
A3:28:19 <Super-Dot> And when the referee says "GO"
A3:28:35 <Super-Dot> Everyone tries to delete the blocks under the other players so that they fall down
A3:28:44 <Super-Dot> The last person standing on the floor wins
A3:28:46 <Zolyx> Haha, nice
A3:28:49 <Super-Dot> It's quite fun
A3:31:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Iamback

A11:43:55 <Prime_2> oh god dammit
A11:44:14 <Prime_2> page title eraser and the translator addon were incompatable with firefox 3
A11:44:24 <Dossy> wat
A11:44:25 <Prime_2> and...
A11:44:30 <Prime_2> *3.5
A11:44:35 <Siiseli> hmm
A11:44:44 <Prime_2> I liked those addons

A11:45:56 <Prime_2> yahuh.
A11:46:03 <Dossy> Why? :|
A11:46:17 <Prime_2> why are you asking?
A11:46:19 <Prime_2> I just did
A11:46:32 <Darkebrz> >->

A11:46:53 <Prime_2> put two and two together and stop delving into a person's private matters
A11:46:53 <Dossy> Well why not just use javascript? :|

A11:47:15 <Darkebrz> Page blocker isnt compatible either

A11:47:30 <Prime_2> Why the hell learn javascript to perform suck a simple task, Dossy?
A11:47:39 <Dossy> Because it's easier?
A11:47:52 <Darkebrz> Its easier to learn javascript then download an addon?
A11:48:07 <Prime_2> ...also, that new tab button from IE7 is looking at me funny
A11:48:22 <Prime_2> I don't appreciate having my tab space reduced
A11:48:44 <Dossy> Um, yeah, it is :p
A11:48:57 <Darkebrz> Im sure theres an option
A11:49:03 <Prime_2> if you can find it, let me know
A11:49:10 <Prime_2> ...in query. I don't have name notice.
A11:49:23 <Dossy> Just do -> Add New Bookmark -> Name the Bookmark something like 'Hide Title' -> In the Location box put: javascript:alert(document.title="");
A11:49:38 <Dossy> Then click inside the ""
A11:49:46 <Dossy> Put in Alt+0160
A11:49:55 <Dossy> As in, Hold alt, press the numbers on numpad

P1:06:49 <wingboy> i hardly play it
P1:06:58 <Eagle> They haven't changed the gameplay at all. :P

P1:07:35 <Eagle> Exactly the same as it was before?
P1:07:38 <Eagle> Because it is.

P1:08:29 <Eagle> Teamwork is much easier that way.
P1:08:32 <wingboy> stupid russians
P1:08:36 <citricsquid> eagle: exactly what I did :D
P1:08:48 <citricsquid> completed entire game on expert with friends, took loads of time.
P1:08:55 <wingboy> the game needs proper fun map
P1:08:57 <Eagle> Survival mode.
P1:09:12 <Eagle> Citric just play Survival mode.
P1:09:25 <wingboy> imo l4d could have been so much better
P1:09:30 <Eagle> Personally I think it's more fun than campaign or versus
P1:09:37 <citricsquid> eagle: I'm going to wait for a new graphics card before I try that, I only get 40FPS atm and it sucks
P1:09:44 <Eagle> Well then.
P1:09:49 <Eagle> Go do that. :P
P1:09:54 <citricsquid> campaign with 3 friends on voice chat was so awesome, "oh god TANK!!!!!!!"
P1:09:57 <citricsquid> it was brilliant fun
P1:10:07 <Eagle> It's like that on survival.

P2:39:00 <Eagle> But the Eaglevirus makes you fly
P2:39:06 <Eagle> So there would be births in the air.

P4:38:05 <Quatroking> Why is minecraft so graphic intensive?
P4:38:12 <Quatroking> They're fucking cubes

P4:38:44 <Siiseli> in java

P4:38:50 <fydo> I challenge you to draw cubes as fast as minecraft can
P4:39:02 <Siiseli> it's really not as fast as you think Parthon 
P4:39:15 <Parthon> what's not as fast as I think?
P4:39:20 <Quatroking> your DICK
P4:39:26 <Quatroking> its SLOW

P4:39:44 <Quatroking> with a TURBO DRIVE (from india)
P4:39:48 <Parthon> always taking his time, making me late for things
P4:39:52 <Rroff> they are drawn pretty fast
P4:39:57 <Rroff> but theres faster methods
P4:40:01 <Parthon> taking 20 minutes where 5 should suffice

P4:40:27 <Super-Dot> Most games get to optimize their polygons so that they take little space
P4:40:31 <Quatroking> You need 20 minutes to rape a girl
P4:40:33 <Quatroking> sad
P4:40:39 <Super-Dot> And so that the polygons you never see don't actually exist
P4:40:46 <Super-Dot> Minecraft doesn't have that luxury
P4:40:55 <Parthon> no?
P4:40:59 <fydo> Super-Dot: why not?
P4:41:02 <Siiseli> Super-Dot, really? minecraft doesn't check for those?
P4:41:02 <Rroff> in theory almost no polygons that you can't see should be drawn in minecrafy
P4:41:04 <Siiseli> why the fuck not
P4:41:20 <fydo> culling is very important

P4:41:27 <fydo> if MC isn't culling, it should be
P4:41:29 <Super-Dot> Maybe they're not drawn, but their presence slows the game down somehow
P4:41:30 <Rroff> its easy to depth first test when your working with voxels
P4:41:31 <Quatroking> I hope Notch will disable rendering the cubes you don't see in the future
P4:41:37 <Parthon> minecraft uses occlusion and backface culling
P4:42:00 <Parthon> and I think it renders depth first, I'm not sure
P4:42:02 <Rroff> backface culling is a given
P4:42:07 <fydo> yeah, of course
P4:42:07 <Super-Dot> Even if you can't see the huge amount of dirt underneath you, it's still there
P4:42:18 <Rroff> its not rendering it all
P4:42:20 <Super-Dot> In other games, the entire floor is one flat polygon
P4:42:22 <fydo> but it shouldn't even be sending polygons to the videocard that exist behind you, for example

P4:42:43 <Parthon> until you dig into it at least
P4:42:47 <Super-Dot> It is if you look down
P4:43:02 <Quatroking> holy shit I made a super discussion just now
P4:43:07 <Parthon> but there's no processing or rendering taking place, it may as well not be there :P
P4:43:17 <Super-Dot> If you look up and there's a clear sky, you get a higher framerate than if you look down and there's dirt underneath you
P4:43:33 <Super-Dot> Even if you're at sea level and you can only see four blocks when you look down
P4:43:35 <Parthon> well .. yeah, because dirt has texture, and the sky is just one colour
P4:43:39 <Rroff> yeah because if you look up theres nothing to test again
P4:43:54 <Rroff> I'm assuming he has a fast test against sky
P4:44:06 <Rroff> if you look down its gotta cast into the array
P4:44:06 <Super-Dot> At sea level I said
P4:44:18 <Parthon> looking down where there's only black rocks below, vs looking down when you are on a flat level with lots of blocks below you render at about the same speed
P4:44:21 <Super-Dot> So there are as many array locations above you as there are below you
P4:44:36 <Rroff> if you can see the sky or mostly see the sky
P4:44:51 <Rroff> theres ways to fast check
P4:44:55 <Quatroking> Where is Notch when you really need him
P4:45:01 <Parthon> rendering speed is purely based on the number of textured polygons in the chunks that are currently on screen
P4:45:07 <Rroff> without having to cast into the array
P4:45:15 <Super-Dot> Notch would have logged off by now anyway
P4:45:26 <UnknownX> i even made notch a song
P4:45:32 <UnknownX> :(
P4:45:48 <Quatroking> I tried to make notch a song but I couldn't get fruityloops to work with my midi keyboard again
P4:46:02 <Super-Dot> Parthon, try this
P4:46:06 <Super-Dot> Go to the edge of the map
P4:46:07 <Quatroking> it worked before but now it's not doing SHIT
P4:46:10 <Super-Dot> Tunnel down
P4:46:18 <Super-Dot> Look towards the edge of the map
P4:46:25 <Super-Dot> Then look towards the inside of the map
P4:46:39 <Super-Dot> Even if you can only see eight blocks, the framerate drops
P4:46:43 <Parthon> it will be slower towards the inside of map
P4:46:54 <Rroff> if your looking outside the map or at the sky
P4:47:02 <Rroff> theres way to fast check what to render
P4:47:02 <Parthon> especially on a new map
P4:47:10 <Super-Dot> No, because at the edge of the map, you're looking at the entire map
P4:47:22 <Super-Dot> In the middle of the map, you're looking at at most half the map
P4:47:45 <Rroff> if you dig a hole and look into the map
P4:47:54 <Rroff> it should be culling 99% of the map
P4:48:10 <Rroff> if not notch needs to work on the code a bit
P4:48:16 <Super-Dot> Maybe the culling is what's dropping the framerate
P4:48:31 <Parthon> it occludes any faces that aren't touching an open tile, and tranforms all tiles involved
P4:48:45 <Rroff> shouldn't be if your depth first testing

P4:51:22 <Super-Dot> It's pretty amazing that the performance is as good as it is

P4:53:07 <Parthon> graphics technology and programming is a very extensive subject
P4:53:31 <Parthon> there's heaps of hacks, tricks and techniques that can be used to make it fast
P4:54:37 <Parthon> I'm stuck on mine atm .. it's similar to minecraft, but the player can slice the world away to reveal the inside of the landmass
P4:54:53 <Parthon> which means 1) batching is out, or 2) I need to figure out a very good way of doing it
P4:55:01 <Rroff> hmm
P4:55:03 <fragmer> Redshift!
P4:55:06 <fragmer> what's going on.
P4:55:13 <Rroff> assuming by billion you mean 1000 million
P4:55:17 <Parthon> yes
P4:55:20 <Parthon> the american billion
P4:55:49 <UnknownX> then trillion then quadrillion
P4:57:02 <fragmer> the American (short) scale has been accepted as standard in UK also, afaik
P4:57:04 <UnknownX> then quabillioshillion
P4:57:08 <fragmer> for like the past 30 years
P4:57:25 <Parthon> yeah, it has become a world standard :(
P4:57:34 <Parthon> but I will never give up my extraneous U!
P4:58:14 <UnknownX> it just feels funny saying one-thousand million
P4:58:35 <fragmer> "milliard" or another common name
P4:58:40 <fragmer> for thousand-million
P4:58:52 <Parthon> I like that word .. milliard :D
P4:59:06 <UnknownX> sounds like 1000 yards -.-
P4:59:07 <Parthon> "I would like a milliard dollars thank you!"
P4:59:38 <fragmer> 1000^5 (quadrillion) on the long scale is "billiard"
P4:59:39 <fragmer> :P
P4:59:39 <Parthon> also .. get with the program america .. the rest of the world uses metric, why not you?
P5:00:01 <fragmer> i'm all for metric
P5:00:06 <UnknownX> metric is baaaad
P5:00:21 <Parthon> is that because no americans can count to 10?
P5:00:32 <UnknownX> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11
P5:00:34 <fragmer> they can count to 12 though!
P5:00:36 <Parthon> metric is easier, you can be lazy :P

P10:52:24 <Prime_2> Whoever told me it was possible to send money to a paypal account WITHOUT a paypal account was bullshitting me.
P10:52:32 <Greenslimy> How do you do actions, sorry im a noob
P10:52:52 <PuyoDead> with /me
P10:52:55 <JTE> They probably meant by credit card or something, Prime_2.
P10:53:01 <Prime_2> I even have this exerpt of a book called paypal hacks which describes how to do just that, lo and behold it didn't work.
P10:53:09 <Prime_2> That's exactly what they meant.
P10:53:13 <Prime_2> and it still isn't possible.
13P10:53:13 * Greenslimy understands

P10:57:09 <JTE> Firesocks.
P10:57:26 <Prime_2> those socks do not appear to have anything to do with firefox, aside from their packaging
P10:57:28 <Prime_2> what is this farce
P10:57:38 <JTE> MADE IN CHINA.
P10:57:50 <JTE> Duh. :P
P10:58:11 <Inschato> I think there was a firefox logo engraved on the socks too
P10:59:17 <PuyoDead> this heightmap turned out kind of boring, but easily buildable http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=f80ebde979f678e601e6b5e1cc2921f9

P11:00:56 <JTE> Heh.
P11:01:44 <Inschato> My first one was pretty wicked, but almost entirely below sea level, I might redo it at a higher brightness

P11:27:04 <LucasAnderson> is nitch on?
P11:27:50 <JTE> Nitch? No, Nitch is never on anymore.
P11:28:53 <PuyoDead> how about lilo and stich?
P11:28:59 <JTE> http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/7703/no1ch.png -- I saw my friends make Notch fly off in a Notchmobile before, though. That was pretty cool.
P11:29:19 <vdgmprgrmr> LucasAnderson, you seriously just checked ten minutes ago.
P11:29:22 <Inschato> He gets a yellow name? >_>
P11:29:25 <vdgmprgrmr> He's not on!
P11:29:32 <Inschato> Could probably hack that in for anyone though..
P11:29:53 <JTE> Yeah, he gets a yellow name by default.
P11:29:58 <JTE> I made my name red. :3
P11:30:47 <vdgmprgrmr> How do you make your name a different color?
P11:30:55 <JTE> With color codes.
P11:31:00 <vdgmprgrmr> ...

P11:31:09 <Greenslimy> Where?
P11:31:17 <Inschato> So you actually made your account name &4___?
P11:31:29 <alexsuraci> gah, getting a NullPointerException trying to load
P11:31:30 <JTE> &c, actually.
P11:31:35 <Inschato> Green: http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=800
P11:32:12 <Greenslimy> Oh, thank you Inschato
P11:34:22 <Inschato> You know, Notch's blog post from a few days ago is kind of misleading, you can only get so much FPS hardware side before it no longer matters, because your monitor won't support it.
P11:35:24 <JTE> Still, having the game THINK and try to RENDER at 140 frames per second is a tad much.
P11:35:28 <JTE> Especially for a Java applet.
P11:35:46 <LucasAnderson> hm... some one said notch was on and
P11:35:50 <LucasAnderson> I wanted to check
P11:35:52 <JTE> It should be limited to something like 20 fps, tops, if it's not supposed to eat your cpu alive. :(
P11:36:14 <JTE> Nobody but us ghosts at the moment, Lucas. Sorry.
P11:36:54 <PuyoDead> Lucas, someone lied to you
P11:38:01 <Inschato> 20 is pretty crappy looking actually

P11:49:10 <PuyoDead> I'm guessing it has to do with infinity, though
P11:49:30 <Infinity> DING
P11:49:43 <Infinity> i love how chatzilla makes a ding
P11:49:45 <Infinity> when you say my name

P11:50:13 <Infinity> forgot a comma

P11:51:18 <PuyoDead> nope, no problems here today
P11:51:20 <Infinity> Puyo i own the [SNiPE] servers tel me if you want OP
P11:51:25 <Infinity> PuyoDead
P11:51:33 <alexsuraci> Jat: is it freezing or locking the input?
P11:51:34 <Jat> it sort of freezes for like 10-20 seconds then unfreezes for a few seconds then freezes again and then unfreezes again and so on
P11:51:35 <Infinity> i have to say full name to make it ding >.<
P11:51:36 <PuyoDead> oh man, the onion movie is a pretty big letdown
P11:51:41 <alexsuraci> ah
P11:51:45 <Jat> completely freezing alex
P11:52:05 <Jat> everything just stops completely even if windows is in the middle of shutting down
P11:54:16 <Jat> asnd that includes no input
P11:55:01 <Greenslimy> The Bates 100?! Last time I checked, it didnt even have the delete key!
P11:55:05 <PuyoDead> oh, sorry. I said your name infinity, because LucasAnderson was asking about the server
