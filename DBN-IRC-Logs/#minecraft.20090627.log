A12:43:34 <Punx_Work> this new posts bulshit is retarded
A12:44:09 <Roras> because:
A12:44:09 <Roras> 1. this irc is full of people who cant handle illogacy
A12:44:09 <Roras> 2. the game is filled with all sorts of griefers
A12:44:09 <Roras> 3. i dont like what the people talk about
A12:44:54 <Roras> and also... people dont understand me, so they treat me like crap
A12:45:42 <Dilt> i lol
A12:45:59 <Dilt> irc drama is total lol, and these griefers remind me of the old blockland
A12:46:01 <Punx_Work> lol http://picturesforsadchildren.com/blog/famous.png
A12:46:17 <Punx_Work> roras fuck off
A12:46:25 <Punx_Work> quit being a little queer

A12:46:50 <Drakkar> dilt
A12:46:52 <Roras> i may leave when i want
A12:46:53 <Drakkar> just realise
A12:46:54 <Drakkar> right now
A12:46:57 <Drakkar> this is blockland
A12:47:01 <Dilt> but beteter
A12:47:04 <Drakkar> yeah
A12:47:05 <Drakkar> but still
A12:47:06 <Dilt> i know
A12:47:10 <Drakkar> it'll attract the same people
A12:47:11 <Dilt> there's a reason i don't play blockland anymore
A12:47:22 <Drakkar> at least it has one thing on it though
A12:47:28 <Dilt> and i'll give you the hint: it reallly wasn't the community, it was the person who made it
A12:47:35 <Drakkar> notch enjoys developing and is actively developing
A12:47:45 <Drakkar> unlike whatshisname
A12:47:51 <Dilt> drakkar, i spent the most on his game :D
A12:47:59 <Drakkar> ?
A12:48:01 <Drakkar> notch?
A12:48:08 <Dilt> yep
A12:48:11 <Drakkar> lawls
A12:48:12 <Drakkar> yeah
A12:48:12 <Dilt> everyone paid uh
A12:48:15 <Drakkar> I'm holding off
A12:48:15 <Drakkar> but
A12:48:17 <Dilt> 9.95 euros translated
A12:48:24 <Roras> 14$
A12:48:32 <Drakkar> that's because I haven't gotten confirmation whether I'm slushed or not
A12:48:33 <Drakkar> which is GOOD
A12:48:33 <Dilt> but i had a screwed up deal with my money, so i stole 3 bucks from quadro, and gave $15 to notch
A12:48:42 <Dilt> so i paid more than everyone else, even with the paypal fees
A12:48:42 <Drakkar> but it'll still take time
A12:49:32 <Punx_Work> slushed?
A12:49:45 <Roras> drakkar
A12:49:49 <Roras> did punx block em
A12:49:51 <Roras> me*
A12:49:54 <Drakkar> ?
A12:49:56 <Drakkar> I dunno
A12:50:08 <Drakkar> Punx_Work, it's a term for the magazine I'm submitting a story to
A12:50:11 <Drakkar> basically its just
A12:50:19 <Drakkar> WELP YOU DIDN'T LISTEN / THIS IS COMPLETE CRAP
13A12:50:21 * Drakkar trash

A12:51:06 <Drakkar> I'm a writer
A12:51:18 <Dilt> i'm the king of idiots
A12:51:18 <Drakkar> submitting to magazines is like freelancing
A12:51:19 <Drakkar> :P
A12:51:24 <Punx_Work> oohhh
A12:51:30 <Roras> does it pay
A12:51:31 <Punx_Work> no, the way you worded it confused me
A12:52:04 <Roras> ...
A12:52:26 <Drakkar> quite a bit
A12:52:31 <Drakkar> I see
A12:52:32 <Drakkar> well
A12:52:34 <Roras> oh
A12:52:41 <Drakkar> slushing is basically the preliminary process
A12:52:56 <Drakkar> where they check if the writer has followed the guidelines for submissions and just
A12:52:59 <Drakkar> general quality check
A12:53:19 <Drakkar> whether or not it's properly formatted, a quick eh is it crap check
A12:53:22 <Drakkar> stuff like that

A12:54:34 <Roras> like

A12:54:57 <Drakkar> I like all types of music though
A12:55:02 <Roras> oh
A12:55:05 <Punx_Work> Well hopefully you get slushed?
A12:55:09 <Drakkar> well
A12:55:13 <Drakkar> slushing means you failed the process
A12:55:13 <Drakkar> :P
A12:55:31 <Drakkar> I think my favorite chiptune musician is actually buzinkai
A12:55:36 <Drakkar> who happens to chillax on this network
A12:55:43 <Roras> hm
A12:56:49 <Roras> what do you do to deal with your personal problems

A1:00:57 <Punx_Work> computers, consoles, nice big tvs and displays
A1:01:00 <Punx_Work> it was the sex
A1:01:05 <Drakkar> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
A1:01:07 <Drakkar> I love that stuff
A1:01:16 <Drakkar> ours was also a gameshop
A1:01:24 <Drakkar> so you could get magic cards and D&D books and shit
A1:01:28 <Drakkar> and there were big ass tables
A1:01:36 <Drakkar> so it was pretty much home

A1:10:11 <Drakkar> undertaking it took alot of chutzpah and finishing it would just give him even more credibility

A2:29:52 <TrueWolves> XD
A2:29:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I agree.
A2:30:00 <TrueWolves> played my fitst game of spleef!
A2:30:06 <TrueWolves> first*
A2:30:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, how about we make May the official, worldwide, Month Of Notch?
A2:30:42 <vdgmprgrmr> The month when we celebrate his existence and play all his games in huge parties?
A2:30:47 <Quatroking> and we can onyl eat butterscotch during that month
A2:30:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Well...
A2:30:59 <Quatroking> using our crotch
A2:31:08 <Quatroking> just like notch
A2:31:14 <vdgmprgrmr>  O_o
A2:31:28 <vdgmprgrmr> So like I had an idea right?
A2:31:39 <vdgmprgrmr> You know all these Ocean Build servers?
A2:31:46 <Quatroking> Yeah
A2:31:52 <Quatroking> They're wet.
A2:31:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Imma make an only-dirt map.
A2:32:06 <vdgmprgrmr> It's just a big cube of dirt.
A2:32:10 <Quatroking> Desertbuild.
A2:32:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Oohhhh.
A2:32:39 <Quatroking> just generate a map and replace all tiles with sand
A2:32:40 <Quatroking> zing
A2:32:45 <Quatroking> no more caves either
A2:32:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe have a map where like, it's a huge VERTICAL slab of dirt that covers half the map, so people make caves in it.
A2:33:06 <vdgmprgrmr> And have a huge wall with tons of balconies and such.
A2:33:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe make a canyon like that.
A2:33:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I AM DOING THIS
A2:33:22 <Quatroking> what about a map that has a fucking big 256x256x256 sphere in it, in which you play.
A2:33:27 <Quatroking> Solid rock
A2:33:30 <vdgmprgrmr> No...
A2:33:36 <Quatroking> Spherebuild :D
A2:33:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I wouldn't be able to play it, y'see.
A2:33:44 <Quatroking> I would
A2:33:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Well but I matter more.
A2:33:57 <vdgmprgrmr>  :|
A2:33:58 <Quatroking> considering how big 256x256 is
A2:34:06 <Quatroking> nah
A2:36:19 <Quatroking> Ugh
A2:36:35 <Quatroking> seems people are starting to use the spleef article to blatantly advertise their spleef servers
A2:37:35 <Quatroking> I'm throwing the page on protection to prevent unregistered people from adding crap
A2:37:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Honestly, I'm kind of okay with that.
A2:38:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, if I want to play Spleef, I am definitely not against having a list of servers that support Spleef.
A2:38:51 <Quatroking> Well I'm currently creating a template for server pages
A2:39:04 <Quatroking> as well as a Server category for people to throw their servers in.
A2:39:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Hm.
A2:39:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Coo.
A2:40:25 <Quatroking> what the hell
A2:40:32 <Quatroking> my userpage says I'm 19
A2:40:44 <Eagle> Shenanigans.
A2:40:55 <Quatroking> I swear it was 15

A3:27:25 <Quatroking> I'm considering liquid cooling
A3:27:34 <vdgmprgrmr> That's a large number of fans.
A3:27:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Do you count processor fan and PSU fan?
A3:28:02 <vdgmprgrmr> If you do, I have three fans.
A3:28:02 <Quatroking> Yeah, and still it has an average temperature of 50 degrees when idle
A3:28:08 <Quatroking> Yes i do
A3:28:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I got three. I usually only have two running though.

A3:37:44 <Punx_Work> quatro
A3:37:54 <Punx_Work> dont go to liq cooling
A3:38:13 <Punx_Work> read up on it, with propper air flow you will get the same results as liquid cooling
A3:38:49 <Punx_Work> I did some work for quite  a few people when I was running the shop, and the overclocked cpu's on good air cooling had the same results as liquid
A3:39:30 <Quatroking> proper air flow? lol? I've got all my cables going BEHIND my motherboard
A3:39:39 <Quatroking> there's no way I can have bad airflow
A3:39:54 <liq3> liquid nitrogen is the best cooling...
A3:39:58 <liq3> assuming you don't overcool. :/
A3:40:17 <Punx_Work> you have everything flowing through the computer, in the front out the back>?
A3:40:25 <Punx_Work> side cooling on the HD's?

A4:43:22 <Quatroking> just like the names above people
A4:43:26 <TrueWolves> XD
A4:43:34 <Quatroking> and to remove it just go stand o nthe same tile and do /removetext
A4:43:44 <TrueWolves> lol
A4:43:45 <Quatroking> *on the
A4:43:51 <Quatroking> would be great to make signs
A4:44:03 <Quatroking>  /text "Quatroking's crib"
A4:44:12 <Quatroking>  /text "cheese storage"
A4:44:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Wow.
A4:44:27 <Quatroking>  /text "do not enter or we will fuck up your shit"
A4:44:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm suddenly torn between standard signs and Quatroking's idea...
A4:44:38 <TrueWolves> XD
A4:45:04 <Quatroking> but have a maximum amount of signs, of course, to prevent spamming of signs
A4:45:15 <TrueWolves> only admin's would be able to place them.
A4:45:45 <Quatroking> have the server properties decide the amount
A4:45:52 <Snowman> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=3515#p3515
A4:45:54 <TrueWolves> though a non admin that was known could proubly ask for someone to do it for them.
A4:46:16 <Quatroking> and admins can do infinite
A4:46:37 <Quatroking> that way we won't have "eat dick" showing up everywhere
A4:46:54 <citricsquid> it's more fun building text
A4:47:21 <Quatroking> I don't like to have an enormous sign next to a little building that's ten times as big as the structure itself
A4:47:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree with Quatroking.
A4:47:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I think we should have sign blocks.
A4:48:03 <Punx_Work> slocks
A4:48:08 <Quatroking> socks
A4:48:15 <Quatroking> I'm not wearing any
A4:48:16 <Quatroking> :O
A4:48:20 <Punx_Work> i am :(
A4:48:34 <Quatroking> i feel so naked right now
A4:48:38 <Quatroking> D:
A4:48:45 <Punx_Work> thats how i like it
A4:48:50 <Punx_Work> 22498.28
A4:48:51 <TrueWolves> bigtext won't die from this, I can bet you that
A4:48:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Would it be possible to have a sign block with little text on it, so you don't have to mouse over it, but you have to just be close enough to read it?
A4:48:52 <Punx_Work> oops...
A4:48:58 <Snowman> oh i found out what the problem was
A4:49:01 <Snowman> CITRIC!
13A4:49:17 * Snowman throws a bucket of water in citric's face
A4:49:33 <Quatroking> vdgmprgrmr: normal player names are barely readible from distance
A4:49:38 <citricsquid> yessss I'll do it
A4:49:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah but they're readable at medium distance at least.
A4:49:51 <TrueWolves> <TrueWolves> allright last request: Will signs that while you are pointing at them it shows the text saved to them placable by admins, hows that? <-- thanks to quatro, perhaps have a sign block in 2 versions, a "sign going 4 ways or something, as well as a normal looking block that displays the text
A4:49:54 <Quatroking> so if the signs have the same sign and font it wouldn't really matter that much
A4:49:57 <Snowman> no citric wait
A4:49:59 <Quatroking> true true
A4:50:03 <Snowman> you swapped the upload boxes
A4:50:19 <Snowman> the preview says upload and the upload says preview
A4:50:20 <Quatroking> Notch did you fell asleep or are you simply stunned by my awesome idea?
A4:50:28 <08Notch> elin called!
13A4:50:36 * Quatroking slaps Notch
13A4:50:43 * Notch stabs Quatroking 
A4:50:46 <TrueWolves> I helped spark the idea ;.; (I think)

13A4:50:54 * Quatroking sonic BOOMS Notch
13A4:51:03 * Notch zerg rushes Quatroking

13A4:51:47 * Punx_Work eats quatro
A4:51:48 <Snowman> IE8
A4:52:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Arg! There was something I was going to suggest but I've forgotten it!
A4:52:13 <08Notch> ooh
A4:52:20 <Quatroking> PunX_work all my bases belong to me
A4:52:23 <TrueWolves> big text will allways be there for 1: flair 2: readable at a huge distince
A4:52:35 <vdgmprgrmr> And it stands the hell out.
A4:52:36 <Quatroking> and cockspam
A4:52:39 <Punx_Work> quatro i eatid ur bases
A4:52:41 <vdgmprgrmr> You can't NOT read it.
A4:52:50 <Quatroking> gotta love a huge sign saying "BALLS" in the sky
A4:53:03 <Quatroking> punx_work who ever said i have a brain
A4:53:12 <Quatroking> who ever said I'm a human
A4:53:14 <Punx_Work> not I
A4:53:18 <Snowman> http://i41.tinypic.com/99dra9.png
A4:53:20 <Punx_Work> thats why i ate your bases not ur brain
A4:53:21 <Quatroking> WHO EVER SAID I'M NOT A FUCKING AI
A4:53:23 <Snowman> I have to put it like this
A4:53:25 <TrueWolves> I should remake the "Itburns" bigtext I got kicked for a lot on redshifts server, I think he'd lol if I did that
A4:53:32 <Quatroking> I'M GOING TO FUCKING SKYNET ON YOU
A4:53:34 <Quatroking> WPP
A4:53:35 <Quatroking> FFH

A4:53:55 <TrueWolves> I'll ask him first, but theres more colorfully blinding things on that server, I love that server
A4:53:58 <Quatroking> Skynet has no plug
A4:53:59 <citricsquid> It's all aligned wrongly.

A4:54:26 <Snowman> W/e ill just keep spamming the site with my skins :D
A4:54:39 <citricsquid> use a better browser >=(
A4:54:42 <Quatroking> snowman you're dutch, start using firefox
A4:54:49 <Snowman> youre Dutch too
A4:54:54 <Quatroking> yes, and I use firefox
A4:54:59 <Quatroking> because everyone in holland does
A4:55:03 <Snowman> So stfu Martijn
A4:55:08 <Quatroking> >:C
A4:55:12 <Snowman> :D
A4:55:21 <Quatroking> with your stupid wanadoo
A4:55:26 <Quatroking> do they actually still exist
A4:55:59 <Quatroking> so anyways Notch what do you think of my idea
A4:56:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Hey when will mushrooms become hardier?
A4:56:10 <TrueWolves> I had a part in the idea ;.;
A4:56:23 <Quatroking> I designed it Truewolves, shaddap
A4:56:24 <Snowman> no
A4:56:27 <TrueWolves> v.v
A4:56:29 <08Notch> I think I prefer the signs. =)
A4:56:32 <Snowman> It became orange
A4:56:37 <08Notch> floating text everywhere is distracting
A4:56:38 <Snowman> and that became online
A4:56:41 <Snowman> and it sucks
A4:56:48 <Quatroking> >:C
A4:56:49 <08Notch> i kinda want to get rid of the floating text over players as well and just have it on mouse-over
13A4:56:52 * Quatroking slaps Notch again
A4:56:57 <Snowman> quatro 3fm or 538? :D
A4:57:09 <Quatroking> 538, 3FM is almost as shit as skyradio
A4:57:17 <Snowman> yeah :D
A4:57:20 <Snowman> I can talk with you
A4:57:28 <Quatroking> So can I, I talk a lot with myself.
A4:57:40 <Snowman> Some douchebag on the forums listens to 3fm >.>
A4:57:47 <TrueWolves> Hey notch, when I finish the Eagle 4, a 8 floor underwater spaceship thing shaped a bit like an eagle, you think you can pay a visit?
A4:58:01 <Snowman> Hehe I put 7 skins on minecraftskins.net :D
A4:58:12 <Quatroking> I should submit mine but I'm too lazy
A4:58:33 <Quatroking> plus its a bitch to make screenshots of them because the skin previewer is SHIT
A4:58:44 <Quatroking> you hear that Notch, its SHIT
A4:58:50 <Quatroking> SSSSSSHHHIIIIIITTTTT
A4:59:08 <Quatroking> Unrealistic as hell, nobody walks like that
A4:59:27 <TrueWolves> block pets! buy them for just 2 euros! give them your own custom blockpet skin!
A4:59:27 <Quatroking> looking around constantly while waving your arms like you have fucking parkinson
A4:59:29 <Snowman> NSFW NSFW http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=584 NSFW NSFW We got bots on the forums again
A4:59:39 <Quatroking> :D
A4:59:44 <Quatroking> wait
A4:59:45 <Quatroking> WTF
A4:59:50 <Quatroking> what the fuck happened to that dick
13A5:00:06 * TrueWolves loves the idea of blockpets
A5:00:12 <Punx_Work> lol sexy catsuits that are cheapfarmsex sluts
A5:00:20 <citricsquid> It's not even a bot, it's a real person signing up.
A5:00:25 <Quatroking> indians
A5:00:40 <Punx_Work> salt n pep sexpie sexy torrents 
A5:01:38 <TrueWolves> Citric, can you bring up the blockpetminecraft idea up to notch? I got to go x.x
A5:01:42 <Quatroking> that's hot.
A5:01:52 <Quatroking> FUCK YES BLOCKY DOGS
A5:02:16 <TrueWolves> you design some sort of skin for them to.
A5:02:38 <Quatroking> they follow you around and you have to feed them once in a while and when you dont they fall apart
A5:02:42 <Quatroking> with a pop animation
A5:02:47 <Quatroking> just like tiles
A5:02:50 <TrueWolves> shouldn't be to hard when block animals and creatures are planed for survival
A5:02:53 <TrueWolves> XD
A5:02:58 <TrueWolves> pop animation XD
A5:03:10 <Quatroking> like a block being removed
A5:03:14 <Quatroking> exploding block dogs :D
A5:03:18 <Arzock> I made a gold duck statue in my courtyard.
A5:03:19 <TrueWolves> I know, I thought it was funny
A5:06:26 <TrueWolves> hell, if revenue is a problem, have a bunch of templates (dog/cat template, bird template, fish template, horse template) at a cost of a half to one and a half euros based on how complex they are and if they do anything (horses being ridable)
A5:06:31 <TrueWolves> thats getting quite complex though
A5:06:39 <TrueWolves> I'd be happy with a little block dog to start
A5:06:53 <Quatroking> I don't want to pay extra
A5:07:01 <TrueWolves> nor do I
A5:07:04 <Quatroking> however pets as a premium feature would be nice
A5:07:46 <TrueWolves> Well, being a pet has it's own custom skin, I would guess so.
A5:08:06 <Arzock> http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r121/arzock/gold_duck.jpg

A6:21:04 <Quatroking> <vdgmprgrmr: you know
A6:21:05 <Quatroking> i don
A6:21:05 <Evil-Ville> Overworld will always exist no matter how much he destroys though
A6:21:09 <Quatroking> i don't care.
A6:21:15 <Quatroking> I really, really don't.
A6:21:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Hey man, just saying, you know.
A6:21:31 <Quatroking> Yeah
A6:21:34 <Quatroking> but I don't care
A6:21:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't really care whether or not you care, so meh.
A6:21:40 <Quatroking> just saying too
A6:21:49 <Quatroking> i don't care about that either
A6:21:53 <Quatroking> >:D
A6:21:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay.
A6:22:21 <vdgmprgrmr> There's just some really, really cool shit that could be done with this.
A6:22:39 <Evil-Ville> No way
A6:22:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I know, never woulda thunk it, right?
A6:22:50 <Quatroking> i don't care man, i don't care
A6:23:03 <Quatroking> it's just one of those days I guess
A6:23:09 <Quatroking> where I don't care about FUCK
A6:23:19 <Evil-Ville> There's just these blocks... and you can build with them
A6:23:24 <Evil-Ville> What could you possibly do with that huh
A6:23:28 <vdgmprgrmr> One that would prolly be pretty easy to do: constant rain of meteors which destroy land, you have to find an object without dying.
A6:23:36 <Quatroking> zomg sims 3
A6:23:36 <Quatroking> http://www.quatroworld.org/img/Screenshot-2.jpg
A6:23:38 <vdgmprgrmr> That's the whole thing. But I think it might be pretty fun.
A6:24:05 <Siiseli> meh, sims 3
A6:24:13 <Evil-Ville> Why is that man unscrewing the computer while the monitor is sitting on top of it
A6:24:23 <Quatroking> he's overclocking it, don't you see
A6:24:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Does anyone seriously have horizontal computers anymore?
A6:24:45 <Quatroking> in the sims 3 your sims just constatly rams the pc while overclocking it
A6:25:00 <Quatroking> I've got one behind me
A6:25:07 <Quatroking> didn't turn it on in months
A6:25:11 <vdgmprgrmr> See?
A6:25:14 <Quatroking> I already forgot if it works or not
A6:25:22 <Quatroking> probably not
A6:25:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Horizontal computers are frickin' OLD SCHOOL.
A6:25:47 <Quatroking> then why do they still sell desktop cases
A6:25:52 <Quatroking> multimedia purposes?
A6:26:03 <vdgmprgrmr> I should get one, and use it as a dedicated retro gaming machine.
A6:26:14 <vdgmprgrmr> That would be awesome.
A6:26:16 <liq3> Horizontal computers?... what's a h-PC?
A6:26:24 <Quatroking> those old flat ones
A6:26:26 <vdgmprgrmr> liq3, seriously?
A6:26:28 <liq3> >.>...
A6:26:29 <Quatroking> you used to put your monitor on
A6:26:41 <Quatroking> instead of the towers everyone uses now
A6:26:53 <vdgmprgrmr> And without any ridiculous doors.
A6:26:54 <liq3> It's just a case... I had an old h-PC and took everything out and put it in a tower case, so I could upgrade the Vcard and PSU (they wouldn't fit in old case). 
A6:27:30 <vdgmprgrmr>  >.>
A6:27:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm tired or something.
A6:27:46 <Snowman> life?
A6:27:48 <Snowman> end it now
A6:27:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm all talky.
A6:28:45 <liq3> ZOMBIE SEIEGE, IS GONNA BE AWESOME.
A6:29:07 <vdgmprgrmr> YES IT IS
A6:29:07 <liq3> What kinda forts everyone gonna build in it? O.o
A6:29:23 <liq3> I think Ima make a low fort and cleare all the area around it. :D
A6:29:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Imma dig in, in a literal sense.
A6:29:36 <liq3> Maybe add a moat.
A6:29:44 <Snowman> make a huge tower
A6:29:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Small hillside cave fortress.
A6:29:51 <liq3> Huge tower might work.
A6:29:59 <liq3> Although I'd assume zombies can climb....
A6:30:07 <_spondy> /solid rock cube
A6:30:14 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A6:30:18 <liq3> spondy: You won't be able to.
A6:30:21 <vdgmprgrmr> -_-
A6:30:24 <_spondy> yeh no shit :P
A6:30:34 <liq3> 1. You have to dig before you can create.
A6:30:43 <liq3> 2. You can't dick admincrete.

A6:30:52 <vdgmprgrmr>  O_O
A6:30:59 <liq3> rofl.
A6:31:06 <Kinhoshi> I'm gonna make a huge one block tower thing, set my respawn point at the very top, and delete it all, then constantly hit r. Which probably won't work at all, but it'd be funny if it did
A6:31:07 <Siiseli> oh how funny
A6:31:15 <vdgmprgrmr> How did you do that, liq3?
A6:31:32 <liq3> Kinhoshi: I bet we won't have respawn points in survival/zombie seige.
A6:31:41 <Siiseli> he was trying to be funny vdgmprgrmr 
A6:31:42 <Kinhoshi> Yeah, I figured. :P
A6:31:58 <liq3> Siiseli: No, it was a serious typo. o.O
A6:32:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Just got your muscle memory set on cocks is all.
A6:32:21 <Siiseli> oh
A6:32:32 <Evil-Ville> Siiseli just because you don't constantly think about dicks doesn't mean other people don't
A6:32:33 <liq3> vdgmprpgrmr: i have no idea.
A6:32:43 <Quatroking> he has dicks in his heads
A6:32:48 <liq3> ...
A6:32:55 <Quatroking> all of 'em
A6:32:55 <Siiseli> Evil-Ville, I only think about your fick <3
A6:32:58 <Siiseli> dick*
A6:33:32 <Evil-Ville> Not going to assembly
A6:33:37 <Siiseli> :D
A6:33:43 <Siiseli> you'd be raped <3
A6:33:51 <Siiseli> no, we'd make sweet sweet manlove
A6:33:53 <Siiseli> on the roof
A6:33:59 <Siiseli> on a moonlit night
A6:34:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm constantly thinking about Notch's amazing penis.
A6:34:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Er... I mean GAME.
A6:34:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Not penis.
A6:34:24 <08Notch> :-o
13A6:34:31 * liq3 waits forever one to stop with the dick jokes.
A6:34:37 <Siiseli> Notch, what api do you use in yer game btw
A6:34:43 <Siiseli> I mean, you use openGL right?
A6:34:48 <Quatroking> what the fuck
A6:34:50 <08Notch> aye
A6:34:52 <Quatroking> dis Gmod got updated?
A6:34:53 <08Notch> lwjgl
A6:34:53 <Siiseli> mmkay
A6:34:55 <Quatroking> *did
A6:34:58 <Siiseli> I thought so
A6:35:01 <Evil-Ville> Gmod blows
A6:35:10 <Quatroking> I all of the sudden get background music and an annoying sound in the menu
A6:35:13 <Siiseli> Notch, I'm almost forced to use openGL in a 2d game :|
A6:35:14 <citricsquid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummingtonite
A6:35:16 <Siiseli> such a silly thing imo
A6:35:25 <Quatroking> ah yeah it did
A6:35:34 <_spondy> minecraft is 3d
A6:35:41 <vdgmprgrmr> lol@cummingtonite
A6:35:46 <Siiseli> _spondy, ORLY :O
A6:36:02 <liq3> spondy, we had NO idea.
A6:36:02 <_spondy> yarly
A6:36:03 <Siiseli> I mean using openGL for 2d is silly imo
A6:36:14 <Siiseli> you can't really do per pixel stuff
A6:36:21 <Snowman> WIP: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Snowman
A6:36:22 <Siiseli> you have to "fake" the 2d
A6:36:36 <liq3> Siiseli: Not really, it makes GFX clock time nearly non-existent.
A6:36:45 <Evil-Ville> Hahaha you can't edit the cummingtonite article
A6:36:49 <08Notch> lol
A6:36:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I always thought Minecraft had a number of dimensions equal to the amount of days which had passes since the most previous saturday, assuming that saturday was also the second or fourth saturday of the month.
A6:36:50 <Siiseli> okay that's correct. it's fast
A6:36:55 <liq3> Siiseli: Also, it has 2d mode. ;/
A6:36:56 <vdgmprgrmr> *passed
A6:37:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Butthatsjustmeiguess
A6:37:21 <Siiseli> liq3, what kind of 2d mode do you mean :p
A6:37:31 <liq3> Orthagonal mode i think.
A6:37:39 <Siiseli> cos' I'm just setting my view to orthagonal or something
A6:37:40 <liq3> I'm pretty sure it removes any persective calcs.
A6:37:43 <Siiseli> then I made a drawpic
A6:37:59 <Siiseli> which basically makes 2 polygons that form a quad
A6:38:03 <Siiseli> not quad damnit
A6:38:08 <Siiseli> quad is.. yeahj
A6:38:11 <Evil-Ville> Notch you're updating today right
A6:38:16 <08Notch> yes
A6:38:18 <Snowman> ffs kleiner has a really annoying haircut :/
A6:38:21 <08Notch> client only
A6:38:27 <Siiseli> (using 2 polygons instead of quads cos some stuff don't like quads, such as opengl es)
A6:38:38 <Siiseli> so umm.. then I draw a texture on it
A6:38:45 <Siiseli> and thus I have 2d
A6:38:51 <vdgmprgrmr> So uh did anyone else read that cummingtonite article and find all the many possible sexual innuendos in the sidebar?
A6:38:53 <liq3> Siiseli: And?
A6:39:09 <Siiseli> liq3, I think that's rather silly
A6:39:19 <Siiseli> having to do all that
A6:39:23 <citricsquid> Cleavage 	56 and 124 - good; {110} perfect
A6:39:27 <liq3> Then, make functions to automate it. :/
A6:39:33 <Siiseli> I did, of course
A6:39:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Luster  Vitreous - Silky
A6:39:57 <liq3> All 2D APIs do is do those exact same calls.
A6:40:19 <liq3> They just hide them behind a bunch of functions and classes.
A6:40:19 <Siiseli> but anyway.. there's stuff like pixel perfect collision detection, cos' there's no real pixels you have to do some polygon collision stuff
A6:40:22 <Siiseli> meh
A6:40:49 <ReaperSWE> paging Notch
A6:40:56 <08Notch> ?
A6:40:57 <ReaperSWE> Another bug:
A6:41:01 <liq3> Siiseli: Uh, I'm pretty sure you can do pixel perfect CD with opengl.
A6:41:04 <ReaperSWE> deopped users can still make solids
A6:41:16 <08Notch> client side, yes. But do they show up for others?
A6:41:21 <ReaperSWE> yes
A6:41:28 <08Notch> err, are you sure?
A6:41:38 <ReaperSWE> err.. not really
A6:41:41 <liq3> lol.
A6:41:47 <08Notch> haha
A6:41:47 <ReaperSWE> Don't know who's op and who's not >.<
A6:42:02 <08Notch> whoa eclipse crash
A6:42:18 <Snowman> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Snowman
A6:42:19 <Siiseli> liq3, do tell. how does one do pixel perfect stuff with uh.. polygons
A6:42:34 <liq3> Siiseli: You ignore the polygons and use the textures. :/
A6:42:41 <Evil-Ville> If you don't even know who's op and who isn't then there's too many ops
A6:42:47 <Siiseli> dhm.. hmm
A6:42:52 <Siiseli> thanks I'll look into it
A6:42:56 <ReaperSWE> its' not my server :-P
A6:43:06 <liq3> Last I checked when using sprites in opengl for 2d, the polygons are more or less just canvases for the sprites.
A6:43:08 <Evil-Ville> Yes but still
A6:43:14 <liq3> i.e. a place to draw them.
A6:43:28 <liq3> the actual polygons have no real impact on anything.
A6:43:29 <Siiseli> hmnm
A6:43:40 <Siiseli> thanks
A6:44:52 <burntfaceman> love the skin snowman
A6:44:55 <Snowman> its wip

A6:45:30 <citricsquid> Notch: Are there ever any plans to have a sort of profile feature in minecraft? It'd be nice if we could have servers we're ops on listed, or have an "owner.txt" file which will mean that server shows up on our "user page".
A6:45:36 <Snowman> http://luminaryuprise.wikidot.com/longest-word
A6:45:44 <Snowman> thats a chemical compound
A6:46:01 <08Notch> yeah, there are vague plans like that, citricsquid

A6:48:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh god that article is rife with obviously sexual references.
A6:48:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe.
A6:48:32 <citricsquid> Dickite has perfect cleavage in the (001) direction
A6:48:40 <vdgmprgrmr> I especially like the last paragraph.
A6:48:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Talkin' about hardness and coloration and such.

A7:05:09 <Marach> is it possible that standalone singleplayer-only version of minecraft will be available for download?
A7:05:26 <Marach> i think it would be 15 minutes of work for notch
A7:06:00 <citricsquid> I think a standalone client has been mentioned before.

A7:09:43 <conman420> half life 2 is a great series
A7:10:07 <Snowman> agreed
A7:10:53 <conman420> They managed to create a deep and compelling storyline without constant cutscenes
A7:11:04 <Marach> i hate when anmin of server is afk and he closes spawn with unbreakable blocks to prevent griefing
A7:11:07 <Marach> admin*
A7:11:14 <conman420> lol
A7:11:17 <Evil-Ville> Yeah that's bullshit
A7:11:25 <conman420> you can get out
A7:11:32 <conman420> I think if you furiously tap enter
A7:11:44 <Evil-Ville> No I've tried that
A7:11:49 <conman420> hmm
A7:11:51 <conman420> there is a way
A7:11:55 <conman420> maybe enter and space?
A7:11:57 <citricsquid> place bricks on the spawn
A7:12:01 <Marach> Zachariasmith's Spleef Server is closed like that!
A7:12:02 <citricsquid> and then it'll force you on the roof
A7:12:06 <conman420> ah
A7:12:12 <Marach> how i can place blocks on myself?
A7:12:14 <Evil-Ville> The problem is that you can't spawn blocks where you are standing
A7:12:14 <Punx> HOME PUNX
A7:12:22 <Marach> to citric^^
A7:12:42 <Marach> in Zachariasmith's Spleef Server im an op anyway ^_^
A7:12:50 <Evil-Ville> I guess you could have someone else do it for you
A7:12:50 <citricsquid> you can't, only secure newplayer traps are 1 block wide, if you're in one of them you're stuffed :D
A7:12:59 <Evil-Ville> But that doesn't work if all of the players in the server are in the prison
A7:13:03 <Snowman> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=3629#p3629
A7:13:22 <Rroff> new player traps are gay
A7:13:35 <Marach> we talk about it all the time now
A7:13:40 <Rroff> well on public ones any way
A7:13:51 <Rroff> its like "we don't actually want anyone on our server" but we are too lazy to make it private
A7:14:07 <Marach> if anyone wants to go to Zachariasmith's Spleef Server, i can open the spawn
A7:14:13 <Evil-Ville> It's also like "please grief me when you finally get out"
A7:14:28 <Snowman> yay now I can be a mingebag in Minecraft
A7:14:29 <Snowman> :D
A7:14:34 <Snowman> I got Kleiner skin

A7:15:17 <Quatroking> and then I cut off their feet and hands
A7:15:18 <Marach> there is nothing harder to create than a good spleef arena...
A7:15:28 <Quatroking> and glue their hands to the place their feet are supposed to be
A7:15:33 <Quatroking> and i let them eat their feet
A7:15:34 <Marach> lol
A7:15:41 <Quatroking> while i cut their stomach

A7:18:36 <conman420> or just support parts of names
A7:18:36 <liq3> basically you type like.. quat[TAB]
A7:18:39 <liq3> and it fills in the rest. :D
A7:18:41 <Quatroking> we must get rid of our senses.
A7:18:48 <Marach> you must
A7:18:50 <Quatroking> before they go haywire
A7:18:51 <Marach> we do not
A7:18:52 <citricsquid> conman: A work around is coming for that, I think, not autocomplete though :)
A7:18:54 <Quatroking> srsly
A7:19:07 <conman420> griefers are starting to have REALLY long names
A7:19:10 <Marach> begin with yourself quat!
A7:19:18 <Quatroking> nah
A7:19:20 <Quatroking> too lazy
A7:20:03 <conman420> we had a griefer that filled up a huge cave with water
A7:20:07 <conman420> and it broke chat for like 2 minutes
A7:20:29 <Marach> you can try to remove part of body that checks if CO2 factor is too high
A7:20:29 <liq3> broke chat?
A7:20:32 <conman420> yer
A7:20:33 <liq3> oh i see.
A7:20:45 <conman420> chat has a lower priority to chunk updates
A7:21:05 <conman420> and it was like 250 chunk updates for about 2 minutes
A7:21:09 <Marach> then you will have to concentrate on breating or you will just stop breathing
A7:21:15 <Marach> lol
A7:21:21 <Marach> and it didnt crash?
A7:21:32 <conman420> no
A7:21:43 <Marach> so whats up with that one-move-command-per-tick thing???
A7:21:49 <conman420> just lagged
A7:22:16 <Marach> buy better pc?
A7:22:21 <conman420> what?
A7:22:25 <Marach> if youre server runner ofc
A7:22:34 <conman420> its bandwidth mate
A7:22:39 <conman420> not cpu
A7:22:58 <Marach> order faster connection?
A7:23:16 <conman420> 250 chunk updates a tick
A7:23:20 <conman420> is going to lag most home broadbands
A7:23:38 <conman420> it doesnt matter if the server has an amazing connection its still limited by the client as well
A7:23:39 <citricsquid> <3 100mbit
A7:23:56 <Marach> :/
A7:24:25 <conman420> I imagine there is some sort of limit to how much stuff can be sent each tick
A7:24:29 <conman420> and chat has a lower priority
A7:24:39 <conman420> so I couldn't ban the guy while he kept griefing for 2 minutes
A7:24:52 <citricsquid> use the console?
A7:24:57 <conman420> not server owner
A7:24:58 <conman420> OP
A7:25:02 <citricsquid> oh
A7:25:04 <Marach> going to yoyogames to download something that wont crash 11 years old pc
A7:25:34 <Marach> yes it has a  hard disk
A7:25:47 <Quatroking> 2GB
A7:25:51 <Quatroking> probably
A7:25:56 <Rroff> roughly how much bandwidth does 250 update in 1 tick rquire?
A7:26:02 <Marach> 40 GB!
A7:26:03 <conman420> I have no idea
A7:26:12 <Marach> was reanimated recently!
A7:26:22 <conman420> I guess its 3 numbers for X Y Z position
A7:26:27 <Rroff> surely it can't be that much
A7:26:28 <conman420> and a number for the material type
A7:26:30 <conman420> or a string
A7:26:36 <conman420> I dunno it was water
A7:26:49 <conman420> so I guess its gunna take up on the CPU as well to trace around it
A7:26:57 <Marach> and user name!
A7:27:01 <conman420> it was a fucking big cavern seriouly
A7:27:12 <Marach> tserver has to know if it has to change block to solid block
A7:27:34 <Marach> so along with block data, user name is sent too
A7:27:38 <conman420> why would it be
A7:27:39 <Rroff> whats the server tickrate? something like 30?
A7:27:49 <conman420> I dunno
A7:28:17 <conman420> I think the cavern was like
A7:28:21 <conman420> 200 by 200 by 50
A7:28:23 <Rroff> 250 tick updates at most wouldn't need more than 50KB/s
A7:28:38 <conman420> probably more
A7:29:02 <Rroff> assuming even 5 bytes per block and a server tickrate of 30fps
A7:29:09 <Marach> i want a standalone singleplayer minecraft version sooooo muuch...
A7:29:11 <Rroff> to see no lag you'd only need approx 38KB/s
A7:29:20 <conman420> well it did lag :v
A7:29:36 <Rroff> prolly combination of CPU, rendering and bandwidth
A7:29:38 <Marach> it doesnt even need to change one line of code!
A7:29:39 <conman420> yes
A7:29:49 <Marach> even i could do this :)
A7:30:07 <Rroff> I'd say the problem is more in the code than hardware performance
A7:30:12 <conman420> yes
A7:30:24 <conman420> java socket probably has a limit to what it can do to
A7:30:26 <Rroff> well any decent server should be upto the CPU load
A7:30:31 <Rroff> and most dedis have 100Mbit connections
A7:31:11 <conman420> Notch might have some sort of limit to how much data the server can send to clients in each tick update
A7:31:18 <Rroff> expect so
A7:31:54 <Rroff> wonder if its possible to accelerate minecraft with cuda heh
A7:32:19 <Rroff> a lot of the processing must be massively parallel
A7:32:46 <ReaperSWE> wtf
A7:32:53 <ReaperSWE> 130 players, 150 servers, 22169 registered, 1 purchases.
A7:33:00 <ReaperSWE> 1 purchases
A7:33:01 <conman420> ????
A7:33:09 <citricsquid> 621 purchases
A7:33:09 <Rroff> on what?
A7:33:12 <conman420> 621 for me
A7:33:13 <Rroff> thats not what I see

A9:00:44 <Zuriki> Thanks squid :D
A9:01:03 <08Notch> the applet should be aligned

A9:03:27 <Evil-Ville> http://ville.poronet.com/spongeland.PNG
A9:03:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Odd.... it's aligned center by default but not when I resize the applet... I guess I'll have to redo the script to resize the DIV also
A9:05:10 <Zuriki> Hang on. If the SP levels are saved on the server, couldn't you just add a link under the applet that links to the dat file :S
A9:05:28 <citricsquid> they don't use the same structure, do they?
A9:05:35 <citricsquid> + how would they load them back in?

A9:21:30 <ZomBuster> Its not a very big deal
A9:21:41 <Evil-Ville> Should still be visible though
A9:22:05 <ZomBuster> maybe order servers on what country they arein
A9:22:06 <citricsquid> wait
A9:22:17 <citricsquid> For us to see the real ping, between us and the server
A9:22:19 <Quatroking> give servers a little flag icon
A9:22:20 <citricsquid> we need to ping it
A9:22:21 <citricsquid> correct?
A9:22:28 <Quatroking> Yesh.
A9:22:33 <citricsquid> pinging 50 servers will take ages
A9:22:46 <citricsquid> flag idea is best, I think.
A9:22:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, no
A9:22:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Q3, same idea, but 100s of servers
A9:23:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> pinging takes about 5 6 seconds
A9:23:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> for about 200 servers

A9:29:18 <Quatroking> it doesn't really track all of my apps good
A9:29:34 <citricsquid> I've done 306 hours in 3 weeks, so 102 hours/week.
A9:29:55 <ZomBuster> I think its pretty good 
A9:30:00 <ZomBuster> it even tracks apps I just made
A9:30:01 <ZomBuster> http://wakoopa.com/software/objtominecraft
A9:30:03 <ZomBuster> lol
A9:30:06 <citricsquid> 15 hours a day I use my pc, lmfao
A9:30:06 <Quatroking> lol
A9:31:02 <Quatroking> it's just that after 30 secs of "idle" (no input) it stops tracking until you do something
A9:31:12 <citricsquid> if you're idle you're not using it ;)
A9:31:15 <Quatroking> which is annoying when you're reading stuff
A9:31:40 <Quatroking> Well I certainly am busy for a few minutes when I'm reading big documents
A9:32:07 <citricsquid> I'm weekly top minecraft user :D
A9:32:23 <Quatroking> are you proud of yourself
A9:32:39 <citricsquid> very
A9:32:59 <Quatroking> are you proud that you spend loads of time on a blocky game, playing with blocks

A10:18:40 <citricsquid> yes, but in paypal, was it in your account?

A10:18:53 <cryzed> hrmmm
A10:18:54 <cryzed> wait
A10:18:55 <Prime_2> Citricsquad, don't you have to have a paypal account to transfer money from a credit card to another paypal account? :/
A10:19:07 <Prime_2> or debit card, for that matter.
A10:19:11 <akuryo> no
A10:19:16 <akuryo> there is an option on paypal
A10:19:19 <akuryo> you can check it
A10:19:22 <citricsquid> prime: No, you don't need a paypal account to pay with paypal, just enter your card details

A10:19:41 <Prime_2> I don't have paypal.
A10:19:44 <Prime_2> do not have.
A10:19:47 <citricsquid> Yes
A10:19:48 <akuryo> you can pay without paypal
A10:19:49 <citricsquid> you don't need it
A10:19:54 <citricsquid> if you go to the payment page
A10:19:57 <citricsquid> and enter your card details
A10:19:59 <akuryo> you ugly stinky moisty bitch
A10:20:02 <citricsquid> it'll accept it, you don't need an account.
A10:20:10 <citricsquid> an account just makes the process easier.
A10:20:16 <Prime_2> ah.
A10:20:23 <citricsquid> so you missed the point ;)

A10:20:55 <cryzed> How should my account be

A10:21:05 <cryzed> yes
A10:21:14 <cryzed> I've got the transaction number aswell
A10:21:18 <cryzed> I think I'll need to wait
A10:21:18 <citricsquid> Have you logged out and back in again on minecraft.net, that might help.
A10:21:20 <cryzed> till he's back
A10:21:22 <cryzed> yes
A10:21:23 <cryzed> I did
A10:21:24 <cryzed> 2 times
A10:21:30 <citricsquid> It's normally instant uless there's problem.
A10:21:42 <cryzed> Well how should he automate it
A10:21:45 <cryzed> it's not possible right?
A10:21:51 <cryzed> He needs to do it manually
A10:21:52 <cryzed> I think
A10:21:55 <citricsquid> No he doesn't
A10:21:59 <citricsquid> it's automatic, integrated.
A10:22:04 <cryzed> shit
A10:22:11 <cryzed> So what do I do now?
A10:22:19 <citricsquid> Just wait, he'll be around soon :D
A10:22:34 <cryzed> okay
A10:22:43 <cryzed> you know when he's normally around?
A10:23:05 <citricsquid> http://filebox.me/files/eiarirx1k_mojangcompleted.JPG It looks like that, right?
A10:23:15 <citricsquid> Not sure, should be here soon :D
A10:23:44 <cryzed> Wait I'm goint o take alook
A10:28:06 <citricsquid> If it says "completed" and your account isn't done - the account you were logged in with when purchasing - then email notch the paypal payment ID and your account name and he'll take a look, or just wait for a bit in IRC :D If it says anything else, it's a problem on your end.

A11:11:02 <Adura> You can script that.
A11:11:14 <Evil-Ville> Should still be in the game
A11:11:23 <Enthernal> but jail would be instead kick
A11:11:53 <Evil-Ville> What difference is there between putting a person in jail for 5 minutes and banning him for 5 minutes?

P12:44:09 <Daidoji> but I kind of remember that being fixed or whatever
P12:44:29 <Daidoji> for a while there you'd play wurm for 8 hours or so and the clock would fast end up being 20 minutes fast
P12:44:40 <Daidoji> TOO MANY FAST
P12:44:57 <akuryo> yeah
P12:45:08 <akuryo> TOO fast
P12:45:18 <akuryo> and it made me so fucking angry

P12:45:31 <Rroff> that little proggie I made seems to prevent it getting out of hand
P12:45:34 <akuryo> too fast and too furious
P12:45:52 <Daidoji> my clock auto-updated every 24 hours so it's no biggie
P12:46:06 <Rroff> which is weird coz the program is basically while(1) { sleep 30 }
P12:46:16 <akuryo> lol
P12:46:17 <ZomBuster> I dont care about my clock speed
P12:46:18 <akuryo> no
P12:46:21 <Rroff> well on my system is causes the NIC to crash after awhile
P12:46:27 <Rroff> if the timer is running fast
P12:46:36 <Rroff> not to mention other issues

P1:14:18 <Evil-Ville> type /solid
P1:14:49 <dodocommander> i did, but it wont let me delete it
P1:15:26 <Meizlizard> Adura, I could boot into windows, but that defeats the purpose.
P1:15:50 <Adura> Just some humour about Macs.
P1:15:51 <Evil-Ville> Try reconnecting to the server dodocommander
P1:17:07 <dodocommander> ty that did the trick

P1:39:36 <Evil-Ville> some ko to 2 mo?
P1:40:47 <Evil-Ville> Oh I see french people use octet instead of byte
P1:41:03 <Adura> Also MIME types.
P1:42:43 <akuryo> erm
P1:42:45 <akuryo> evil
P1:42:49 <akuryo> everyone use octets
P1:42:53 <akuryo> .
P1:43:00 <akuryo> or at least every europeans
P1:43:08 <akuryo> oh wait
P1:43:10 <akuryo> wait wait...
P1:43:17 <akuryo> i think you're totally dumb
P1:43:23 <akuryo> are we talking about bytes or bits
P1:43:29 <akuryo> because bytes = octets...
P1:43:29 <Evil-Ville> Most people use byte when indicating file size
P1:43:37 <akuryo> 1mo = 1mb
P1:43:42 <akuryo> it's the original definition
P1:43:50 <citricsquid> I've never heard of octets before.
P1:43:54 <akuryo> lol.
P1:43:56 <akuryo> it's the same
P1:43:58 <akuryo> exact same
P1:44:03 <akuryo> but byte is the...
P1:44:06 <akuryo> erm
P1:44:10 <akuryo> octet is the correct term
P1:44:16 <akuryo> i don't remind who invented bytes
P1:44:22 <Evil-Ville> In france it is yes
P1:44:26 <akuryo> europe

P1:50:18 <Adura> The low IQ requirement to play and enjoy Minecraft leads to high levels of druggy players, unfortunately.
P1:50:27 <akuryo> =D
P1:50:27 <Quatroking> more than 90% of french can't speak english for SHIT
P1:50:34 <Siiseli> so?

P1:50:59 <Siiseli> I hate that kind of generalization
P1:51:02 <akuryo> erm lol.
P1:51:04 <Siiseli> akuryo, why should we
P1:51:07 <akuryo> you got on the wrong guys
P1:51:14 <Quatroking> I was in fucking paris
P1:51:16 <Siiseli> by generalization I meant the others
P1:51:17 <akuryo> lol
P1:51:19 <akuryo> paris...
P1:51:21 <akuryo> xD
P1:51:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> French language > English language
P1:51:24 <Siiseli> who are like "all french are arrogant"
P1:51:26 <akuryo> if you judge france in function of paris
P1:51:29 <Siiseli> "all x are y" 
P1:51:30 <akuryo> it's pretty normal...
P1:51:32 <Quatroking> tried to buy souvenirs, but no, cordon bleu motherfuckers!
P1:51:38 <akuryo> xD
P1:51:39 <Siiseli> wut

P1:51:51 <citricsquid> belgium is awesome
P1:51:56 <Quatroking> meh

P1:52:06 <akuryo> i'm from the campain =)
P1:52:06 <Testvan> belgium is just half france half dutch
P1:52:07 <Adura> *has
P1:52:16 <Quatroking> belgium is pretty retarded to be honest
P1:52:17 <akuryo> belgium is pretty cool too
P1:52:22 <akuryo> lol
P1:52:33 <akuryo> belgiums are fucking slow
P1:52:36 <akuryo> really...
P1:52:46 <akuryo> belgium is the slow motioned country
P1:52:47 <Siiseli> jesus 
P1:53:00 <akuryo> but being slow isn't a bad thing at all
P1:53:01 <Siiseli> slow as in stupid or slow as in they move unquickly
P1:53:03 <Quatroking> a short time ago there was a belgium girl in the news who had half her face tattood
P1:53:09 <akuryo> no slow as unquickly
P1:53:13 <akuryo> VERY unquickly xD
P1:53:21 <Quatroking> and she sued the tattoo man because she only wanted 2 little starts next to her eyes
P1:53:27 <Quatroking> she "fell asleep"
P1:53:30 <Quatroking> wtf?
P1:53:33 <citricsquid> quatro: I saw that :D
P1:53:36 <citricsquid> I bet $100 she wanted it
P1:53:40 <citricsquid> then realised it looked stupid
P1:53:40 <Quatroking> guess what
P1:53:45 <citricsquid> and wanted to cover her mistake :D
P1:53:45 <Siiseli> well yeha I think judging people by their geographical location is wrong
P1:53:49 <Quatroking> she now works at a tattoo shop
P1:53:49 <akuryo> citrics = yeah

P1:54:10 <Siiseli> but never does living somewhere make you automatically stupid
P1:54:18 <Quatroking> she probably has downs or general belgiuminius
P1:54:21 <Siiseli> or anything, pretty much
P1:54:24 <Evil-Ville> Quatroking she actually wanted all of the stars on her face to begin with
P1:54:32 <Quatroking> then sued the tattoo man

P1:56:37 <akuryo> it's what i tough
P1:56:38 <Adura> You poor soul.
P1:56:39 <Syndlig> TWO.
P1:56:42 <Testvan> i live in new mexico :(
P1:56:46 <akuryo> lol
P1:56:46 <Siiseli> well yeah one thing I agree on the so called general opinion varies from place to place
P1:56:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> i jailbroke my ipod touch gg
P1:56:51 <Evil-Ville> I've never seen any guns
P1:56:59 <Syndlig> In the entire fucking state I've met TWO people who actually carry a gun.
P1:57:03 <akuryo> i know 3 people in my friends which can actually sell me guns
P1:57:10 <Adura> Where I live, I've seen no guns.
P1:57:12 <akuryo> syndlig
P1:57:17 <Syndlig> Well, besides police.
P1:57:19 <akuryo> generally guns are hided
P1:57:26 <Quatroking> Ah, gotta love The Gmod Idiot Box
P1:57:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> i like hided guns
P1:57:32 <akuryo> in france cops do not necessary have guns =/
P1:57:33 <Quatroking> especially the latest episode.
P1:57:39 <Siiseli> but I'm opposed to something like "general opinion" anyway
P1:57:49 <akuryo> siiseli : +14
P1:57:51 <Siiseli> just people not being able to form their own
P1:57:54 <Quatroking> in french they call the moon a fucking croissant
P1:57:57 <Quatroking> *france
P1:58:01 <akuryo> yeah
P1:58:02 <Adura> I'm not opposed to it if I have a logical conclusion.
P1:58:03 <akuryo> and?
P1:58:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> i eat croissants
P1:58:09 <akuryo> it has a croissant shape
P1:58:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> they are pretty delicious
P1:58:11 <Quatroking> a croissant is BREAD
P1:58:14 <Evil-Ville> No it doesn't
P1:58:15 <Siiseli> Adura, if it's your opinion it doesn't matter
P1:58:17 <Evil-Ville> It's round
P1:58:20 <Siiseli> but if you just agree with someone 
P1:58:25 <akuryo> i never called the lune a croissant lol
P1:58:30 <akuryo> but it's right it has it's shape
P1:58:37 <akuryo> i mean
P1:58:38 <Syndlig> the moon's a sphere.
P1:58:39 <akuryo> not always
P1:58:42 <akuryo> with i'll not full
P1:58:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> from now on i'll call the sun pancakes
P1:58:47 <akuryo> the vision we have of it
P1:58:48 <Siiseli> I think Adura isn't getting what I mean?
P1:58:48 <Syndlig> Croissants don't look like spheres.
P1:58:52 <Adura> Perhaps not.
P1:59:06 <akuryo> lol
P1:59:22 <Syndlig> Adura, if you seriously believe that about the southern US all that means is you're very ignorant.

P1:59:53 <Adura> You're saying it's not accurate that the Southern US has a higher rate of gun ownership?

P2:00:25 <Quatroking> my friends face looks like a penis but that doesn't mean i call him penis
P2:00:28 <Syndlig> I have no idea if the south has a higher rate of gun ownership.
P2:00:30 <Syndlig> But you know what?
P2:00:33 <Quatroking> french people..
P2:00:38 <Adura> When you know, get back to me.
P2:00:39 <Syndlig> I've seen less people here that own guns than I did up north.
P2:01:02 <Testvan> the south sucks cocks, but not because of guns
P2:01:20 <Syndlig> the south sucks because it's fucking 109 fahrenheit outside right now what the fuck.

P2:04:11 <Siiseli> thankfully global warming changes all that
P2:05:25 <Quatroking> global warming is a hoax
P2:05:42 <Adura> You're a climatologist?
P2:05:53 <Siiseli> oh I was joking
P2:05:57 <Quatroking> I'm THUNDERMAN
P2:07:23 <Siiseli> but do tell me how global warming is a hoax
P2:07:25 <prakCurie> Personal anecdotes make for very poor statistics.
P2:07:38 <Quatroking> well
P2:07:44 <Quatroking> al gore used it to become rich
P2:07:45 <Quatroking> durr
P2:07:53 <Siiseli> uh
P2:08:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Global warming cannot be denied, the issue at hand is whether it is our fault
P2:08:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Raw numbers don't lie ;)
P2:08:10 <Siiseli> yeah it can't be denies
P2:08:22 <citricsquid> What matters is whether or not we should and can affect it. 
P2:08:46 <prakCurie> I'm not sure why people get so hung up on if it is our fault or not.  We will suffer because of it just the same.
P2:08:46 <Siiseli> I was just about to ask Quatroking to show me evidence for his claims
P2:09:02 <Siiseli> of course we should and sure we can but the question is if we will
P2:09:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> prakCurie, because if it is a natural cycle it will reverse itself... If we did it, we are in uncharted waters, and we may be screwed
P2:09:22 <Quatroking> let me grab evidence
P2:09:28 <Siiseli> well you know cars etc. don't exactly help global warming
P2:09:34 <citricsquid> To "combat" global warming we will have to change how we function as a society and how we treat the planet, I don't think we ever will.
P2:09:43 <Siiseli> but sure it may not be ALL our fault
P2:09:55 <Siiseli> citricsquid, that is exactly my point
P2:10:02 <Quatroking> http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php
P2:10:04 <Siiseli> humanity will never return to primitivism
P2:10:04 <Quatroking> bonk
P2:10:12 <citricsquid> It's nature "taking it's course" but it's undeniable that we have been involved it, whether or not we've increased it much or a lot we can never know.
P2:10:17 <Quatroking> it has a funny bird so i guess it's legit
P2:10:34 <citricsquid> quatro: Sites like this will just be his quotes out of context. 
P2:10:39 <akuryo|away> BACK
P2:10:41 <Adura> Yeah, can't be all our fault. Fossil fuels were burned by aliens before we started.
P2:10:52 <Adura> ;)
P2:11:00 <prakCurie> Humans have always existed in an ice age and being natural does not necessarily make something good.
P2:11:08 <citricsquid> It isn't just fossil fuels that have caused it though, is it?

P2:11:51 <Quatroking> lol
P2:11:56 <Quatroking> I made that silly animation
P2:12:18 <Adura> The Earth has never dealt with the burning of fossil fuels before humans, it'd be smart of us to try to offset the effect.
P2:12:28 <citricsquid> I don't think global warming exists how it is popularily defined: I don't think for every car we use a bit of the ozone dies, I do however think the earth is changing because of us, it's just directly related to us.

P2:13:00 <akuryo|away> i had the flitch too
P2:13:04 <akuryo|away> no
P2:13:06 <akuryo|away> lol
P2:13:08 <Siiseli> there're so many ways for humanity to end
10P2:13:09 * akuryo|away is now known as akuryo
P2:13:16 <C418> this happens when you're blocked in blocks
P2:13:19 <citricsquid> I think we'll end up ending ourselves.
P2:13:20 <akuryo> i had a better version of the glitch
P2:13:25 <akuryo> i was very high in the sky
P2:13:26 <akuryo> dunno why
P2:13:29 <Siiseli> I mean if the enviroment doesn't end us
P2:13:32 <Siiseli> we will eat ourselves up
P2:13:34 <akuryo> and i could see through the first layer of rock
P2:13:34 <Quatroking> akuryo is da haxxorz
P2:13:37 <Testvan> just took a shower time to smoke weeeed
P2:13:41 <akuryo> quatro
P2:13:45 <akuryo> this was unwanted lol
P2:13:47 <akuryo> really
P2:13:50 <Siiseli> seriously human nature in itself is enough to end humanity
P2:13:50 <akuryo> this wasnt a part of my hax
P2:13:54 <Siiseli> humans are shitty creatures
P2:13:55 <Quatroking> you're still da haxxorz
P2:14:01 <Siiseli> and we'll destroy ourselves
P2:14:04 <prakCurie> How is global warming popularly defined?
P2:14:10 <Siiseli> but I'm planning on having fun while I still cna
P2:14:11 <akuryo> humans are shitty creatures. Yeah... they need to poo like every other fucking animal race.
P2:14:17 <Quatroking> We humans should consider making live on the moon
P2:14:22 <Siiseli> oh you're so funny akuryo

P2:14:56 <akuryo> MY LITTLE SISTER TOO?!
P2:15:03 <Quatroking> Yeah did her twice

P2:15:06 <akuryo> ah. so it's ok =D
P2:15:09 <Quatroking> didn't you notice the lube
P2:15:15 <akuryo> yeah yeah
P2:15:18 <akuryo> it was pretty strange
P2:15:23 <akuryo> when i got inside myself
P2:15:27 <citricsquid> parkCurie: The population are led to believe we are the cause of global warming and all global warming, whereas I think that while we are contributing to the problems, we're not the sole cause and our planet "evolving" is part of it.
P2:15:33 <akuryo> it gone easyer than the other times
P2:15:34 <Quatroking> just so you don't have to blame your highly abusive french dad this time
P2:15:35 <Evil-Ville> Neither does talking to elected representatives
P2:15:38 <akuryo> thanks for the lube =D

P2:20:25 <akuryo> citric = citygen resume all
P2:20:26 <prakCurie> I thought the "we are the only cause" was just the strawman argument put up by people.  Not that it doesn't actually mean that most people didn't believe it.

P3:29:57 <C418> NOTHING
P3:29:59 <C418> YOU GET NOTHING
P3:30:49 <Evil-Ville> Everyone was throwing a fit over the difficulty level of Spelunky
P3:31:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh okay.
P3:31:50 <Evil-Ville> One guy almost left the community for good
P3:31:51 <Punx> fuck sleep
P3:32:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah that was me, I think.
P3:32:05 <Rock_D> when you look at it as a roguelike, the difficulty is fine. it's the only roguelike i ever finished at least
P3:33:18 <Rock_D> I'm playing a lot of stone soup lately
P3:33:45 <C418> roguelike doesn't equal difficult
P3:33:54 <C418> the gameplay of spelunky is based around the hardness
P3:34:06 <vdgmprgrmr> That games was, like, the biggest mistake ever, according to me. Combining the harshness of roguelikes with the fast-paced, fun-to-be-reckless gameplay of the platformer aspect of it made for a game that felt like it just LIED to you.
P3:34:30 <C418> why?
P3:34:33 <C418> it's not a long game
P3:34:40 <C418> so making it hard is the best way to let you play longer
P3:34:53 <C418> also there are the checkpoints where you can spend money on to start in later levels
P3:34:57 <C418> I don't call that hard
P3:35:09 <Adura> Harder and longer? Viagra?
P3:35:16 <C418> you can go now
P3:35:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I felt like the game was constantly encouraging me to do really crazy stuff, because doing really crazy stuff was just SO FRICKIN' COOL in it, but doing all that stuff just made the game punish you.

P3:52:47 <tesseract> America is the seat of culture. The seat of democracy.

P3:53:47 <tesseract> Is socialism democratic? Workers owning the means of production? FUCK NO.
P3:54:00 <vdgmprgrmr> So we can force them to do democracy instead of being socialist.
P3:54:21 <tesseract> How would we accomplish this "forcing" you speak of?

P3:59:26 <tesseract> You are right.

P4:09:26 <Quatroking> Fuck what was stamppot again
P4:09:35 <Quatroking> I never eat it because its terrible
P4:09:49 <vdgmprgrmr> It's a country where freedom means everything, as long as it's freedom LIKE THEIRS.
P4:10:09 <Quatroking> freedom (and oil) means everything! ONTO IRAQ BOYS
P4:10:19 <Daroh> its not really freedom if your being restricted
P4:10:26 <tesseract> Fug this poopoo. I want to live on the MOONS OF JUPITER.
P4:10:28 <Quatroking> freedom doesn't exist
P4:10:36 <Quatroking> true fact
P4:10:43 <Rock_D> a green leafy vegetable like endive and potatoes is stamppot
P4:10:44 <tesseract> Maybe not, but FREEDOM FRIES do.
P4:10:55 <Daroh> so does FREEDOOM
P4:10:57 <Quatroking> rock_d, oh yeah that shit
P4:10:58 <Daroh> wooz
P4:11:00 <Quatroking> uggghhh
P4:11:03 <Rock_D> sausage from the Hema is obligatory
P4:11:10 <Quatroking> eh
P4:11:21 <Quatroking> Sausage from Hema is made by freaking Unox
P4:11:24 <tesseract> lets not talk about how retarded everything is, ok?
P4:11:33 <Rock_D> so
P4:11:34 <Daroh> sausages are retarded?
P4:11:35 <tesseract> what about THE MOONS OF JUPITER?
P4:12:08 <Quatroking> I raped them
P4:12:10 <tesseract> I fly to them in my dreams.
P4:12:13 <Daroh> so, turns out jupiter isnt actually a planet
P4:12:28 <Quatroking> who says Earth is a planet?
P4:12:29 <Daroh> its a space ship harbouring convicts! *gasps*
P4:12:37 <Rock_D> in leiden they celebrate the liberation from the spanish by eating lots of hutspot for a day
P4:12:38 <tesseract> Your mom is a planet. burn.
P4:12:56 <Daroh> well actually i was going to say pluto but seems i had a brain fart and said jupiter instead
P4:12:58 <Quatroking> Leiden is only good for their university
P4:13:01 <Rock_D> supposedly the recipe for hutspot was stolen from the spanish invaders
P4:13:15 <Quatroking> what a bullshit
P4:13:23 <tesseract> Pluto and Jupiter are the most different of any two planets.
P4:13:29 <tesseract> Largest and smallest.
P4:13:31 <Quatroking> all our cuisine exists out of less than 5 ingredients
P4:13:35 <Quatroking> sort of
P4:13:40 <tesseract> Pluto is so small, it's not even a planet.
P4:13:48 <Daroh> pluto is aparently too small to be classifieda as a planet, thats what i was getting at :P
P4:13:56 <Siiseli> oh crap
P4:13:56 <Evil-Ville> Old news
P4:13:58 <tesseract> New horizons is going to arrive there in 2014 I think?
P4:13:59 <Siiseli> pluto discussion
P4:14:09 <Quatroking> you momma is so fat, she's the reason pluto lost the title of planet!
P4:14:11 <tesseract> Then we will see our first images of pluto.
P4:14:20 <Siiseli> tesseract, it won't matter COS WELL ALL DIE BY 2012!!11
P4:14:31 <tesseract> True, true.
P4:14:36 <esper_spksfh> what ever 2012 wont happen

P4:15:11 <tesseract> Chuck norris is a born again christian.
P4:15:21 <Quatroking> I never see those in foreign countries
P4:15:32 <Rock_D> the word 'snack' is actually derived from dutch
P4:15:49 <Quatroking> snek, which is pea soup
P4:15:52 <Snowman> kroketten?
P4:15:52 <tesseract> the dutch gave us snacking!!?!?!? WTF YOU GUYS RULE!

P4:18:59 <Fishlips> i cant wait for the beta! hopefully alot of griefers will bugger off
P4:19:02 <Testvan> which is is 2 or 5?
P4:19:25 <Snowman> 2,5 = 2.5
P4:19:30 <Rock_D> dutch use , as a fractional delimiter, it's really really annoying
P4:19:39 <Rock_D> especially for programmers
P4:19:42 <Testvan> i now hate the dutch
P4:19:46 <Snowman> im sorry :(
P4:19:52 <tesseract> Let us destroy them.
P4:20:20 <Snowman> AT LEAST WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM
P4:20:33 <Snowman> YOU DONT
P4:20:41 <tesseract> Dude, our system is way beter.

P4:20:48 <Snowman> no
P4:20:53 <tesseract> It makes you learn more.
P4:21:02 <Testvan> i can use either
P4:21:03 <Snowman> EVERYTHING IS DIVIDABLE BY 10!
P4:21:04 <tesseract> How many feet are in a mile? 5280!
P4:21:07 <Rock_D> even nasa agrees the metric system is best
P4:21:17 <Snowman> how many meters are in a kilometer? 1000
P4:21:20 <tesseract> They are just saying that for appeasment
P4:21:24 <tesseract> 5280
P4:21:28 <Testvan> all sciences agree metric is better
P4:21:32 <tesseract> you couldn't even memorize a number that long.
P4:21:35 <Snowman> and science is ftw
P4:21:37 <Rock_D> why would they have to appease to us
P4:21:48 <tesseract> how many inches wide is a slice of american cheese?
P4:21:52 <tesseract> 3.5!
P4:21:54 <tesseract> fools.
P4:22:09 <tesseract> the american system makes the most sense.
P4:22:12 <Snowman> lol no
P4:22:18 <tesseract> see, you devide all the inches by eight
P4:22:19 <Testvan> a foot is a foot
P4:22:24 <tesseract> and then you devide all the feet
P4:22:27 <tesseract> by twelve
P4:22:28 <Snowman> having everything dividably by 10 makes the most sense
P4:22:36 <tesseract> then you add together three feet
P4:22:43 <tesseract> remember thats 36 inches
P4:22:47 <tesseract> and that makes a yard!
P4:22:53 <tesseract> WE RULE.
P4:22:54 <Testvan> 5280 is the number of steps to walk a mile
P4:22:54 <Snowman> you know 1mm
P4:23:03 <tesseract> No, youfool
P4:23:05 <Snowman> so you multiply that by 10, then you have 1 cm
P4:23:10 <tesseract> A step is more like 3 feet.
P4:23:18 <Snowman> you multiply that by 100 then you got 1m
P4:23:27 <tesseract> BORING
P4:23:31 <Snowman> then you multiply that by 1000 and you have a kilometer
P4:23:32 <Rroff> meh nothing wrong with either system
P4:23:34 <tesseract> You Europeans are complacent.
P4:23:39 <Testvan> i have small steps 
P4:23:47 <tesseract> We are smarter because we haveto learn the standard system.
P4:23:48 <Snowman> so 1 kilometer = 1000000mm
P4:23:50 <ZomBuster> TF2 class rushes are win
P4:23:51 <Fishlips> americans are wrong!
P4:23:58 <tesseract> we haveto memorize lots of numbers.
P4:24:01 <Rroff> I've been brought up using both imperial and metric intermixed and it works great
P4:24:03 <Fishlips> english are always right
P4:24:04 <Snowman> no you are dumb cause you force yourself to learn it >.>
P4:24:18 <tesseract> that's what makes the american education system the best in the world.
P4:24:37 <Quatroking> FFFFFFFFFFUCK GUYS

P4:27:57 <tesseract> I had to have my wisdom teeth removed, but because they were impacted (below the gums) they were not covered by my medical insurance. So I had to pay out of pocket. I waited too long to do it, so I got a cavity. Then when I had it done I couldn't afford $260 for Nitrous or a Happy pill, so I did it with only Novacaine.
P4:28:11 <tesseract> and it was fucked up having them cut my teeth apart and break them out of my head.

P5:28:51 <Quatroking> Yeah you can request a payout by sending bank stuff
P5:28:52 <citricsquid> when he hits 18.
P5:28:52 <Quatroking> I am
P5:28:56 <citricsquid> well, he's like 20 now

P5:29:53 <liq3> All I know is I said I was 18.

P5:29:59 <liq3> lol.
P5:30:01 <liq3> Exactly!
P5:30:02 <Rroff> and they ended up settling out of court

P5:34:14 <liq3> Probably best to keep it private, or leave people unnamed. o.O

P6:26:25 <TrueWolves> they can unban themselves
P6:26:27 <Adura> You don't ban individuals.
P6:26:29 <C418> if you want to be stupid, then yes
P6:26:29 <TrueWolves> if they know how
P6:26:31 <Adura> You ban masks, on IRC.
P6:26:48 <Simsarmy> Also, I'll take that as a yes C418
P6:26:56 <TrueWolves> I'm happy to brag about being one of the first 20 to be on this channel =D
P6:27:08 <C418> wow simsarmy
P6:27:11 <C418> you know more than me
P6:27:14 <citricsquid> IRC scares me, everytime I say something it's like executing a command in ssh =o The results are not to be known until it's done.
P6:27:22 <Adura> man IRC
P6:27:23 <C418> because I never knew the free sound project had a new copyright law
P6:27:30 <C418> except for cc sampling
P6:27:43 <Simsarmy> Hey, hard to tell over the Internet, but I'm just pointing it out. Not getting in your face or anything.
P6:27:44 <Simsarmy> Calm down!
P6:27:45 <citricsquid> True: /brags about being op =D
P6:28:00 <TrueWolves> v.v
P6:28:01 <Adura> /join 0
P6:28:13 <C418> I could activate capslock and talking about me being calm now
P6:28:20 <C418> but I have no capslock
P6:28:25 <TrueWolves> Well, at least I'm an op in other channels on other servers...

P6:30:09 <Simsarmy> Notch gave me a "false" OP... Got my hopes up and everything.
P6:30:25 <Simsarmy> But at least I got Zuriki angry while it lasted.
P6:30:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I was an op for a while...
P6:30:28 <TrueWolves> no, I'm not an op in any furry channels, I'm only in 2 furry channels out of the some 20 channels I frequint

P6:32:23 <Simsarmy> I'mma give a shot at making Notch guilty for breaking my feelings. =<

P6:33:42 <TrueWolves> Testvan, a somewhat ordanary wolf, nonthing special about em, besides, I avoid any furry servers and other major furry sites, I may have liked anthropomorphic animals all my life before knowing what furry is, but the fandom is just f***** up x.x
P6:34:13 <Quatroking> Am I a furry because I have a cap with cat ears
P6:34:26 <Quatroking> and wear it once in a while
P6:34:32 <Zuriki> :D
P6:34:35 <Quatroking> zuriki, 1400 views
P6:34:39 <Simsarmy> I wanna back up that people with animals in their names aren't necessarily a furry. But I've never spoken with a person with "wolf" in their name that isn't a Furry.
P6:34:39 <Zuriki> Whut lol
P6:34:47 <Quatroking> http://96.9.153.80/cucumber.php
P6:35:00 <Zuriki> I know a guy who is called Lukas Wolf
P6:35:03 <TrueWolves> oh, Simsarmy, I agree with you
P6:35:05 <vdgmprgrmr> What the hell?
P6:35:08 <Zuriki> Does that mean he's a furry.
P6:35:12 <Zuriki> It's his REAL name too.
P6:35:13 <TrueWolves> Not everyone with an animal name is a furry
P6:35:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not seeing how that page has anything to do with perverts...
P6:35:26 <Simsarmy> Hey, I said I've never SPOKEN with anyone with wolf in their name. I'm not saying that one doesn't exist.
P6:35:28 <Zuriki> Not YET you're not.
P6:35:30 <Adura> John Catfucker
P6:35:30 <TrueWolves> hell, I preaty much hate the fandom, but by deffination I'm still a furry x.
P6:35:31 <TrueWolves> x.x
P6:35:58 <TrueWolves> I only stick in the 2 channels I'm in becuase of friends I got there.

P6:36:05 <PF> >.>
P6:36:09 <citricsquid> Furry confuses me. Sexual, "I wank over fox sex" furry, or "I dress up as cats on weekends" furry?
P6:36:17 <TrueWolves> neither
P6:36:21 <PF> there are also "artist" furries
P6:36:25 <PF> who just draw stuff
P6:36:29 <PF> and then have their houses egged
P6:36:31 <Quatroking> I only got ears on a cap, thats it
P6:36:36 <Adura> "I'm Native American" furry?
P6:36:38 <TrueWolves> I only have a great admiration of anthropomorphic animals, I just seem to perfer them in my videogames and such
P6:36:44 <PF> the guy who made lugaru had lots of harassment
P6:36:45 <Simsarmy> I would back em up, explaining their not as weird as the media likes to portray them, but I don't want to get confused with being a furry myself.
P6:36:52 <PF> people from somethingawful called his house etc
P6:36:54 <PF> >.>
P6:37:04 <Zuriki> TrueWolves would love Roax in Star Ocean.
P6:37:11 <PF> ?
P6:37:15 <vdgmprgrmr> I've never liked anthropomorphic animals.
P6:37:21 <TrueWolves> Roax is not a furry though, just got ears and tail
P6:37:22 <Zuriki> A planet full of animal people.

P6:45:24 <Simsarmy> Whoops.
P6:45:24 <TrueWolves> It does not need ops, but it's a good idea to have as many ops in the room as the square root of the people in it -1, so at least 1 is active at all times for spam attacks, flamers, trolls (lots of trolls)
P6:45:25 <Zuriki> If he goes over 9000 then he never gets it.
P6:45:38 <Adura> Ah, I have a reason to spam it, then.
P6:45:47 <citricsquid> Zuriki: It won't affect the server in the slightest :)
P6:45:57 <Zuriki> Shush.

P7:25:55 <TrueWolves> does sims 3 have 180hours of fun in it?
P7:26:07 <liq3> No way Im' getting 90 hours out of a sandbox SP game.e
P7:26:15 <TrueWolves> I'd pay 40 dollars for a good rpg that only had about 25hours in it though
P7:26:19 <liq3> I'd buy it for $40 max.
P7:26:38 <liq3> Yeh, games like Mirrors Edge and Portal, they only last like, 6 hours, but totally worth it. :P

P7:46:32 <mib_db37rd> at random intervals i won't be able to connect to a server
P7:46:35 <mib_db37rd> it'll say 'connecting'
P7:46:37 <mib_db37rd> and stay at that
P7:46:41 <mib_db37rd> and if i leave it for more than 5 seconds
P7:46:48 <mib_db37rd> it freezes my browser and i have to ctrl alt del
P7:46:52 <mib_db37rd> sometimes i can connect to servers
P7:46:55 <mib_db37rd> and sometimes that happens
P7:46:57 <mib_db37rd> and its totally random
P7:47:06 <mib_db37rd> is it because im a bad person?
P7:47:18 <Adura> Perhaps you've been banned/IP banned.
P7:47:23 <mib_db37rd> nah
P7:47:25 <mib_db37rd> it happens alot
P7:47:28 <mib_db37rd> and i leave the server
P7:47:30 <mib_db37rd> come back in 10 minutes
P7:47:32 <mib_db37rd> and i can connect
P7:47:36 <mib_db37rd> its completely random
P7:47:47 <mib_db37rd> i've tried it on firefox, IE and safari
P7:47:55 <mib_db37rd> opera doesn't work with minecraft so i dunno about that
P7:48:02 <mib_db37rd> some results on all browsers
P7:48:06 <mib_db37rd> except IE doesnt crash
P7:48:09 <mib_db37rd> it just says on connect forever
P7:48:24 <Rydia> when Notch makes survival mode he should add a bunch of options so people can choose what their end goal is etc
P7:48:36 <mib_db37rd> i'll assume the game just hates me
P7:48:40 <mib_db37rd> for X reason
P7:48:42 <mib_db37rd> it's pretty annoying though
P7:48:48 <mib_db37rd> i bought the game and i can't play it at random intervals
P7:49:00 <mib_db37rd> it feels like buying a car then it randomly gets taken away and put back 
P7:49:09 <Adura> Test your connection by hosting your own server, unless you've not already.
P7:49:18 <mib_db37rd> i doubt its my connection
P7:49:23 <mib_db37rd> because i can connect after about 2 minutes
P7:49:26 <mib_db37rd> it seems to just be random breaking
P7:49:38 <Adura> Nonetheless, it's worth a shot.
P7:49:44 <mib_db37rd> i have hosted my own server

P7:49:54 <mib_db37rd> said it was down
P7:49:59 <mib_db37rd> i assume its my ports

P10:13:37 <Eagle> When you destroy the red flower, it should scream.

P10:14:18 <Animator> When you destroy the mushroom, it should sound like Mario Power-up.

P10:24:39 <Bob> if you didnt notice, i had 3FPS
P10:24:48 <Nalok> lol redshift your map makes me lag like hell
P10:24:49 <Bob> that map is intensely laggy
P10:24:53 <Bob> same with me
P10:24:54 <Nalok> 2fps
P10:24:58 <Redshift> depends on client
P10:25:04 <Redshift> i get 30 fps
P10:25:38 <Redshift> its because
P10:25:48 <Redshift> on most map there is a series of blocks
P10:25:51 <Redshift> that can be rendered together
P10:26:01 <Redshift> but this is all random

P10:49:45 <Eagle> Even real life?
P10:49:49 <liq3> Yep.
P10:49:58 <Eagle> I wish I knew it.
P10:50:01 <liq3> lol.
P10:50:22 <liq3> Even if you did know it, you wouldn't even be able to begin to understand it. :P
P10:50:38 <Eagle> And even if I did understand it? Where and how would I use it?
P10:50:50 <Animator> Disable gravity and start flying.
P10:51:00 <Eagle> How? Just yell into the air?
P10:51:00 <Animator> Making cars transform.
P10:51:10 <Animator> Walk in outer space.
P10:51:23 <Animator> Dance in the Sun.
P10:51:23 <Eagle> How would I edit the code? :P
P10:52:17 <liq3> Eagle: If you understood it, you'd understand cause and effect. Thus, you'd be able to do pretty much anything.
P10:52:36 <Eagle> If I had the materials to do it.
P10:52:39 <liq3> Well, maybe not be able to do it, but know how. ;P
P10:52:55 <liq3> Eagle: Anything, including manifesting materials out of no where. :P
P10:53:03 <Eagle> But
P10:53:08 <Eagle> Where would I use the source code
P10:53:21 <liq3> What do you mean?
P10:53:33 <Eagle> Just yell into the air?
P10:53:42 <Eagle> Somehow edit it to disable gravity?
P10:53:42 <liq3> You just need to know it...
P10:54:28 <Eagle> If you know the source code to minecraft, you can't do anything in the app itself.
P10:54:43 <Eagle> You have to manually edit the code to do whatever you want. :P
P10:54:50 <liq3> Hrm.
P10:55:04 <liq3> Except, minecraft has small amounts of variables.
P10:55:14 <liq3> The only variables are input buttons.
P10:55:35 <liq3> Which, are mainly WASD and mouse look.
P10:55:58 <Eagle> Who's to say that real life has more?
P10:56:11 <liq3> Me. ;]
P10:56:20 <Rydia> i wish you could enable gravity on all blocks
P10:56:20 <Eagle> ... G-God?
P10:56:28 <Rydia> that'd be interesting
P10:56:35 <liq3> Because, cause and effect is very simple in Minecraft.
P10:56:37 <Animator> That's be horrible.
P10:56:44 <liq3> In Real life, it's very, very complicated.
P10:56:55 <Rydia> enable gravity on all blocks not connected to another block that's connected to the ground
P10:57:04 <liq3> e.g. my brainwaves affect galaxies billions of light years away, even if only minutely.
P10:57:14 <Eagle> But I doubt that there's a variable in real life that allows to spontainiously materialize things.
P10:57:25 <Rydia> would be useful for theme servers that are medieval or whatever
P10:57:34 <liq3> If I combine all the inputs in the correct way, it'll cause mass chain effect. ;P
P10:58:02 <Eagle> So
P10:58:03 <Rydia> someone should make a map generator that just litters random blocks throughout the map and then cuts holes in it
P10:58:03 <Eagle> If
P10:58:23 <liq3> But then, we're already WRITING the source code for 'real life'.
P10:58:23 <Eagle> You typed WSAD keys in a very complicated manner, you'd cause a mass chain effect?
P10:58:32 <liq3> So, kinda irrelevent. >.>
P10:58:34 <Eagle> In Minecraft, I mean.
P10:58:42 <liq3> Eagle: It's possibl.
P10:58:54 <liq3> Not on a software level, but on a hardware level yes.
P10:59:06 <Eagle> What do you mean?
P10:59:12 <liq3> You can make teh hardware 'fail'.
P10:59:22 <Eagle> O.o
P10:59:31 <Eagle> Real life hardware failure would be terrible.
P10:59:37 <Eagle> I'd better stop moving so much.
P10:59:38 <liq3> Haha, I don't mean outrigth fail.
P10:59:42 <liq3> I mean like skip a beat...
P10:59:49 <liq3> Which makes a value in MC slightly wrong.. ;]
P11:00:17 <liq3> Still, we're writing the source code for RL already.
P11:00:55 <liq3> Although, the source code we write goes through an interpeter, which has rules for it. Hrm.
P11:01:02 <liq3> No idea what the rules are.
P11:01:09 <liq3> Oh I know one of the rules.
P11:01:12 <Eagle> We're writing it?
P11:01:15 <liq3> Yep.
P11:01:27 <Eagle> Must be a powerful piece of hardware to run it.
P11:02:15 <liq3> Infinitely powerful.
P11:02:22 <Eagle> Then again, I guess the universe must be powerful.
P11:02:42 <Eagle> Although I wonder what happens when we run out of memory?
P11:02:57 <TrueWolves> When Farrah Fawcett she went to heaven, and at the pearly gates, St. Peter offered her one wish. She said "I wish that the young childrens could be safe" guess who dies a few hours later =/
P11:02:58 <liq3> "we"?
P11:03:08 <Eagle> They?

P11:03:46 <liq3> Haven't heard it before.

P11:52:31 <TrueWolves> I know
P11:52:40 <TrueWolves> I like to brag about being one of the first =3
P11:53:59 <Alehkhs> eh, it's not worth the bragging really. that's like people who get mad at people for listening to a band they've been listening to for years
P11:54:19 <Alehkhs> in the end, they just think your covering your own ass from that same lable
P11:54:20 <Alehkhs> ah well
P11:54:27 <Alehkhs> how goes it TrueWolves?
P11:54:58 <TrueWolves> XD
P11:55:00 <TrueWolves> good point
P11:55:11 <TrueWolves> right  now? recovering from 2 months of overworking my self
P11:55:51 <TrueWolves> I am trying to start either an A: sphere server (a whole server inside a 256/256/256 sphere where everything outside is unbreakable blocks) or a RP server
P11:55:54 <Alehkhs> wooh! break free!
P11:56:14 <Alehkhs> I think the spere would be interesting myself
P11:56:21 <Alehkhs> hmm
P11:56:25 <Alehkhs> is Parthon around?
P11:56:39 <Testvan> do the sphere 
P11:57:21 <Alehkhs> if only you could do a free-floating sphere, and have the outside act like a clear water
P11:57:23 <Alehkhs> like space
P11:58:58 <Testvan> sphere
