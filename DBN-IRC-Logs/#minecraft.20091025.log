P4:42:22 <gm|lap> wow that's got to be the quickest leaving the community i've seen
P4:42:28 <Sergio> Hmmm
P4:42:31 <Sergio> Cloth
P4:42:35 <Sergio> =
P4:42:42 <BoirG> im bored?
P4:42:43 <Sergio> Closer to crafting
P4:42:59 <Sergio> Whew
P4:43:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
P4:43:04 <PickYerPoison> Oh hey Notch, I've got a question. Dunno if it's already been asked.
P4:43:09 <Snowman> I have an idea for my health bar
P4:43:10 <Notch> oh?
P4:43:10 <Sergio> That was worse than calculus
P4:43:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> And for a second I thought you were in a good mood today
P4:43:12 <Snowman> Not change it at all
P4:43:16 <Dilt> PickYerPoison: I'll take the question poison for 200
P4:43:16 <PickYerPoison> When you stack two half-blocks together, then destroy them, you only get one back.
P4:43:20 <PickYerPoison> Shouldn't you get 2?
P4:43:34 <Dilt> that is a valid point
P4:43:35 <PuyoDead> yea, that's also been reported
P4:43:35 <Notch> yeah, it's to prevent milling a single block
P4:43:51 <Snowman> Or because you are too lazy to code it? :D
P4:43:56 <PickYerPoison> Milling? Ã“_Ã´
P4:43:58 <Notch> if you place another tile above a half-tile block, it becomes a full (because of the bug DBN showed in his dual-bug screenie above)
P4:43:58 <Dilt> currently there's a way to turn one block into two
P4:44:06 <Madrick> half-locks are pretty hacky right now, aren't they?
P4:44:09 <Madrick> *blocks
P4:44:10 <BoirG> u need to fix that notchy!
P4:44:17 <Dilt> notch: that was in your video, was that really an unintended bug?
P4:44:25 <Notch> not as bad as you'd think. I rewrote a lot of code to make things more stable
P4:44:38 <Notch> Dilt:Them turning into full blocks? No, that's intentional
P4:44:54 <Notch> Hopefully I will be able to fix it in some clever way
P4:45:16 <Dilt> hm, clever way
P4:45:18 <Sergio> LEAVE NOTCH ALONE! YOU ONLY WANT MORE MORE MORE![/crocker]
P4:45:18 <Notch> so how about sheep for wool, pigs for meat and cows for hides?
P4:45:25 <Sergio> Ya
P4:45:26 <Madrick> yes
P4:45:29 <Dilt> how about somehow not allowing you to build on top of half blocks?
P4:45:38 <Dilt> acceptable notchy!
P4:45:39 <Notch> Dilt: You can build in from the side
P4:45:40 <ZomBuster> cows and sheep should give meat too, maybe lower quality
P4:45:41 <Sergio> Noplzthx
P4:45:41 <Dilt> but cows should drop meat too
P4:45:45 <Notch> oh, well, I COULD prevent that..
P4:45:52 <ZomBuster> like, sheep and cow 1 meat, pig 3 meat
P4:45:54 <Notch> so what are pigs for then?
P4:45:55 <PickYerPoison> Oh right, that reminds me.
P4:46:00 <Notch> ahhh,, good idea ZomBuster
10P4:46:05 * Nametaker40 (Nametaker@99-177-122-6.lightspeed.bcvloh.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
P4:46:09 <gm|lap> what if you're a vegetarian?
P4:46:13 <Sergio> LOL
P4:46:14 <Dilt> gm|lap: mushrooms
P4:46:15 <PickYerPoison> Since the clay blocks ore produce what appears to be silver, why not just make them silver ore blocks?
P4:46:16 <ZomBuster> eat leaves
P4:46:19 <PickYerPoison> *clay ore blocks
P4:46:23 <Notch> then you can eat mushrooms. =D
P4:46:28 <Jat> clay?
P4:46:29 <Sergio> =D
P4:46:37 <Dilt> and one last idea i had
P4:46:37 <BoirG> pigs should drop bacon. its less healthy than reg meat and causes stomach cancer and heart attacks. :P (and monkeys should give u aids...)
P4:46:43 <Notch> I like diplomas and titles a la roguelikes
P4:46:44 <Jat> what clay ore blocks?
P4:46:48 <PickYerPoison> [16:46] <@Notch> then you can eat mushrooms. =D <-- Followed by getting high and waking up next to a creeper. XD
P4:46:48 <Sergio> :D
P4:46:52 <Dilt> how do you suggest we 'move' animals?
P4:46:55 <Notch> so I might have a vegetarian achievement for never eating meat
P4:47:01 <Dilt> suppose we find a pig and want to take it home and make a pigpen
11P4:47:04 <DBN> iron ore
P4:47:05 <Annihilator> achievements?
P4:47:08 <Dilt> how do we take it home? :D
11P4:47:09 <DBN> not clay/silver
P4:47:11 <Notch> Dilt: Leash!
P4:47:17 <PickYerPoison> [16:47] <Jat> what clay ore blocks? <-- You know, the light-brownish ones you find under ground?
P4:47:20 <gm|lap> hmmkay
P4:47:20 <Dilt> :D and leashes are made out of... cloth or leather?
P4:47:23 <PickYerPoison> They look like iron and gold, only light brown.
P4:47:26 <Notch> dunno yet
P4:47:26 <Jat> notch i was wondering what the point of building in mp survival actually is? is there a rason to create a shelter or something?
P4:47:39 <Dilt> which means you need to sheer a sheep or kill a cow :D
P4:47:39 <Annihilator> oh, yeah
P4:47:39 <Nametaker40> I heard there was fire.. true?
P4:47:39 <gm|lap> You have died....
P4:47:40 <Annihilator> notch, aren't you going to update the texture for gold?
P4:47:55 <gm|lap> Do you want to see your conduct? [y/n]
P4:47:55 <Jat> and no pypr i dont know what youre talking about
P4:47:55 <Annihilator> Y
P4:47:55 <Notch> Jat: Well, I will try to add as much purpose as I can
P4:47:56 <Notch> but everything can be "gamed" pretty easy
P4:47:56 <Jat> oh ok
P4:48:09 <Drakkar> Jat: protection is a good one
P4:48:09 <Notch> like if you need roof, you could just place a single tile
P4:48:09 <vede> Notch, what's your stance on the use of cheat codes in video games?
P4:48:21 <Jat> sh i see
P4:48:21 <Notch> it's hard to differentiate a real building from just a quick "hack"
P4:48:21 <Jat> i maen as
P4:48:21 <Jat> i mean ah
P4:48:34 <Notch> so I think I'll focus on making it fun for the player to want to build that
P4:48:34 <Drakkar> good idea
P4:48:35 <Jat> ok
P4:48:35 <Drakkar> ooh
P4:48:36 <Drakkar> I KNOW
P4:48:38 <Drakkar> notch
P4:48:40 <Dilt> well, i still like the idea of remembering who built what block to determine score
P4:48:41 <BoirG> notch somehow i just glitchd water up a level in survival...
P4:48:42 <Drakkar> have things like
P4:48:44 <Drakkar> carpet tiles
P4:48:45 <PickYerPoison> [16:48] <Jat> and no pypr i dont know what youre talking about <-- Hands up who has seen the clay blocks.
P4:48:49 <Drakkar> that get all messed up without a roof
P4:48:57 <Dilt> oh god
P4:48:58 <Jat> lol
P4:48:59 <Dilt> cloth -> carpet
P4:48:59 <Sergio> Notch: You should make sheep ram you  if you hit it about 3 times
P4:49:00 <Jat> protect the carpet!
P4:49:01 <PickYerPoison> Just so I can prove to Jat they're real. :P
P4:49:15 <Notch> haha sergio
P4:49:15 <Notch> good idea
P4:49:15 <Dilt> if you leave it out in the sun it gets bag
P4:49:15 <Drakkar> so you'd have to have a roof over everything you place
P4:49:15 <vede> Clay blocks?
10P4:49:15 * chilley1 (armin@p5B0BC556.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
P4:49:15 <Dilt> er, bad
P4:49:15 <PickYerPoison> ...or I could just take a screenshot. :P
P4:49:16 <Drakkar> otherwise it'd be ruined!
P4:49:19 <Dilt> yeah drakkar
P4:49:20 <Dilt> :D
P4:49:21 <Jat> take a screenshots
P4:49:25 <Madrick> so would sheep regrow wool?
P4:49:26 <Notch> video is processing
P4:49:28 <vede> PickYerPoison: describe the clay blocks.
P4:49:31 <Notch> yes, if you let them eat grass
P4:49:33 <vede> Like, what color are they?
P4:49:35 <citricsquid> god damn I hate L4D players, kicked me from my own server twice.
P4:49:37 <chilley1> anyone got a map for me :) ?
P4:49:38 <Dilt> basically notch
P4:49:45 <Dilt> do the reverse of grass with some sort of 'carpet' tile
P4:49:50 <vede> And where do you find them?
P4:49:51 <Dilt> if it's in sunlight, it gets ugly and bad
P4:49:52 <Jat> are you talking about copper ore blocks pyp?
P4:49:55 <Dilt> otherwise, it looks pretty and happy
P4:50:03 <PickYerPoison> Oh, they're copper?
P4:50:07 <Snowman> citric, you have your own server?
P4:50:07 <gm|lap> wow half-blocks are pretty cool
P4:50:08 <Sergio> I think we should also have mud :D
P4:50:09 <PickYerPoison> Looked like clay to me, sorry. X3
P4:50:13 <vede> I'm pretty sure they're iron.
P4:50:13 <citricsquid> Snowman: yes
P4:50:13 <gm|lap> you don't have to jump your way up'
P4:50:15 <vede> Not copper.
P4:50:16 <Jat> or iron?
P4:50:18 <PickYerPoison> But still, shouldn't we just make them silver?
P4:50:19 <Jat> i forgot
P4:50:22 <PickYerPoison> And lemme take a screen. :P
P4:50:23 <Snowman> Help me with achievement pl0x? :D
P4:50:29 <vede> Actually, I think they should stay iron.
P4:50:31 <Notch> it's supposed to be iron, heh
P4:50:34 <Notch> iron swords!
P4:50:40 <vede> Having gold and silver means we have two precious metals, and coal.
P4:50:45 <ZomBuster> it's pretty shiny iron :P
P4:50:46 <Jat> well iron would be expected to be possibly oxidized before its processed so a color like they have is good
10P4:50:53 * BoirG is now known as injexboot
P4:50:54 <Sergio> I think when mud is by water for a while, it turns to mud
P4:50:58 <Snowman> I think Notch just made it shiny
P4:51:06 <vede> Gold, iron and coal gives us a precious metal, something to make things with, and a form of fuel.
P4:51:12 <Notch> Jat: Yeah, that's the idea. But perhaps it might be a good idea to make it easier for the player to understand rather than to be technically correct, hehe
10P4:51:12 * injexboot is now known as BoirG
P4:51:12 <Snowman> not oxidized :p
P4:51:13 <citricsquid> Snowman: what achievement do you need?
P4:51:19 <Snowman> 20 car pile-up
P4:51:21 <Snowman> :(
P4:51:23 <Snowman> really hard
P4:51:23 <Drakkar> so notch
P4:51:24 <Jat> lol yeah notch
P4:51:29 <Drakkar> will there be super-speed pickaxes
P4:51:33 <citricsquid> Snowman: k, wanna try? Does it have to be all in one round?
P4:51:39 <Notch> yes, pickaxes will let you mine faster than with a flower
P4:51:42 <Snowman> nope, and already have 8 hits
P4:51:42 <Drakkar> and if you hit someone in the had with them
P4:51:47 <Drakkar> will they stick in their head
P4:51:50 <Drakkar> because that would be lovely
P4:51:51 <Jat> but how else would you make iron ore look? if you just make it silverish it would blend into the rock
P4:51:55 <citricsquid> Snowman: k, me and you, wanna do it now? :D
P4:51:59 <Snowman> yeah
P4:52:03 <Drakkar> iron ore tends to look sort of dark gray
P4:52:05 <vede> Notch, I think that a pickaxe should be REQUIRED to mine.
P4:52:12 <citricsquid> Snowman: which level?
P4:52:15 <Notch> vede: How will you make the first pickaxe?
P4:52:19 <Snowman> crash course ofc
P4:52:19 <Madrick> i lol'd in one of the first survival mode videos when notch beats up zombies with a flower
P4:52:23 <Drakkar> hmm
P4:52:24 <Snowman> has to be in crash course
P4:52:24 <ZomBuster> dun dun duuun
P4:52:24 <Drakkar> a thought
P4:52:29 <Drakkar> pickaxe would be for hard material
P4:52:33 <vede> Notch, you start with one?
P4:52:34 <Jat> wait flowers make you mine faster?
P4:52:35 <Drakkar> a spade could be for less hard material
P4:52:40 <Drakkar> like dirt
P4:52:41 <Notch> what if it breaks?
P4:52:41 <vede> And yeah, Drakkar is right.
P4:52:42 <Dilt> Make a pickaxe with a flower.
P4:52:48 <Sergio> xD
11P4:52:52 <DBN> i suppose "minecraft suddenly froze my entire system for a long time" isn't a very useful bug report, right?
P4:52:54 <Drakkar> a spade is minor enough that it would be ok to start with
P4:52:54 <citricsquid> Madrick: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtpf-lJA8y0
P4:52:55 <Jat> fires are supposed to make you shoot fireballs :|
P4:52:59 <Jat> flowers
P4:53:01 <vede> Notch, pickaxe is only damaged when you mine materials you need to make a pickaxe. ;)

P4:53:29 <Madrick> criticsquid: there had better be runescape music playing
P4:53:35 <Notch> i think better design is to make mining take long enough to be boring without a pickaxe, but fast enough to be fun with one
P4:53:41 <Notch> or am I totally wrong?
P4:53:43 <vede> Exactly.
P4:53:46 <Nametaker40> lava + sand?
P4:53:47 <vede> You should do that.
P4:53:49 <Nametaker40> :/
P4:53:54 <Madrick> notch: yes
P4:53:55 <Dilt> basically
P4:54:00 <Snowman> And make pickaxes take some time to obtain
P4:54:03 <Dilt> you want to allow us to be ABLE to mine without a pickaxe
P4:54:07 <Notch> Nametaker40: It'd be very hard to pick up the glass, since it falls into the lava, heh
P4:54:07 <Dilt> but persuade us that we really should get one
P4:54:09 <Snowman> not like you can get one within 5 minutes

P5:03:59 <Conundrumer> i was asking for sergio
P5:04:02 <vede> Notch, what if, when you run into a web block, instead of slowing you down, you get a sort of rope (I'm imagining rope like the stuff Spider-Man produced) which connected you to the block, and made it so you could only walk, say, five or six blocks away from the web. So you'd be constricted to a small area and have to fight off spiders and such before escaping to a better area.
P5:04:03 <Notch> I still have to finish offline saving
P5:04:17 <Notch> how would you get loose?
P5:04:22 <fenixfurion|hw> hit the web block

P5:10:55 <Dilt> i do not approve of resource drain notch
P5:11:00 <Madrick> using the same code as activated dynamite
P5:11:00 <Dilt> consider scarcity
P5:11:08 <Dilt> if you constantly remove resources, the world will have less overall resources
P5:11:09 <Madrick> hot smoking rocks could driop from the sky and explode
P5:11:10 <Notch> scarcity can be boring

P5:11:26 <Dilt> you're suggesting to improve the scarcity by having resources simply fade away
P5:11:27 <vede> Deities that require sacrifices of resources, otherwise the world becomes progressively more terrifying.
P5:11:34 <iscalar> 1) How about (and bear with me here) premade buildings
P5:11:37 <Sergio> My idea seems reallly weird now that I think about it
P5:11:39 <iscalar> get the right amount of tiles
P5:11:42 <iscalar> open up a menu
P5:11:48 <iscalar> add a touch of time
P5:11:51 <Dilt> if someone wants to hoard 99 stone, let them (their inventory can't hold that much)
P5:11:51 <vede> That way they don't just fade away, but you give them away in exchange for "protection".
P5:11:52 <iscalar> building generates
P5:11:57 <Nalok> Adminium, Mincecraftium, BedRock, Adminus
P5:11:59 <Dilt> someone can just go jump in his stockpile and steal it all
P5:12:01 <iscalar> means that non builders
P5:12:05 <Annihilator> regenerating terrain?
P5:12:07 <iscalar> can enjoy the game with objective aswell
P5:12:13 <Zuriki> Vede, a sacrific system.
P5:12:17 <iscalar> also if you make the buildings have some functions
P5:12:22 <vede> And I think it would be AWESOME for you to end up having to survive in a hellish, burnt landscape filled with horrible creatures if you go too long without giving things to the gods.
P5:12:24 <Resetting> ...Id quite like to see an "Alert the horde" feature. like L4D has.
P5:12:24 <Zuriki> Depending on the resource you give away
P5:12:26 <Notch> i don't like the idea of buildings being selected from a menu
P5:12:27 <iscalar> for example, say a blacksmith which has a erea which could say

P5:12:35 <iscalar> change iron ore into a iron blade

P5:12:46 <Snowman> Guys should I turn the pigs into: Arctic foxes, arctic wolves, polar bears or snowy pigs?
P5:12:47 <Notch> increasing challenge over time is always interesting. :D
P5:12:55 <Notch> especially if there's a way to make it easier again
P5:12:56 <Dilt> notch: use current inventory slots
P5:12:57 <Annihilator> polar bears
P5:12:58 <Resetting> Polar. Bears.
P5:13:02 <Nalok> Notch, in the future, you should have an "adventure mode" which would basically be Survival + Dungeons and Switches and add NPCs
P5:13:04 <Sergio> My idea is: A mushroom, darker than health mushrooms, that blurs your screen and scrambles controls when eaten, like being drunk :D
P5:13:06 <Dilt> similar to what you do currently with blocks
P5:13:09 <iscalar> How about premade buildings in another fassion then?
P5:13:12 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: it depends, it sometimes got ~3k uniques a day, averaged at about 1.2
P5:13:13 <iscalar> because lets face it
P5:13:15 <Snowman> Bears it is
P5:13:16 <iscalar> there are some ... put simply
P5:13:19 <iscalar> bad builders in minecraft
P5:13:22 <vede> I don't mean just increasing difficulty, Notch. I mean, like, the game outright trying to kill you. Lightning strikes and all.
P5:13:23 <Nalok> Also Dragons
P5:13:23 <Jat> a survival map on a giant mountain would be cool...
P5:13:23 <Jat> weapons and armor wearing down isnt a big enough resource drain?
P5:13:24 <BoirG> notch we need sheep now!
P5:13:26 <Notch> yes, Nalok. =) dungeon mode = you can't destroy blocks other than a few (wood, perhaps)
P5:13:33 <iscalar> just because they dont have the skills to build
P5:13:35 <Notch> so you can build levels and drop loot, then sent it to your friends
P5:13:40 <Schoko> citricsquid, Hits or Users? o.O
P5:13:43 <iscalar> doesnt mean they should be at a disadvantage
P5:13:46 <Annihilator> awesome
P5:13:47 <citricsquid> Schoko: uniques
P5:13:53 <Resetting> Dungeon mode: have you ever played the lab map some guy made?
P5:13:55 <Nalok> So yes in a few years we'll have a story type mode?

P5:14:24 <fenixfurion|hw> oh notch
P5:14:25 <iscalar> so notch, how about certain special creatures
P5:14:30 <Jat> im not saying it should actually be added to the game but is magic at all in your plans?
P5:14:32 <iscalar> say like extra powerfull creatures like bosss
P5:14:34 <fenixfurion|hw> did you ever port a doom map?
P5:14:36 <Snowman> Haven't played 1 second with you and you got bored >.>
P5:14:39 <iscalar> occasionally drop a building plan or something then
P5:14:40 <vede> So if you piss the gods off too much, just going outside means being assaulted by zombies from every side and avoiding meteors and lightning from the blackened sky, or lava randomly spurting up from the ground.

P5:15:10 <Resetting> i think lava kills in two.

P5:15:22 <Dilt> you can open the menu to equip things
P5:15:25 <iscalar> Interesting
P5:15:30 <Dilt> and if you say
P5:15:33 <Zuriki> Notch and Vede. How about a sacrifice option. You can give away some resourced for different blessings (or curses) like giving away 1 dirt block and the Gods would punish you, but giving away 20 gold blocks might grant you 20s invincibility.
P5:15:35 <iscalar> so monsters could drop say a diagram
P5:15:35 <Dilt> equip a backpack, you'd get some more inventory slots
P5:15:41 <iscalar> of a building set up 
P5:15:44 <iscalar> build what it shows
P5:15:46 <iscalar> something happens
P5:15:47 <Dilt> mind you, 'inventory' in this case is pretty much what you already have in survival mode
P5:15:47 <Notch> yeah, backpack.. :D
P5:15:50 <vede> Sounds to complicated to me.
P5:15:53 <vede> *too
P5:15:57 <iscalar> means that you dont need building skills as you have instructions
P5:15:58 <Notch> but I think three slots is far too little
P5:16:02 <Zuriki> Meh
P5:16:03 <iscalar> adds functionality and insentive
P5:16:07 <Zuriki> Whatever then.
P5:16:10 <Jat> will there be buildable traps?
P5:16:10 <Notch> I run out of slots all the time already with 9 slots, and there's going to be MORE tile types
P5:16:11 <Dilt> Hey, consider your situation
P5:16:11 <Zuriki> Just my 2-cents
P5:16:17 <Dilt> You don't have any baskets
P5:16:18 <Jat> simple ones
P5:16:20 <Dilt> or any holding contraptions
P5:16:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I meant how much data?
P5:16:29 <Dilt> how can you carry all that dirt and stone?
P5:16:34 <Zuriki> Are sheep in the game yet?
P5:16:35 <vede> Dilt, it's a video game. You have to recognize the existence of hammerspace.
P5:16:38 <Notch> realism is not a priority

P5:16:46 <AlexVMiner> ZURIKI!

P5:16:48 <citricsquid> AlLnAtuRalX: oh, uh, not much, ~10gb monthly
P5:16:53 <Notch> if that, hehe
P5:16:56 <citricsquid> well, on fluxbb anyway, it's very light
P5:16:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> alright
P5:17:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I can double that
P5:17:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
P5:17:06 <citricsquid> :D
P5:17:08 <Dilt> three-five seems like a good starting thing. Maybe if you don't like that add in a menu inventory with more-
P5:17:08 <citricsquid> probably triply
P5:17:10 <iscalar> Yes ... realism, because zombies and exploding block based creatures
P5:17:10 <Dilt> ... Or that could be it
P5:17:11 <citricsquid> triple*
P5:17:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> Maybe
P5:17:14 <iscalar> are realistic :P ;)
P5:17:14 <Notch> a single block of dirt would weigh 10^3 kgs, assuming the same density as water
P5:17:21 <Dilt> you could start with so many, then a backpack lets you pop open a menu and swap things out
P5:17:24 <Notch> that's one metric ton
P5:17:25 <AlexVMiner> i remember when i flooded Citric's hell map
P5:17:28 <AlexVMiner> and it went down
P5:17:31 <fenixfurion|hw> o.o

P5:17:57 <Dilt> Miclee: likely not
P5:18:01 <Dilt> water is heavier
P5:18:06 <vede> Miclee, that was an argument AGAINST a weight limit.
P5:18:07 <Dilt> sciecne my friends
P5:18:08 <Jat> it depends on the kind of dirt...
P5:18:17 <Notch> but stone is heavier per dm^3
P5:18:20 <Zuriki> Youtube is being poop
P5:18:22 <Jat> there are lots of different kinds of dirt

P5:18:28 <AlexVMiner> YOUTUBZ
P5:18:29 <iscalar> if a feature does not add to the fun 
P5:18:32 <Dilt> i like the idea of your 'base inventory' being uh
P5:18:32 <iscalar> theres no reason to have it
P5:18:34 <Annihilator> youtube poop?
P5:18:36 <Dilt> pretty much what survival has now
P5:18:36 <iscalar> unless its balancing
P5:18:37 <Jat> dirt is not always heavier than water
P5:18:41 <Nalok> Notch, maybe on minecraft's birthday you can re-release the original version as a download
P5:18:43 <Dilt> and when you get inventory enchancing items, like a backpack
P5:18:43 <iscalar> we're not focusing on a realistic game
P5:18:46 <Dilt> you can gain more slots
P5:18:48 <iscalar> so why make it unnecassarily hard for people
P5:18:50 <Resetting> Notch: Spawn animation perhaps? rather than enemies just popping up

P5:25:33 <AlexVMiner> that can get turned into zombies
P5:25:34 <Dilt> 'what mob do you want to see in minecraft?!'
P5:25:35 <Nalok> Screw time!
P5:25:36 <Iguana> Ghost. :D
P5:25:38 <AlexVMiner> and make a choice to spawn a town
P5:25:38 <iscalar> Dilt
P5:25:41 <iscalar> thats ...
P5:25:42 <iscalar> superb
P5:25:47 <iscalar> just brainstorm like 3 or 4 ideas
P5:25:50 <iscalar> and put it up for vote
P5:25:58 <sulai> I'm impressed by minecraft - and the possibility that you can create mods. Does this include you can create own objects (like animals, enemies, tools, user defined blocks)?
P5:25:59 <Notch> haha, yeah :D
P5:26:05 <Resetting> can we have cats that are completely ignored by everything?
P5:26:08 <Dilt> no, here's my idea
P5:26:13 <Dilt> notch posts a poll on his blog
P5:26:15 <iscalar> Notch, you GOT to do that
P5:26:15 <Notch> sulai: Well, I've been stubbornly against user created art in the game
P5:26:15 <AlexVMiner> I vote for giant rats or snakes
P5:26:20 <Dilt> "tell me the top two mobs you want" or something
P5:26:21 <AlexVMiner> *giant snakes*
P5:26:32 <iscalar> also put a iframe embedd code on the page so that archives and wom players
P5:26:33 <Dilt> and then he can look at it and go 'wow look at how many people want angry gnomes'
P5:26:33 <Notch> but you could script the behavior of mobs
P5:26:36 <copyboy> i want cats, dogs and mice

P5:26:39 <iscalar> can have it placed on the archives and wom website

10P5:26:47 * Flozz (florian@85.210.223.15) has left #minecraft
P5:26:49 <Dilt> and thus, angry gnomes are made
P5:26:54 <Sergio> Fish,  human, birds, deer
P5:26:59 <Resetting> Im with Zuriki on this one, Frogs!
13P5:26:59 * AlexVMiner wants to see zombie versions of himself in the game
11P5:27:01 <DBN> hey notch, did you forget to make the meat for pigs/sheep to drop? :P
P5:27:05 <iscalar> Or better yet, just have the poll pop up at the beggining of a load up
P5:27:07 <iscalar> once per week
P5:27:12 <Nalok> Must. Stop. Nostalgiaing.
P5:27:19 <Schoko> Resetting: We already got Spiders
P5:27:26 <Zuriki> FROGS!
P5:27:27 <Dilt> see notch?
P5:27:33 <Dilt> that's why we're here, we do the thinking for you
P5:27:33 <Dilt> :D
P5:27:36 <AlexVMiner> Or for Halloween, evil pumpkins and witches and mummies and... zombies and... skeletons
P5:27:39 <Resetting> i know we have spiders, what does that have to do with frogs?
P5:27:49 <copyboy> dogs sometimes scare cats away, cats hunt mice and mice ... anger dogs or something ^^
P5:27:54 <Notch> i must go do my taxes!
P5:28:02 <AlexVMiner> EFF TAXES
P5:28:04 <Dilt> oh god minecraft taxes

P5:28:20 <Notch> what do I need?
P5:28:25 <iscalar> you need to get someone, to record down the suggestions made on irc

P5:28:31 <iscalar> but at the speed they come
P5:28:33 <iscalar> it'd be hard to keep up
P5:28:37 <AlexVMiner> "YOU MUST PAY 100 POINTS OR BE ABDUCTED BY THE GOVBERNMENT" that would be funny
P5:28:45 <iscalar> just take the suggestions made here and on forums

P6:05:34 <Snowman> An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation in which the unknown function (also known as the dependent variable) is a function of a single independent variable. In the simplest form, the unknown function is a real or complex valued function, but more generally, it may be vector-valued or matrix-valued: this corresponds to considering a system of ordinary differential...

P7:09:57 <Tank> lol, TNT has no use
P7:10:03 <FakeSky-AFK> That just gives me an idea!
P7:10:09 <Tank> And what are spiders doing with TNT?
P7:10:14 <GeneralGuy> some enmy should drop tnt
P7:10:14 <BoirG> but its fun, fakesky
P7:10:15 <FakeSky-AFK> Creepers should drop gunpowder
P7:10:17 <FakeSky-AFK> :D
P7:10:18 <GeneralGuy> not spiders
P7:10:21 <Tank> lmao
P7:10:24 <Tank> TNT spiders
P7:10:30 <GeneralGuy> it should be a rare/hard enemy
P7:10:33 <FakeSky-AFK> Gunpowder should be an ingredient for crafting TNT
P7:10:34 <FakeSky-AFK> :D
P7:10:44 <Tank> TNT isn't all that useful unless you can blow it with arrows
P7:10:58 <gordenfreechmen> yeah
P7:11:01 <FakeSky-AFK> It has a timer now, and that's all I need
11P7:11:03 <DBN> he updated tnt to have a timer

P7:12:20 <GeneralGuy> or rather a creeper that blows up at will?
P7:12:32 <GeneralGuy> but it's really rare?

P7:13:11 <gordenfreechmen> exactly
P7:13:13 <FakeSky-AFK> Gunpowder can be used to craft TNT
P7:13:16 <Miclee> Fake, TNT = Coal+Sulphur
P7:13:19 <Miclee> Or something like that
P7:13:19 <Tank> Notch needs to fix TNT not blowing stone
P7:13:32 <gordenfreechmen> tnt is pretty useful atm
P7:13:46 <gordenfreechmen> it would be slightly more useful if you could explode it with arrows

P7:14:58 <GeneralGuy> well still
P7:15:03 <GeneralGuy> that's a good idea
P7:15:27 <Tank> TNT should defininently blow stone
P7:15:44 <gordenfreechmen> or at least make it weaker
P7:15:56 <Tank> Weaker, but blows stone is good
P7:16:06 <Tank> Also if you hit it while your on top of it, major frame rate drop

P7:16:49 <GeneralGuy> the explosion no
P7:16:55 <Nametaker40> Tank.. by who?
P7:17:01 <gordenfreechmen> tnt could be admin only

P7:17:13 <GeneralGuy> or just make it not explode

P8:02:58 <Conundrumer> did you macro or something

P8:03:08 <bildramer> best excuse ever!
P8:03:13 <Eagle> But
P8:03:20 <Eagle> Ocean build is /supposed/ to be flooded
P8:03:25 <bildramer> also, why did you unflood it?
P8:03:26 <Eagle> since it's /ocean build/
P8:03:27 <gordenfreechmen> thats the point
P8:03:31 <gordenfreechmen> my friend was pissed

P8:03:41 <gordenfreechmen> he got rid of his winter build

P8:03:47 <gordenfreechmen> i had a giant ice cave in there
P8:03:55 <TrueWolves`> ... heheh
P8:03:56 <gordenfreechmen> so i vandalised his new server so i can have it back

P8:04:27 <gordenfreechmen> would you kindly
P8:04:31 <gordenfreechmen> not point out my mistakes
P8:04:38 <TrueWolves`> I love "build" levels, I don't think I've /ever/ been in a non theamed one for more then 15 minutes, ocean builds are awesome, and I'm still impressed even with hating hax.

P11:40:50 <DarkCybrid> YELL YELL YELL
13P11:40:54 * JRCrusher likes talking in 3rd person.
P11:40:55 <TestDummy> ban ban ban
P11:41:32 <emgmod> We need someone to talk in 2nd person.
P11:41:35 <emgmod> Right now.
P11:41:45 <JRCrusher> thats not really possible
P11:42:06 <JRCrusher> iI would have to listen to be in 2nd person; making me unable to talk.
13P11:42:24 * JRCrusher doesn't like 2nd person at all.
P11:42:36 <TestDummy> You start talking in the channel #minecraft.
P11:42:59 <emgmod> I want 2nd person because if accomplished, it would be epic.
P11:43:03 <TestDummy> Wow, this is hard.
P11:43:15 <TestDummy> There's like, only one second person word. :(
P11:43:16 <Meizlizard> That's what she said.
P11:43:20 <TestDummy> .
P11:43:26 <Meizlizard> Sorry, I had to.
P11:43:31 <JRCrusher> -_-
P11:44:16 <Visiiri> Hmmm
P11:44:29 <Visiiri> Talking in second person, he said as he tries to pull an all nighter.
13P11:44:38 * JRCrusher attacks Meizlizard with a spin slash attack, daling 36.89 damage!
P11:44:49 <Visiiri> he knew he probably would't make it, but he didn't want to go to school tomorrow
P11:45:04 <Visiiri> he knew the best way to stay home was to be sick, and the best way to be sick was to be tired.
P11:45:13 <Visiiri> he needs to be more quited.
P11:45:14 <JRCrusher> that is clearly third from your perspective as narrator.  Sorry
P11:45:22 <TestDummy> FAIL
P11:45:24 <Visiiri> is it?
P11:45:26 <Visiiri> wtf is second then
P11:45:33 <Visiiri> wait
P11:45:36 <Visiiri> let me finish
P11:45:49 <Daidoji> it's like an rpg game
P11:45:51 <TestDummy> "You" is second
P11:45:53 <Daidoji> or an adventure game
P11:45:54 <JRCrusher> second is the person you are taking to therefore you can never be the one talked to if you are talking
P11:45:56 <vede> Anyone else notice that wood is harder than stone in Minecraft?
P11:46:00 <Visiiri> ahh
P11:46:02 <Visiiri> omg vede to
P11:46:03 <Visiiri> this is bs
P11:46:05 <Visiiri> fuck this

P11:46:19 <Visiiri> vede
P11:46:21 <Visiiri> you and dilt
P11:46:23 <Visiiri> deop dilt
P11:46:31 <Visiiri> dilt is a worthless 12 year old peice of shit
P11:46:37 <vede> That's mean.
P11:46:44 <vede> First off, NOTCH opped Dilt.
P11:46:56 <Visiiri> NOTCH wasn't on for alot when Dilt was around.
P11:46:58 <Daidoji> notch isn't infalliable
P11:47:00 <DarkCybrid> @vede know what's harder than wood in minecraft? ^^
P11:47:12 <Daidoji> your penis of course
P11:47:18 <vede> Secondly, I'm not going to do any status-changes, since I'm only a temp-op.
P11:47:20 <Visiiri> Notch invited me to be OP when whe had talked for five seconds.
P11:47:20 <DarkCybrid> i was gonna say iron 
P11:47:21 <DarkCybrid> tbut ok
13P11:47:24 * JRCrusher thinks no one should have answered that.
P11:47:28 <Visiiri> I fucking hate dilt.
P11:47:29 <vede> And I was opped by Super-Dot.
P11:47:40 <vede> And I've only ever seen Dilt make intelligent, mature comments, so yeah.
P11:47:48 <Visiiri> hahaha
P11:47:55 <Visiiri> Your opinion is your own.
P11:48:03 <vede> Right now the only person I see being immature is you.
P11:48:08 <JRCrusher> im going to bed; goodnight
P11:48:11 <Visiiri> Hahahaha

P11:48:19 <vede> Spouting about how he is a "worthless 12 year old piece of shit"
P11:48:26 <Visiiri> Immature =/= possesing an opinion.
P11:48:37 <DarkCybrid> i'm a worthless 15 year old, if that counts
P11:48:42 <Visiiri> omg
P11:48:43 <Visiiri> nowai
P11:48:51 <Visiiri> I was a worthless fifteen year old last year
P11:48:59 <vede> Not saying you're immature as a whole, but the way you're expressing your opinion right now is immature.
P11:49:00 <DarkCybrid> omg
P11:49:14 <Visiiri> Yeah. I guess that makes since.
13P11:49:14 * DarkCybrid 's head explodes
P11:49:15 <Visiiri> err
P11:49:15 <Visiiri> sinse
P11:49:17 <Visiiri> err
P11:49:20 <vede> *sense
P11:49:20 <Visiiri> sense
P11:49:22 <Visiiri> yeah
P11:49:24 <Parthon> lets all just agree on one thing ..
P11:49:28 <Parthon> you are all immature!
P11:49:31 <vede> :O
P11:49:33 <Visiiri> D:
P11:49:39 <Parthon> :P
P11:50:20 <Parthon> maturity is like fame .. if you think you have it, you don't
P11:50:24 <Visiiri> If I could state my opinion more "mature", he is narrow minded and quick to speak, not much unlike myself.
P11:50:44 <Visiiri> That's exactly why I wouldn't hate being [most hated]
P11:50:54 <Parthon> who are we talk about anyways, I just walked in
P11:51:01 <Visiiri> Dilt. >.>
P11:51:03 <vede> Parthon, he's talking about Dilt.
P11:51:05 <Parthon> aah
P11:51:12 <vede> But I've never seen any problems with Dilt.
P11:51:26 <Visiiri> Hmmm
10P11:51:38 * Super-Dot sets mode: +o Parthon
P11:51:39 <Visiiri> I don't believe you were here with the Fonzi incident, were you?
P11:51:42 <Visiiri> orly
P11:51:46 <Visiiri> wth is goin on here?
P11:51:47 <DarkCybrid> Scanning for retards
P11:51:47 <DarkCybrid> >.>
P11:51:48 <DarkCybrid> <.<
P11:51:49 <vede> Uh.
P11:51:54 <DarkCybrid> Target acquired: Dilt = retard
P11:51:57 <DarkCybrid> LOL
P11:52:15 <Visiiri> Ok, really, i'm starting to feel like i'm in hell here
P11:52:23 <Visiiri> I think that Parthon will do a great job
P11:52:36 <Visiiri> but OP'n dilt is like OP'n Liam
P11:52:43 <Visiiri> except dilt acts more mature.
P11:53:33 <Visiiri> I don't understand what is happening.
P11:53:40 <Visiiri> Would you care to enlighten me, super-dot?
P11:53:44 <vede> Visiiri, no one does.
P11:53:57 <Visiiri> Then why the fuck did Dilt the the short straw?
P11:54:06 <Visiiri> I advocate Gear.
P11:54:08 <Super-Dot> I don't know Dilt very well, and I wasn't here when he was opped
P11:54:14 <vede> Super-Dot is very liberal with ops.
P11:54:15 <Super-Dot> So I couldn't say
P11:54:42 <Visiiri> lol
13P11:54:46 * Visiiri picks a straw.
P11:54:52 <Super-Dot> I wish I could aop
P11:55:04 <vede> I doubt Notch would like that.
P11:55:17 <Visiiri> I doubt Notch likes me.
P11:55:18 <vede> The number of ops would skyrocket.
P11:55:28 <Super-Dot> I wouldn't joke-aop
P11:55:45 <Visiiri> I think we need to talk TestBuddy and his friends into HalfOps
P11:56:04 <vede> Am I a joke-op, Super-Dot?
P11:56:15 <Super-Dot> no
P11:56:18 <vede> ./kittenface
P11:56:22 <vede> Ohokay
P11:56:26 <Super-Dot> It was a joke when I opped Meizlizard
P11:57:09 <Super-Dot> Even though I'm pretty sure he's trustworthy, seeing as he's my brother
P11:57:15 <Visiiri> roflmao
P11:57:20 <vede> omfug
