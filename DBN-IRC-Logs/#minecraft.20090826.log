A7:27:57 <Magnulus> I remember the series of screenshots someone had edited in Photoshop to make them look how they wish Diablo 3 looked. A lot of it consisted of making the game nearly greyscale and darker, two things that severely hampers the readability of the game.
A7:28:37 <doohan> I like it as it is tbh
A7:28:56 <doohan> The old games always lookd washed out when I had to put the brightness up on my shitty monitor
A7:29:00 <Magnulus> Also, a lot of the shadow editing was plain impossible to implement in a game engine.
A7:30:29 <Magnulus> And in quite a few he applied sharpening filters to the images to make them look "better".

A7:39:00 <Magnulus> Exactly. I always say that Fallout 3 would have made people suicidal if it hadn't been for the upbeat soundtrack.
A7:40:15 <Magnulus> You can't just say "THIS IS A DARK GAME! IT BROODS! WATCH IT BROOD!!!" and expect people to want to play it for very long. The reason I never finished Doom 3 is precisely because it never let up. It was always dark and scary and never let up or gave you much of a breather.
A7:40:55 <Magnulus> When they DID shake things up, they made them SCARIER and DARKER, like the sequence where you're following the character with a torch.

A7:47:30 <Magnulus> Considering the amount of gore and terrifying things (Like the Fallen Lunatic which stabs itself repeatedly and then explodes) in Diablo 3, as well as the music which I can only assume will be heavy orchestral scores, I think the colours will end up being a very good choice.

A8:28:58 <Quatroking> My awesomeness wins over everything

A8:30:05 <Vic> guys
A8:30:07 <Vic> marach is using mibbit
A8:30:14 <Vic> the images are autoembed for him
A8:30:24 <citricsquid> if you use mibbit you should be banned from irc
A8:30:28 <citricsquid> shittiest client ever
A8:30:32 <citricsquid> not even a client
A8:30:34 <Vic> ^
A8:30:34 <citricsquid> just an annoyance
A8:30:36 <Quatroking> offset: $3 glasses off ebay
A8:30:40 <Marach> yes, i said i had a problem with auto-showing images
A8:30:41 <Quatroking> works great
A8:30:46 <offset> nice
A8:30:51 <Vic> marach: stop using shitbit
A8:31:05 <Marach> i usualy use my nds client
A8:31:17 <Vic> ew
A8:31:24 <Marach> but sometimes i have a game suspended and i cant save
A8:31:26 <offset> I'm yet to find something that beats mIRC, even xchat/equivs.
A8:31:27 <Vic> how does that work
A8:31:39 <Vic> mirc isnt that great
A8:31:43 <Vic> its just another irc client
A8:31:50 <offset> what beats it though
A8:31:58 <Vic> eh, i dunno
A8:32:02 <Vic> i'm happy with my chatzilla
A8:32:04 <Marach> i dont need anything more than mibbit or my nds client

A11:24:07 <Visiiri> Notch, ftw
A11:24:24 <Visiiri> The recent survival test was almost as amazing as I expected.
A11:24:41 <Visiiri> I was hoping the mobs would actually try to kill you and the animals.
A11:25:25 <Visiiri> They don't break through blocks to kill you, and that's what a mob should do in survival.
A11:25:45 <Visiiri> Also, He needs day and night. Perhaps they can hurd in the day, and attack at night.
A11:25:50 <Visiiri> The music should also change.
A11:26:02 <ZomBuster> he's not here! but good ideas anyway
A11:26:09 <Visiiri> I know.
A11:26:29 <Visiiri> I think that there should be sheep and cows and stuff
A11:26:46 <Visiiri> The sheeps should have blocks on their backs as part of them, representing the wool.
A11:26:57 <Niggy> cool
A11:26:57 <ZomBuster> I don't think he can do advanced AI in a few days but I hope he'll do pathfinding later on

A11:34:18 <Visiiri> We were discussing ideas for minecraft.
A11:34:23 <Visiiri> Would you like to see the log?
A11:34:30 <Visiiri> I came up with beutiful ideas :P
A11:34:31 <ZomBuster> food system is simple
A11:34:32 <LucanC> sure, why not.
A11:34:50 <Visiiri> Ugh.
A11:34:53 <Visiiri> It's a bit too long.
A11:35:02 <PuyoDead> pastebin.com
A11:35:06 <ZomBuster> plant = low nutrition meat = med nutrition plant+meat = high nutrition
A11:35:12 <Visiiri> I'm going to place it in the forums.
A11:35:12 <Visiiri> :D
A11:35:31 <ZomBuster> when you are starving you should be able to eat grass
A11:35:49 <LucanC> grass wouldn't do much good though
A11:35:53 <LucanC> starving or not
A11:35:58 <Visiiri> lol
A11:36:05 <Visiiri> It will fuck with your digestive system :P
A11:36:09 <LucanC> yup
A11:36:23 <LucanC> we'd have to grow 3 more stomachs to digest it.
A11:36:28 <Visiiri> lol
A11:36:42 <LucanC> and I don't think we have room for that in us
A11:36:43 <Vic> you can still eat roots
A11:36:49 <Vic> oh yeah
A11:36:50 <Vic> root blocks
A11:37:06 <LucanC> for trees?
A11:37:08 <Vic> yes
A11:37:20 <Vic> rootz r helty
A11:37:33 <Visiiri> Yeah
A11:37:37 <LucanC> tree roots? I wouldn't say that's better than eating grass
A11:37:43 <Vic> actually it is
A11:37:44 <Visiiri> There should be wild plants with the generations that grow back
A11:37:50 <Visiiri> Picking fruits
A11:37:55 <Visiiri> Small plants.
A11:38:06 <Vic> roots are full of nutrition 
A11:38:23 <Vic> hell, what about eating bugs
A11:38:35 <Vic> its a bit extreme, but its survival, right
A11:38:39 <Visiiri> If you're down to a half of life, I don't see why not.
A11:38:42 <LucanC> eating zombies :)
A11:38:49 <Visiiri> Eww. Infection.
A11:39:01 <Visiiri> You could find bugs under rocks that your diggin.
A11:39:06 <Vic> :]
A11:39:10 <Visiiri> lol
A11:39:20 <Vic> cobblestone should be modded into stones
A11:39:26 <Vic> like the above ground stones
A11:39:36 <Visiiri> Nah.
A11:39:43 <Visiiri> I think we need to have tools that do that stuff
A11:39:51 <LucanC> cobble should be picked up from stone like planks are from logs
A11:39:52 <Visiiri> Not a whole bunch of above ground stone :P
A11:39:56 <Vic> well
A11:40:00 <Visiiri> I guess.
A11:40:10 <Visiiri> But how do we get planks and stone?
A11:40:17 <Visiiri> err...
A11:40:18 <Vic> uh
A11:40:19 <Visiiri> Logs and stone?
A11:40:21 <Vic> there should be something
A11:40:24 <LucanC> you get 3-5 planks from one log
A11:40:25 <Vic> like a
A11:40:33 <Vic> some kind of a workshop
A11:40:36 <Vic> that you can smelt resources on
A11:40:36 <Visiiri> Yeah
A11:40:41 <Visiiri> I was thinking a forgery.
A11:40:42 <LucanC> no, haven't you seen the new video?
A11:40:48 <Visiiri> Yeah.
A11:40:51 <Vic> like 4 planks into a log
A11:40:54 <LucanC> yes
A11:41:01 <Visiiri> But how do we get a log D:?
A11:41:05 <LucanC> should be maybe, one cobble for every stone
A11:41:09 <Vic> you
A11:41:14 <Vic> you mine logs
A11:41:17 <Vic> you gain 5 plants
A11:41:18 <LucanC> I don't think we'll be able to get logs.
A11:41:18 <Vic> planks
A11:41:27 <Vic> you go to a workshop, you smelt the planks into a log
A11:41:46 <Vic> i saw that concept
A11:41:52 <Vic> in a GMod gamemode
A11:41:53 <Visiiri> Maybe if you isolate the log, so it's just floating. No logs above or below. Then it becomes a resource?
A11:42:11 <Vic> thats
A11:42:13 <Vic> not how gravity works
A11:42:21 <Vic> unless notch leaves the gravity as is
A11:42:28 <Visiiri> Yeah
A11:42:36 <Visiiri> but still, it'd work
A11:42:41 <Visiiri> destroy above
A11:42:47 <Visiiri> destroy below
A11:42:48 <Vic> i say my solution'd work better
A11:42:58 <Visiiri> Yeah.
A11:43:10 <Vic> you could do all kinds of stuff with it
A11:43:14 <Vic> like uh
A11:43:21 <Vic> make leaves from plants
A11:43:26 <Vic> ...thats dumb but IT WORKS
A11:43:33 <Visiiri> Dye cloth from sheep :D
A11:43:36 <Vic> yes
A11:43:41 <Vic> and get some paint
A11:43:44 <Vic> from... fruits?
A11:43:50 <Visiiri> Paint would be cool.
A11:43:54 <Visiiri> So are signs.
A11:44:01 <Vic> yeah
A11:44:05 <Vic> and uh
A11:44:10 <LucanC> signs will be very handy.
A11:44:19 <Vic> you should get a few plants from destroying a leaf block
A11:44:43 <Vic> so you can make leaf blocks by smelting plants
A11:44:51 <LucanC> I'd say maybe one plant for every few leaves
A11:44:56 <LucanC> cause they make trees
A11:44:57 <Vic> hmm
A11:45:04 <LucanC> and people would spam trees
A11:45:14 <Vic> thats fine actually
A11:45:23 <Visiiri> Yeah.
A11:45:36 <Visiiri> I think that axes should take trees down in a few hits though...
A11:45:40 <Vic> yes
A11:45:52 <Visiiri> All of it becomes resources.
A11:45:54 <Visiiri> Err...
A11:45:58 <Vic> if you axe the lowest log block it falls down!
A11:46:00 <Visiiri> Half of it becomes resources.
A11:46:01 <LucanC> yeah, same for pics digging stone
A11:46:12 <Vic> no, all of it
A11:46:16 <Vic> why half of it
A11:46:28 <Visiiri> Because then it's very easy to get resources.
A11:46:36 <Visiiri> We don't want to have nearly unlimited in survival.

A11:48:59 <Vic> then again
A11:49:09 <Vic> you
A11:49:23 <Vic> could make it so if you have a specific tool equipped
A11:49:29 <Vic> you gain different resources from mining
A11:49:42 <Vic> like, if you have axe equipped, you gain logs and not planks
A11:49:53 <Visiiri> Yeah...
A11:50:15 <LucanC> shouldn't get too complex
A11:50:16 <Vic> (i'm stealing it from that gmod gamemode but yeah)
A11:50:36 <Vic> it isnt really
A11:59:16 <LG_Legacy> I'm going to end up flooding the damn topic this way

P12:04:01 <Visiiri> Hello.
P12:04:03 <C418> you people made me notice that there actually is something like a web-irc-site
P12:04:10 <C418> mibbit is pretty nice
P12:04:27 <Visiiri> Yeah. I use it now. mIRC isn't connecting right D:
P12:04:32 <C418> and it even goes through every proxy without problems because it uses a completely different ip
P12:04:49 <Visiiri> :D
P12:04:55 <C418> that means they use a dedicated server for all our mibbit irc connections
P12:04:59 <C418> quite a nice service
P12:05:00 <Visiiri> Anyway, i'm going to post my thread now.

P12:25:24 <Visiiri> Is there a portforwarding guide out there that goes the hard way?
P12:26:33 <LG_Legacy> ?
P12:26:36 <ZomBuster> hard way?

P1:00:14 <gdude2002> Porbably making armour/weapons later on
P1:00:18 <fydo> use it to fight orcs
P1:00:19 <ZomBuster> it will be for item crafting
P1:00:29 <Azjherben> Hmm
P1:00:36 <Azjherben> Can you collect and build it?
P1:00:58 <gear|work> i think thats the idea
P1:01:07 <citricsquid> what's the glitch gdude?

P4:03:41 <Snowman> There is amber purple 3d

P4:03:43 <liq3> I mean purple is what, red and blue?
P4:03:58 <liq3> ...and orange is also red.
P4:03:59 <Zachariasmith> they worked in the movie i saw with them
P4:04:02 <liq3> dude wtf @ your glasses.
P4:04:06 <Zachariasmith> :P
P4:04:10 <Super-Dot> Quatroking: It's exactly 1/10 of your height? O_o
P4:04:14 <Zachariasmith> yeah il have to pick up some good ones
P4:04:16 <liq3> The reason red/cyan works is because it splits red and green/blue.
P4:04:31 <liq3> yours is like, red and red/green/blue or some shit. :P
P4:04:42 <liq3> erm, red/blue*
P4:04:43 <Zachariasmith> yeah i see what ur saying
P4:04:45 <Quatroking> superdot: oh wow, now you mention it
P4:04:57 <PuyoDead> there were orange/purple 3d glasses for a tv ad for monsters vs. aliens
P4:05:02 <Zachariasmith> its is blue but the other one looks super orange
P4:05:16 <PuyoDead> they just changed the two pictures from red/blue to orange/purple is all
P4:05:21 <Zachariasmith> it makes white look brown
P4:05:21 <liq3> PuyoDead: ooh wow, weird.
P4:05:34 <Zachariasmith> blue makes it look really deep blue
P4:05:37 <PuyoDead> why, I have no idea
P4:05:38 <Zachariasmith> its odd
P4:05:55 <Zachariasmith> i think that minecraft should be stereo scopic and crazy :P
P4:06:08 <Zachariasmith> that would be awesome

P4:06:14 <Zachariasmith> k i brb
P4:06:15 <Vic> no it shouldnt
P4:06:33 <PuyoDead> man, stereoscopic would be awesome
P4:06:55 <PuyoDead> smaller screen would suck, but I really don't care, it'd be worth it
P4:07:01 <Snowman> I should look what minecraft looks like on 10 combined monitors
P4:07:20 <Vic> stereoscopic vision doesnt work for me
P4:07:22 <Vic> so no
P4:07:25 <Snowman> Too bad I dont have 10 monitors
P4:07:25 <Zachariasmith> k back
P4:07:25 <liq3> Ah, Zach, yours were probably yellow/blue, they just loooked orange/purple. :P
P4:07:28 <Vic> i'm not letting you have something i cant
P4:07:30 <Vic> >:|!
P4:07:42 <Zachariasmith> yeah they could be yellow blue too i gues
P4:08:01 <Snowman> I can't do steroscopic either, I probably just do it wrong though :p
P4:08:07 <Snowman> stero
P4:08:08 <Vic> i cant
P4:08:10 <Snowman> stereo
P4:08:12 <Snowman> ffs
P4:08:12 <Vic> eye condition
P4:08:18 <Super-Dot> stero stero stero
P4:08:22 <Zachariasmith> can anyone do they cross eyed 3d thing?
P4:08:31 <Zachariasmith> i learnt how to once
P4:08:35 <PuyoDead> I have a friend who is blind in one eye, so it would be worthless for him
P4:08:36 <Zachariasmith> i cant do it anymore though
P4:08:36 <Vic> thats stereoscopic fff
P4:08:45 <Super-Dot> Vic: Does that mean that you can't look at objects up close?
P4:08:54 <Zachariasmith> yeah but without glasses and stuff
P4:08:54 <Vic> wweeeell
P4:08:56 <Vic> i can
P4:09:02 <PuyoDead> I hate the cross eyed type
P4:09:08 <Vic> stereoscopic IS without glasses
P4:09:08 <PuyoDead> I'm much better at the other direction
P4:09:12 <Vic> or am i doing it wrong
P4:09:17 <PuyoDead> yea, no glasses needed
P4:09:24 <Vic> i
P4:09:34 <Vic> i a LITTLE cross-eyed
P4:09:41 <Zachariasmith> u can do it with glasses to though cant you
P4:09:41 <Zachariasmith> or is that something else
P4:09:44 <PuyoDead> it takes practice, that's true
P4:09:45 <Zachariasmith> my friend was calling it stereo
P4:09:47 <Vic> but that's because my eyeholes arent placed perfectly placed
P4:10:12 <Vic> eye socket even
P4:10:15 <Vic> or i dont even 
P4:10:18 <Vic> fffff
P4:10:23 <PuyoDead> http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/stereoscopic1903a.jpg
P4:10:33 <PuyoDead> that's the kind I can do
P4:10:49 <Vic> i just cant do this
P4:11:05 <Vic> i dunno maybe i'm just doing it wrong
P4:11:16 <Zachariasmith> i always go to far with those ones
P4:11:27 <Vic> but 3d glasses never work for me
P4:11:32 <PuyoDead> it would be the equivalent of looking twice the distance -behind- the monitor
P4:11:55 <PuyoDead> cross eyed type would be focusing half the distance -toward- you
P4:12:02 <Zachariasmith> i watched the new harry potter in 3d yesterday
P4:12:09 <Siiseli> haha
P4:12:10 <Siiseli> potter..
P4:12:12 <Zachariasmith> it was pretty well done
P4:12:24 <PuyoDead> coraline was pretty neat in real3d

P4:12:38 <Siiseli> :D
P4:12:47 <Zachariasmith> lol
P4:12:58 <Zachariasmith> oh no!
P4:13:05 <Zachariasmith> minecraft isnt liking me today
P4:13:10 <liq3> ?
P4:13:16 <liq3> I'm getting my 3d glasses today. :D
P4:13:20 <Zachariasmith> im gettinf some error message about zeros
P4:13:26 <liq3> divide by zero?
P4:13:58 <Zachariasmith> java.lang.arithmaticException / zero
P4:14:02 <Zachariasmith> something like that
P4:14:20 <liq3> yes.
P4:14:25 <liq3> Did it happen while loading?
P4:14:38 <Zachariasmith> loading the applet thing
P4:14:40 <Zachariasmith> yeah
P4:14:53 <liq3> yep, it's an annoying bug that gets me all the time. Make sure the window (or tab) is focused while you load it. xD
P4:15:18 <Zachariasmith> k il try that
P4:16:49 <Vic> so it divided by zero basically
P4:16:52 <Zachariasmith> k its working now thanks
P4:16:57 <Zachariasmith> i g2g byebye
P4:17:10 <LG_Legacy> The only fuck up that happens when i alt tab while loading sometimes, is it locks up, or doesn't display for shit.
P4:17:16 <Zachariasmith> and if u see minotour tell him hes awesome for me

P4:49:25 <ZomBuster> not much to do on it
P4:49:31 <vede> What do you mean?
P4:49:39 <ZomBuster> not so much games
P4:49:52 <vede> There's Sauerbraten and Blood Frontier...
P4:49:56 <vede> Both very good games.
P4:50:10 <vede> But what I'm saying is, with such a GOOD engine, I'd expect more games to be made with it.
P4:50:23 <PuyoDead> I tried that blood frontier, it has some very nice aspects, and runs smoothly, but has some real oddities to it
P4:50:30 <vede> Like?
P4:50:37 <PuyoDead> some odd collision detection

P6:40:14 <citricsquid> I am over ruling that
P6:40:16 <citricsquid> I find it tricky
P6:40:18 <Quatroking> in fact, don't use a computer
P6:40:33 <citricsquid> OVERRULED
P6:40:53 <Quatroking> but I have a lot of money and I suck dick so I win anyways
P6:40:56 <Quatroking> zing
P6:40:59 <UnknownX> Its quite hard for me to right click
P6:41:02 <Quatroking> welcome to the real world
P6:41:33 <UnknownX> I have to open my right clicking port everytime

P6:42:10 <UnknownX> and detach the safety plastic cover on my right click
P6:42:44 <UnknownX> So i don't have a right clicking accident
P6:44:20 <Quatroking> I have my rightclick locked with a 50-number combination

P6:45:06 <UnknownX> "Addition is not preferable to subtraction for griefers, the only real method of doing so with this is random construction, which is, at worst, a pest." Teaching how to grief :D
P6:45:31 <Quatroking> I'm getting rid of all the substraction/addition pages, its worthless stuff
P6:45:41 <UnknownX> No
P6:45:45 <UnknownX> I need it
P6:45:57 <UnknownX> Everyone needs them
P6:46:04 <Quatroking> Does wikipedia tell you how to breath correctly?
P6:46:09 <UnknownX> Yes
P6:46:13 <Quatroking> along with 50 variants of it
P6:46:22 <UnknownX> Yes
P6:46:23 <Quatroking> IT DOES NOT.
13P6:46:35 * Quatroking slaps UnknownX in the face
P6:47:07 <UnknownX> Does the wiki tell you how to think?
P6:47:17 <Snowman> Yes
P6:47:29 <Maulrus> is the minecraft wiki not work
P6:47:30 <Vic> wiki how to
P6:47:33 <Maulrus> also quatro:
P6:47:42 <Vic> i'm
P6:47:48 <Vic> pretty sure there's a guide on wikihowtos
P6:47:52 <Maulrus> wikiped doesn't teach you that but a gaming wiki can have controls for a a game
P6:47:56 <Maulrus> not the same thing
P6:48:08 <Quatroking> the controls are under the fucking applet
P6:48:18 <Maulrus> though
P6:48:19 <Maulrus> It is the opposite of block subtraction, which provides the other half of sandbox gameplay. 
P6:48:24 <Maulrus> that is pretty fucking dumb
P6:48:28 <Maulrus> i was just arguing
P6:48:37 <Zachariasmith> so some people may not have played the game and want the info while their are reading the wiki
P6:49:06 <UnknownX> http://www.wikihow.com/Breathe
P6:49:08 <Quatroking> lemme count the pages about tile-removing/adding related stuff
P6:49:23 <Maulrus> okay my opinion:
P6:49:24 <Maulrus> Block addition is the process of adding a block to the map.
P6:49:29 <Maulrus> that definition decribes nothing
P6:49:36 <Maulrus> it uses both of the words in the phrase IN THE DEFINITION

P6:50:01 <Zachariasmith> k im gonna go
P6:50:01 <citricsquid> make a page about 3d :)
P6:50:02 <Zachariasmith> byebye
P6:50:14 <Maulrus> i agree with quatro, this is dum
P6:50:18 <UnknownX> Do they explain to you how you right click and left click then switch blocks to add?
P6:50:25 <Zachariasmith> oh on the 3d page, say that orange and blue glasses dont work!
P6:50:31 <Zachariasmith> k bye
P6:50:37 <Quatroking> citricsquid: that is actually useful, a guide on how to use the anaglyph mode
P6:50:40 <citricsquid> link to the right type of glasses and explain what type won't work
P6:50:45 <citricsquid> and that ;)
P6:50:49 <Maulrus> amagraph
P6:50:51 <Quatroking> THAT, is a wiki page.
P6:50:59 <Maulrus> so i am a bit confused
P6:51:12 <Maulrus> right now, survival looks like sandbox mode with enemies and limitations
P6:51:14 <Maulrus> and trees
P6:51:50 <Maulrus> what else is planned
P6:52:05 <citricsquid> Quatroking: If you wannna write up some wiki dos and dont's, I'll sticky them in the wiki forum and add them to the posting forms for the wiki :)
P6:52:06 <PuyoDead> weapons, resource storage, multiplayer, etc
P6:52:06 <Quatroking> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Blocky < do we need to keep this
P6:52:20 <Quatroking> citricsquid: . . . check the wiki forum
P6:52:30 <Quatroking> I already have a topic about shit I don't want, I gotta update it
P6:52:34 <citricsquid> yeah, but it's v. empty
P6:52:44 <UnknownX> Theres like 2 things in it

P6:53:23 <LG_Legacy> You're the damn wiki admin
P6:53:25 <Maulrus> Tunneling is generally disallowed unless the tunnel was present before the game started. 
P6:53:26 <Maulrus> but what
P6:53:27 <Maulrus> how
P6:53:38 <Maulrus> that game sounds stoopid
P6:53:42 <Quatroking> who the hell is cryzed
P6:53:42 <LG_Legacy> Tunneling is allowed unless said so :<
P6:53:51 <Snowman> `Maulrus, look at the name

P6:54:52 <Maulrus> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Seeker
P6:54:55 <Maulrus> so this came along
P6:55:02 <Maulrus> after the rush of games that tried to emulate spleef
P6:55:05 <Maulrus> er
P6:55:05 <Maulrus> furing
P6:55:07 <Maulrus> during
P6:55:16 <citricsquid> What's wrong with it? 
P6:55:18 <Quatroking> fuhrer
P6:55:19 <Snowman> I press random page: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/AnnihilatorBeta
P6:55:22 <citricsquid> game might be stupid, but article is well written
P6:55:36 <Quatroking> ah, yes, our lovely user category
P6:55:38 <Maulrus> It was created June 27th, 2009, but still hasn't been played. 
P6:55:40 <Maulrus> ahaha
P6:55:41 <Quatroking> the funpot of the wiki
P6:55:43 <Maulrus> oh wow
P6:55:47 <Maulrus> seeker is just like bridges
P6:55:52 <citricsquid> You should "crack down" on poorly written empty articles, not stupid hames.
P6:55:53 <citricsquid> games*
P6:55:59 <Maulrus> anyone who was on my server the day spleef craze started should remember that
P6:56:22 <Quatroking> citricsquid: Lets just no longer accept silly games.
P6:56:33 <Snowman> YEAH LIKE THIS IS USEFUL http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Solid_block
P6:56:52 <Quatroking> snowman: . . . what
P6:57:01 <citricsquid> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Dedicated_Server This is the sort of thing you should discourage, it's poorly written and has very little information. Just because the game is silly, does it matter? As long as the article is well written and contains enough info to be viable...
P6:57:12 <Snowman> Omg, let's look up what I can and cannot walk though
P6:57:13 <Maulrus> Just because the game is silly, does it matter?
P6:57:15 <Maulrus> i think
P6:57:25 <Quatroking> Hmm
P6:57:34 <Quatroking> I'm making up a list of shit I don't want.
P6:57:40 <Maulrus> that if the game is just essentially masturbation for the person who made it (i made this on this day, on this server, isn't it COOL?)
P6:57:42 <Maulrus> why keep it?
P6:57:44 <Quatroking> as well as do
P6:57:52 <Quatroking> do's and dont's etc
P6:58:43 <Snowman> -.- http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/AlLnAtuRalX
P6:59:01 <Quatroking> but about the silly game, if three 12-year olds come up with a stupid game involving a ball three feet and a butt, and make a wiki page about it called "buttball", do you think it would be accepted?
P6:59:02 <Maulrus> i think
P6:59:07 <Maulrus> we should keep that page
P6:59:13 <Maulrus> about alLnAtuRalX
P6:59:18 <Maulrus> on the grounds that it is a work of art
P6:59:34 <Quatroking> snowman, the user category is the funpot.
P6:59:44 <Snowman> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Air_pockets wtf
P6:59:47 <Quatroking> See it as the uncyclominea
P6:59:55 <citricsquid> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Treehouse
P7:00:00 <citricsquid> Articles like this shouldn't be allowed
P7:00:02 <Snowman> At least make that in decent english
P7:00:26 <Quatroking> citricsquid: then I'd have to delete almost the entire structure category
P7:00:34 <citricsquid> Quatroking: No, you can merge them.
P7:00:40 <Quatroking> Yup.
P7:00:43 <Quatroking> or that.
P7:00:47 <Quatroking> my idea.
P7:00:50 <Maulrus> [19:00] <Quatroking> snowman, the user category is the funpot.

P7:01:59 <Snowman> Though being a holy symbol in Asian religions such as hinduism and jainism

P7:02:17 <Maulrus> quatro:
P7:02:19 <Quatroking> yeah, true
P7:02:27 <Maulrus> that seems sorta okay to keep
P7:02:30 <vede> Why remove it?
P7:02:37 <UnknownX> Air pockets?
P7:02:41 <Quatroking> happiness, is what we sell, thats why everyone love BNL
P7:02:48 <vede> It's a relevant piece of information.
P7:02:50 <Maulrus> though it should emphasize that planety of players get pissed at them
P7:02:54 <Maulrus> planety? whut
P7:02:56 <Maulrus> plent
P7:02:56 <Maulrus> y
P7:03:05 <vede> "due to the controversial nature of the structure, building random swastikas around the place is commonly a way of griefing."
P7:03:11 <Maulrus> also oh god it's called admiuim now?
P7:03:14 <Maulrus> admium even?
P7:03:20 <Maulrus> yeah but that's not an emphasis
P7:03:25 <Quatroking> Yeah I'm fully against naming of tiles.
P7:03:42 <Quatroking> adminium, okay, I can live a little with that
P7:03:47 <Quatroking> because it sounds nice
P7:03:47 <citricsquid> vede: Surely that piece of information, being so small, would do better in a section for griefing techniques?
P7:03:51 <Snowman> OP=ium :D
P7:03:55 <citricsquid> We don't need an entire section just for a single shape...
P7:03:56 <Snowman> OP-ium
P7:04:01 <Maulrus> no.
P7:04:02 <Quatroking> opium?
P7:04:02 <Maulrus> nonono
P7:04:03 <vede> That sounds like a good idea, actually, citricsquid.
P7:04:03 <Quatroking> lol

P10:31:14 <Foe> The nation needs to fight another nation with the same amount of people or get a penalty
P10:31:46 <Foe> To win you have to occupy most of the board with your color
P10:32:07 <Foe> Build up doesn't count, but helps in enccumbering the foe.
P10:32:23 <Foe> It looks awesome
P10:33:06 <Foe> That is how you battle
P10:33:45 <Foe> When you win, you get to go to the map room, and take one square out of the loser's land
