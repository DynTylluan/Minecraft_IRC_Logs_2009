Session Ident: #minecraft
A12:10:26 <zid> it's been around for ages
A12:10:30 <zid> just not officially

10A12:10:42 * Super-Dot (Super-Dot@adsl-75-61-94-186.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:11:29 <zaqu> so whats everyone up to\
A12:11:47 <zaqu> and does anyuone want help building a project?
A12:12:00 <Evil-Ville> What kind of project
A12:12:30 <zid> no, he wants to build a ghetto
A12:15:35 <notjotham> afaik it's never been made before
A12:15:38 <zaqu> like a pyramid or lava moat caslte
A12:16:02 <notjotham> it was just theoretical

10A12:16:22 * zaqu (opera@naprouter1.jetstream.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:16:39 <zaqu> does minecraft work in opera yet?
A12:16:43 <paul|not> no
A12:16:51 <notjotham> opera is a suckers game
10A12:16:58 * Parthon (cheeeese@124-169-82-40.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:17:07 <zaqu> opera>firefox
A12:17:15 <paul|not> oh dear god don't get that started
A12:17:22 <zaqu> too late
A12:17:34 <notjotham> firefox is a suckers game
A12:17:52 <zaqu> chrome is a tools game
A12:18:04 <zaqu> maxthon is high tier
A12:18:07 <notjotham> i don't know any browser that is without major flaws
A12:18:27 <Parthon> firefox's major flaw is?
A12:18:30 <notjotham> but, i will say this, using a browser that marginalises and breaks your internet experience is probably the action of a perverse man
10A12:19:04 * AlMightyBob is now known as AlMightyAway
A12:19:22 <zaqu> firefox crashes too often
A12:19:39 <notjotham> firefox has a number of flaws, i would say ones that affect me most are its current operation speed, it's instability in linux (a plugin should never bring down its host)
A12:19:50 <zaqu> chrome has poor bookmark access
A12:20:02 <notjotham> chrome isn't really viable atm from my perspective
A12:20:17 <notjotham> but given the coming epic battle between adobe, apple, microsoft, and google, chrome is well placed
A12:20:34 <Parthon> adobe? lol
A12:20:52 <zaqu> adobe has a browser?
A12:20:57 <notjotham> flash is, for better or worse, a contender in the new software layer that is starting to dominate the application market
A12:21:09 <zaqu> true enough
A12:21:16 <Parthon> I think flash is more of an enabler than a competitor
A12:21:19 <zaqu> but java is also quite high on that list
A12:21:36 <notjotham> java doesn't have an equivilent product 
A12:21:47 <Parthon> java applets?
A12:21:50 <notjotham> hold on
A12:22:27 <notjotham> the market consists of google/apple with html5/webkit, google/adobe with the new javascript engines, adobe with flash/flex, google with canvas/chrome/o3d/aformentioned htm5, microsoft with xaml/wpf/.net
A12:22:43 <notjotham> there isn't an equivilent java platform (xml style markup for a good quality vector rasteriser) yet
A12:22:52 <notjotham> there are some nice java rasterisers though
A12:22:59 <notjotham> nothing tied in nicely and in increasing usage
A12:23:23 <notjotham> that's the current shape of the application platform, the host OS is increasingly irrelevent
A12:24:12 <Parthon> what web based rasteriser is apple creating?
A12:24:16 <notjotham> using a minority browser is like voting yourself out of the likelyhood of a good application experience
A12:24:36 <notjotham> apple isn't providing a rasteriser
A12:24:49 <notjotham> well ignoring quicktime and safari
A12:24:59 <notjotham> their main contribution atm seems to be with html5
A12:25:06 <notjotham> and the itune/iphone platform
10A12:25:21 * paul|2 (grif392@209.65.247.45) has joined #minecraft
A12:25:29 <notjotham> we're watching the emergence of a new application layer, all the big players realise this
A12:25:34 <notjotham> it's just us little guys that are slow to catch on
A12:25:36 <Parthon> for sure
12A12:25:37 * paul|not (grif392@209.65.247.45) Quit (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by paul|2)))
10A12:25:42 * paul|2 is now known as paul|not
A12:25:45 <Parthon> not at all :P
A12:26:05 <notjotham> i hope o3d sorts its shit out
A12:26:05 <Parthon> most of those companies and platforms you mentioned tend to overlap more than they compete ..
A12:26:07 <notjotham> it's terrible atm
A12:26:12 <Parthon> like, webkit can't replace flash
A12:26:18 <Parthon> flash can't replace javascript
A12:26:22 <paul|not> naw man unity > all
A12:26:22 <notjotham> right, i tried to illustrate the overlap when i listed the various parts
A12:26:33 <notjotham> but the space itself is forcing competition between the parts in various ways
A12:26:51 <notjotham> i wouldn't have believed adobe would even be a participant in this battle 5 years ago
12A12:26:58 * CheeToS (na@c-69-143-253-69.hsd1.md.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:26:59 <Parthon> yeah, it's the underlying platforms that are competiting, not the layers on top
A12:27:10 <notjotham> i don't know about that
A12:27:16 <notjotham> .net and flash are in direct competition
A12:27:30 <Parthon> but the only two competitors for flash are silverlight and java applets
A12:27:31 <notjotham> html5 and xaml will be in increasing competition
A12:27:45 <notjotham> xaml and flex/flash are in competition
A12:27:49 <Parthon> silverlight is not used much atm, and java applets are for something completely different
A12:28:06 <notjotham> it's more xaml/wpf/.net silverlight is only relevent to non windows systems
A12:28:18 <notjotham> since in windows you will see less silverlight and more full fledged web delivered wpf
12A12:28:19 * betasword (chatzilla@c-67-175-203-230.hsd1.il.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
A12:28:25 <Parthon> are you sure? given that silverlight is windows only?
A12:28:41 <Parthon> or at least, it's poorly deployed on other platforms
A12:28:42 <notjotham> a lot has been written about silverlight being designed to not depend on dx
A12:28:46 <notjotham> that's their plan
A12:28:49 <notjotham> so they can spread it
10A12:28:55 * zaqu (opera@naprouter1.jetstream.net) has left #minecraft
A12:28:58 <notjotham> otherwise we'd just be seeing wpf everywhere
10A12:29:02 * zaqu (opera@naprouter1.jetstream.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:29:11 <Parthon> what layer does xaml work on?
A12:29:33 <notjotham> it's a markup, like html5, like the markup flex uses (well flex got renamed flash again afaik)
A12:29:53 <Parthon> flex is actionscript 3, which is the engine behind flash
A12:29:58 <notjotham> it's just used to describe shit for the various rendering environments (be it browser or browser-inbrowser (i.e. flash, java applet, silverlight))
A12:30:08 <notjotham> right, i am a comercial flash developer at the mometn
A12:30:14 <Parthon> so they are synonymous .. but they aren't markups, they are scripting languages
A12:30:21 <notjotham> flex is the name for a particular philosophical assembly for AVM2
A12:30:24 <Parthon> yup
10A12:30:32 * zaqu (opera@naprouter1.jetstream.net) has left #minecraft
A12:30:34 <Parthon> so xaml is the silverlight script?
A12:30:37 <notjotham> no
A12:30:38 <Parthon> or web markup?
A12:30:59 <notjotham> xaml is a description format used for a variety of runtimes
A12:31:06 <Parthon> aah
A12:31:14 <notjotham> you 'script' with C# or Jscript or whatever that runs in the .net runtime
A12:31:27 <notjotham> the idea with flex is to provide a similar markup approach
A12:31:31 <notjotham> same idea with html5 and canvas
A12:31:38 <notjotham> (and potentually o3d)
A12:33:06 <notjotham> anyway that's why i lol at opera
A12:33:09 <notjotham> in summary =D
A12:34:04 <Parthon> it's confusing, because some of those technologies are for backend applications and some are for frontend applications .. given that, I wouldn't say they were overlapping
A12:34:29 <notjotham> whatever you say
A12:34:54 <notjotham> C# for instance is for both ends now
A12:35:02 <notjotham> as is AS3 in a variety of specific contexts
A12:35:19 <Parthon> how does AS3 work outside of the flash/flex environment
A12:35:44 <Parthon> c# is a language, .net is a platform and silverlight is a platform
A12:35:48 <notjotham> flash remoting server
A12:35:55 <notjotham> i think that's what it's called
10A12:35:59 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) has joined #minecraft
A12:36:00 <notjotham> might be called flash communication server
A12:36:06 <notjotham> we don't use it
A12:36:34 <notjotham> basically allows you to bind existing infrastructure tomcat/iis/apache/whatever to flash with a nice AMF1 RPC system
A12:37:47 <Parthon> yeah, it allows greater connection with the backend infrastructure
A12:40:17 <notjotham> i think you'll see apples webkit/html5 using a mixture of flash and canvas vs adobes flash/flex vs googles chrome/canvas/htm5 vs microsofts xaml/wpf/.net
A12:40:35 <notjotham> in a general incestuous row
A12:41:48 <Parthon> for sure
A12:41:52 <Parthon> then you have the crazy people ..
A12:42:09 <Parthon> that use flash on php and apache, or flash on .net
A12:42:39 <Parthon> apache/php/sql/flash is very popular, but I wouldn't call it a platform
A12:42:51 <Parthon> but that's for the small time players, like myspace and facebook
A12:43:09 <notjotham> fuck php
A12:43:27 <notjotham> anyway on that note, it is time for some tea
A12:43:34 <obnub> I'd rather php not procreate

A1:13:02 <betasword> Seriously.
A1:13:07 <betasword> That's just... Wow.
A1:14:19 <paul|not> probably
A1:14:31 <paul|not> just some randomization + a gradual de-slope
A1:15:06 <betasword> Where are people getting map editors and stuff for this?
A1:16:13 <vdgmprgrmr> They're making them.
A1:16:28 <paul|not> not map editors, just programs that spit out data that they convert into maps
A1:16:35 <paul|not> a few map eds.
A1:16:40 <paul|not> but WIPs
A1:17:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, yeah.
A1:18:25 <vdgmprgrmr> But a program that you manipulate to spit out map data is basically a very bare-bones, extremely user-unfriendly map editor.

A1:37:14 <liq3> Which one?

A1:38:07 <Syndlig> Parthon, your roads need work.
A1:38:16 <Syndlig> I see roads that are practically unwalkable.  :P
A1:38:40 <betasword> I just wish I knew how to make some of those myself.
A1:39:02 <betasword> Personally, I'd like to see bigger sized maps for multiplayer, both horizontally and vertically.
A1:39:16 <betasword> Though I know that that could be a rather big performance drain, as well.'

A2:05:32 <liq3> So it sounds like all decent expansions are for payed only until it's open source. :p
A2:05:44 <liq3> And from the looks of things so far, it won't be open source for a year or 2 at least.
A2:05:54 <Batosai3591> meh

A2:08:01 <liq3> Batosai: CTF and Survival WILL be worth it.
A2:08:11 <Batosai3591> lol only 2 gametypes?
A2:08:26 <liq3> I have a feeling even Survival alone is going to be worth the 10 Euros, or future 20 Euros.
A2:08:26 <liq3> :p
A2:08:36 <Batosai3591> got L4D for that, lol
A2:08:43 <liq3> Lol. TF2 realeased with like 5 maps or something and 2 gamemodes? :P

A2:10:03 <liq3> Yeh, trust me, this game is easily worth 10 Euros. 
A2:10:14 <liq3> Weather you want to buy or it not is entirely your choice. :p
A2:11:16 <Batosai3591> anyone here waiting for rosettas editing tool?

A2:14:18 <Batosai3591> xp was pretty good >.>
A2:14:26 <Batosai3591> and windows 7 will be all C# so
A2:14:27 <liq3> XP is the best so far... and it still sucks.
A2:14:33 <Batosai3591> compared to?
A2:14:36 <zaqu> vista is good
A2:14:46 <liq3> It doesn't need to be compared to anything. It just plain sucks. :/
A2:14:51 <Batosai3591> vista isnt bad if you know how to use it
A2:14:56 <zaqu> but like xp it has been through 2 service pacls
A2:14:58 <Batosai3591> and dont have a shit computer
A2:15:01 <liq3> It's virus prone. Gets bogged down easy. Crashes easy. 
A2:15:21 <Batosai3591> what would you rather use?
A2:15:23 <zaqu> no crashing no bogging no viruses
A2:15:27 <liq3> Nothing. All OSes suck atm.
A2:15:29 <zaqu> vista > xp
A2:15:31 <Batosai3591> lol
A2:15:40 <liq3> Linux has terrible GUI and is way bloated.
A2:15:55 <zaqu> gui osnt that terrible
A2:15:57 <Batosai3591> so make your own or deal with it <.< lol
A2:16:01 <liq3> Windows is got the worst architecture ever (i.e. tons of viruses). 
A2:16:02 <zaqu> but it is getting bloated
A2:16:04 <liq3> Mac is for simple people. :/
A2:16:13 <liq3> Oh and Mac is way overpriced.
A2:16:19 <Batosai3591> if you complain of viruses you need a better antivirus
A2:16:20 <zaqu> whoa
A2:16:24 <zaqu> you buy macs?
A2:16:31 <liq3> zaqu: no.
A2:16:33 <Batosai3591> ew mac
A2:16:40 <Batosai3591> like shaving with a bowling pin
A2:16:42 <zaqu> why not just pirate it all and runn on a cheap intel proccessor
A2:16:42 <liq3> My current PC I built myself. Thus why I hate Macs.
A2:16:55 <Batosai3591> ill be going for an i7 build soon actually
A2:16:59 <zaqu> i have a home built mac
A2:17:06 <liq3> Windows wins the OS race because of games.
A2:17:12 <liq3> For office stuff, Linux is best.
A2:17:16 <Batosai3591> i dont pc game too much so...
A2:17:24 <Batosai3591> i just much prefer it ti linux
A2:17:28 <liq3> If you don't game much, then Linux is best. :/
A2:17:44 <liq3> Batosai: There has only ever been like 1 virus for linux, and it was made in a test lab.
A2:17:51 <Batosai3591> XD
A2:18:00 <liq3> Windows has millions of viruses.
A2:18:01 <liq3> :/
A2:18:05 <Batosai3591> so get NOD
A2:18:09 <Batosai3591> free and great
A2:18:15 <zaqu> i use avira
A2:18:16 <Batosai3591> plus resource friendly
A2:18:16 <liq3> You don't get it >.>.
A2:18:22 <liq3> Windows is made so badly it's possible to make viruses. :p
A2:18:33 <Batosai3591> ugh
A2:18:36 <liq3> It's why I hate windows. :/
A2:18:41 <zaqu> macs get viruses too
A2:18:44 <Batosai3591> im not saying its perfect
A2:18:49 <Batosai3591> just dont hate what you use
A2:18:53 <liq3> Oh, the amount windows relies on IE is just sad too.
A2:19:01 <Batosai3591> thats why i dont use IE
A2:19:04 <liq3> A specific program should NEVER be required.
A2:19:10 <zaqu> opera>firefox
A2:19:15 <liq3> Batosai: Unistall IE, MSN and other programs stop working.
A2:19:22 <Batosai3591> ?
A2:19:30 <zaqu> that is true
A2:19:33 <Batosai3591> i already have
A2:19:36 <Batosai3591> i run great, lol
A2:19:43 <liq3> You must not use MSN then. >.>
A2:19:48 <Batosai3591> nope
A2:20:02 <liq3> Still, fact stands. Linux > Windows for office use. :p
A2:20:09 <liq3> And general home use. >.>
A2:20:13 <liq3> Windows for gaming. :/
A2:20:20 <Batosai3591> i think someone is just a fanboy <.<
A2:20:27 <Batosai3591> ah
A2:20:28 <Batosai3591> ok
A2:20:29 <FoxBlitzz> [03:15:53] <liq3> Linux has terrible GUI and is way bloated. <- Depends on the desktop environment you use
A2:20:49 <liq3> FoxBlitzz: What's a non-bloated one?
A2:21:03 <liq3> I like Windows minimal GUI (at least compared to linux).
A2:21:13 <Batosai3591> aero is where its at, lol
A2:21:16 <FoxBlitzz> There's Xfce which is light-weight and light on features, KDE which is looking to be an ambitious next-gen desktop (my personal favorite)
A2:21:18 <liq3> Heh, Mac's GUI would drive me nuts. lulz.
A2:21:40 <FoxBlitzz> And then there's GNOME, which is heavy-weight and low on features at the same time... somehow.
A2:21:48 <liq3> Yeh, I like as much screen space as possible. I want the GUI as small as possible while still being easy to read. >.>
A2:22:01 <liq3> Thus, I use Chrome. XD
A2:22:05 <FoxBlitzz> Or you could go even more lightweight than Xfce, and just have a window manager
A2:22:08 <FoxBlitzz> Like Fluxbox
A2:22:12 <liq3> Interesting.
A2:22:18 <liq3> I might try that next time I hit Linux up. >.>
A2:22:31 <Batosai3591> windows 7 ftw <.<
A2:22:36 <liq3> Pfft.
A2:22:41 <FoxBlitzz> I am getting a new laptop, and this computer here isn't too shabby either
A2:22:43 <liq3> I'm hanging onto XP till I'm forced to move over. :/
A2:23:01 <FoxBlitzz> I have systems that can handle KDE4 fine
A2:23:13 <Batosai3591> liq unless your comp is garb get vista
A2:23:17 <Batosai3591> or wait for 7
A2:23:19 <FoxBlitzz> People criticize KDE4 all the time, but they don't understand that it's still emerging technology and not yet 100% complete
A2:23:43 <Batosai3591> lol im gonna save up and get an sli comp eventually
A2:23:57 <Batosai3591> prob make that one linux <.<
A2:24:15 <Batosai3591> liq3: ever think of virtualizing?
A2:24:27 <FoxBlitzz> Virtualization is a great way to try Linux
A2:24:47 <FoxBlitzz> Go grab VirtualBox. It's free and does most everything you need for a simple desktop solution
A2:24:49 <liq3> Virtualization?
A2:24:58 <FoxBlitzz> Yes, virtualization. All the buzz now.

A2:25:15 <FoxBlitzz> Basically you're running a second computer within your main system
A2:25:23 <liq3> Yeh.
A2:25:30 <FoxBlitzz> It's being run on top of your operating system for the matter
A2:25:38 <FoxBlitzz> But it's faster than emulation by a long shot
A2:25:45 <FoxBlitzz> VirtualBox is actually very easy to use
A2:26:16 <FoxBlitzz> Just create a new VM, assign it a new virtual hard drive image, put an .iso into its "CD drive"
A2:26:27 <FoxBlitzz> And install whatever OS you want

A2:28:39 <FoxBlitzz> KDE is ugly?
A2:28:44 <paul|not> yes
A2:29:04 <paul|not> frosted glass EVERYWHERE
A2:29:05 <Batosai3591> pretty in my opinion
A2:29:06 <FoxBlitzz> http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.2/screenshots/desktop.png
A2:29:08 <FoxBlitzz> KDE is ugly?
A2:29:22 <liq3> Yes, KDE is very ugly.
A2:29:22 <FoxBlitzz> Not to mention that you can change the visual style anyway. :/
A2:29:33 <liq3> Not the style, it's just too big.
A2:29:49 <FoxBlitzz> Skulpture, Bespin are two popular alternate widget themes
A2:29:56 <paul|not> big icons, frosted glass
A2:30:04 <paul|not> generic beige windows
A2:30:07 <FoxBlitzz> Skulpture in particular is a very compact
A2:30:10 <paul|not> most OSes are ugly though
A2:30:11 <FoxBlitzz> paul|not: That's not beige
A2:30:15 <FoxBlitzz> That's silver.
A2:30:22 <paul|not> grey, beige, silver
A2:30:23 <liq3> paul: What ones aren't?
A2:30:31 <paul|not> unless your brightness is 100% you're not gonna notice
A2:30:39 <paul|not> liq3: not many.

A2:31:12 <liq3> Although I hate Vista's style. Oh god that's ugly as hell.
A2:31:30 <FoxBlitzz> Linux isn't Windows or OS X. You actually have freedom over your visual style
A2:31:40 <paul|not> wow foxblittz, looks like windows 98 with bevelled edges

A2:32:49 <FoxBlitzz> I swear, you guys take everything for granted just by looking at a single screenshot
A2:32:49 <Batosai3591> ok ppls, its linux... this means you can do ANYTHING to it basically
A2:32:52 <liq3> I haven't seen it. Just how little I care about it. >.>
A2:33:08 <Batosai3591> sounded like a little bit of a troll here liq...

A2:33:14 <liq3> Batosai: I don't want to do anything to it. I want a mininal GUI out of the box. :p
A2:33:30 <FoxBlitzz> You can also try QtCurve
A2:33:41 <FoxBlitzz> Which can be as pretty or ugly as you want. Very customizable
A2:34:01 <FoxBlitzz> http://kde-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/40492-1.png

A2:34:26 <Batosai3591> for idgets
A2:34:48 <paul|not> that just looks like Gnome blitzz
A2:35:02 <FoxBlitzz> paul|not: There's an important difference
A2:35:20 <FoxBlitzz> The important difference is that you don't have to deal with the horrors of GTK.
A2:35:37 <paul|not> lol
A2:35:50 <FoxBlitzz> Honestly, since you can't seem to be satisfied with anything

A9:11:27 <citricsquid> I suggested that, it'd be awesome :D
A9:11:48 <bokonon> yeah, I really dislike PayPal and avoid using it
A9:12:06 <citricsquid> how come?
A9:13:02 <bokonon> my father used it once to buy some random thing. after almost one year, I suddenly remembered that and, knowing his email's password, I managed to reset the accounts password
A9:13:18 <bokonon> and I saw all of his credit card details was stored
A9:13:28 <bokonon> in a left account. horror.

A9:15:22 <citricsquid> You say it's bad that they stored his credit card details, yes?
A9:15:59 <bokonon> oh no, that was completely an unrelated anecdote, though I dislike the very idea of PayPal. it frightens me
A9:16:04 <citricsquid> oh :P
A9:16:08 <citricsquid> my apologies :D
A9:16:17 <bokonon> no harm done :>
A9:16:35 <Parthon> they should do what most online brokers do and refuse to tell you the CC number
A9:16:57 <Awol10> last time I check it only gave the last 4 digits
A9:17:02 <Parthon> they give you *some* of the numbers, but only 4
A9:17:08 <bokonon> so yeah, I would definitely buy the game, even if at full price if it was released on Steam
A9:17:08 <Parthon> yeah, that's not that bad
A9:17:12 <bokonon> with a client.
A9:17:21 <Parthon> why steam?
A9:17:24 <citricsquid> Paypal is my primary funding source, I only use a bank account to with draw IRL :)
A9:17:27 <bokonon> oh, Steam Achievements would be lovely also but highly unlikely
A9:17:43 <Awol10> well you would pay full price cause I don't think steam will allow uncomplete games

A10:32:54 <iPope> why can we only have 256?
A10:32:57 <citricsquid> Hopefully we can eventually bind stuff, that'd be awesome. 
A10:33:00 <Awol10> yes but only 9 are selectable by the player
A10:33:04 <PuyoDead> 256, only?
A10:33:04 <citricsquid> So we can bind H to our favourite block
A10:33:10 <PuyoDead> sheesh, that's plenty
A10:33:13 <zid> iPope: for now, the protocol would need changing
A10:33:14 <Awol10> 256 is the limit
A10:33:22 <iPope> Oh right
A10:33:22 <zid> as well as the levle file making twice as big
A10:33:55 <iPope> do mobs count in that number

A10:34:20 <PuyoDead> thought so
A10:34:24 <mojomasta> i bought the game and all i get right now is custom skins?
A10:34:32 <iPope> wait young one
A10:34:32 <Zuriki> For now
A10:34:35 <Eagle> You get a lot of stuff later.
A10:34:36 <mojomasta> i just tried to make something in paint and failed horribly :(
A10:34:37 <PuyoDead> for now, yea. and the satisfaction of a good deed
A10:34:39 <Eagle> A /lot of stuff/
A10:35:16 <Zuriki> I can't have a PayPal cause I'm not 18
A10:35:19 <Zuriki> WHICH SUCKS
A10:35:25 <Eagle> Lie?
A10:35:42 <ZomBuster> lie!
A10:35:54 <Zuriki> What would that achieve.
A10:36:02 <ZomBuster> a paypal account
A10:36:04 <Eagle> ... Allowing you to have a paypal?
A10:36:04 <Parthon> where does notch live?
A10:36:06 <PuyoDead> think there would be any demand for a "tutorial" skin? like, "this is the back" "this is the front of the leg" etc.?
A10:36:16 <ZomBuster> look at the basic one
A10:36:20 <Eagle> Oh somebody here made one.
A10:36:23 <PuyoDead> ahh
A10:36:24 <Eagle> I forgot who.
A10:36:33 <iPope> Will people need to pay for the new block types?
A10:36:38 <Zuriki> No
A10:36:44 <PuyoDead> I've made a few myself, but sometimes when starting from the basic one, I forget which side of the leg faces forward
A10:37:00 <Eagle> They will need to pay for the new content when the alpha and beta are finished
A10:37:11 <iPope> I guess that makes sense, or you would have to have servers only for upgraded accounts
A10:37:19 <iPope> so you could use the new blocks
A10:37:35 <LKA> that's a delicious thing to see upon waking up. <3

A10:38:25 <Eagle> Otherwise both my gentleman and pirate won't look as good.
A10:38:30 <ZomBuster> im looking at it
A10:38:38 <Parthon> is stone the darker one, or is it rock?
A10:38:57 <Eagle> I always thought stone was the one you found underground
A10:39:01 <Parthon> me too
A10:39:07 <Parthon> oh wait
A10:39:08 <ZomBuster> uuh
A10:39:14 <Parthon> no .. rock is underground, stone in the one you place
A10:39:16 <ZomBuster> the lighter one
A10:39:23 <ZomBuster> argh
A10:39:31 <Parthon> lol
A10:39:34 <ZomBuster> ok rock is natural

A10:40:53 <PuyoDead> stone, I'd say
A10:40:54 <Awol10> 03 is what I call rock

P1:23:31 <Rroff> I know its gzipped but beyond that haven't worked out any more on the format

P1:38:51 <Quatroking> charnotch.png!
P1:38:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> :D
P1:38:55 <wingboy> should we put our banlists underneath our names in a wiki or all together?
P1:38:56 <citricsquid> al: awesome, I was hoping something like this existed :D
P1:39:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> I grabbed all of the minecraft forums posters' skins and some others
P1:39:17 <citricsquid> I think the best idea would be to have a name then a reason, then at the bottom of the page have a big list for copy + pasting
P1:39:35 <citricsquid> I'm working on minecraftskins.net now, could come in handy ;)
P1:39:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid what can be reasons other than griefing?
P1:39:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol cool citricsquid :D
P1:39:46 <wingboy> i cant remember what i banned most people for
P1:39:51 <wingboy> its mostly griefing :P
P1:39:53 <citricsquid> Spamming? "Hacking"?
P1:40:06 <citricsquid> It's mostly griefers that get banned, but could be other reasons
P1:40:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll go get my banlist
P1:40:12 <citricsquid> only problem is, as it's a wiki anyone can add
P1:40:18 <citricsquid> so we could end up with legit people...

P1:40:45 <Quatroking> I've banned two guys for constantly talking in polish while I asked them to speak english, and they just kept refusing because "english was a gay language"

P1:45:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, you responsible for minecraftforum.net?
P1:45:48 <citricsquid> yeah
P1:45:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just a suggestion... require email verification
P1:46:01 <Quatroking> don't forget captcha
P1:46:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> wouldn't want to open yourself up to bots... It's not fun clearing out 100s of pages of spam
P1:46:42 <citricsquid> Email verification enabled
P1:47:00 <citricsquid> I'll look into captcha if we have spam problems, I'd rather avoid it while possible :)
P1:47:18 <Spazzo> Wow, the forum is really multiplying?
P1:47:22 <Spazzo> *multiplying.
P1:47:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> captcha isn't really necessary... mostly e-mail stops em
P1:47:25 <Deiz> citricsquid: Pre-empt it.
P1:47:33 <Deiz> You will invariably have spam.
P1:47:35 <Spazzo> I last saw it at 20 users yesterday...now it's at 170
P1:47:41 <Spazzo> Who is the admin of the forum? Notch?
P1:47:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> especially once you get hit by google and they have auto-searches for Powered by FluxBB
P1:47:57 <modx> come see my climb map http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=2fa13e420c15f47d1915453f6b32d6d2
P1:48:32 <citricsquid> I've yet to see any bots; captcha irritates a lot of legitimate users so I'd rather ignore it until we have any sort of problems, it's easy to clear out spam from 1 or 2 users, I'd rather wait for that than annoy all potential legitimate users when it's not needed.
P1:48:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> especially the new captchas.. they make me feel like a bot

P2:26:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jessicatz, uninstall it
P2:26:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> install the proprietary jre
P2:27:00 <Jessicatz> did that.
P2:27:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> the Open JRE dies on the switching applet
P2:27:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I assume FireFox?
P2:27:10 <Jessicatz> yes
P2:27:14 <Parthon> zid: worse, the server itself died
P2:27:17 <Jessicatz> do I have to tell firefox which one to use?
P2:27:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> in your plugins, is there an icedtea listing?
P2:27:29 <zid> Parthon: not
P2:27:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> no you have to get on synaptic and install everything with icedtea and openjre in it
P2:27:31 <Jessicatz> yea.

P2:28:49 <Jessicatz> AlLnAtuRalX: ah yea, you're right.
P2:29:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> then reinstall sun-java6-jre, sun-java6-plugin, sun-java6-bin, sun-java6-fonts
P2:29:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> uninstall if they are already and install them again (you could do that for just hte plugin
P2:29:24 <Jessicatz> AlLnAtuRalX: works fine now

P2:58:22 <unknownczar> cause the way water works, you cant have sewers changing elevation
P2:58:22 <liq3> Trouble getting ammo. xD
P2:58:28 <Parthon> true
P2:58:45 <zid> I think water should be finite
P2:58:47 <unknownczar> so build directly below the roads, but always at the same height
P2:58:51 <liq3> zid: It will be.
P2:58:54 <zid> good
P2:59:00 <Deiz> smn: You should consider getting less-paranoid admins, also
P2:59:02 <liq3> Although I think ocean tiles may stay infinite.
P2:59:06 <zid> make me a lava waterfall 
P2:59:24 <Deiz> When I initially joined [to play normally] I was kicked twice for being a supposed griefer
P2:59:24 <liq3> smn: Deiz is a bot user. :/
P2:59:39 <Deiz> Yes, and?
P2:59:40 <liq3> Deiz: What you get for using bots publically.
P2:59:52 <unknownczar> I want the good old days when below us was infinite death and the horizon was empty space
P3:00:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol I IP banned Deiz just for coming in
P3:00:08 <liq3> The only good reason to make bots is to mess around PRIVATELY, and to figure out to make the bots not work.
P3:00:19 <citricsquid> I agree, bots on a pubkic server = bad
P3:00:22 <citricsquid> public*
P3:00:31 <citricsquid> shit storm on one of mine after zid filled half the map in :D
P3:00:31 <liq3> Anything else is pretty much griefing.
P3:00:51 <Deiz> They're psychology experiments
P3:00:55 <Deiz> Three times we filled roofs in
P3:01:00 <Deiz> Three times people became attached to the roof
P3:01:04 <Deiz> And kicked people who defaced it
P3:01:36 <liq3> Go ahead and use them publically, just prepared to get IP banned.
P3:01:44 <Deiz> IP bans mean nothing
P3:01:50 <Deiz> Most people have dynamic IPs
P3:01:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Deiz : that was you and zid this morning?
P3:01:54 <Deiz> Doubtful.
P3:01:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Filling in my fucking map?
P3:02:01 <Deiz> Wasn't me, at least
P3:02:06 <citricsquid> Pissing off the community should be punishment enough, don't you value others enjoyment?
P3:02:09 <citricsquid> It's the same as griefing.
P3:02:09 <liq3> Deiz: Smart people IP ban and nick ban.
P3:02:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> We had to reset because some noob with a bot filled in 1/4 of our map at the highest altitude 5 cubes deep
P3:02:22 <Deiz> liq3: Means little, too
P3:02:26 <Ylle> I hope we can someday change the ocean to a lava ocean
P3:02:26 <citricsquid> Zid filled one of mine with sand :D
P3:02:28 <Syniphas> Nice
P3:02:29 <Deiz> Can create thousands of nicknames per minute
P3:02:31 <Syniphas> checks header now
P3:02:43 <liq3> Deiz: Uhuh. Nick bans will plenty once paid-only servers are out. :p
P3:02:45 <zid> AlLnAtuRalX: Oh yea, that was me
P3:02:50 <Syniphas> So you -can't- load maps which aren't 256x256x64

P3:08:48 <Parthon> just a quick query, what were the main problems with my roads?
P3:08:49 <liq3> Ocean level is Y/2 -2
P3:08:54 <liq3> Y being height.
P3:08:59 <liq3> NOT depth. >.>
P3:09:02 <Syniphas> ok
P3:09:07 <liq3> Damn people are using incorrect notation. >.>
P3:09:08 <Syniphas> Blargh, java!
P3:09:16 <Syniphas> That's even worse than basic!
P3:09:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Syniphas, http://www.writsoft.com/~ninti/rosettas.html
P3:09:20 <liq3> Parthon: they arent smooth?
P3:09:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> those are the 2 I know of
P3:09:30 <liq3> Syniphas: Java isnt worse. Java has uses unlike basic. :p
P3:09:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rosetta's is not released yet :(
P3:09:33 <Parthon> liq3: mainly that?
P3:09:44 <Parthon> flat, or smooth?
P3:09:45 <liq3> And the bug with them being 2 and 3 high.
P3:09:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Java is nice and cross-platform

P3:09:49 <liq3> Smooth.
P3:09:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> and I mean cross-platform
P3:09:53 <liq3> Dont need to be flat.

P3:11:49 <Deiz> liq3: Yeah, I can't duplicate the chat kick
P3:11:55 <Parthon> yeah, I'm thinking of a way
P3:12:03 <Deiz> On my local server, running the latest version, the bot does what it should
P3:12:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Deiz that will be patched soon
P3:12:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> with server-side verification
P3:12:39 <Deiz> That's the point.
P3:12:42 <Parthon> either: segment the road discretely, or find the local highs/lows and segment the road on those
P3:12:46 <Deiz> Notch's original 'fix' wasn't.
P3:12:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, of course it wasn't, but he recognizes that
P3:13:08 <Deiz> He doesn't, I don't think.
P3:13:14 <Deiz> Which is why we're waiting to tell him.
P3:13:21 <liq3> Parthon: what about get 2 values for each road. Average height and bumpiness
P3:13:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Then what would be the use of server-side verification he plans?
P3:13:38 <Parthon> liq3: how do you measure "bumpiness"?
P3:13:42 <Deiz> What he posted on the blog was that he'd 'fixed' it
P3:13:47 <Parthon> programatically speaking
P3:13:48 <liq3> If any part of the road is greater then the bumpiness away from the average, smooth it.
P3:13:51 <Deiz> When he'd just removed the regular client's ability to send illegal character
P3:13:53 <Parthon> that's the trick .. need to think like a computer
P3:13:56 <liq3> bumpiness is like....
P3:13:58 <Deiz> Heh.
P3:14:02 <liq3> how far the start and end are from the average.
P3:14:09 <Deiz> The client actually doesn't crash with normal ASCII

P3:19:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> don't think it takes PNGs though
P3:19:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah
P3:19:47 <citricsquid> So like, skin.png :P
P3:19:57 <citricsquid> because users change their skins and it'd break the site :D
P3:19:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know... Ask Notch to release the code, it's not like it's important to the game itself in too much of a way

P3:21:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Especially on MineCraft
P3:21:25 <Deiz> I wish the clients didn't get skins on their own.
P3:21:32 <Deiz> It'd make it more fun if they had the server do it.
P3:21:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> they get it on their own?  :(
P3:22:09 <Deiz> AFAIK they poll the master server on connect
P3:22:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Custom skins, downloaded dynamically from the server!
P3:22:18 <Deiz> As opposed to the server caching it
P3:22:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> From the Dev Blog.. He didn't specify which server though
P3:22:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> I had the impression the server applet polled the master server and cached it... looking back though, this way makes more sense in terms of how it works with older server versions
P3:23:04 <Deiz> Yeah
P3:23:09 <Deiz> It's probably best in that respect
P3:23:13 <Deiz> As not everyone updates the server
P3:23:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Absolutely... I was amazed that it worked on rollout...
P3:24:04 <citricsquid> notch works amazingly fast
P3:25:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, citric, I meant that I was amazed it worked even without a server update... I thought previously the whole thing was cached server-side once a client connected

P3:28:44 <Deiz> Notch is crazy and says Y should be height.

P3:50:38 <Syniphas> unless you mean the 3 view modes
P3:50:46 <Parthon> yes I do
P3:50:50 <Syniphas> oh ok
P3:50:59 <Syniphas> ok, I think...
P3:51:01 <citricsquid> Parth: I'd love something that you can give parameteres to, like 10% rock, 20% water and it generates a funky map
P3:51:09 <smn> heh :>

P3:51:41 <smn> heightmap + setting sea level

P5:24:26 <citricsquid> I thought it was just animation
P5:24:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I doubt it, since there aren't separate shadow types for other blocks, and lava doesn't get shadow'd.
P5:24:31 <notjotham> or maybe those little height lines, water with a surface is only 90% high or so
P5:24:47 <vdgmprgrmr> And there's no liquid animations...
P5:24:47 <notjotham> if you get me
P5:25:00 <Parthon> nopes, it's not that
P5:25:02 <notjotham> there are two visual states for the liquids, 100% and that 90% or so height

P6:12:23 <paul|not> vdgmprgrmr: I can see both sides
P6:12:29 <paul|not> some generated maps are more fun to create on

P6:12:55 <paul|not> don't ask someone to gen you a castle
P6:13:04 <vdgmprgrmr> My view: Level editors are good for making base levels. Like a canvas.
P6:13:12 <paul|not> exactly
P6:13:13 <citricsquid> vdgm: Exactly my view
P6:13:28 <citricsquid> Structures should be made in game, base levels made with an editor

P6:44:15 <vdgmprgrmr> You should be able to figure out the basic character anatomy from char.png, and you can use that to cleverly place colors. You can use the textures in your screenshots as a pallette.

P6:59:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Much better, Puyo.
P6:59:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Nalok, what things around the skin?
P6:59:17 <Quatroking> minecrap. Coming soon to an itnernets near you.
P6:59:17 <Kaidane> That's a great Joker skin, Puyo.  :D
P6:59:35 <PuyoDead> thanks, vdgmprgrmr helped advise it, heh
P6:59:39 <Nalok> The image I used, the first failed skin..
P6:59:48 <Nalok> and the "final" skin
P6:59:49 <zaqu> so
P6:59:53 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Okay, but what things around it?
P7:00:06 <vdgmprgrmr> You're really not that great at telling us what's going on.
P7:00:07 <Nalok> The things around the final skin
P7:00:08 <EllyIsAsleep> puyo: looks pretty aight. gz.
P7:00:18 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P7:00:23 <Nalok> ...
P7:00:31 <zaqu> damage/health/combat integrated yet?
P7:00:33 <Nalok> It's..in the image..
P7:00:40 <vdgmprgrmr> "The things around the skin" tells me nothing.
P7:00:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Ooooh. You just copied the things directly into it?
P7:01:09 <vdgmprgrmr> That's not what you're supposed to do.
P7:01:16 <Nalok> Ok so, there's the image I used for textures, which the final skin is on, the first failed skin which is on the image..
P7:01:16 <vdgmprgrmr> (Although I guess it would still work.
P7:01:31 <vdgmprgrmr> You don't need to get rid of it.
P7:01:36 <Nalok> wat
P7:01:44 <PuyoDead> ok, ok...
P7:01:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Just save it, upload it, and test it at the place I linked!
P7:01:57 <PuyoDead> this is getting confusing
P7:02:08 <Nalok> The skin is like..on top of the image and I cant get it ouff
P7:02:18 <vdgmprgrmr> What are you talking about!?
P7:02:22 <Nalok> ...
P7:02:32 <PuyoDead> this is my normal skin http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=PuyoDead
P7:02:37 <vdgmprgrmr> What do you mean, it's on top of the image?
P7:02:47 <vdgmprgrmr> There's only one layer to a basic image!
P7:02:50 <Nalok> The final skin is on the image I used for the texture..it's basically in the image now
P7:02:51 <PuyoDead> are you saying the texture part is on top of the char.png stuff?
P7:03:04 <Nalok> no, below
P7:03:20 <PuyoDead> this is paint, right?
P7:03:20 <Nalok> the picture is behind the skin
P7:03:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, Nalok.
P7:03:26 <Nalok> yes it's paint
P7:03:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Please, tell me EVERY SINGLE THING you did, starting at the "saved char.png from the page you linked"
P7:04:13 <Syniphas> http://electrokinesis.drx.pl/
P7:04:14 <vdgmprgrmr> I assume it's something like "opened char.png in paint" ... "opened screenshot in another paint window"
P7:04:18 <Daidoji> nalok might want to read a basic image editing tutorial on layers and selection tools.
P7:04:19 <Syniphas> MineCrap download is there.
P7:04:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Daidoji, it's in paint.
P7:05:02 <vdgmprgrmr> No layers or anything like that to deal with.
P7:05:05 <Daidoji> can you even save a png in paint
P7:05:07 <Nalok> Ok, so, after I saved the char.png, I copied the texture image (TI) onto Paint, then I copied the .png onto paint also, then, I took bits of the image and placed them on the .png, now what
P7:05:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, you can.
P7:05:26 <vdgmprgrmr> That was really, really vague.
P7:05:29 <Daidoji> do yourself a favor and uh
P7:05:46 <Daidoji> hell even the trial version of psp
P7:05:54 <paul|not> what
P7:06:00 <paul|not> >get a more complicated program
P7:06:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Daidoji, paint will work perfectly fine for this.
P7:06:09 <Daidoji> NONSENSE
P7:06:17 <Nalok> I took bits of the part I needed, placed them onto the png...and I don't know what to do next
P7:06:17 <paul|not> made my skin in paint
P7:06:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Nalok, I will give you steps.
P7:06:37 <vdgmprgrmr> 1. Download char.png
P7:06:38 <Quatroking> I MUST INSTALL A 500MB PROGRAM TO MAKE MY SKIN

P7:06:51 <Quatroking> or something
P7:06:51 <vdgmprgrmr> 2. Open char.png in paint
P7:06:52 <Daidoji> excuse me I got a 40mb version of ps :v
P7:06:54 <Nalok> When I save the skin the picture will be there too
P7:06:55 <Quatroking> as long as its big
P7:07:00 <Testvan> i use paint like a boss
P7:07:01 <Daidoji> on a thumbdrive.
P7:07:04 <vdgmprgrmr> 3. Open screenshot in ANOTHER paint window

P7:07:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> so do I Quatroking 
P7:07:20 <vdgmprgrmr> 4. Zoom in as far as you can on both images
P7:07:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Gimp is better for these kinds of things
P7:07:27 <Kaidane> I use GIMP.
P7:07:41 <Quatroking> And I really obtained it legally

P7:07:44 <Quatroking> oh yeah
P7:07:45 <vdgmprgrmr> 5. Go to the window with the screenshot, find a nice, small area.
P7:07:46 <Quatroking> sure did
P7:07:54 <Kaidane> Which I refuse to believe

P7:08:09 <Daidoji> then you can just paint the thing and rotate it without worrying about the overlap!
P7:08:09 <citricsquid> Someone built a sphere :O
P7:08:09 <vdgmprgrmr> (an area the same size as the area of the skin you're wanting to edit)
P7:08:30 <Quatroking> I'll go even further and write a script that'll draw it for me
P7:08:31 <vdgmprgrmr> 6. Copy-paste that area only, onto the area of the skin you are editing.

P7:10:21 <vdgmprgrmr> If you want it to look better, instead of just copy-pasting, use the color-picker on the screenshot, and use the same colors to make a pattern on your skin that looks like the texture.
P7:10:21 <Quatroking> you have to be verified to get the money in hands, yes
P7:10:28 <Syniphas> It won't let me register without a credit card number

P7:16:17 <Syniphas> but the binary file is still there
P7:16:19 <PuyoDead> also, since MC models have cubes for heads
P7:16:22 <Syniphas> then you can compress it yourself
P7:17:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, so if I try to load my uncompressed level file, even though it says I can't, I'll still be able to?
P7:17:47 <Syniphas> Yes, if it has no extension.
P7:18:00 <Syniphas> And is uncompressed.

P7:27:58 <Kaidane> Which I have no problem with, of course.
P7:28:06 <Rroff> someones made a complete chess set on my server lol
P7:28:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Nalok, it's really not that hard.
P7:28:28 <vdgmprgrmr> The ENTIRE PROCESS consists of editing a very small image, and uploading it to the skins page.

P7:28:46 <Kaidane> Syniphas, is that the DOS version of gzip?

P7:33:30 <Rroff> the gzip dll is the best way to do it imo
P7:34:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Best way to do what?
P7:34:29 <Rroff> compress/uncompress the file
P7:34:30 <Syniphas> Kaidane
P7:34:35 <Syniphas> it's the commandline one

P7:41:53 <Rroff> uh
P7:41:56 <vdgmprgrmr>  What did you get?
P7:42:02 <vdgmprgrmr> That has the wrong dimensions?
P7:42:09 <Nalok> I finished it, tried it, and it says I have the wrong dimensions
P7:42:13 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P7:42:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Tell me EXACTLY what you did...
P7:42:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually, no, I give up.
P7:42:44 <PuyoDead> what's the resolution of textures, 16x16?
P7:42:56 <Nalok> One sec, uploading a pic to tinypic
P7:42:59 <PuyoDead> well, of blocks, I guess
P7:43:08 <zid> Not sure, but the blocks are 32 coordinates across
P7:43:11 <Quatroking> Syniphas
P7:43:18 <Syniphas> yes?
P7:43:19 <PuyoDead> hmm, 16 would make sense, then
P7:43:19 <zid> whether the texture is mapped 1x1 i'm not sure
P7:43:25 <Quatroking> How do I control minecraft ???
P7:43:28 <zid> 16x16 sounds sensible
P7:43:39 <Kaidane> MineCrap you mean?
P7:43:39 <Syniphas> Right, I didn't put a readme in it...

P7:45:42 <vdgmprgrmr> The process is so stupidly simple!
P7:45:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Then why is the image so big?

P7:47:53 <PuyoDead> that m = ,

P8:06:08 <Syndlig> Syniphas, no, probably not.
P8:06:29 <Syniphas> hm.
P8:06:44 <Syndlig> If you charged for a program that lets you view maps for a game that's going to have a map editor built in I'd just use the game's map editor or one of the other half-dozen editors being created.
P8:06:57 <Kaidane> Yeah, that's pretty much the strongest argument
P8:07:04 <Kaidane> Other people will probably be creating map editors
P8:07:21 <Syniphas> Well, okay
P8:07:34 <Syniphas> I'll still be asking for donations, though :P
P8:07:36 <Nalok> So Puyo, how's it comin?
P8:07:37 <Syndlig> There's at least one other confirmed one (with a thread), I'm pretty sure a goon's making one...
P8:07:44 <Syniphas> I mean, it's just so I can buy Minecraft as well
P8:07:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Selling MineCrap would be stupid and mean. Asking for donations is pretty okay.
P8:07:47 <Kaidane> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=80
P8:07:56 <Meizlizard> I think map editors will sort of ruin the fun.
P8:08:02 <PuyoDead> I was asking if you really want leaf arms?
P8:08:05 <kingnerd> I am of the same opiniojn
P8:08:08 <kingnerd> opinion*
P8:08:08 <Maulrus> boop
P8:08:09 <PuyoDead> looks better as just wood
P8:08:18 <Jesse> How do I open levels up to edit them?
P8:08:25 <Meizlizard> Huge structures won't be so amazing when people will be able to create them on their own easily.
P8:08:42 <Syndlig> Doesn't make them any less amazing.
P8:08:49 <Meizlizard> It's more fun if it's a big process lots of people work together on.
P8:08:50 <Syndlig> Maps being loaded complete with superstructures is boring.
P8:08:52 <Jesse> stuff like hollow maps are possible with them though.
P8:08:57 <Nalok> Keep going, I want to see how wood and foliage are..make a wood one just un case

P8:09:13 <Jesse> And if you find it fun not to use them then simply don't use them.
P8:09:13 <Syndlig> Watching people work together for 8 hours to make a massive ancient city or something?
P8:09:27 <Syndlig> That's something to behold.
P8:09:42 <vdgmprgrmr> MeizLizard, the amount of time someone spends on something doesn't necessarily make it better.
P8:09:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Nor does the amount of work.
P8:09:57 <Syndlig> http://www.wayfaring.info/images/ziggurat_ur_recona.jpg  I plan on constructing this eventually.
P8:10:01 <vdgmprgrmr> In a sense.
P8:10:14 <Syniphas> Yeah, really.
P8:10:15 <Syndlig> Just trying to figure out the dimensions so it can fit in a 32-tall area.
P8:10:18 <Syniphas> I mean, look at MineCrap
P8:10:31 <Syniphas> 3 days, all the effort I could put on it :P
P8:10:32 <Meizlizard> I just like the feeling of thinking "Whoa, how did they build that?"
P8:10:43 <Nalok> I made a giant tree castle, but then it got griefed, but then I made a second one near it, and it hasnt been griefed yet :D
P8:10:49 <Syndlig> Meiz, it's usually pretty easy to answer that:
P8:10:58 <Syndlig> "by pressing LMB 5 billion times"
P8:10:59 <vdgmprgrmr> If someone spent ten years pouring their heart and soul into a game, working day and night, and it sucked, it still sucks, no matter how hard they worked or for how long.
P8:11:01 <Nalok> They each took about...5-10 minutes
P8:11:05 <PuyoDead> wood arms: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=PuyoDead
P8:11:13 <Jesse> I can't figure out how to open up the levels for editing...

P8:11:36 <Syniphas> Jay_, sorry, wrong highlight
P8:11:38 <Nalok> can you make the arms leaves?
P8:11:40 <Jay_> lol
P8:11:42 <PuyoDead> I am now
P8:11:42 <Syniphas> Jesse, click load

P8:11:55 <Syniphas> Type the filename (must be in the same folder)
P8:11:58 <Syniphas> Press enter
P8:12:00 <Syniphas> That's all
P8:12:13 <Syndlig> I'd make my guy look like dirt but mezo took that already :(
P8:12:16 <Nalok> Just change the arms to leaves and I'll be happy
P8:12:41 <Nalok> The second tree castle is more..a city
P8:12:43 <Syniphas> I kinda have some good ideas for skins..

P8:26:54 <PuyoDead> I thought I could make the underside of the arms darker, but just like the legs, they're not mirrored

P9:43:22 <PuyoDead> so, no word on the sponge coming out tonight?
P9:43:37 <Syndlig> I doubt Notch worked on the game much today.
P9:43:46 <Syndlig> It's the middle of the workweek
P9:43:57 <Nalok> I hope glass and sponge release tomorrow
P9:46:30 <vdgmprgrmr> Some time this weekend is popular word, I here.
P9:46:50 <vdgmprgrmr> But I still don't have any idea what the use of the sponge would be...
P9:47:07 <Syndlig> None, really.
P9:47:10 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P9:47:12 <Syndlig> I mean, you could make some cool things.
10P9:47:12 * Kaidane (chatzilla@adsl-065-005-218-152.sip.cae.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
P9:47:16 <Syndlig> Like...
P9:47:23 <Syndlig> Space sponges 3 blocks apart from one another.
P9:47:32 <Syndlig> Make a 2 block tall path through water.
P9:47:42 <Syndlig> So it's Sponge - Water - Water - Sponge
P9:47:42 <Syndlig> x2
P9:47:56 <Syndlig> The sponges soak up the water so you have an air path through the water :D
P9:48:06 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P9:48:08 <Syndlig> I just hope he makes glass blocks that aren't ugly :(
P9:48:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Are sponges going to suck up water?
P9:48:28 <Syndlig> Yes
P9:48:31 <vdgmprgrmr> If so, that would not be very useful with infinite water like we have.
P9:48:34 <Syndlig> Sponges soak up any liquid adjacent to it
P9:48:38 <Syndlig> Right
P9:48:43 <Syndlig> It'd be useful for finite water
P9:48:59 <Syndlig> And be terrible in survival mode 'cause you sponge up all the water and oh no we're dehydrating D:
P9:49:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Hm...
P9:49:20 <Syndlig> Looks less like sponge and more like cheese
P9:49:21 <PuyoDead> they'll mainly be for clearing out flooded areas
P9:49:25 <Syndlig> Or coral
P9:49:35 <Syndlig> Pyuo:  Won't really work though.
P9:49:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe for infinite water, it would just shave the top level off the current body of water in it every few seconds.
P9:49:42 <Syndlig> Puyo*
P9:49:49 <vdgmprgrmr> That way it actually works.
P9:49:59 <vdgmprgrmr> And is compatible with infinite water.
P9:50:06 <PuyoDead> why wouldn't it work?
P9:50:06 <Maulrus> yay 100 dorfs!
P9:50:12 <Maulrus> HOLY SHIT 21 FARMERS
P9:50:16 <Syndlig> Because water infinitely floods
P9:50:22 <PuyoDead> I mean... plug up the leak, soak up water
P9:50:23 <Syndlig> You'd still need to fill the entire area up with sponge blocks.
P9:50:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Because we have infite water, it won't work if it just gets rid of adjacent water.
12P9:50:26 * dropshock (squirrelbo@c-67-160-180-88.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P9:50:35 <Syndlig> Though
P9:50:36 <PuyoDead> well, you'd be a damn fool to try to clear out water without blocking it first
P9:50:39 <Syndlig> It could PREVENT floods.
P9:50:54 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Not really...
P9:50:55 <Syndlig> Put sponge blocks in your tunnels
P9:51:00 <PuyoDead> go to a flooded room, block the water leak, soak up remaining water
P9:51:02 <Syndlig> The water would never get past the sponge.
P9:51:23 <PuyoDead> did nobody else think of this?
P9:51:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Puyo, none of those ideas will work because the water doesn't move, it just regenerates.
P9:51:32 <Syndlig> It's not finite.
P9:51:37 <VitaEdo> you have to fight the Water Elemental at the center of water
P9:51:38 <Syndlig> One block of water will fill the entire world if you let it.
P9:51:56 <PuyoDead> *facepalm*
P9:52:00 <Syndlig> I think alot of the problems will be solved if the water behavior is changed.
P9:52:00 <PuyoDead> I give up
P9:52:21 <Syndlig> It shouldn't just instantly expand sideways to fill the entire area.
P9:52:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, yeah, but as it is, soaking up water in any kind of simple way is just impossible.

P9:52:57 <PuyoDead> either I'm not understanding how it will function... or you guys are overthinking this
P9:53:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Puyo, how do you think it will function?
P9:53:09 <Syndlig> Sponge soaks up water that is adjacent to it.
P9:53:13 <Syndlig> Water infinitely respawns.
P9:53:24 <Syndlig> The sponge can't get rid of the water so long as ANY water tiles exist.
P9:53:26 <PuyoDead> let's say you have a box. it is flooded from the outside
P9:53:32 <Syndlig> Hence, the sponge needs to fill the entire area to remove the water.
P9:53:50 <Syndlig> Even if it's closed off from the outside, if even a SINGLE water tile exists it will flood the entire room again.
P9:54:01 <PuyoDead> sorry, but... no shit
P9:54:15 <PuyoDead> so the sponge will expand where water is present
P9:54:19 <PuyoDead> is this how it will work?
P9:54:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Why would it do that?
P9:54:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Sponges don't do that?
P9:54:33 <Syndlig> No, it jut sits there.
P9:54:37 <Syndlig> And soaks up adjacent water.
P9:54:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Er, that second question mark should be a period.
P9:54:45 <PuyoDead> only in the adjacent blocks?
P9:54:48 <downer> no, 1 sponge block will just will clear a 3x3 area of water (from my understanding
P9:54:49 <Syndlig> Yeah.
P9:54:58 <vdgmprgrmr> What downer said.
P9:55:01 <PuyoDead> so, it only soaks up the directly adjacent blocks
P9:55:02 <Syndlig> Sponge blocks just clear a 3x3x3 area
P9:55:05 <Syndlig> Exactly.
P9:55:06 <Syndlig> What I said.
P9:55:08 <PuyoDead> ok, see, I didn't know that
P9:55:15 <Syndlig> I said it like 4 times.
P9:55:21 <PuyoDead> you most certainly did not
P9:55:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, Notch hasn't said anything about what exaclt it would do...
P9:55:45 <vdgmprgrmr> But I don't comprehend how you'd come to the conclusion you came to there...
P9:56:19 <downer> if sponge expanded to every adjacent water tile, it would be just as bad as water
P9:56:22 <m0bus> sup vdg
P9:56:24 <PuyoDead> I was under the impression that it would change the surrounding water to be finite
P9:56:30 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Um, sup m0bus.
P9:56:39 <Syndlig> I did, in fact, say it 4 times.
P9:56:40 <Syndlig> thank you.
P9:56:41 <vdgmprgrmr> How would it do that, Puyo?
P9:56:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Water is infinite intentionally...
P9:56:59 <Syndlig> Notch needs to change two things.
P9:57:00 <PuyoDead> as in, clear more than 3x3x3
P9:57:09 <vdgmprgrmr> How?
P9:57:11 <PuyoDead> I was unclear of the range
P9:57:18 <PuyoDead> how? how the hell would I know?
P9:57:30 <Syndlig> 1)  Water should not be infinite.  All water should be finite.  The out-of-the-map water tiles should produce water.
P9:57:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, you're the one saying it, and no one else is...
P9:57:38 <Syndlig> 2)  Water should flow downwards before it flows outwards.
P9:57:47 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree with Syndlig.
P9:58:01 <Syndlig> So the ocean will always be full of water, yes.
P9:58:10 <PuyoDead> because, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. that was my ignorant understanding. that's why I was discussing it, to find out more
P9:58:13 <Syndlig> Because water tiles are being created by the areas outside the map.
P9:58:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, did anyone read the thread on the forums about sand behavior?
P9:58:25 <Syndlig> But if you shut an area off from the water that section of water shouldn't spread.
P9:58:29 <Syndlig> It should keep the same volume.
P9:58:38 <Syndlig> vdg:  I think I like the sand the way it is personally :x
P9:58:51 <Syndlig> I can't make awesome sand spires if the sand just falls into a pyramid pile.

P10:23:49 <Eagle> I'll test it out.
P10:24:10 <Syniphas> vdgmprgrmr, just gzip or minecrap itself?
P10:24:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Gzip.

P10:27:39 <vdgmprgrmr> "GZIP.EXE cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of Windows. Contact your vendor blah blah blah."

P10:34:08 <Jay_> umm
P10:34:14 <Syniphas> vdgmprgrmr has the same problem, he is trying a quick fix
P10:34:16 <Jay_> the problem is your coding
P10:34:20 <Syniphas> Uh, no
P10:34:22 <Syniphas> it's gzip
P10:34:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, Win32 version didn't work.
P10:34:29 <Jay_> well gzip's coding then
P10:34:30 <Kaidane> Damn.
P10:34:37 <Kaidane> It's not gzip's coding either
P10:34:46 <Jay_> gzip just doesn't run on vista?
P10:34:47 <Syniphas> It's the version I've been sent
P10:35:07 <Syniphas> I'll whip up a quick fix
P10:35:12 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm not using Vista, so it's not quite the same problem...

P10:39:24 <Syniphas> you'll need the headers.dat from the original zip, though (this is just the main EXE)

P10:48:08 <Syndlig> Oh :(
P10:48:14 <Syniphas> I -could-
P10:48:19 <Syniphas> it isn't programmed to
P10:48:26 <Syniphas> I'll add that in the next version
P10:48:52 <Syndlig> I'm trying to get a Huge map that looks good (like the game itself can generate) to play in multiplayer with a couple friends.
P10:49:02 <Jay_> well, other than being terribly difficult to use, the editor works decently
P10:49:11 <Kaidane> Lol
P10:49:14 <Syndlig> I think any survival game that isn't done on a Huge map is missing out on the most fun part.
P10:49:19 <Jay_> I wouldn't pay money for it unless it had a nice GUI
P10:49:22 <Syndlig> Which is that 95% of the map will be hostile territory :D
P10:49:22 <Kaidane> It's a POC editor, guys.  Be patient.
P10:49:37 <Syndlig> VS the standard map which can be taken up by a decent sized town in about half an hour.
P10:49:59 <Syniphas> Ok, fuck
P10:50:07 <Syniphas> Header checking is STILL a problem
P10:50:12 <Syniphas> I've disabled it for now
P10:50:21 <Syndlig> I spend half an hour building random average-sized houses on a Huge map, wandered around until I got lost and couldn't find them again D:
P10:50:23 <Syniphas> just DON'T load anything other than uncompressed maps
P10:50:34 <Syniphas> I do now know what that could result on
P10:50:40 <Jay_> it'll either crash or look hilarious
P10:50:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Syndlig, I think most people who play on huge maps will be missing the main key to being able to experience the fun parts; acceptable framerate.

P11:06:00 <vdgmprgrmr> This is just unacceptable.
P11:06:15 <Kaidane> Try DOSbox I guess
P11:06:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I may have to...
P11:06:35 <vdgmprgrmr> *sigh*
P11:06:39 <Kaidane> What game is it?
P11:06:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Duke3d
P11:06:47 <Kaidane> OHHH
P11:06:51 <Kaidane> use eduke then

P11:07:04 <Kaidane> eduke32

P11:07:16 <PuyoDead> ever played Painkiller?
P11:07:34 <Kaidane> The source code for Duke3D was released years ago...a few ports have popped up.
P11:07:37 <Kaidane> I have.
P11:08:04 <PuyoDead> fun stuff

P11:10:22 <Cameron_Pease> derp
P11:10:25 <zid> 1992, damn, it's slightly younger than me
P11:10:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Have to have some sort of Duke Nukem files for it work.
P11:10:34 <Kaidane> Nab DUKE3D.GRP
P11:10:43 <Kaidane> and shove it in there with the eduke32 binary

P11:19:50 <zid> or if on a unix like operating system, man gzip
P11:20:42 <Cameron_Pease> 1) I don't know where to enter that. 2) I've already read it on the website, made no sense.
P11:20:54 <zid> lol
P11:21:05 <zid> I'm not going to teach you basic computing 101, sorry
P11:21:30 <Cameron_Pease> Nevermind.
P11:21:44 <Cameron_Pease> You could have just said 'drag the file onto gzip.exe'
P11:21:49 <Cameron_Pease> Which would have made alot more sense.
P11:22:53 <zid> That will execute the program and pass it as its first argument the filename of the file you dragged onto it
P11:22:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Arg stupid fucking XP 64 doesn't play fucking DOS games grumble grumble
P11:23:16 <zid> vdgmprgrmr: duh?
P11:23:22 <zid> amd64 mode doesn't *have* real mode
P11:23:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Duh? Normal XP did!
P11:23:36 <zid> you physically cannot execute 16bit instructions in 64bit mode
P11:23:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I hate it!
P11:23:58 <zid> try dosbox
P11:24:05 <zid> it's better than NTVDM anyway
P11:24:14 <zid> plus, my friend wrote it
P11:24:16 <vdgmprgrmr> But DOSbox says Win32, will it still work?
P11:24:27 <zid> yes, you can run 32bit apps in 64 bit mode
P11:24:37 <zid> they show up wth a * in taskmgr I think
P11:24:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Why can't you do 16-bit operations in 64-bit?
P11:24:54 <zid> the cpu can't
P11:25:04 <zid> it provides 32bit mode as legacy
P11:25:09 <zid> just as 32bit mode provided 16 as legacy
P11:25:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I would still expect it to be able to do 16-bit, even if it's doing 64-bit.
P11:25:24 <zid> it'd be a nightmare to try and support all three instruction encodings at once
P11:25:40 <zid> and probably make the amd64 instruction set massively more complicated and a lot slower
P11:25:53 <zid> people in the real world don't run 16bit apps, sorry
