A12:00:06 <PuyoDead> You can also try /solid
A12:00:11 <vurtual> or /op NAME in the console.
A12:00:19 <PuyoDead> Either way, those should all work.
A12:00:19 <AndrewPH> there's no / in console
A12:00:24 <vurtual> then "op NAME"
A12:00:39 <its_rena_tastic> okay, that did it! :D
A12:00:43 <vurtual> But the / won't kill you. Minecraft's rendering isn't a shield that stops the / from becoming a sword strike.
A12:00:45 <its_rena_tastic> thanks guys. ^-^
A12:00:52 <PuyoDead> No problem.
A12:01:19 <its_rena_tastic> but another thing..how do i make it one large landscape, a flat area? D:
A12:01:48 <PuyoDead> Short answer: Download a flatgrass map. Long answer: Make one in Omen.
A12:02:33 <AndrewPH> The long answer lets you change the dimensions of it, though, so it's generally the better choice
A12:02:53 <its_rena_tastic> okay, and just worldofwarcraft.net or whatever for Omen?
A12:03:08 <AndrewPH> http://minecraftforum.net/
A12:03:10 <PuyoDead> Err, no.
A12:03:12 <AndrewPH> Should be in the mapping section
A12:03:21 <its_rena_tastic> ah.
A12:03:31 <PuyoDead> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=80
A12:03:57 <its_rena_tastic> thanks. ^-^

A12:05:33 <Animator> Hey Puyo.
A12:05:33 <its_rena_tastic> no, im its_rena_tastic on Minecraft, im not a member of the minecraft forums though. D:
A12:05:35 <its_rena_tastic> why?
A12:05:45 <Animator> Didn't you give your gift to Duke 2.0?
A12:05:45 <AndrewPH> Ah
A12:05:52 <AndrewPH> Because Greyscar is a friend of mine
A12:05:54 <PuyoDead> He never responded.
A12:06:00 <AndrewPH> and he acts really similarly to you
A12:06:01 <Animator> Send it to him.
A12:06:03 <PuyoDead> Ended up giving it to Siiseli.

A12:08:26 <AndrewPH> Should be
A12:09:06 <its_rena_tastic> k.
A12:10:37 <its_rena_tastic> what are the most preferred dimensions?
A12:10:44 <Animator> 56th.
A12:10:49 <AndrewPH> powers of 2
A12:10:53 <Animator> It's my favorite dimension. :D
A12:10:58 <its_rena_tastic> .-.
A12:11:00 <AndrewPH> y is the height
A12:11:10 <AndrewPH> z and x are the width and length
A12:11:31 <its_rena_tastic> i'll just go with the default for now...lol.
A12:11:33 <AndrewPH> 256x128x256 is a pretty good size for a flatgrass
A12:11:35 <Archanos> lol nerds
A12:11:37 <AndrewPH> or that works
A12:11:43 <AndrewPH> Archanos, lol nerde
A12:11:53 <Archanos> >nerde
A12:11:59 <Archanos> what
A12:12:04 <its_rena_tastic> clicked okay, now what? :/
A12:12:08 <AndrewPH> Now you wait
A12:12:13 <its_rena_tastic> for?
A12:12:14 <AndrewPH> It's making a blank map
A12:12:18 <AndrewPH> It sometimes takes a while
A12:12:24 <Archanos> 256 is the best
A12:12:28 <vurtual> pff
A12:12:31 <vurtual> 8x8x8 forever
A12:12:34 <its_rena_tastic> oh..i did a flat map. :/
A12:12:38 <AndrewPH> vurtual, 4x4x4
A12:12:39 <Archanos> too bad my 256 had 64 instead of 128
A12:12:43 <Archanos> ;-;
A12:12:46 <AndrewPH> 4x4x4 is the best
A12:13:16 <its_rena_tastic> restart server maybe? it said it created the map... :/
A12:13:30 <vurtual> Actually 32x32x32 is cool, along with 64x32x64.
A12:13:51 <vurtual> I'm gonna see what playing on a 32x16x32 is like.
A12:14:04 <Aeomin> i'm making 32 32 16 =p
A12:14:35 <AndrewPH> Yeah restart the server
A12:14:43 <AndrewPH> otherwise it will save over the map
A12:14:45 <AndrewPH> Oh
A12:14:47 <AndrewPH> save the map
A12:14:47 <AndrewPH> derp

A12:16:17 <Alexander> weird
A12:16:41 <vurtual> Map is so tiny, it's hillarious.
A12:16:52 <its_rena_tastic> lol.
A12:16:59 <Alexander> why is it that in the indev version
A12:17:07 <Alexander> if you make a torch, put a tnt on top
A12:17:15 <Alexander> delete the torch, wait a few seconds, and delete the tnt
A12:17:20 <Alexander> a layer of wood covers the map
A12:17:22 <vurtual> Alexander, put a TNT in the air, delete it.
A12:17:25 <vurtual> Blow your mind.
A12:17:31 <vurtual> TNT floodfills the layer below.
A12:17:35 <vurtual> You don't need a torch.
A12:17:49 <Alexander> Oh ;3
A12:17:54 <its_rena_tastic> ...the map didnt load. ;-;
A12:17:56 <Alexander> Why, though?
A12:18:02 <vurtual> Because Notch is testing it.
A12:18:28 <vurtual> Is there a mapgen that can make a map that say, has mountains leading into wherever at one side, or have a coast, or something?
A12:19:35 <AndrewPH> what
A12:19:35 <Archanos> man its impossible to play servers with those illegal text spammers
A12:19:58 <its_rena_tastic> D:
A12:19:59 <PuyoDead> "indev". There ya go.
A12:20:06 <its_rena_tastic> you could always play my map.. X3
A12:20:12 <its_rena_tastic> but the blank one didn't load... :/
A12:20:26 <AndrewPH> Archanos, I could always add you to the allowed list of my private server and you could play there
A12:20:56 <Animator> Link me to your server.
A12:20:57 <vurtual> I want to take a tiny map, and make multiple maps that look stitched together blocks of the tiny one, and maybe use a custom software to link them like a world map.
A12:21:00 <Animator> I want to be amused.
A12:21:02 <Archanos> oh that could work
A12:21:12 <Archanos> im just trying to play theone's server now and hnngh
A12:21:20 <Archanos> every second every gets booted
A12:21:47 <AndrewPH> Your ign is Archanos right?
A12:22:21 <Archanos> yes
A12:22:25 <vurtual> Wait, we get our own personal IGN site now? I can have guides and reviews WHENEVER I WANT!?
A12:22:34 <Archanos> lol ign suck
A12:23:26 <Aeomin> it sucks when have the idea but can't make it right in game
A12:25:42 <Archanos> i dont really get that too often
A12:26:17 <Aeomin> 90% here
A12:26:59 <its_rena_tastic> how would i load the blank map? ;-;

A12:53:53 <TestDummy> As opposed to keystrokes that aren't artificial?
A12:54:15 <Skillkills> Im talking about things like macros
A12:54:43 <Skillkills> You make a macro to move your character and it either works or doesnt
A12:55:21 <Skillkills> depending on if the game takes the keys that the macro supplies

A2:07:32 <Lugnut1206> It only works once in, approximately, 20 times.
A2:07:43 <AndrewPH> Lugnut1206,  power game doesn't need as many resources
A2:08:00 <AndrewPH> Find your computer's specs and we can tell you why it doesn't work
A2:08:05 <Lugnut1206> Oh durr. For soem reason I didn't think of that.
A2:08:15 <Lugnut1206> It's a windows XP, where could I find those?
A2:09:33 <Lugnut1206> I WnidowsKey + R and put in winver, and it says "Physical memory available to windows : 1,030,578 KB"

A3:05:28 <Skillkills> I just talked to one of ... THE BEST griefers ever
A3:05:49 <ez> good morning
A3:05:58 <Skillkills> He told me problems of a server(griefing) and how to fix
A3:06:11 <AndrewPH> really now?
A3:06:17 <AndrewPH> What was his nme
A3:06:30 <Skillkills> You know that guy on the forums... Jerraud?
A3:06:36 <AndrewPH> No I don't
A3:06:37 <Skillkills> And remember Herrode?
A3:06:41 <AndrewPH> Nope
A3:06:41 <Skillkills> No?
A3:06:44 <Skillkills> Hmm
A3:06:49 <Skillkills> Get caught up
A3:06:49 <Skillkills> xD
A3:07:05 <ez> Siiseli here?
A3:07:06 <Skillkills> Herrode is the reason for the warning on verify-names=false
A3:07:30 <AndrewPH> I c
A3:07:40 <AndrewPH> Griefing isn't a server problem
A3:07:42 <AndrewPH> It's a user problem
A3:07:51 <AndrewPH> The problem is griefers are retarded 10 year olds
A3:08:19 <Skillkills> Jerraud = Herrode = Aderus = Valeik = LGSteve = andrewx1 = zach1188
A3:08:31 <Skillkills> He says he makes a new account about every day
A3:08:41 <AndrewPH> Now we can add features to servers to stop the general public from building/deleting and that would stop most griefing

A3:25:35 <Zekarus> by chat, of course, the automated timed message >_>
A3:25:58 <Adura> Did you get the cpan modules.
A3:26:04 <Zekarus> Yup, yup
A3:26:15 <Zekarus> It doesn't seem to tell me anything about missing things, at least
A3:26:50 <Zekarus> Off memory, POE, JSON::XS, JSON::PP, POE::IRC, and other things found in the .pl script

A3:30:25 <Zekarus> I _believe_ so
A3:30:37 <vurtual> Guys, if the world blows up, there will be no more corn. We will have to haphazardly restart the corn process, making new corn from the basic plants. It'd take centuries and we may not ever eat corn again.

A3:35:19 <vurtual> You know what though?
A3:35:20 <Zekarus> <- scientist
A3:35:21 <Zekarus> brb science
A3:35:49 <vurtual> Mammoths could be sentient beings of extreme intelligence, who value their ability to stand around without action.
A3:36:13 <vurtual> They just idly act like animals, knowing what is happening, capible of talking, but they just keep going on due to some philosiphy.
A3:36:37 <Zekarus> Sounds awfully retarded philosophy
A3:36:44 <vurtual> They're elephants.
A3:36:51 <Zekarus> Vurtual, would you know if Notch has archives of older minecraft.jar perchance?
A3:36:59 <vurtual> no I don't know
A3:37:01 <Zekarus> I want to see if Adura's script works with older files
A3:37:05 <Zekarus> WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR?
A3:37:09 <Zekarus> BOW YOUR HEAD IN SHAME
A3:37:27 <vurtual> Then someone spills some chemical X into the cloning tanks and THE POWERPUFF MAMMOTHS zoom around like beams of light.
A3:37:32 <AndrewPH> It should work
A3:37:32 <vurtual> That's what I'm good for.
A3:37:53 <AndrewPH> the powdar paff
A3:38:09 <vurtual> They value the ability to ZOOM AROUND AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS FOR DECADES AND SHOOT LIGHTNING
A3:39:00 <vurtual> Then someone's having difficulty opening a jar infront of some walk-up-to fast food place, and they zoom in, hover, and sternly open it with LASER EYES, before warping off instantaneously.

A3:41:42 <Zekarus> Now THAT is depressing
A3:42:41 <gordenfreechmen> i just noticed the spiderweb in the terrain.png
A3:43:01 <vurtual> Welcome to ages ago.
A3:43:06 <vurtual> Spiderblocks look silly anyways.
A3:43:29 <vurtual> But if they're added, I'm using them to climb buildings, instead of logs maybe.
A3:44:03 <gordenfreechmen> notch said he didnt want to add ladders
A3:44:13 <gordenfreechmen> which i would like to say for this game thats a pretty dick move
A3:44:22 <byte[]> well, maybe you will be stuck in there (movement slow, like in water)
A3:44:49 <gordenfreechmen> isnt notch adding spiderblocks for the spiders
A3:44:53 <AndrewPH> yes
A3:44:57 <AndrewPH> spiders will 'shot web'
A3:45:00 <AndrewPH> ignore the meme
A3:45:09 <AndrewPH> because I meant shoot
A3:45:17 <AndrewPH> when they die they will shoot web out of their carcass.
A3:46:12 <vurtual> Here's an idea.
A3:46:27 <gordenfreechmen> i was thinking you could craft the blocks into a trap
A3:46:28 <gordenfreechmen> :/
A3:47:33 <vurtual> They shoot web beams that slow time near them, but move at arrow speed. Then this makes a web coating, but can become a block if fired repeatedly, or charged up over time. This block is like non-flooding, extra-thick magma, and decays like sponge.
A3:47:54 <vurtual> It'd be like a roguelike!
A3:48:14 <vurtual> Later game spiders can fire a larger blast that coats walls, like the ice spreader in metroid prime. That'd be awesome.
A3:49:13 <vede> So I keep having this weird urge to make a science fiction themed Spelunky ripoff.
A3:49:24 <AndrewPH> use cave story sprites
A3:49:34 <AndrewPH> :D
A3:49:42 <Siiseli> :D
A3:49:52 <Siiseli> so vede make it
A3:49:55 <Siiseli> what's stopping you
A3:50:01 <vede> Well, nothing at all, really.
A3:50:05 <Siiseli> (nothing, nothing I tell you!)
A3:50:08 <vede> I have the time, I have the ability.
A3:50:32 <vurtual> Actually, a mutated spider-man(like an antman or other human-nothuman hybrid) would make an awesome boss enemy.
A3:50:35 <vede> But every time I get my text editor up and prepare to write some code, I just... feel disinterested.
A3:50:57 <vurtual> Made out of mobs, and it can only be killed by arrowing it constantly in the creeper sections.
A3:51:10 <vurtual> It'd bleed zombies.
A3:51:18 <vede> Hm.
A3:51:26 <vede> An ooze monster would be a good enemy in Minecraft.
A3:51:43 <vede> If any two oozes collided, they would just form one bigger ooze.
A3:52:00 <vurtual> No, megabeasts are the way to go.
A3:52:11 <Zekarus> DORF FORT?
A3:52:13 <vurtual> Randomly generated ones with simulation of flesh layers!
A3:52:13 <vede> Such that if you just oozes hang around each other long enough, you'll eventually end up with an ooze the size of... very large things.
A3:52:16 <vede> Like houses.
A3:52:19 <vurtual> Shells filled with sentient vomit.
A3:52:36 <vede> Or castles.
A3:52:44 <vede> Oozes capable of engulfing entire kingdoms.
A3:52:57 <vurtual> Attack of the killer blob?
A3:53:04 <vede> Indeed!
A3:53:19 <vede> You'd need an ice mage to kill it.
A3:53:29 <vurtual> Globs that abosrb information and matter, eventually eating up random tribal mobs and gaining humanoid status. Or giant pig-blobs.
A3:53:33 <Siiseli> so vede go make it
A3:54:02 <vurtual> Damaging them slowly makes them less viscous and lose structure, until they melt like Nightmare from Metroid Fusion, losing their abilities and form.
A3:54:10 <byte[]> razor queen in minecraft ... :S
A3:54:11 <vede> Siiseli, I've tried. I told you every time I start writing code I get bored.
A3:54:37 <vurtual> Then their shells they craft fall away, and they slowly glorp after whatever they can learn from. Including the player.
A3:54:55 <Siiseli> vede, then get unbored!
A3:55:00 <vede> :(
A3:55:01 <vurtual> Mutated mobs that have glob-parts might rise from them in a vain attempt to retaliate.
A3:55:37 <vurtual> Until they turn into nothing more than overextended paint that might drain your health by one or two points.
A3:56:08 <vede> vurtual, I was thinking of The Blob...
A3:56:09 <vede> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob
A3:56:13 <vurtual> Someone get the best random-genners, gore-simulators, and epic boss makers working on this.
A3:56:23 <vede> coughcough ICE MAGE coughcough
A3:56:52 <vurtual> Well your blob sucks, I like my metroid prime/zombie virus/golem beast better.
A3:57:42 <vurtual> It could copy you and take stuff from you, then go around feeding on life and resources as it tries to become more powerful, and more intelligent. Copying and distorting your skin!

A4:59:01 <HAL9000> so Mailis Hideous?
A4:59:05 <HAL9000> Makes sense to me.
A4:59:08 <Hideous> Funny fact, my bot is still in tigirc
A5:00:01 <HAL9000> Andreas Jorgensen.....why do people use their actual real name?
A5:00:42 <Evilgrim> I don't think Mail's hideous? 
A5:00:55 <bildramer> ...?
A5:00:56 <bildramer> no
A5:00:56 <Hideous> Mail isn't me
A5:01:01 <HAL9000> Then there is something wrong with you Evilgrim.
A5:01:03 <Hideous> My actual real name is awesome
A5:01:11 <Hideous> That's why
A5:01:17 <bildramer> mail is @hawaiisomethingjunkIPsomethingjunk
A5:01:36 <bildramer> err...
A5:01:39 <bildramer> yup
A5:01:39 <HAL9000> I never said mail was you.
A5:01:53 <HAL9000> I just said mail is hideos.
A5:01:59 <HAL9000> I just said mail is hideous..
A5:02:04 <bildramer> *facepalms*

A5:02:35 <Siiseli> hideous is not mail.
A5:02:44 <Siiseli> Hideous, you want me to go bothunting?
A5:02:51 <HAL9000> Siiseli didn't understand it either.

A11:54:38 <Marach> riverchen: heh you wish
A11:54:38 <riverchen> trolls
A11:54:39 <Adura> Trolling is trying to get a response out of someone.
A11:54:44 <HAL9000> He even admitted it himself.
A11:54:44 <Adura> Usually a pissed off one.
A11:54:57 <HAL9000> Trolling is generally a tactic to cause confusion.
A11:55:01 <riverchen> In Internet slang, a troll is someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room or blog, with the primary intent of provoking other users into an emotional response[1] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.[2]

P4:21:31 <AndyFm> ...
P4:21:38 <AndyFm> ? wait what?
P4:22:02 <Archanos> I hope notch adds artificial lights instead of a boring torch
P4:22:38 <Ylle> yeah it'd be sweet if you could just slap a 2d decal or something onto a block
P4:22:41 <vurtual> I hope Notch adds lasers that glow as they move.
P4:22:44 <AndyFm> artificial lights?
P4:22:55 <Ylle> yeah like lamps
P4:23:20 <AndyFm> oh
P4:23:22 <ZomBuster> crafting tree - torch < lamp < magical glowing rock thingie
P4:23:24 <vurtual> Maybe little robots, that are placed with a robot block, and can be activated from the placer's block panel. Then you could tell them to light up or start firing lasers at people.
P4:23:28 <AndyFm> bbl, eating
P4:23:31 <Archanos> because that would like, f up all the urban maps
P4:24:09 <vurtual> Then we could have little guards in survival, or know when someone enters our creations.
P4:24:23 <Ylle> Maybe but that's a bit overkill
P4:24:25 <ZomBuster> 5 wood blocks = torch. 2 steel blocks + 1 coal = lamp, glowing gem rocks are very rare underground 
P4:24:32 <Ylle> I'd like sentry guns at most.
P4:24:45 <PoF59> Zom, that's brilliant
P4:24:45 <Archanos> or like glowing blocks in <infiniminer>
P4:24:46 <vurtual> "Someone has triggered your security drone!", and then you can switch to them and find if they're griefing.
P4:25:01 <Ten_Tacles> XD
P4:25:04 <Ylle> but sentry guns are terribly overkill anyway and I'm pretty sure it'll never happen
P4:25:07 <primis> Spys sappin mah sentry!
P4:25:10 <vurtual> Giant expansive caves that have adamantine ore running through them, which glows.

P5:33:51 <derp> ok
P5:34:17 <Leonardo> I like your name derp.
P5:34:31 <AndrewPH> vurtual, openoffice
P5:34:31 <vede> If you want a word processor in Linux, you can use Open Office, or AbiWord. Both work great.

P5:34:47 <vurtual> I was clarifying why I have it.
P5:34:47 <AndrewPH> no we haven't
P5:34:54 <i300> openoffice is greate

P5:35:07 <Jat> thats the british spelling
P5:35:09 <Jat> clearly
P5:35:13 <i300> yeah

P5:45:23 <i300> yeah
P5:45:25 <Ylle> gimp should just do what every other graphics editing program does
P5:45:26 <Ylle> instead of
P5:45:32 <Ylle> all this floaty bullshit D:
P5:45:35 <i300> yeah
P5:45:50 <Jat> and they know the ui sucks and they refuse to change it
P5:45:50 <mail2345> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=58874#p58874
P5:45:53 <i300> paint.net is *supposed* to be a free photoshop, but it is nowhere near that
P5:46:00 <Jat> no its not
P5:46:08 <Jat> its supposed to just bea  simple graphics and photo editing program
P5:46:09 <Ylle> It's more of a free paint shop pro
P5:46:14 <Jat> as sort of a replacement for mspaint
P5:46:20 <Ylle> hmm
P5:46:36 <Ylle> you could call it what wordpad is to word and notepad
P5:46:44 <i300> yeah
P5:46:55 <i300> notepad is a text editor
P5:46:56 <Ylle> speaking of graphics editing
P5:46:57 <HAL9000> completely useless?
P5:46:58 <i300> not a document writer
P5:47:07 <Ylle> Completely useless if you have word and notepad
P5:47:08 <vurtual> paint.net can be used to photoshop things, I am content.
P5:47:08 <Ylle> :V
P5:47:14 <HAL9000> I use editpad pro myself.
P5:47:21 <Archanos> oh yeah well I use cs3
P5:47:25 <i300> cs4
P5:47:29 <Ylle> cs2
P5:47:31 <Ylle> because
P5:47:33 <HAL9000> csâ
P5:47:34 <vurtual> I use a hex editor.
P5:47:35 <Ylle> I only have 2gb of ram.
P5:47:40 <i300> oh
P5:47:44 <Ylle> I can't run cs3 on 2gb ram
P5:47:48 <i300> yeah
P5:47:50 <i300> no chance
P5:47:54 <Ylle> Well I can but
P5:48:00 <i300> slow as hell
P5:48:00 <Ylle> It wouldn't work too well.
P5:48:06 <Archanos> >cs4
P5:48:08 <Archanos> oh snap
P5:48:12 <Ylle> That and CS2 is the only one I can afford
P5:48:13 <Ylle> :V
P5:48:21 <i300> > pays for software
P5:48:22 <AndrewPH> buy
P5:48:23 <AndrewPH> ?
P5:48:27 <vurtual> I'm laughing very hard now. I have roughly 10 or so people in my Evil Genius fort entrance, stupified by a single trap that everyone keeps htiting.
P5:48:27 <Ylle> Yes
P5:48:29 <Ylle> Sorry.
P5:48:30 <AndrewPH> I use cs42
P5:48:30 <Ylle> :(
P5:48:32 <Jat> people pay for photoshop?
P5:48:36 <Ylle> Nevermind
P5:48:49 <Ylle> I didn't pay i pirated it forget I said I bought it.
P5:48:51 <AndrewPH> vurtual what is evil genius
P5:48:51 <i300> i thought 'pay' was 90's lingo
P5:48:57 <Ylle> god
P5:49:01 <Ylle> I'm so old fashioned.
P5:49:11 <vurtual> It's what I'm currently playing, that's what it is.
P5:49:13 <OWD9000> I pay for things, just not when they're that overpriced
P5:49:18 <i300> yeah
P5:49:19 <Ylle> I'm pretty upset because my flash 5 doesn't work on 64bit computers.
P5:49:21 <Ylle> :c
P5:49:31 <Jat> i dont think adobe actually cares much about people byuing photoshop for personal use
P5:49:32 <i300> wait
P5:49:32 <Ylle> Or vista or something
P5:49:37 <i300> > 2gb ram
P5:49:39 <i300> > 64 bit
P5:49:45 <Ylle> Yes.
P5:49:48 <OWD9000> what.
P5:49:51 <Jat> piracy of photoshop for personal use actually benefits adobe anyway by helping them to saturate the market
P5:50:01 <Archanos> luckily for me, I have an uncle who is a graphic design artist
P5:50:01 <Jat> since if people didnt pirate it much fewer peope would be using it
P5:50:05 <i300> true
P5:50:05 <Ylle> I bought the computer second hand, it's not my fault whoever built this thing was a retard.
P5:50:09 <Archanos> so I never payed for it :3
P5:50:12 <i300> oh
P5:50:15 <i300> i see then
P5:50:19 <Jat> they get their main money from enterprise sales and such
P5:50:22 <OWD9000> this is excusable.
P5:50:25 <Jat> mass licenses for businesses
P5:50:28 <i300> yeah
P5:50:32 <i300> tahts very true
P5:50:35 <Ylle> That and 64 bit makes gamecube emulation bearable :D! (pretty much the only reason.)
P5:50:43 <i300> :P
P5:50:49 <i300> i still buy OEM computer
P5:50:52 <i300> *computers
P5:51:06 <OWD9000> I stopped doing that :C
P5:51:15 <i300> good for you man
P5:51:26 <i300> once you want linux, BAM you already have 4 partitions
P5:51:26 <Ylle> But yeah I buy stuff like games and software out of like..
P5:51:29 <Jat> by oem you mean you buy oem parst and put them together?
P5:51:34 <Ylle> habit.
P5:51:42 <i300> no i mean like dell building it and sending it to me
P5:51:45 <Jat> i buy most stuff
P5:51:48 <Jat> oh ok
P5:51:51 <Ylle> I only pirated when I was too young to pay for shit mysef.
P5:51:59 <i300> i pirated cs4
P5:52:05 <i300> everything else i usually buy
P5:52:12 <i300> but, i pirated ram
P5:52:14 <Ylle> oh
P5:52:16 <Jat> how??
P5:52:22 <i300> i have no idea
P5:52:22 <Ylle> Yeah I used to pirate ram

P5:55:53 <Ylle> Ehh I wonder if I should even upgrade my computer now.
P5:55:54 <vede> As I said last night here, you should be educated on how computers work, and what all the parts are and what they do, before you're allowed to use one.
P5:55:58 <Ylle> Since I have a 8800gt.
P5:56:02 <i300> oh god
P5:56:05 <HAL9000> just a gt?
P5:56:09 <Ylle> just a gt.

P5:56:32 <HAL9000> My favorite video card company has to be EVGA

P5:56:51 <Ylle> I hate these god damn numbers.

P5:57:52 <vede> They have model numbers, while everything else is generally identified by its specs.

P5:58:10 <Jat> im pissed off that its so difficult to find power consumption specs for hardware
P5:58:18 <vurtual> Well, you know a rage pro is going to be worse than a 4670.
P5:58:19 <Ylle> vede: Back in the day, a voodoo 3 was much better than a voodoo 2
P5:58:23 <OWD9000> Usually just overestimate and you'll be fine
P5:58:23 <vede> "Oh I have <video card model number> and a <number> <number>-core processor, <stats stats stats>"
P5:58:31 <i300> lol
P5:58:38 <i300> i need to upgrade my card
P5:58:38 <Ylle> Nowadays a 9600 is going to be much worse than a 8800.
P5:58:45 <i300> its a radeon hd 4850
P5:58:46 <vurtual> Learn numbering, and you can know how good each card is.
P5:58:51 <Jat> since im planning on upgrading my computer soon can i ask about my upgrade?
P5:58:53 <i300> i need to upgrade to a 5000
P5:58:58 <i300> yeah
P5:59:06 <OWD9000> i think i'm good for a while still
P5:59:08 <Jat> wait a 9600gt is worse than a 8800gt?
P5:59:10 <vurtual> Jat, collect lots of XP with a computer, then you can upgrade in that stat.
P5:59:11 <OWD9000> gtx 280
P5:59:14 <vede> I'm saying, like, why don't we use a video card's actual specifications rather than its model?
P5:59:21 <i300> yeah, the bigger the number the better is is basically
P5:59:34 <i300> but i dislike nvidia
P5:59:35 <vede> The way we do with processors, hard drives, RAM, and everything else.
P5:59:37 <vurtual> They're realllly complex.
P5:59:49 <vurtual> So we turned them into simple numbers.
P5:59:51 <Ylle> Jat: Yeah.
P5:59:51 <Jat> is a 9600gt worse than a 8800gt?
P5:59:53 <Jat> why?
P5:59:57 <Ylle> Because
P6:00:08 <Ylle> the second number denotes the series
P6:00:15 <Jat> oh
P6:00:17 <i300> yeah
P6:00:20 <Jat> thats fucking retarded
P6:00:23 <Ylle> I know!
P6:00:25 <i300> yeah
P6:00:25 <Ylle> I hate it.
P6:00:30 <i300> i like ATI
P6:00:37 <Ylle> I love ati cards however'
P6:00:44 <i300> yeah
P6:00:53 <OWD9000> i don't really like ati cards. don't know why.
P6:00:53 <Ylle> they run hot, loud and require more power than you'd think was needed.
P6:00:54 <i300> its a number taht gets bigger, getting better
P6:00:57 <Jat> so then wtf is the first number?
P6:01:00 <vurtual> ATI cards always have obscure random problems.
P6:01:01 <Ylle> It's the model
P6:01:11 <Ylle> 9th model, 6th series.
P6:01:13 <i300> vurtual: yeah
P6:01:15 <Jat> goddamnit
P6:01:22 <OWD9000> the naming and numbering is just as ridiculous for either brand
P6:01:31 <i300> i have an ati radeon hd 4850
P6:01:32 <OWD9000> you just end up getting used to whichever one you pick
P6:01:36 <i300> true
P6:01:37 <Ylle> Also I think my 8800gt is a sapphire one.
P6:01:45 <Ylle> if that's even possible like hell I know
P6:01:45 <i300> > sapphire and nvidia?
P6:01:52 <Ylle> yeah it's probably wrong
P6:01:55 <i300> yeah\
P6:01:59 <i300> nvidia make their cards
P6:02:04 <i300> ati have people do it for them
P6:02:06 <Jat> then maybe i should look again at what card i should upgrade to
P6:02:16 <Ylle> yeah its my other box that has a sapphire, higher end
P6:02:17 <Jat> i was planning on 9500gt because its cheap
P6:02:21 <Ylle> but the best ATI card I've ever had
P6:02:27 <Jat> and most likely better than a radeon 9800 pro anyway
P6:02:29 <Ylle> was a 9250 radeon.
P6:02:34 <i300> ooo nicwe
P6:02:36 <i300> *nice
P6:02:40 <Ylle> Yeah
P6:02:41 <Ylle> No fan.
P6:02:44 <Ylle> Just a heatsink
P6:02:44 <i300> xD
P6:02:44 <Ylle> :3
P6:02:50 <i300> i love heatsinks
P6:03:04 <Ylle> I could even run tf2 on it
P6:03:08 <i300> nice
P6:03:21 <Ylle> Of course I had 1gb ram and 4ghz p4 backing it up but yeah
P6:03:23 <Jat> tf2 barely evenb runs on my 9800 :|
P6:03:28 <i300> i run tf2 on my hd 4670
P6:03:29 <OWD9000> really?
P6:03:39 <Jat> i mean it runs fine most of the time on lowest settings
P6:03:40 <Ylle> maybe you have settings too high Jat
P6:03:45 <Ylle> weird.
P6:03:50 <i300> yeah
P6:03:51 <Jat> ubut in some places the fps becaomes unplayable
P6:03:59 <i300> that sucks
P6:04:01 <Ylle> Well TF2 is more processor and ram than graphics card.
P6:04:04 <OWD9000> i'm glad i blew too much money building this computer
P6:04:07 <Jat> then again it appears to be somewhat broken anywy
P6:04:08 <Ylle> Well, actually, just as much
P6:04:18 <OWD9000> most things run great
P6:04:20 <Jat> well my cpu is a p4 2.6 ghz
P6:04:28 <OWD9000> that would be the problem
P6:04:30 <Ylle> Since I had shit fps on TF2 before they threw in dual core optimization.
P6:04:31 <Jat> oh ok
P6:04:37 <i300> if you have 3gb ram and a good 3.00GHz dual core you should be able to ruyn tf2 on lowest easy
P6:04:51 <OWD9000> what was your ram like Jat?
P6:04:51 <Jat> how much fucking ram dose it need?
P6:04:54 <Ylle> It should work on less but
P6:04:55 <Jat> 2.5gb
P6:04:55 <i300> tf2?
P6:04:59 <Ylle> Every god damn update you know
P6:05:01 <i300> i think 1.0gb
P6:05:05 <OWD9000> that should work, but the cpu is your bottleneck right now
P6:05:09 <Jat> oh ok
P6:05:14 <revenant> wtf you talking about
P6:05:15 <Jat> well im upgrading amlmost everything
P6:05:15 <Ylle> in theory you could run it on 512mb ram.
P6:05:17 <Ylle> I know I have.
P6:05:18 <Jat> soon probably
P6:05:18 <revenant> TF2 is easy to run
P6:05:19 <revenant> on shit.
P6:05:24 <OWD9000> whats your budget like?
P6:05:24 <Ylle> but then
P6:05:31 <revenant> I ran it on Medium settings on my MAC BOOK PRO in Wine.
P6:05:32 <Ylle> it looked like bloody legoland lol
P6:05:43 <i300> tf2 specs:
P6:05:44 <i300> Minimum: 1.7 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM, DirectX® 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE), Windows® Vista/XP/2000, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection
P6:05:44 <i300> Recommended: Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better), 1GB RAM, DirectX® 9 level Graphics Card, Windows® Vista/XP/2000, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection
P6:05:47 <Jat> well the stuff i m upgradnig will probably end up being about 400-500 $ D:
P6:05:51 <Jat> most than i was hoping to spend
P6:05:51 <revenant> yeah, 2.6ghz
P6:05:54 <revenant> im around the middle.
P6:06:00 <Jat> but i wanted it to be stable and upgradeable for a while
P6:06:04 <revenant> I just had to use OpenGL instead of D3D
P6:06:06 <Jat> nnot necessarily powerful
P6:06:10 <i300> how much did you pay for your current pc?
P6:06:15 <Jat> a lot
P6:06:21 <Jat> but that was many years ago
P6:06:21 <i300> over 1k?
P6:06:25 <i300> oh
P6:06:28 <Jat> and its inuncluded replacing parts
P6:06:35 <i300> oh ok
P6:06:37 <Jat> ive replaced a lot of parts over time
P6:06:43 <Jat> but im ordering a whole bunch of new stfuf soon
P6:06:46 <i300> nice
P6:06:47 <Jat> so almost everything will be replaced
P6:06:47 <OWD9000> oem originally?
P6:06:57 <i300> a good overhaul is a great for anything
P6:06:59 <Jat> it was put together in a computer shop
P6:07:02 <OWD9000> ah
P6:07:03 <Jat> so not really oem
P6:07:05 <i300> yeah
P6:07:13 <OWD9000> well
P6:07:15 <Jat> anyway is athlon 2 dual core 3.0ghz ok?
P6:07:21 <Jat> for cheap
P6:07:23 <Ylle> http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/3713/ctfdoublecross0003.jpg
P6:07:24 <Ylle> pro
P6:07:25 <Jat> or rather cheap and old
P6:07:34 <OWD9000> i couldn't tell you, i never recommend amd
P6:07:38 <Ylle> I'm rather sad about how the hitdecals look but eh
P6:07:51 <Jat> amd is cheaper than intel
P6:07:58 <OWD9000> i was lucky
P6:07:59 <Ylle> god damn legoland crap anyway
P6:08:01 <AndrewPH> intel is better
P6:08:04 <i300> yeah
P6:08:05 <OWD9000> i knew someone who worked at intel
P6:08:10 <i300> intel rule the cpu market
P6:08:10 <OWD9000> so i got a discount on mine
P6:08:20 <Ylle> AMD used to be pretty good
P6:08:26 <i300> yeah
P6:08:28 <Jat> as long as the cpu works decently i dont ally care what vbrand it is
P6:08:29 <i300> now they are a joke
P6:08:32 <Ylle> but now its a matter of what GPU you're putting in.
P6:08:46 <i300> i7 getting 3.0GHz with Quad Cores and 8MB Cache
P6:08:54 <i300> Only intel get that
P6:08:55 <revenant> watch your RAM latency.
P6:09:11 <revenant> and most importantly, make sure everything fits your motherboard, and that you have a good enough power supply.
P6:09:16 <Jat> yeah
P6:09:18 <i300> lmao
P6:09:18 <revenant> You can't just plug an i7 into any motherboard.
P6:09:21 <i300> true
P6:09:24 <revenant> It has its own socket.
P6:09:31 <revenant> You'll need an i7 compatible motherboard.
P6:09:34 <i300> yeah
P6:09:35 <Jat> thats why im pissed off about the power supply since i cant find out how much power the components draw from each rail

P6:09:40 <i300> and i7 compatible everything
P6:09:42 <Ylle> I remember when dual core meant putting two cpus onto the same mobo
P6:09:45 <revenant> And if you try to find an i7 compatible one that also has quad-SLI...
P6:09:49 <revenant> it gets expensive.
P6:09:54 <i300> yeah
P6:09:58 <Jat> who are you talking to?
P6:10:00 <revenant> And by then you're building a BTX large tower...
P6:10:05 <revenant> *rambling*
P6:10:08 <Jat> oh
P6:10:09 <Ylle> hahahaha revenant
P6:10:17 <Ylle> quad sli.
P6:10:27 <Ylle> If I won the lottery, perhaps.
P6:10:28 <Ylle> :V
P6:10:30 <revenant> haha.
P6:10:37 <OWD9000> i can't imagine how much space that would take up physically
P6:10:38 <revenant> Four nVidia 295's
P6:10:39 <revenant> :)
P6:10:46 <OWD9000> that sounds horrifying.
P6:10:52 <revenant> You'd need a shitload of liquid cooling
P6:10:59 <revenant> In fact, this should be hung on a mobile.
P6:11:02 <Jat> anyway the videocard WAS going to be a 9500gt since that seemed like the best balance between cheap price and power compared to my old radeon 9800
P6:11:03 <OWD9000> i have one 280 and it's like half a cereal box
P6:11:04 <revenant> With the box, itd get too hot.
P6:11:11 <Ylle> At that point, your power bill would be part of the calculations of your computer build.
P6:11:13 <Jat> but i dunno now
P6:11:17 <revenant> yep XD.
P6:11:29 <revenant> 1200 would not be enough
P6:11:29 <Jat> i have no fucking idea how to pick out a videocard
P6:11:42 <revenant> Make sure it works with your motherboard!
P6:11:42 <Ylle> DX9 pixel shader 3.
P6:11:45 <OWD9000> well, we could get really nontechnical
P6:11:49 <Ylle> make sure it works for your mobo yeah
P6:11:54 <revenant> Look for good vram amounts too
P6:11:54 <Siiseli> Jat, buy the most expensive one!
P6:11:56 <OWD9000> what is the highest quality game you want to be able to run?
P6:11:57 <Jat> what do you mean works with my motherboard?
P6:11:59 <revenant> lower CPU will make games slower.
P6:12:00 <Jat> no wait
P6:12:02 <Jat> this one is like 55$
P6:12:06 <revenant> But not enough vram means you cant play them at ALL
P6:12:12 <i300> here is my build
P6:12:12 <i300> http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/8828/minecraftirc12302009spe.png
P6:12:32 <Ylle> is the i7 good for anything
P6:12:37 <i300> yes
P6:12:37 <Ylle> other than maybe ut3.
P6:12:44 <OWD9000> i wish i had gone for the i7
P6:12:45 <Jat> anyway i guess source games mainly are what i want to run
P6:12:45 <OWD9000> kind of.
P6:12:53 <i300> running source games with everything highest
P6:12:58 <OWD9000> but i'm not going 8 core until it's 8 physical cores
P6:12:59 <i300> thats what i do
P6:13:08 <OWD9000> yeah, i do that with mine
P6:13:09 <Jat> at the moment even wnhat i have now is decent for source games
P6:13:17 <OWD9000> only thing that can have problems is gmod but that's a very different issue
P6:13:22 <i300> yeah
P6:13:38 <i300> the newest gmod is buggy for me and  win7]
P6:13:40 <Jat> anyway my main concern is just upgradeability in the future and stability
P6:13:44 <Jat> reliability and such
P6:13:47 <Jat> not necessarily power
P6:13:51 <Jat> and preferably cheap too
P6:13:55 <Jat> relatively
P6:13:56 <i300> yeah

P6:29:04 <Animator> You mean debating, vurtual.
P6:29:34 <Siiseli> the point of anarchy is to bring down a form of government into no form of government, then basically let the void fill itself and hope it'll be something better
P6:29:38 <vurtual> I did.
P6:29:41 <Siiseli> anarchy is just a moving point between government
P6:29:44 <Siiseli> anarchy is just a moving point between governments*

P6:30:07 <vurtual> Debating/argumenting/arguing, whatever. It's one skill.
P6:30:23 <vurtual> Siiseli, well, they believe in equality of everyone and power of speech and such.
P6:30:24 <Siiseli> anyway, anarchists are often kids who think there's something wrong with the system
P6:30:30 <vurtual> It's like... half-socialist, half-anarchist.
P6:30:34 <Siiseli> but cannot suggest a better alternative.
P6:30:35 <Jat> democracy is a crappy government for large populations
P6:30:40 <Siiseli> it indeed is
P6:30:43 <Siiseli> and it cannot work
P6:30:47 <vurtual> Jat, for large, lazy populations.
P6:30:48 <owd9000> maybe we should just get an anarchist state going. they could vacation there and see how much they like it
P6:30:50 <Jat> no
P6:30:51 <vurtual> Currently, I'm fine with everything.
P6:30:56 <Jat> for large populations with many different pionts of view
P6:30:57 <Siiseli> but Jat, any form of government is shit for large populations.
P6:30:59 <Jat> and opinions
P6:31:10 <Jat> yes
P6:31:13 <Jat> siiseli
P6:31:15 <Jat> i agree
P6:31:23 <Siiseli> the perfect social order is impossible
P6:31:27 <Siiseli> because we lack the perfect human
P6:31:36 <vurtual> What if everyone was nice and friendly?
P6:31:38 <Siiseli> to make a perfect society we need to strip humanity out
P6:31:43 <mail2345> we can only approximate perfection
P6:31:44 <Siiseli> vurtual, which would be the perfect situation
P6:31:47 <Siiseli> which is impossible
P6:31:54 <Jat> that sounds like socialist talk vurtual
P6:31:55 <Siiseli> because everyone will NEVER be nice and friendly
P6:32:01 <Jat> suspicious socialist talk
P6:32:04 <Siiseli> it's a sheer impossiblity
P6:32:18 <owd9000> until everyone's just so afraid of retribution that they have to be nice and friendly
P6:32:19 <mail2345> with current technology
P6:32:22 <vurtual> I say we invent a new country, where you have to be nice.
P6:32:28 <Siiseli> vurtual, or what?
P6:32:31 <Animator> Then society becomes distopic.
P6:32:34 <vurtual> You move to the USA.
P6:32:36 <Siiseli> you know they tried that vurtual 
P6:32:38 <mail2345> i say
P6:32:44 <mail2345> we let make skyney
P6:32:45 <owd9000> so, nice or deported?
P6:32:45 <Siiseli> it's called the soviet union
P6:32:48 <mail2345> lol
P6:32:53 <Siiseli> but it kind of broke down
P6:32:54 <vurtual> 51st state requires niceness, or you move to the other states.
P6:33:00 <mail2345> yea
P6:33:01 <Jat> anyway i was just talking about democracy since a lot of people seem to think that democracy is a cure-all
P6:33:04 <mail2345> but over here in hawaii
P6:33:11 <Siiseli> well vurtual that would result in a government led by fear
P6:33:12 <mail2345> umm lets say the education system
P6:33:13 <Siiseli> which isn't nice!
P6:33:16 <mail2345> isn't exactly up to par
P6:33:20 <Siiseli> it's fascist.
P6:33:22 <vurtual> Siiseli, be scared of having to move a little?
P6:33:22 <owd9000> democracy would only be a cure-all if everyone voted the way you did
P6:33:24 <Animator> But if you're forcing someone out, you're not being nice to them.
P6:33:32 <Animator> You're contradicting your own rule.

P6:33:45 <Siiseli> vurtual, your ideas are utopistic and unrealistic.
P6:33:46 <owd9000> the reason it doesn't work is the same reason it's sought after in the first place
P6:33:54 <vurtual> "Oh no if I go around insulting people or screaming at everyone or start breaking the law I'll have to move what do I dooo"
P6:34:09 <Siiseli> vurtual, that involves leaving all your friends behind

P6:34:16 <Siiseli> house
P6:34:17 <Siiseli> everything
P6:34:28 <Siiseli> and where do you draw the line of being nice?
P6:34:34 <vurtual> Internet, internet, internet, RV, storage.
P6:34:45 <storage> what
P6:34:48 <Siiseli> anyway, to make such a place, would essentially strip humans of their humanity
P6:34:51 <owd9000> ha.
P6:34:54 <Siiseli> thus bringing me back to my original point
P6:35:08 <vurtual> It's already illegal for hate crimes or abuse.
P6:35:09 <Siiseli> no governmental system could work
P6:35:16 <Siiseli> that well
P6:35:26 <vurtual> Just enforce it.
P6:35:27 <Siiseli> because humans are horrible pieces of shit
P6:35:30 <owd9000> hate crimes and abuse and stuff like that are already incorrectly prosecuted a good portion of the time
P6:35:33 <vurtual> I'm not horrible.
P6:35:38 <vurtual> I certainly hope YOU'RE not horrible.
P6:35:39 <Siiseli> well most are :)
P6:35:52 <vurtual> You're banned from my 51st state.
P6:35:53 <owd9000> people would be in jail for a lot of things they didn't do because of how difficult they'd be to prove
P6:35:57 <Siiseli> anyway, vurtual, your ideas for government couldn't work
P6:36:03 <vurtual> It already works on the internet.
P6:36:11 <mail2345> i have a solution for goverment
P6:36:13 <Siiseli> well the internet is formed of mini-societies
P6:36:19 <Jat> LOOK WHAT YOUVE DONE YOUVE STARTED ANOTHER POLITICAL ARGUMENT
P6:36:24 <mail2345> we use technology to improve the human race
P6:36:25 <Siiseli> and is essentially not what you're suggesting vurtual 
P6:36:30 <mail2345> and then let things settle themselves
P6:36:32 <Siiseli> Jat, silence, this is interesting
P6:36:37 <owd9000> this is better then sitting in a dead channel at least
P6:36:53 <Siiseli> mail2345, we use technologoy to advance further to advance further to advance further to...

P6:37:07 <vurtual> I get to play videogames AND push my political agenda for world domination.
P6:37:15 <Siiseli> anyway, vurtual, internet is mini-society. 
P6:37:20 <Siiseli> state is not
P6:37:26 <Siiseli> that would require enforcing
P6:37:28 <Jat> just pointing out that he pushed the snowball down the hill :o
P6:37:29 <owd9000> i'd say
P6:37:30 <vurtual> I run it on a channel of lifeless, homeless nerds.
P6:37:33 <owd9000> internet is more like a mega-society
P6:37:34 <Siiseli> and it would require 24/7 surveilance
P6:37:36 <owd9000> this is like a tribe
P6:37:39 <Siiseli> which would mean Orwellian society
P6:37:43 <vurtual> Getting kicked from the IRC channel is the equivelant of solitary confinement.

P6:37:51 <Siiseli> owd9000, it's a mini-society, individual channels
P6:37:55 <Siiseli> forming one mega-coutnry
P6:37:57 <Siiseli> country
P6:37:57 <owd9000> yes
P6:38:03 <owd9000> i think i just misunderstood what you said
P6:38:06 <Siiseli> individual all sorts of stuff
P6:38:08 <Siiseli> yeah you did
P6:38:12 <Siiseli> whatever, don't matter :D
P6:38:23 <vurtual> NO WAIT
P6:38:25 <Archanos> then who was internet
P6:38:29 <vurtual> We just invent everything we could comprehend in 2004.
P6:38:38 <vurtual> Then, we will only be able to invent "future tech". It adds happiness and health!
P6:38:46 <Siiseli> vurtual, yes but in your state things're more complicated and surveilance is harder
P6:38:51 <vurtual> Keep inventing it and everyone will be more estatic than a dwarf with a dining room!
P6:39:00 <Siiseli> surveilance eventually leads to cameras everywhere
P6:39:04 <Siiseli> leading to fear of eviction
P6:39:07 <Archanos> like cctv
P6:39:08 <owd9000> but once things become like that people get used to it
P6:39:09 <Jat> especially in the womens changing rooms
P6:39:13 <Jat> and bathrooms
P6:39:14 <Jat> and bedrooms
P6:39:16 <Siiseli> leading to a society founded on fear
P6:39:19 <Siiseli> Archanos, excacltly.
P6:39:24 <owd9000> "Why don't we have technology from 500 years in the future instead of just 250?"
P6:39:25 <Siiseli> (enjoy your Orwell, bitches)
P6:39:30 <mail2345> umm guys
P6:39:31 <Archanos> lol britons
P6:39:35 <mail2345> while we are having a debate
P6:39:44 <mail2345> what is the definition of a perfect society?
P6:39:48 <mail2345> what would be the ideals
P6:39:49 <Archanos> <insert UN joke here>
P6:39:50 <Jat> the one i rule
P6:39:50 <Siiseli> owd9000, so you're saying it's okay for people to get numbed by a society of fear?
P6:39:58 <owd9000> what? no...
P6:40:10 <Jat> or more correctly
P6:40:13 <Jat> "the one i rule"
P6:40:17 <owd9000> I'm saying if we did something like that to keep everyone happy, they'll just want more
P6:40:23 <Siiseli> mail2345, one that can sustain itself, has no dilemmas basically
P6:40:43 <Siiseli> everyone is "free" and has anything they need to make 'emselves happy
P6:40:43 <Jat> it is a subjective question that mail asked and there is no specific answer
P6:40:59 <vurtual> I don't think people will be founded on fear of getting arrested or fined for being a horrible person to everyone.
P6:41:01 <Siiseli> (all the moslows lower hierarchy levels need to be automatically fullfilled by society)
P6:41:07 <Archanos> Some could interpret a perfect society as one without emotion and thought
P6:41:18 <Siiseli> vurtual, well drawing the line of horrible person is hard
P6:41:38 <vurtual> Did you just make everyone wish you didn't exist?
P6:41:38 <Siiseli> would you draw the line of this with a community vote? surveilance cameras?

P6:42:16 <Siiseli> besides, occasional dickery is part of the human nature
P6:42:22 <Siiseli> it's impossible and dangerous to always be nice
P6:42:22 <Jat> and fun
P6:42:30 <vurtual> wait
P6:42:35 <vurtual> I have to be mean occasionally!?
P6:42:38 <vurtual> Nobody told me that!
P6:42:44 <Siiseli> well you're allowed to
13P6:42:49 * vurtual burns Siiseli's house down
P6:42:51 <Siiseli> if you don't consider yourself before others
13P6:42:55 * vurtual stabs a puppy
P6:42:55 <Siiseli> you'll end up in the gutter.
P6:43:01 <AndrewPH> Archanos what are you doing on my custom server that nobody good ever goes on
13P6:43:12 * vurtual disregards the people he normally helps
P6:43:20 <Siiseli> anyway vurtual is obviously being silly and this arguement is tupid
P6:43:23 <Siiseli> stupid*
13P6:43:25 * vurtual lets his friends fall into ruin without a socially supportive leader
P6:43:32 <Siiseli> let's drop it :p
P6:43:40 <owd9000> i think he's just making up for the years and years of being perfectly nice to everyone
P6:43:52 <Siiseli> yeah propably
P6:44:01 <Siiseli> anyway, being selfish can be healthy
P6:44:09 <Siiseli> anything you do is basically selfish at some level
P6:44:18 <Siiseli> realize selfishness, to a certain extent, is good
P6:44:29 <Siiseli> well, selfishness is always good
P6:44:31 <vurtual> You're using the dark side of the force now.
P6:44:37 <Siiseli> there are just different kinds of selfishness
P6:44:43 <vurtual> Things can be selfish until it gets to the point where nobody is troubled, and it doesn't matter.
P6:44:53 <Siiseli> some are, for example, making yourself feel better for helping someone
P6:44:56 <owd9000> and then you have to step up to a galactic scale. :D
P6:44:58 <Siiseli> that's good
P6:45:07 <Siiseli> but if you hurt someone by your selfishness
P6:45:10 <mail2345> siiseli, besides the fact that people are mean
P6:45:10 <vurtual> That's not even selfish. You're not using it as a means to an end.
P6:45:11 <Siiseli> well, you're doing it wrong
P6:45:13 <vurtual> The help is the end itself.
P6:45:15 <Siiseli> mail2345, yes.
P6:45:16 <mail2345> there is also the fact that people are stupid
P6:45:25 <mail2345> and can sometimes make incorrect choices
P6:45:25 <Siiseli> oh right, that

P6:45:33 <Siiseli> also the human brain is complicated
P6:45:35 <vurtual> It's not selfish to ask your parents to buy you a small game for some money they can spare. It's not selfish to call dibs on something unimportant, it isn't selfish to be player one sometimes.
P6:45:37 <Siiseli> people are illogical
P6:45:38 <Siiseli> stupid
P6:45:42 <Siiseli> and our thoughts aren't ours
P6:45:53 <vurtual> GUYS I JUST INAHLED HOW SELFISH
P6:45:57 <Siiseli> vurtual, sure it is. It's just not super selfish
P6:46:12 <AndrewPH> Insert logical fallacy here!
P6:46:16 <Siiseli> it's selfish on some extent
P6:46:26 <Siiseli> AndrewPH, refering to me? do explain

P6:47:25 <Siiseli> vurtual, aww sorry
P6:47:37 <Siiseli> how.. selfish of me!
P6:47:37 <owd9000> there's an idea. put a few thousand people into a simulation, try out all these ideas and see which one is the least ridiculous.
P6:47:40 <vurtual> Ten simple virtual lifeforms died.
P6:47:58 <Siiseli> owd9000, governmental policies? that doesn't work.

P6:52:18 <owd9000> everything's decided by vote

P6:52:28 <Siiseli> :D
P6:52:53 <Siiseli> vurtual, haha, so basically anarchy with someone trying to ask people to do stuff

P6:53:14 <vurtual> People will fall into getting used to obeying.

P6:54:13 <vurtual> Anyways I'm not president yet, so this is just a random encounter for xp.
P6:54:27 <owd9000> i have a plan.
P6:54:33 <owd9000> everyone stock up on whale blubber
P6:54:35 <vurtual> I also know who my political enemies will be.
P6:54:39 <owd9000> we are moving to the arctic circle
P6:54:45 <vurtual> NO

P6:55:00 <owd9000> arctic square fits inside the arctic circle

P6:55:08 <owd9000> if you really want to be colder, be my guest
P6:57:06 <vurtual> Isn't a "religon" supposed to be a shape with an unknown number of sides?

P6:58:32 <owd9000> so guys how bout that lhc lots of black holes all up ins

P6:59:07 <mail2345> THE LHC WILL DESTROY US ALL
P6:59:20 <vurtual> The closest I could get with a religious argument here is about the potentium view used in jediism.
P6:59:20 <Siiseli> vurtual, yes see I thought that was an euphanism for religion at first

P7:05:42 <AndrewPH> bf2 isn't an fps
P7:05:46 <vurtual> yes it is.
P7:05:48 <vurtual> I play it in FPS mode.
P7:05:49 <AndrewPH> it's third person
P7:05:51 <AndrewPH> oh
P7:05:54 <AndrewPH> there's a first person mode?
P7:05:57 <vurtual> Yeah.
P7:06:02 <vurtual> It's default I'm pretty sure.
P7:06:04 <AndrewPH> ok then
P7:06:16 <AndrewPH> yeah get bf2 it's great
P7:06:20 <vurtual> only time it forces thirdperson I think, is droideka rolling and a few turrets when you don't zoom.
P7:06:26 <vede> I have BF2, actually.
P7:06:32 <vede> I have both Battlefront games.
P7:06:36 <vurtual> k
P7:06:40 <vurtual> Does it run?
P7:06:49 <vede> Dunno, haven't tried it with Wine.

P7:07:57 <vurtual> NO WAIT
P7:08:20 <vurtual> Evil Genius. It needs wine, isn't an FPS, and is only limited in freeroam qualities. But it's fun enough to make up for it.
P7:08:39 <vurtual> Or you could get legos, as long as the fun factor can make up for not being on your computer at all.

P7:09:10 <AndrewPH> Is DokuWiki any good?
P7:09:34 <Jat> has anyone told notch to add invisibility for ops so they can catch griefers and such?
P7:09:40 <AndrewPH> yes
P7:09:42 <AndrewPH> several times
P7:09:42 <mail2345> yes
P7:09:47 <Siiseli> well doku is a slang word in finnish for a stupid person who drinks alot
P7:09:48 <Jat> why wo0nt he add it?
P7:09:50 <Siiseli> so I doubt it!
P7:09:52 <Siiseli> it can't be good.
P7:10:04 <AndrewPH> Siiseli, it looks simple :|

P7:10:23 <AndrewPH> I don't know if I should get it just to have a wiki or not
P7:10:46 <AndrewPH> Because there's a jfusion plugin and I have the webspace :\
P7:10:54 <Jat> a wiki for what?
P7:10:55 <PoF59> Siiseli? A joke? these two things do not mix.
P7:10:58 <vurtual> Ops should have a time grenade.
P7:11:02 <AndrewPH> slang and stuff
P7:11:04 <Siiseli> PoF59, madness.
P7:11:29 <vurtual> They fire somewhere, and the area freezes entirely.
P7:11:48 <AndrewPH> Notch should take ownership of minecraftforum.net and minecraftwiki.net and make his own wiki and forum software and integrate everything :D
P7:11:52 <vurtual> Players cannot move around, or edit anything, and blocks stop.
P7:11:53 <Jat> dose notch not want op invisibility?

P7:13:18 <vurtual> I can't get it open.
P7:13:20 <AndrewPH> Siiseli, No you are wrong
P7:13:21 <Siiseli> you clever dog you
P7:13:43 <AndrewPH> Sinep is a string in jermish
P7:13:54 <Siiseli> and this is funny because sinep also means mustard in swedish
P7:13:56 <AndrewPH> it means fire
P7:13:57 <Jat> too bad moer sodas dont offer real sugar versions
P7:14:02 <Jat> how much more expensive is throwback than regular?

P7:16:31 <Jat> what a stupid biottle design
P7:16:44 <Jat> maybe theyre trying to discourage you from buying that kind of mountain dew
P7:16:49 <Jat> so they can selel more of the cheaper stuff
P7:17:08 <Jat> and by cheaper i mean they spend les smoney on it
P7:17:10 <Jat> not you
P7:17:36 <vurtual> They cost the same to make.
P7:17:59 <owd9000> one is sugar and one is corn syrup, right?

P7:18:10 <AndrewPH> It's a message
P7:18:11 <Jat> i highly doubt they cost the same to make
P7:18:13 <AndrewPH> half in swedish
P7:18:20 <owd9000> sugar costs more.
P7:18:31 <vurtual> Well either way I got someone else to open it.
P7:18:39 <Jat> was it your little sister/

P7:19:09 <Jat> thats wha i was thinking
P7:19:13 <owd9000> it stops people from drinking a gallon an hour
P7:19:15 <Jat> or maybe the bottle holds less soda
P7:19:23 <owd9000> so they end up having to pay less in settlements

P7:59:58 <vurtual> Imagine a bunch of simple parts.
P8:00:07 <vurtual> They have wire ports, and wires going out.
P8:00:13 <vurtual> You can plug any of these in however you want.
P8:00:21 <Visiiri> or imagine an invisibie jeep with no-collide D:
P8:00:31 <vurtual> A button has a wire out, you can link that to say, a light.
P8:00:35 <Visiiri> Like a floating bathtub
P8:00:38 <vurtual> Then, when you hit the button, it makes the light turn on.
P8:00:40 <Visiiri> that's my favorite
P8:01:00 <vurtual> But you can do simple math, even programming if needed, with an array of parts.
P8:01:09 <Visiiri> hrm
P8:01:17 <vurtual> Use the advanced wire tool to link anything.
P8:01:22 <vurtual> It has a little GUI thing.
P8:01:38 <vurtual> I can even show you how to use wiremod.
P8:02:13 <Liam> I have a question
P8:02:25 <Liam> Why can't we talk about OpenCraft in #MineCraft?
P8:02:28 <vurtual> Russians have caught on to my secret plan to do something in their area. They kill enough workers so I can't do a mission.
P8:02:35 <vurtual> Because this isn't #OpenCraft at all.
P8:02:37 <Ylle> Wire seems awesomehard because people show off these awesome things
P8:02:42 <vurtual> FREE WILL MAKES NOTCH CRY
P8:02:50 <Liam> OpenCraft is a division of MineCraft, though
P8:02:56 <vurtual> Ylle, with basic knowledge, I took an LAAT model and made it fully functional.
P8:03:13 <Ylle> It's just logic gates yeah.
P8:03:18 <Ylle> do those first
P8:03:18 <vurtual> and programming systems
P8:03:30 <vurtual> Which can be useful to compress gates simply.
P8:03:31 <Ylle> It's not like you have to brute the cpu module first thing you do.
P8:03:54 <vurtual> The only problem with my LAAT is that the collision mesh is a huge area around it, so people have to noclip into pods to ride it, and I can't make turrets on it.

P8:07:43 <vurtual> PM me all the addons you have, over steam. I'll take out any you don't.
P8:07:59 <Visiiri> I was slightly dissapointed with The Perish in L4D2
P8:08:13 <Visiiri> The final place
P8:08:17 <Visiiri> the bridge
P8:08:25 <vurtual> Impossbily hard.

P8:09:01 <Visiiri> You can walk a ways from it and you fall in

P8:13:26 <vurtual> They do better than some players.
P8:13:36 <ez> agree with that tho lol
P8:13:41 <vurtual> Their screwups are things people do in reality too.
P8:13:52 <vurtual> They just aren't tweaked to have your level of faults.
P8:13:55 <ez> not really
P8:14:07 <ez> they are just acting weird
P8:14:16 <vurtual> They don't miss easily, or rage. They act differently than veteran players.
P8:14:19 <ez> like being amazingly quick at shooting hunters off u

P8:14:35 <vurtual> I'm a quick hunter-shooter.
P8:14:47 <Visiiri> what I can't stand about them
P8:14:51 <vurtual> I've never, ever seen the bots do these "stupid things" like circling around people.
P8:14:54 <Visiiri> they just two shot kill every zombie instantly
P8:15:09 <vurtual> ...I do that all the time.
P8:15:12 <Visiiri> They shoot them before I'd be able to see them because of rendering distance
P8:15:17 <Visiiri> I mean, six in a row
P8:15:21 <Visiiri> just bang bang bang
P8:15:22 <vurtual> I do that too.

P8:42:02 <vurtual> Yeah, it's uphill multiple times here. About a seventy-five to hundred to reach the lower flatter area here.
P8:42:35 <vurtual> Yeah, because a scooter can cross the most dangerous woods since Endor.
P8:42:37 <Nuthen> The only problem with NSMBW is the lack of online play
P8:42:50 <vurtual> Nintendo consoles thrive on not having extensive online.
P8:42:59 <revenant> heh.
P8:43:08 <revenant> because when they DO... it's a BIG DEAL.

P8:43:35 <vurtual> Well we DO get to wear clothes.
P8:43:43 <vurtual> But it doesn't matter, because YOUR DOGS WILL STEAL THEM.

P8:53:40 <Nuthen> Great game
P8:53:48 <vurtual> That game had a better plot than Battlefront 2's 501st campaign. And it didn't even directly steal from the movies.
P8:53:54 <PoF59> That game was damn awesome. What other game do you play as a GLOVE?!
P8:54:29 <vurtual> The graphics were decent and the gameplay was solid, with fairly well-balanced and distinctly different sides.

P11:53:45 <Animator> I'm sorry for your loss.
P11:53:50 <Xemos> no biggie
P11:53:53 <UncleBibby> do you think the new lego mmo will harp in on any of minecraft's turf?

P11:54:09 <mail2345> by modifinyg the hosts file
P11:55:06 <UncleBibby> I think the only major rival to minecraft in the future would be that indiegame "love"
P11:55:16 <UncleBibby> you've heard of it right?
P11:55:27 <setveen> meh, isnt that pay only
P11:55:30 <|||||||> HI XENU!
P11:55:35 <PuyoDead> I don't see why it's needed, and it's easily found through a quick Google search... but if you want to, I suppose so.
P11:55:39 <|||||||> I'M ALSO A SCIENTOLOGIST!
P11:55:45 <UncleBibby> it actually called 'love' right?
P11:55:54 <setveen> yea
P11:56:11 <Xemos> xenu?
P11:56:22 <UncleBibby> its the scientology diety
