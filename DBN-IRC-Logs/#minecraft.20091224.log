A1:11:45 <vede> DragoonEnRegalia needs to stop saying crap like oldfag.

A1:12:18 <vede> And butthurt.

A1:20:17 <vede> And GODDAMMIT I swear if I ever see DragoonEnRegalia as a nick here, I'm beating the shit out of him.
A1:21:46 <mail2345> why kickspam
A1:21:53 <mail2345> when you can mess with them
A1:21:57 <mail2345> votekick :D
A1:22:30 <vede> He seems to think that the "oldfags" (read: anyone who played Minecraft before he did) are all "butthurt" about Minecraft changing at all.
A1:22:52 <Annihilator> to votekick, type /msg <nick> votekick
A1:23:29 <vede> If he comes here, and if he says "oldfag" or "butthurt" I'm banning him.
A1:23:54 <Annihilator> yes
A1:24:19 <vede> Hell, if I can find any word he uses on /b/ ANYWHERE, I'm banning him.
A1:24:32 <vede> I don't care if it's a word like "I" or "the"
A1:24:52 <Shadaez> butthurt isn't a /b/ word
A1:25:02 <Shadaez> I've been hearing that since BEFORE THE INTERNET
A1:25:07 <Shadaez> just saying.
A1:25:13 <vede> If he says ANYTHING I'm banning him.
A1:25:25 <Annihilator> i support your cause
A1:25:41 <Annihilator> i must love thee
A1:26:08 <vede> It's gotten to the point where there's about two or three people that don't either LOVE DOCK SOOOO MUCH or HATE HIM AND WANT HIM DEAD.
13A1:26:27 * Cial sits back and watches the flames and rage
13A1:26:37 * vede bursts into flames.
13A1:26:40 * vede rages!
A1:26:47 <Cial> Dock seems like a nice person.. any one got marshmellos?
A1:27:06 <Shadaez> Marshmellows contain geletin, I doesn't eat dem.
A1:27:06 <vede> I *assume* Dock is a cool guy.
A1:27:16 <vede> But he just isn't here enough. :(
A1:27:39 <vede> We have a name, and we have some art, but we don't have a PERSON.
A1:27:49 <Visiiri> Shadaez, hehehe
A1:27:58 <Visiiri> wait, nvm.
A1:28:12 <Visiiri> I've lost the.. image I want to show you.
A1:28:17 <Cial> i spoke to him a bit earlier and from what i experienced he was a rather nice person
A1:28:44 <Visiiri> Vede, Dock was on last night.
A1:28:48 <Visiiri> He's very kind.
A1:28:53 <vede> Yeah, I know he was on.
A1:29:09 <vede> But I haven't actually seen him here.
A1:29:15 <vede> So for me he's still just a shadow.
A1:29:29 <Visiiri> He should be as active as Peerko.
A1:29:35 <Visiiri> He's the most active one in a while.
A1:29:38 <Cial> ....ok talking question anwsering shadows?
A1:29:46 <vede> Cial, for ME.
A1:29:57 <vede> Since I have never been on at the same time he has.
A1:30:06 <Visiiri> <Dock> MonkeyDKS: I'm playing around with options, but it'll be pretty flexible <-- the very top of my log screen
A1:30:42 <Cial> oh
A1:30:44 <vede> He should coordinate with Notch for IRC time.

A1:31:18 <vede> And I would say he should hang out, but I don't think that'd work, since you can only handle temperatures that high for so long.
A1:31:20 <Visiiri> Hey, guize, I've made this game called Minecraft
A1:31:23 <vede> He'd practically be roasted.
A1:31:24 <Visiiri> haz you pleyd it?

A1:32:14 <Visiiri> is a game

A1:32:20 <Visiiri> out of small blocks

A1:35:26 <vede> Evilgrim, just find "niels" in the user list and read through his posts.
A1:35:39 <vede> I defy you to find one that is coherent and intelligent throughout.

A1:38:42 <Visiiri> I'm just playing with words o.O
A1:38:44 <mail2345> anyway
A1:38:44 <vede> Until he was made aware of it, then went right back on.
A1:38:51 <vede> DAMMIT
A1:38:52 <Annihilator> then he's probably purposefully trolling
A1:38:55 <vede> DAMMITDAMMIT

P12:07:42 <citricsquid> not really, but that hurt my ears. I paused kanye for that.
P12:07:49 <Dock> I don't mind visiting the forums a bit, but obviously they're quite noisy
P12:08:01 <C418> usually I find random flash videos pretty funny
P12:08:03 <Dock> it's not appropriate for me to comment on all things, for example
P12:08:03 <Quatroking> there's a stoned kid at the end
P12:08:03 <C418> hrm.
P12:08:16 <citricsquid> Dock: they've got super active recently. 
P12:08:22 <Quatroking> I should upload my random loops

P12:09:09 <C418> haha :D
P12:09:21 <Quatroking> I did that one year ago when I was hanging out over at newgrounds
P12:09:28 <citricsquid> Dock: it's like the angry kids come out of the woodwork when any changes happen.
P12:09:31 <Quatroking> spamming accounts with racial slurs
P12:09:32 <C418> newgrounds is a terrible community
P12:09:33 <Quatroking> :D
P12:09:37 <Dock> yeah, it is to be expected
P12:09:38 <citricsquid> C418: fuck you.
P12:09:40 <C418> because of that for example
P12:09:42 <VurtualRuler98> newgrounds wants to to delete system 32.
P12:09:42 <citricsquid> :D
P12:09:51 <Quatroking> I got deleted by wade, twice
P12:10:01 <Dock> I suspect some of them will hate whatever I do, no matter what 
P12:10:11 <Quatroking> hmm
P12:10:14 <Quatroking> actually, vede, this is my best
P12:10:15 <Quatroking> http://www.quatroworld.org/stuff/flash/benny-the-movie-2/
P12:10:21 <Quatroking> at the end there's this black cat thing
P12:10:23 <Dock> and that's fair, to an extent. If they're very fond of the existing style, then of course what I'm doing is a detriment
P12:10:28 <Quatroking> I've made it for a collab which ended up dead
P12:10:37 <Dock> I'm certain that I'll face even more fury when I start doing the textures
P12:10:41 <Quatroking> I actually attempted to put effort in it
P12:11:13 <C418> ooookay
P12:11:16 <Dock> nevertheless, my goal, and my role, is to end up with a game which looks professional whilst maintaining the pixelly lo-fi style

P12:22:03 <Sean_TE> Stop questioning my ability
P12:22:08 <Sarevok> Hey there, I have a question regarding hosting a server, and it doesn't seem to be addressed on the forums (I've been looking)
P12:22:08 <Sean_TE> :P
P12:22:15 <Sarevok> could a server admin help me?
P12:22:20 <mail2345> but uhh sean
P12:22:26 <bildramer> maybe
P12:22:26 <Sean_TE> yea?
P12:22:27 <vede> just ask the question Sarevok.
P12:22:28 <mail2345> won't that cause verify-names issues :S
P12:22:29 <bildramer> what's the prob?

P12:22:52 <Sarevok> My brother is connecting to my server. I can see in my command prompt window that he connects.
P12:22:53 <mail2345> maybe it's a matter of timing
P12:22:57 <Sean_TE> only if more than 1 connect with same name
P12:22:58 <mail2345> set override
P12:23:01 <Sarevok> Problem is, it then boots him and says he needs to log in.
P12:23:09 <vede> Is he logged in?
P12:23:10 <Sarevok> But, he's logged in
P12:23:15 <vede> Hm, okay.
P12:23:25 <mail2345> did you set the override to on or off?
P12:23:30 <Sarevok> I have the verify names to false, cause it's a private server.
P12:23:31 <Dock> So, do you guys recommend any servers? 
P12:23:34 <Sarevok> Override, which one is that
P12:23:43 <vede> Sarevok, what URL are you using?
P12:23:50 <mail2345> dock, umm chairots
P12:23:52 <mail2345> and theone's
P12:23:54 <vede> And why have verify-names set to false?
P12:23:58 <Sean_TE> I have to override.
P12:23:59 <vede> That whole mess was fixed.
P12:24:00 <Sean_TE> XD
P12:24:01 <Sarevok> I read that could help.
P12:24:16 <Dock> the visitor-jail mechanic that servers use is quite strange
P12:24:16 <Sarevok> Either way, he's using the alternate link
P12:24:17 <vede> It was a problem with the server, but it's been fixed now.
P12:24:25 <vede> What "alternate" link?
P12:24:35 <Sarevok> When you go to the external url
P12:24:43 <bildramer> oh, the IP & port one?
P12:24:43 <vede> That would be the standard link.
P12:24:53 <Sarevok> it says at the bottom "You have the same IP as the host, click this if it doesn't work"
P12:24:57 <Sarevok> or something to that effect
P12:25:08 <Sarevok> he clicks that, it connects him on my end, but then boots him before he gets in.

P1:21:10 <bildramer> well
P1:21:12 <bildramer> your fault
P1:21:15 <Primis> whoops
P1:21:24 <Sarevok> yeah, it gives him a "Disconnected from server- Server is probably down"
P1:21:34 <bildramer> also, the browsers like FF and Safari that "fix" that should go die in a fire
P1:21:37 <Sarevok> it doesn't connect on my end either
P1:21:41 <vede> Is he in the same network as you?
P1:21:45 <Sarevok> yes he is
P1:21:54 <bildramer> lol

P1:22:01 <Sarevok> my laptop and his desktop are connected to the main computer.
P1:22:22 <Sarevok> by Wi Fi
P1:22:46 <vede> And if he tries to connect with the standard URL (as found in externalurl.txt) it says the server is down.
P1:22:51 <Sarevok> yes
P1:23:19 <vede> And what if he tries to connect with your IP and the port number?
P1:23:29 <Sarevok> you mean the same one I use?

P1:24:14 <bildramer> linking... :(
P1:24:17 <vede> So yours is normal, and his has &override=true at the end.
P1:24:22 <Animator> Eventually the entirety of the Minecraft will split into political parties due to player models.
P1:24:29 <vLK> I believe the *.zip is out of date btw

P1:24:36 <vLK> Primis will the Zip contain the latest revision?

P1:27:11 <vede> Which is...
P1:27:15 <Sarevok> should I turn verifynames=true instead of false
P1:27:20 <fenix|UE3> yep
P1:27:21 <Sarevok> You need to Log In
P1:27:24 <vede> Yeah, it should probably never be false.

P1:37:08 <vede> On Ubuntu, you press printscreen, and it opens a little window with a preview of the screenshot, and some options for where to save it, what name to give it, or if you just want to copy it to the clipboard.

P7:46:15 <LG_Legacy> Pitch black?
P7:46:19 <Shadaez> l2comma
P7:46:23 <rudoLF> Since we have tourches we can go to pitch black now
P7:46:29 <rudoLF> would make caves awesome
P7:46:31 <Snowman> I don't like the darkness
P7:46:35 <rudoLF> also luminescent mushrooms
P7:46:36 <Snowman> Will make my buildings look shit

P8:36:45 <PixelScrooge> XD

P9:28:17 <VurtualRuler98> I can ask to return the game apparently

P9:31:36 <VurtualRuler98> Evil Genius
P9:32:14 <PixelScrooge> lmao
P9:32:19 <PixelScrooge> its ok
P9:32:21 <PixelScrooge> its a good game
P9:32:26 <VurtualRuler98> I tried the demo.
P9:32:33 <PixelScrooge> if you like dungeon keeper
P9:32:34 <VurtualRuler98> But it strikes me funny with Valve's no-return policy
P9:32:40 <PixelScrooge> you will probably like evil genius
P9:32:41 <PixelScrooge> oh yeah
P9:32:42 <VurtualRuler98> I liked Dwarf Fortress.
P9:32:46 <PixelScrooge> i think they have to do that with eulas?
P9:33:08 <VurtualRuler98> And the demo for Evil Genius.
P9:33:10 <Shadaez> what does the eula have to do with returning it?
P9:33:28 <PixelScrooge> terms of use and stuff
P9:33:30 <VurtualRuler98> I have the right to return the game within 90 days.
P9:33:36 <Shadaez> oh
P9:33:53 <VurtualRuler98> If I get bug-charged 2000 bucks instead of 2 bucks, I'm okay.
P9:33:54 <Shadaez> I'm sure they have their own ToS/Eula that says that is null or something
P9:34:07 <VurtualRuler98> Valve had to go through great lengths to add the EULA thing.
