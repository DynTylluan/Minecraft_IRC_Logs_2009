10A1:27:49 * fleshBasedProcessor (chatzilla@72-161-154-241.dyn.centurytel.net) has joined #minecraft
A1:28:14 <fleshBasedProcessor> So I'm having some trouble trying to set up a server
A1:28:33 <fleshBasedProcessor> I used the port forward program linked in the server creation topic
A1:28:46 <fleshBasedProcessor> It seemed to work fine
A1:29:27 <fleshBasedProcessor> I even manually checked the configuration panel on my router to double check
A1:30:06 <fleshBasedProcessor> And I *think* I added the port to the firewall exceptions list
A1:31:03 <fleshBasedProcessor> but the port checker program says I have not opened the port and my feeble attempt to run the server anyway seems to support its opinion.
A1:31:56 <fleshBasedProcessor> I'm running this on *shudder* vista because the computer will just be a hunk of unused processing poser sitting around if I don't get this server running
A1:32:22 <fleshBasedProcessor> *power
10A1:33:04 * ctburley (Calin_Burl@c-76-31-27-58.hsd1.tx.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
A1:37:10 <fleshBasedProcessor> Hello? anyone here?
A1:37:43 <fleshBasedProcessor> why is there 54 users if no one is actually chatting?
A1:37:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Because we don't want to.
A1:38:08 <fleshBasedProcessor> OH HAI
A1:38:48 <potato> fff
A1:41:34 <fleshBasedProcessor> so is anyone actually able to help me with my problem?
A1:41:49 <TrueWolves> hmmm
A1:41:52 <TrueWolves> vista is a pain...
A1:42:04 <TrueWolves> do you use wireless internet?
A1:42:16 <fleshBasedProcessor> Yes
A1:42:56 <fleshBasedProcessor> When I actually try and get the server to other people it will hopefully have got it plugged into the router directly but right now it is a wireless link
A1:43:55 <TrueWolves> the router might be the problem then
A1:44:02 <TrueWolves> what are the router's settings?
A1:45:10 <fleshBasedProcessor> What setting exactly? it has wpa encryption and I think I got the port forwarding configured properly. It is a belkin wireless g router
12A1:46:43 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) Quit (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
A1:49:15 <TrueWolves> not sure my self, I just know it's my pain in the ass router that prevents me from hosting servers directly
A1:49:25 <TrueWolves> citric lets me use one of his though =3
A1:50:50 <fleshBasedProcessor> what server is that?
A1:51:09 <TrueWolves> TrueWolves' Huge Tree Map =3
A1:57:39 <TrueWolves> Though I'm closing it up for the night when I sleep
A1:57:48 <TrueWolves> so if there is no ops, you can't visit the awesome tree

10A2:01:37 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) has joined #minecraft
A2:02:31 <fleshBasedProcessor> is that the server with the 1024 high server completely filled with a tree?
A2:03:34 <TrueWolves> not completely
A2:03:46 <TrueWolves> and people (finaly) started biulding on it
A2:04:20 <TrueWolves> the tree is only 436 squares high, 500 of it is dirt/caves/roots/hiddenfunstuff and the top is clouds
A2:05:48 <liq3> TrueWolves, your server has a ghey spawn prison.
A2:06:30 <TrueWolves> oh, sorry about that
A2:06:34 <TrueWolves> It's normaly left open
A2:06:36 <TrueWolves> x.x;
A2:06:41 <TrueWolves> only shut when all the ops are gone
A2:06:56 <liq3> that's kinda silly...
A2:06:57 <TrueWolves> I'll log on so it's open for a bit longer
A2:07:00 <liq3> i mean
A2:07:10 <liq3> anyone could come along with ab asci hack and grief anyway. ;P
A2:07:14 <liq3> basic*
A2:07:20 <liq3> also, if you have a spawn prison but no ops...
A2:07:27 <liq3> you might as well just take teh server down entirely instead.
A2:07:33 <TrueWolves> I can't do that
A2:07:34 <LG_Legacy> So what ii miss this time?
A2:07:42 <TrueWolves> I don't own the server, I just get to run what I want on it
A2:07:44 <TrueWolves> it's citric's
A2:07:56 <liq3> TrueWolves: well, imo you should remove teh spawn prison.
A2:08:03 <TrueWolves> And we only have had 1 greifer who used hacks so far
A2:08:28 <liq3> You will lose TONS of legit players by having it up.
A2:08:32 <TrueWolves> the LAST time I did that liq3 I found floors mutaliated and at least 20 new potholes
A2:08:40 <liq3> lol.
A2:08:44 <TrueWolves> liq3, it's open when ever there is a single op
A2:08:52 <liq3> make me op? :D
A2:08:56 <TrueWolves> like, it's not even opened by the op, it's open just there
A2:09:10 <TrueWolves> ... Credadentionals?
12A2:09:26 * fleshBasedProcessor (chatzilla@72-161-154-241.dyn.centurytel.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
A2:09:28 <TrueWolves> (we leave the prision open as long as 1 op is loged on, which is almost always)
A2:09:43 <liq3> TrueWolves: I'm OP on Redshift's server. :/
A2:09:43 <TrueWolves> I have it open right now
A2:09:47 <TrueWolves> good enough for me
A2:09:48 <LG_Legacy> I'm going to beat the shit out of my ice cream company.
A2:09:53 <TrueWolves> in game name?
A2:09:56 <TrueWolves> liq3?
A2:10:02 <liq3> yeh
A2:10:33 <TrueWolves> no odd rules really
A2:10:54 <TrueWolves> just: no potholes, no pillars, you can biuld in a productive manner just about anywhere on the level
A2:13:26 <TrueWolves> I don't like spawn prisons, so I leave it open as much as I can, and at least make it have a nice view of the place
A2:16:18 <liq3> hehe
A2:16:25 <liq3> let me guess, if no ops on close the prison?
A2:17:01 <TrueWolves> well, I'd ask that
A2:17:22 <TrueWolves> did you find sponge hell/
A2:17:23 <TrueWolves> ?
A2:21:46 <liq3> sponge helL?
A2:24:10 <TrueWolves> get to the top of the map =3

A8:47:35 <bjzaba> checking out the link....
A8:47:52 <citricsquid> but I'd already played quite a bit before it tracked, so I have about 52 hours tracked on wakoopa and ~10/20 before, so I just say 60 :{

A9:20:39 <JTE> Bob Ross is painfully dumb sometimes.
A9:22:33 <bjzaba_> vdgmprgrmr: why would you use a honeycomb prison?
A9:22:47 <vdgmprgrmr> So you can have prisons that aren't supertiny
A9:23:05 <bjzaba_> ...
A9:23:14 <bjzaba_> that's all?
A9:23:16 <bjzaba_> :P
A9:23:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep.
A9:23:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Being in a 1x1x2 prison with three other peeps is UGLY.
A9:24:09 <vdgmprgrmr> And not being able to move more than a few centimeters is really not-fun.
A9:24:09 <bjzaba_> but people can glitch out cant they?
A9:24:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope.
A9:24:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Not with a honeycomb prison.
A9:24:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I will demonstrate.
A9:24:23 <citricsquid> haxk out though
A9:24:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Well yeah but you can hax out of anything.
A9:24:37 <bjzaba_> i think I understand now

A9:24:59 <vdgmprgrmr> The two known prison types.
A9:25:00 <bjzaba_> i can't play - sorry
A9:25:11 <vdgmprgrmr>  D:
A9:25:13 <bjzaba_> notch broke mac support :(
A9:25:30 <bjzaba_> end of my life
A9:25:38 <bjzaba_> well - not really
A9:25:47 <bjzaba_> haha
A9:26:06 <bjzaba_> but I know what your talking about, I think
A9:26:08 <vdgmprgrmr> The only big problem with honeycomb prisons is that they take up A LOT of space, but very little of it is actually open room.
A9:26:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Because the roof has to be at seven layers tall.
A9:26:38 <bjzaba_> wow
A9:26:42 <citricsquid> meh, can do them underground
A9:26:42 <vdgmprgrmr> minus the at
A9:28:01 <bjzaba_> so - if someone tries to glitch they'll just get popped into a cell above
A9:28:09 <bjzaba_> is that the idea?
A9:28:14 <citricsquid> bingo!
13A9:28:15 * JTE idles on cryzed's server, waiting for the inspiration of the day
A9:28:30 <bjzaba_> :D
A9:28:43 <JTE> I just break the admin blocks, no problem~ o.o
A9:28:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Not only that, but if they try, their spawn gets stuck in the small cell above. So they have to rejoin to try again.
A9:28:54 <bjzaba_> Im trying to build it in my mind
A9:29:02 <JTE> Cryzed's spawn prison is broken, due to the fact that you spawn underground. :/
A9:29:04 <bjzaba_> yeah - that's good
A9:29:47 <bjzaba_> so - the top layer would have two levels in a checkerboard pattern?
A9:30:03 <bjzaba_> to get them stuck alone?
A9:30:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, where the very top layer is the inverse of the layer just below it.
A9:30:16 <vdgmprgrmr> so you have the floor which is a big room.
A9:30:26 <bjzaba_> that's so cool
A9:30:29 <citricsquid> You can escape those though, saw someone do it without hacks before. Have to place the blocks really fast though.
A9:30:37 <citricsquid> they placed a block in a 2 cell space
A9:30:47 <citricsquid> took them about 30 spawns to manage it though.
A9:30:54 <bjzaba_> yikes
A9:30:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Nasty.
A9:31:14 <bjzaba_> I gues you know somethings up when someone's spawning that fast
A9:31:19 <bjzaba_> *guess
A9:31:33 <citricsquid> I've never managed it though, took him lots of effort and reconnects. Most people would get bored :D
A9:31:34 <bjzaba_> or that many thimes
A9:31:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I'd have banned him before he managed to do it.
A9:31:52 <bjzaba_> I guess its all about making it too hard for them
A9:32:07 <bjzaba_> you can't stop them
A9:32:24 <vdgmprgrmr> You can stop the average ones.
A9:32:32 <bjzaba_> exactly
A9:32:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is far better than stopping none at all.
A9:32:48 <bjzaba_> I'd love to see a tutorial on the prison
A9:32:59 <bjzaba_> so if you have the time...

A10:00:34 <madMonkey> omg i can't believe it
A10:00:50 <madMonkey> i just spent 6 hours making a huge structure on a server, and then i was inexplicably banned for no reason!
A10:01:00 <madMonkey> what the FUCK
A10:01:06 <citricsquid> =o
A10:01:12 <PuyoDead> sounds like a crappy server
A10:01:17 <madMonkey> you can't imagine how frustrating that is
A10:01:20 <madMonkey> omg!!!!!
A10:01:26 <citricsquid> which server?
A10:01:33 <madMonkey> ocean build
A10:01:49 <madMonkey> i was bombadil
A10:01:57 <citricsquid> want me to ask? :D
A10:02:00 <madMonkey> i made a huge underwater palace, then an enormous 8 bit mushroom
A10:02:13 <madMonkey> ya sure
A10:02:17 <madMonkey> name was bombadil
A10:02:21 <madMonkey> ask them why the hell i was banned 
A10:02:39 <madMonkey> they banned me just as i was about to take a screenshot

A10:03:47 <PuyoDead> no idea, I just got there a while ago
A10:03:52 <madMonkey> ya it sorta sucks but this was my first time playing ...
A10:03:57 <PuyoDead> I went there to see the amazing chaos
A10:04:03 <madMonkey> well
A10:04:03 <PuyoDead> it really is a terrible server
A10:04:05 <madMonkey> check out my huge mushroom
A10:04:10 <madMonkey> i made an underwater base as well
A10:04:11 <PuyoDead> both of them have been up for weeks
A10:04:12 <madMonkey> under the mushroom
A10:04:16 <PuyoDead> with wretched ops
A10:04:23 <madMonkey> is there a mushroom in the distance?
A10:04:25 <madMonkey> striped cap?
A10:04:55 <PuyoDead> hard to tell
A10:05:04 <madMonkey> it's fairly tall, in the far ocean corner
A10:05:19 <madMonkey> oh well my underwater base had been griefed already anyways
A10:05:27 <madMonkey> it was all glass :P
A10:06:35 <madMonkey> going to make my own server
A10:07:13 <citricsquid> madMonkey: you can Op one of mine if you like :D

A10:40:32 <Zuriki> One moment.
A10:41:20 <citricsquid> http://minecraft.net/skin/ONI.png exists, therefore he's premium. http://minecraft.net/skin/0NI.png doesn't, therefore he isn't.

A10:56:55 <PuyoDead> yea, I use windows xchat, and while there are some... oddities, I find it better than most
A10:57:05 <Adura> That build I linked benefits from the Perl plugin from the official build.
A10:57:12 <Adura> The exec plugin, too.

A10:58:09 <JTE> I like perl.
A10:58:14 <Bob_The_Builder_> perl ftw
A10:58:34 <Awol10> I was and probably still am a mIRC fan but since I rarely do IRC anymore I just use Trillian's interface for it

P12:33:15 <SteGriff> Question: Does IP ban also ban the account name?
P12:33:22 <TrueWolves> It shouldn't need a reset yet, let me check quickly
P12:33:27 <peerkoel> no SteGriff 
P12:33:37 <SteGriff> that's flawed
P12:33:43 <peerkoel> perhaps...
P12:33:49 <citricsquid> not really?
P12:34:03 <citricsquid> What if someone uses your account and you want to ban them?
P12:34:05 <citricsquid> you'd ban yourself.
P12:34:09 <TrueWolves> good thing about the level is it's size allows it to last quite a while with out needing resets, so the rare times I do ask for a reset, I'll throw in a new map to make the tree better =3

P2:21:36 <UncleBibby> I have a problem that won't let my mac use minecraft.
P2:21:43 <Azjherben> Well
P2:21:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Mac support is broken at the moment.
P2:21:51 <Azjherben> As you might have seen
P2:21:58 <vdgmprgrmr> It'll be fixed some time in the future.
P2:21:58 <UncleBibby> everytime I open minecraft my keyboard stops working
P2:22:11 <Azjherben> I'm trying to make a little scripting language
P2:22:17 <Azjherben> To make map making alot easier
P2:22:24 <UncleBibby> is notch aware of the broken mac support?
P2:22:25 <Azjherben> So anyone can make their own cool map generator
P2:22:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, I'm pretty sure he is.
P2:22:50 <vdgmprgrmr> What kind of map generator, asjherben?
P2:22:50 <UncleBibby> I really hope this bug is at the top of his list...
P2:23:14 <Azjherben> I'm sure Notch is *cough*getapc*cough* fixing the bug right now.
P2:23:31 <UncleBibby> I have parallel on my mac, should I use that?

P2:35:35 <Snowman> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=10528#p10528
P2:35:58 <vdgmprgrmr> From what I've seen, MOST of the games sold on the Wii have been marketed toward a younger (and older, like, "last game I played was on the NES") demographic, and was made with them in mind.
P2:36:03 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm anything buyt angsty.
P2:36:09 <vdgmprgrmr> *but
P2:36:30 <vdgmprgrmr> I would like to see a shooter like STALKER or Far Cry 2 on the Wii.
P2:36:31 <Snowman> Consoles suck anyway
P2:36:37 <Azjherben> .
P2:36:38 <vdgmprgrmr> And yeah, Snowman is right.
P2:36:41 <Snowman> :D
P2:36:42 <UncleBibby> we shouldn't argue, about games, I guess...
P2:36:46 <JTE> I just like programming for the Wii because it's simple and easy and requires no hardware on my part beyond an SD card. :)
P2:36:56 <UncleBibby> CONDUIT!
P2:36:57 <Azjherben> How does one program for a Wii
P2:37:03 <Adura> Buy a dev kit.
P2:37:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I said like STALKER or Far Cry 2.
P2:37:08 <Azjherben> DUR
P2:37:12 <Snowman> And you can throw the controller against the wall and say it's part of the game
P2:37:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Conduit looks Halo-ish.
P2:37:20 <JTE> There is a free dev kit.
P2:37:28 <Azjherben> ding
P2:37:31 <JTE> And they were even nice enough to port SDL to it. :3
P2:37:33 <vdgmprgrmr> STALKER and Far Cry 2 are both realism-based shooters.

P2:37:41 <Azjherben> [insert sound effect here]
P2:37:47 <UncleBibby> okay whatever dude...

P2:39:57 <vdgmprgrmr> There's the Wii which is obviously focused on a non-gamer demographic and there's the PS3 which obviously focused on the really "hardcore" demographic, and there's the X360 which...

P2:40:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Is not quite as focused as the PS3, but is still in that area.
P2:40:28 <JTE> SDL is for C.
P2:40:35 <Snowman> 360 is the best of the 3 though
P2:40:36 <UncleBibby> is saer short for skinny asian energetically running?
P2:40:44 <vdgmprgrmr> And then there's the PC, which literally can run every single gotdamn thing ever in the whole world.
P2:40:48 <JTE> You program for the Wii, 360, PS3, and other modern consoles using C or C++.
P2:40:57 <Adura> It'd be nice if the 360 wasn't so crappily made.
P2:41:00 <Azjherben> sarcastic ass eating robert
P2:41:09 <Azjherben> I can make things up too!
P2:41:27 <Azjherben> JTE, Intresting
P2:41:34 <JTE> And C is the backend for plugins and modules for nearly all scripting languages, including Perl, Python, and Java as well... so SDL can also be ported to them.
P2:41:35 <Azjherben> I wonder what'd it be like to make a game for the wii

P5:10:57 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> and survive in my little hut underground

P5:11:15 <peerkoel> don't worry, some griefer would destroy your shelter (and mankind with it) anyway
P5:11:19 <citricsquid> I've never learned to use it, so I'm copy and pasting shit from everywhere and it makes me rage :(

P10:05:54 <potato> it was before
P10:06:15 <fleshBasedProcessor> Do you have any idea how to stop the flooding?
P10:06:22 <potato> flooding?
P10:06:40 <fleshBasedProcessor> every day or 2 a rouge op would deleat the wall and flood half the map
P10:06:47 <potato> Rogue op?
P10:06:52 <potato> shit
P10:07:02 <potato> that's citric's problem i have no idea who the rogue op is
P10:07:13 <fleshBasedProcessor> I assume, or it was just someone with a deleat modcrete hack if they have those yet

P11:41:02 <potato> the new hell map
P11:41:05 <potato> has 2 levels
P11:41:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> heaven and hell?
P11:41:14 <potato> there is flatgrass on top and hell inside
P11:41:23 <potato> i suppose you could say that\
P11:41:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> potato
P11:41:31 <potato> i made a watervator
P11:41:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh
P11:41:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> that sounds much better
P11:41:48 <potato> out of modcrete of course
P11:41:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> so that should prevent flood?
P11:41:51 <potato> yeah
P11:42:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> even ops can't flood now?
P11:42:08 <potato> plus i put a layer of sponge sandwiched by modcrete in between heaven and hell
P11:42:16 <potato> well ops could flood
P11:42:30 <AnnihilatorBeta> well, you know how it happened last time
P11:42:39 <potato> was it a rogue op on the other hell map?
P11:42:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> no idea
P11:42:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> may be accidental
P11:43:14 <potato> get citric to deop everyone except the ones who were ops at the start
P11:43:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> last time i was on before it got flooded, those ops were arguing whether to have or have not water in hell
P11:43:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> so i guess it developed from that
P11:43:44 <potato> yeah
P11:43:49 <potato> lol, water in hell
P11:44:00 <potato> there's water in heaven so that argument shouldnt come up
P11:44:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> i told 'em it wouldn't be hell with water
P11:44:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> but they just went 'to hell with that'
P11:44:26 <potato> badap tch

P11:47:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> personally i think only citric should be authorized to op players

P11:47:26 <potato> marenkon was one
P11:47:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> citric should know about that though
P11:49:40 <potato> citric's hardly on anyway
P11:49:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> hardly?
P11:50:03 <potato> on the maps anyway
P11:50:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> he's always here on irc
P11:50:19 <potato> did you think i meant IRC?
P11:50:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> mostly
P11:50:24 <potato> usually
P11:50:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes, i always think of irc
P11:50:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> irc is delicious

P11:57:48 <g1real> Got a few name spoofers on the server here and since I'm not the host myself I can't turn verify names on

P11:59:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> wha
P11:59:27 <Dilt> so i'm not really sure what they're like now
P11:59:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> there's an annihilator who totally griefed a few servers?
P11:59:31 <Dilt> but when i left them
P11:59:43 <Dilt> they were mostly a large mix
P11:59:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm rarely on servers that i don't op on heh
P11:59:51 <potato> that must have been annihilator alpha
