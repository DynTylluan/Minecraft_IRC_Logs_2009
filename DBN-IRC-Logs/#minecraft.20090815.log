A12:00:02 <Super-Dot> Where does the domain stop and the host start?
A12:00:08 <UnknownX> Lol
A12:00:14 <Super-Dot> I don't want to ban everyone with a certain ISP
A12:00:37 <UnknownX> Super just use *!*@*
A12:00:47 <UnknownX> XD
A12:00:52 <TheOne> Um...
A12:00:54 <Super-Dot> I don't understand that syntax, either :O
A12:01:09 <TheOne> thats bad mmmk?
A12:01:10 <PuyoDead> host is the cpe.net.cable.rogers.com
A12:01:28 <PuyoDead> domain is everything after @
A12:01:36 <PuyoDead> that'll pretty much do it alone
A12:01:51 <UnknownX> Before ! Is their name
A12:02:10 <Super-Dot> Hmm, this client doesn't show me information that way
A12:02:14 <UnknownX> After ! Is their custom address thing (Usually their name)
A12:02:26 <PuyoDead> yea, it's nick!name@domainhost
A12:04:06 <mail2345|semi-afk> okay
A12:04:11 <mail2345|semi-afk> yea
A12:04:15 <mail2345|semi-afk> that is it
A12:04:23 <PuyoDead> eh?
A12:04:30 <mail2345|semi-afk> i was
A12:04:36 <mail2345|semi-afk> gonna say something
A12:04:37 <Super-Dot> My client gives me this: http://img329.imageshack.us/img329/1693/picture24d.png
A12:04:41 <Super-Dot> When I whois
13A12:04:43 * PuyoDead fixed mail's enter key
A12:04:44 <mail2345|semi-afk> but then I realise i didn't scroll down
A12:05:27 <Super-Dot> So what's that in nick!name@domainhost notation?
A12:05:33 <PuyoDead> ok, for that, my nick is first then ! then my username, then @ then my domain
A12:05:34 <TheOne> I got this for toast: [toast] (dongs@CPE002078cab8d1-CM000f9faa73a8.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com): pastry
A12:05:34 <TheOne> * [toast] dream.esper.net :Fri Aug 14 12:17:21 2009
A12:05:53 <PuyoDead> PuyoDead!Joe@cpe-24-210-151-151.woh.res.rr.com
A12:06:28 <Super-Dot> So the domain, and the thing I would ban, is cpe-24-210-151-151.woh.res.rr.com ?
A12:06:42 <mail2345|semi-afk> or
A12:06:45 <mail2345|semi-afk> if it is really bad
A12:06:52 <mail2345|semi-afk> woh.res.rr.com
A12:06:57 <mail2345|semi-afk> you will be banning an entire
A12:07:02 <mail2345|semi-afk> area
A12:07:20 <Super-Dot> Yeah, that's what I'm terrified about :D
A12:08:19 <PuyoDead> think of that whole domain as an IP ban (in minecraft) and just the part before ! as regular ban
A12:08:23 <mail2345|semi-afk> could be worse
A12:08:27 <mail2345|semi-afk> you could have
A12:08:33 <PuyoDead> just with it being a hell of a lot easier to change accounts, heh
A12:08:40 <mail2345|semi-afk> *!*@rr.com
A12:08:43 <PuyoDead> hah
A12:08:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> oh wait
A12:08:45 <TheOne> lol
A12:08:46 <mail2345|semi-afk> *!*@*rr.com

10A12:08:53 * Super-Dot sets mode: +b *!*@adsl-75-61-95-195.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net
A12:09:07 <Super-Dot> Cool, so my client bans what you described by default
A12:09:10 <TheOne> Could be real bad and ban everyone...
A12:09:14 <PuyoDead> that's good
A12:09:15 <mail2345|semi-afk> now
A12:09:18 <mail2345|semi-afk> really bad is
10A12:09:20 * Super-Dot sets mode: -b *!*@adsl-75-61-95-195.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net

A11:23:24 <ChJees> If Ores are rare they should yield maybe 2 units per block :P
A11:23:49 <Wirtualnosc> I think skeletons and zombies should be able to break blocks too. For example, when you're behind wall and they are on second side. They can't get you just by jumping, so...
A11:24:06 <ChJees> lol, no Pickaxe
A11:24:42 <Wirtualnosc> My old idea was about item that can break blocks. Without this item, you won't. But I think it's stupid idea :P

A11:41:57 <IceFlinger> What's the rate of falling in minecraft?
A11:42:06 <citricsquid> Notch is never away, he just hates you all and is too busy cutting himself over the pain of reading your terrible words.
A11:42:13 <IceFlinger> ;_;
A11:42:16 <IceFlinger> I'm sorry
A11:42:23 <Wirtualnosc> IceFlinger was talking about me.
A11:42:35 <ChJees> NOTCH

A11:43:00 <Wirtualnosc> O rly?
A11:43:15 <IceFlinger> Notch, what's the rate of falling in minecraft?
A11:43:26 <Wirtualnosc> It's a secret.
A11:43:50 <ChJees> Looks like the Inertia is 1
A11:44:11 <IceFlinger> It's around 56
A11:44:19 <IceFlinger> units/second
A11:44:22 <IceFlinger> units being blocks
A11:45:24 <citricsquid> It takes 15 seconds to fall down TrueWolves tree map. I think that's 1000 blocks high. So it, uh, is about 70 blocks a second, I think?
A11:45:28 <citricsquid> maybe 60, my maths sucks.
A11:46:06 <IceFlinger> My map is around 1012 units you fall, and it takes around 17 seconds
A11:46:22 <Wirtualnosc> I think it's 1024 blocks high, not 1000.
A11:46:26 <IceFlinger> That's 59
A11:46:34 <ChJees> Time for a well needed shower :3
A11:46:37 <IceFlinger> Iunno NOTCH
A11:46:40 <IceFlinger> PLEASE TELL US
A11:46:57 <citricsquid> Don't pester Notch :(
A11:47:19 <citricsquid> If he doesn't reply, assume he's busy and don't keep saying his name, he'll reply when he has a chance :)
A11:47:41 <IceFlinger> I asked already
A11:47:43 <IceFlinger> And yesterday
A11:47:49 <IceFlinger> and when he came back he didn't reply D=
A11:47:51 <Wirtualnosc> Citricsquid, Ice - Don't forget that speed is raising while falling.
A11:48:06 <citricsquid> IceFlinger: He probably didn't see it then. Wait for him to be around chatting then ask him :)
A11:48:07 <IceFlinger> ISn't there a terminal velocity
A11:48:10 <IceFlinger> ?
A11:48:27 <citricsquid> Rate doesn't change I don't think.

P12:19:22 <Visiiri> :D
P12:19:29 <Visiiri> That's good.
P12:19:29 <PuyoDead> Marach, again, clear java's cache
P12:19:36 <Visiiri> But who the hell would want to be me?
P12:19:38 <Marach> that doesnt help
P12:19:42 <r4dio> marach
P12:19:44 <mineguest> its not always intentional
P12:19:56 <IceFlinger> Guys
P12:19:56 <mineguest> sometimes you ghost yourself by disconnecting before the server realizes it
P12:19:57 <mineguest> etc
P12:20:00 <IceFlinger> Science has been done
P12:20:00 <Marach> i installed newest java version, creared cache twice, nothing helps
P12:20:01 <Siam> I'm getting a "Fatal error occured (5): null" whenever i try to play, what's wrong? :(

P12:20:10 <Marach> clear the cache
P12:20:15 <r4dio> maraaaach reply on query chat
P12:20:19 <PuyoDead> I got that exact same error Marach, and that worked

P12:20:30 <IceFlinger> 66 units/second
P12:20:38 <Marach> but ONLY with World of Minecraft!
P12:20:44 <Marach> all else works

P12:21:00 <VISIIRI> And your point is?
P12:21:02 <mineguest> if you cant resolve your issue with local cache clearing etc.. contact them directly
P12:21:03 <Marach> i know
P12:21:17 <mail2345|semi-afk> wom is a server from scratch
P12:21:19 <mail2345|semi-afk> ask triddin

P12:30:49 <ZomBuster> maybe an extension for custom skins?

P12:32:06 <Marach> what do you want to do with blocks that arent in newly created maps by nature?
P12:32:28 <Wirtualnosc> I think he will make tools for block making.
P12:32:38 <Marach> i thought about making a shop where you can sell spare blocks you collected and buy new ones
P12:32:47 <Visiiri> Yeah
P12:32:52 <Visiiri> A currency would be cool.
P12:32:53 <Wirtualnosc> For example, from stone block you will be able to make cobblestone by *yourtoolthere*
P12:32:55 <08Notch> ChJees: I don't know yet
P12:32:55 <mail2345|semi-afk> I think I forge fitss more
P12:33:12 <Marach> dirt - 1z gold - 10z :)
P12:33:25 <Wirtualnosc> z?
P12:33:29 <Wirtualnosc> gp is better.
P12:33:31 <Marach> nvm
P12:33:39 <Marach> im used to z
P12:33:43 <Wirtualnosc> lol
P12:33:47 <PuyoDead> zenny?
P12:33:48 <Wirtualnosc> I think gp is better
P12:33:48 <Marach> guess what game is it from
P12:33:53 <Visiiri> gp is gold points
P12:34:03 <Visiiri> and if the currency is anything other than gold
P12:34:04 <Wirtualnosc> Gold PIECES.
P12:34:05 <Visiiri> you fail
P12:34:08 <Visiiri> POINTS
P12:34:15 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm
P12:34:18 <Marach> i thaought that some blocks can inflict special effects to sombies!

P12:34:23 <PuyoDead> zenny is the only time I can't think of z being used
P12:34:29 <mail2345|semi-afk> gold. so you can melt gold ore
P12:34:40 <Marach> ie. purple block will inflict poison
P12:34:50 <Marach> blue block will freeze
P12:34:56 <Marach> what do you think
P12:35:05 <Visiiri> GOLD WILL DIE
P12:35:09 <Wirtualnosc> wat
P12:35:21 <Visiiri> But he's making weapons
P12:35:31 <Visiiri> Possibly you can make them out of blocks?
P12:35:44 <Visiiri> like 1 gold or 500 stone
P12:35:48 <Visiiri> or 1000 dirt

P12:37:39 <Marach> TNT?
P12:37:49 <fleshBasedProcessor> Notch this is my idea for a forge: you have a forge block. one face is for fuel (coal or wood), two for ores (so you can mix iron and coal), and the 4th face be the output (refined iron steel or gold piece
P12:37:57 <liq3> you guys are crazy.

P1:33:24 <vede> When I play TF2 I constantly am reminded of a game idea I had.
P1:34:05 <vede> The idea was a first-person game, where all the attacks you could use were onamatopoeias.
10P1:34:39 * Bellum (chatzilla@96.19.160.59) has joined #minecraft
P1:34:44 <vede> So you could use the WHOOSH attack or the KABLAM or BOOM or WHAP.
P1:35:01 <r4dio> and SWOOOSH?
P1:35:04 <vede> Maybe.
P1:35:14 <vede> A lot of the attacks wound up in a sort of tree.
P1:35:31 <vede> Like, ZAP was a more powerful version of BUZZ.
P1:35:44 <Bellum> I thought the forums were going back up on Tuesday or something like that. :'(
P1:36:27 <vede> And all the attacks would have you do something related to the sound. So "ZOOM" would have you move really fast, and a big colorful text-art saying ZOOM would appear behind you as you went.
P1:36:48 <vede> TF2 reminds me of it because the game (in my mind) had a graphical style similar to TF2.
P1:37:27 <vede> The whole game would look like an action scene out of a really colorful comic book.
P1:38:03 <vede> They were supposed to, Bellum.

P1:41:51 <r4dio> SWOTUNZPA
P1:42:31 <vede> You'd need like PTING or RATTATATATA for machine guns and bullets and such.
P1:43:36 <r4dio> and when you finish ammo, CHICK CHICK
P1:43:39 <r4dio> lol

P2:59:31 <Quatroking> and I'm not sure about the GPU
P2:59:50 <Visiiri> Mindfreak pwns
P2:59:59 <Quatroking> might be added later, if the intergrated ATI one can't run HL2 decently
P3:00:34 <liq3> Quatroking, if it was 300 Euros, I highly doubt the intergrated can...
P3:00:44 <Quatroking> Yeah, true.
P3:01:17 <Quatroking> then again, the shitty intel integrated gpu of my dad's pc can run HL2 at 50FPS
P3:01:24 <Quatroking> on lowest settings
P3:01:50 <Quatroking> but hell, I'll just make the best out of it
P3:02:21 <SteGriff> Sounds good, quatroking, about right spec for the price and year.
P3:02:42 <Quatroking> Yeah, its a decent PC for the price
P3:02:49 <Quatroking> plus I'm getting brand components
P3:03:16 <Quatroking> corsair PSU, buffalo RAM
P3:03:19 <Quatroking> exactly.
P3:03:35 <Quatroking> the HDD is a western digital, etc.
P3:04:54 <fleshBasedProcessor> My dad recently bought a rediculously overpowered computer. 4 core hyper threaded 12 gigs of ram and 2 high end graphics cards
P3:05:08 <fleshBasedProcessor> I can't wait to run HL2: EP2 on full setings on it
P3:05:11 <Quatroking> price?
P3:05:37 <fleshBasedProcessor> No idea, probably a lot. And it has a kick ass case with flames on the sides :P
P3:05:37 <liq3> flesh: pfft, it needs another vid card and another quad core. :P
P3:05:49 <Quatroking> TRI SLI BABY
P3:05:53 <liq3> :D
P3:05:58 <liq3> with 3 GTX 295s.
P3:06:13 <Quatroking> by the way, isn't i7 an 8-core
P3:06:18 <fleshBasedProcessor> liq3: I don't know what hyperthreading is, but somehow it lets the 4 core act like 8 cores. So it kind of does
P3:06:36 <liq3> im' pretty sure hyperthreading is more then one core emulation.
P3:06:37 <liq3> :/
P3:06:38 <liq3> or something.
P3:07:06 <Quatroking> and hyperthreading, wasn't that just throwing the cpu's power up when it needs to do heavy work?
P3:07:39 <liq3> dunno.
P3:07:46 <liq3> but according to wiki, it's basically 2 virtual cores.
P3:08:36 <Quatroking> right
P3:08:46 <liq3> i7 is a quad core that uses hyperthreading, so it has 8 virtual cores.
P3:09:25 <liq3> wow, there's an i7 that costs $1000 USD.

P4:36:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> std area?
P4:36:55 <peerkoel> or desert
P4:36:57 <mail2345|semi-afk> standard
P4:36:58 <peerkoel> I can't spell
P4:36:58 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm
P4:37:00 <mail2345|semi-afk> desert
P4:37:05 <peerkoel> lots of sand
P4:37:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> hmmm dessert
P4:37:15 <peerkoel> which means no tunneling
P4:37:17 <peerkoel> no water
P4:37:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> lots of desserts
P4:37:34 <vede> Desert should be a few layers of sand atop a large dirt base.
P4:37:41 <mail2345|semi-afk> or I  could load up a cool hiehtmap
P4:37:51 <mail2345|semi-afk> if I could find one
P4:37:57 <peerkoel> define cool
P4:38:15 <mail2345|semi-afk> interesting
P4:38:20 <mail2345|semi-afk> or prehaps
P4:38:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> awes
P4:38:27 <mail2345|semi-afk> something from rl
P4:38:50 <vede> That would be pretty shveet.
P4:39:16 <peerkoel> see if you can find a heightmap of Australia, Europe, the Rocky Mountains, etc.
P4:40:11 <mail2345|semi-afk> osici had one
P4:40:37 <peerkoel> there wasn't much gradient in that one iirc
P4:40:52 <vede> Yeah, there was only like three layers.
P4:41:00 <peerkoel> and it was all grass, no rock for mountains etc
P4:41:24 <mail2345|semi-afk> meh, i could fix those issues up
P4:41:28 <peerkoel> no sandy beaches, no white cloth on top of mountains
P4:41:29 <mail2345|semi-afk> maybe add some snow
P4:41:33 <mail2345|semi-afk> and beaches
P4:41:39 <mail2345|semi-afk> just do some replace alls
P4:41:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> 2d

P4:50:50 <vede> I thought so.
P4:50:57 <Plotty> Just started a server, but can't get in (as I should only be able to access w/ internal address, not external).
P4:50:58 <peerkoel> Plotty I run one behind NAT

P4:51:35 <peerkoel> I'm running a linux box router though
P4:51:36 <Plotty> The port is open...infact, a number of people connected quite quickly.
P4:51:38 <peerkoel> but sure
P4:51:49 <vede> But you couldn't connect, right?
P4:52:05 <Plotty> Righto.  Tried via the server/port connection type, but said it is no longer supported.
P4:52:06 <peerkoel> ok try http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565
P4:52:19 <peerkoel> substitute IP address and port if needed

P4:52:48 <Plotty> Ahh...how does changing verify-names false change things?
P4:52:53 <Plotty> Presume that people can pretend to be admins?
P4:53:15 <vede> It means people can imitate people, yes, but it needs to be off to connect without the external url.
P4:53:22 <peerkoel> the play.jps page doesn't have enough info to make the secure logins possible with the local IP
P4:53:43 <Plotty> Alrighty...give me just a sec...
P4:53:46 <vede> So if anyone wants to connect via IP, it needs to be false.

P6:37:30 <vede> Everyone who plays Minecraft is technically an alpha tester.
P6:38:01 <Jakkarra> okidoki then!
P6:38:25 <Jakkarra> also
P6:38:43 <Jakkarra> Wardrobe is a nicer word than Closet
P6:38:57 <vede> Not the same connotations.
P6:39:13 <Jakkarra> mostly are
P6:39:23 <vede> Not really.
P6:39:30 <Jakkarra> yes, i guess closet works for wall embedded ones
P6:39:32 <vede> "Came out of the Wardrobe" sounds weird.
P6:39:42 <Jakkarra> im english
P6:39:45 <vede> "Came out of the closet" however has meaning.
P6:39:48 <Jakkarra> sounds fine to me
P6:39:54 <Jakkarra> :P
P6:39:57 <Jakkarra> thats a phrase
P6:40:07 <Jakkarra> you can use silly words for those
P6:40:28 <Jakkarra> wardrobe is a more colourfil word anyway
P6:40:30 <vede> So coming out of the wardrobe indicates admitting homosexuality in Britain?
P6:40:33 <Jakkarra> *colourful
P6:40:38 <Jakkarra> nope
P6:40:41 <Jakkarra> ^^

P6:40:49 <JP89> Herro
P6:40:55 <vede> "Closet" is used to describe anything that's "secret"
P6:41:04 <Jakkarra> are it nao?
P6:41:21 <vede> A closet pyromaniac would be a person who is a pyromaniac, but usually only privately.
P6:41:30 <Jakkarra> yay FIAH!
P6:41:36 <JP89> I have a question about setting the motd that people see while waiting for the server to load.
P6:41:51 <vede> It's in server.properties, JP89.
P6:41:59 <JP89> How do you make letters/words into different colors except for white?
P6:42:02 <vede> Open server.properties with a text editor.
P6:42:07 <vede> Use color codes.
P6:42:19 <JP89> ...What kind?
P6:42:21 <vede> Color codes are like &0 or &6 or &f
P6:42:28 <vede> They go from &0 to &f
P6:42:37 <vede> 0123456789abcdef
P6:43:02 <Jakkarra> colour is awesome
P6:43:08 <JP89> Is there a list I can find that tells you what code corresponds with what color?
P6:43:15 <vede> So &0test will make "test" be the color of &0
P6:43:26 <vede> I suggest testing it yourself.
P6:43:51 <vede> &00&11&22&33&44&55&66&77&88&99&aa&bb&cc&dd&ee&ff
P6:43:53 <JP89> Well I don't really want to turn the server on and off for each one...
P6:44:00 <vede> Paste that into your motd.
P6:44:04 <vede> Test it, write it down.
P6:44:08 <vede> Close the server.
P6:44:14 <JP89> Oh, alright
P6:44:20 <vede> Suddenly you have knowledge.
P6:44:24 <JP89> lol
P6:44:49 <JP89> Thank you for answering my question, I wasn't sure about how to do it and I've seen certain servers do it.
P6:45:15 <JP89> Alrighty, well I'm out.  Thanks for the help :)

P6:51:18 <mail2345|semi-afk> seems like standard is prefered

P6:59:30 <Jeffman12> Been a while since I used an IRC
P6:59:36 <Evilgrim> Heehee.
P6:59:53 <Jeffman12> Anyways, I was wondering if anyone could help me out with a bit of a server problem
P7:00:00 <Evilgrim> I can try.
P7:00:19 <Jeffman12> I'm hosting one on a seperate computer from the one I'm trying to play on
P7:00:34 <Jeffman12> It's actually in the same room
P7:00:34 <Evilgrim> I do that. ^^
P7:00:46 <Jeffman12> I can't join my own server, but others can
P7:01:02 <Miclee> Anyone know how to play the game in third person?
P7:01:04 <Evilgrim> Hmm.. That doesnt happen to me..
P7:01:10 <Evilgrim> The usuall server is down message?
P7:01:21 <Jeffman12> Yeah
P7:01:35 <Evilgrim> Hmm... 
P7:01:57 <Jeffman12> When I host a Natural Selection server using Steam, I can join that
P7:02:09 <Jeffman12> So I don't think the problem is that I can't connect to it
P7:02:15 <Evilgrim> Ohh...
P7:02:36 <Evilgrim> Well to be honest I have no idea..
P7:03:31 <Evilgrim> D:
P7:03:52 <Jeffman12> I googled it, looks like the forums have an entry, but I just read they're down

P11:34:24 <mail2345|semi-afk> as in enough to glue modules together

P11:39:06 <vede> TrueWolves, there's a !trust command, to let free users in.
P11:39:20 <vede> So, you can !trust vede and suddenly I can join the server.
P11:40:26 <Amatsu> You could use a spawn prison.
P11:40:36 <Blade`Skydancer> He does.
P11:40:43 <Blade`Skydancer> The spawn prison that is.
P11:40:46 <Amatsu> Granted, it'll slow a hacker down for all of 2 seconds ,but then you know exactly who is hacking.
P11:40:46 <TrueWolves> Hia Blade!
P11:40:50 <Amatsu> And thus can ban.

P11:41:42 <Blade`Skydancer> Is there any way to make a server use a single-player map I made?
P11:41:42 <TrueWolves> Anyhow, I won't auto kick free users ever, as long as I'm home, I can undo almost any damage with just a half an hour of down time, or even 5 minutes
P11:42:37 <TrueWolves> 2 ways I can think of, ripping it off the java files while it's running, which I have no idea if it's even possable, or using Omen to recreate it

P11:49:43 <mail2345|semi-afk> it is not
P11:49:49 <TrueWolves> It's currently under the "sandbox" area
P11:49:57 <Maulrus> i'd consider it a game
P11:49:59 <Maulrus> it's fun
P11:49:59 <mail2345|semi-afk> game as in one with a goal

10P11:50:09 * Bradness_ is now known as Bradness
P11:50:32 <TrueWolves> Game's don't need goals, but most games that don't have a goal are under the "sandbox" genra
P11:50:38 <mail2345|semi-afk> "Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction"
P11:50:39 <TrueWolves> Minecraft is such a game
P11:51:05 <vede> No no, just "game".
P11:51:09 <TrueWolves> Goals can be self set player goals
P11:51:10 <vede> Does Minecraft fit the category.
P11:51:16 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm
P11:51:21 <mail2345|semi-afk> good point there tw
P11:51:25 <Blade`Skydancer> In the term of a "video game", it is.
10P11:51:26 * UnknownX (chatzilla@66.247.218.200) has joined #minecraft
P11:51:35 <Blade`Skydancer> It is a program made to be able to interact with a virtual world.
P11:51:37 <TrueWolves> If the game offers the ability to set your own goals, it may be sandbow, example: robot biulding games
P11:51:42 <UnknownX> Ok nevermind, I'll play tomorrow :/
P11:51:46 <Blade`Skydancer> Thus it is a video game in the loosest sense of the term.
P11:51:46 <TrueWolves> sandbox*
P11:51:49 <TrueWolves> yes
P11:52:29 <Blade`Skydancer> However, it is not a game in that there is no end goal. It's a toy.
P11:52:37 <Blade`Skydancer> Something that can be played with over and over and over again.
P11:52:38 <Blade`Skydancer> Like legos.
10P11:52:44 * potato (samthrashe@CPE000393e704cd-CM001bd71cdc30.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has left #minecraft
P11:53:04 <UnknownX> What?
P11:53:09 <Blade`Skydancer> A "sandbox game" is a game with a beginning and an ending that simply offers a huge world and a mostly nonlinear storyline.
P11:53:12 <mail2345|semi-afk> player defined foals
P11:53:16 <mail2345|semi-afk> goals*
P11:53:24 <mail2345|semi-afk> the player creates their own goals
P11:53:34 <Blade`Skydancer> No such thing.
P11:54:02 <Blade`Skydancer> Because if a player accomplishes this "goal" they set for themselves, does the game end for them? No.
P11:54:05 <Blade`Skydancer> Thus, there is no goal.
P11:54:13 <Peroggi> thus, nigger
P11:54:16 <marky> mail, do you know what is happening to darkes server?
P11:54:26 <Blade`Skydancer> >.>;
P11:54:35 <mail2345|semi-afk> no
P11:54:37 <mail2345|semi-afk> crap
P11:54:39 <mail2345|semi-afk> sshit
P11:54:47 <mail2345|semi-afk> probably bad
P11:55:06 <marky> i duno, last time i went on rogue op was still incharge even tho map was reset
P11:55:42 <TrueWolves> ...
P11:55:45 <TrueWolves> Damnit
P11:55:47 <Blade`Skydancer> In Infiniminer, the usual goal is to dig up X amount of money. But in setting up the server, there's a "sandbox" flag which makes all the blocks cost 0 ore, and sets the win condition to infinite(actually your team's money never goes up.)
P11:56:03 <TrueWolves> I wish I could get on to minecraft, this computer won't let me play past loading the server
P11:56:25 <Blade`Skydancer> Thus it becomes something you can play in endlessly, which is what a *real* sandbox is. It's a toy used for enjoyment.
P11:56:49 <mail2345|semi-afk> anyway, false alarm
P11:56:54 <mail2345|semi-afk> on flatgrass
P11:57:00 <mail2345|semi-afk> aslo I smell a troll
