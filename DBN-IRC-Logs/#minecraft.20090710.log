A3:33:56 <RaymondTracer> Also I need some help with skin customizing
A3:36:21 <Quatroking> er
A3:36:25 <Quatroking> what community page?
A3:37:07 <RaymondTracer> http://www.minecraft.net/community.jsp
A3:37:09 <RaymondTracer> That one
A3:37:29 <Quatroking> That would be Notch.
A3:37:36 <RaymondTracer> Okay
A3:37:48 <Quatroking> I don't see how that's going to help you with your skin tho
A3:38:05 <RaymondTracer> No thats a diffrent thing
A3:38:13 <Quatroking> Ah
A3:38:16 <RaymondTracer> just a misleading link on that page
A3:38:24 <RaymondTracer> Needs to be fixed
A3:38:49 <Quatroking> you mean the IRC link?
A3:38:55 <RaymondTracer> Yep
A3:38:57 <Quatroking> considering Notch isn't on THAT much
A3:39:12 <Quatroking> Its a working link tho
A3:39:29 <RaymondTracer> It leads to #minecraft/

A3:41:12 <Quatroking> What client are you using
A3:41:17 <RaymondTracer> HydraIRC
A3:41:20 <Quatroking> . . .
A3:41:25 <Quatroking> The shit is hydraIRC
A3:41:31 <RaymondTracer> i like it
A3:41:37 <RaymondTracer> I got sick of mIRC
A3:41:39 <Quatroking> I'm using both chatzilla and Xchat and it works fine
A3:41:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Nettalk is THE BEST mediocre irc client out there, I assure you.

A3:44:46 <RaymondTracer> Okay next thing; I cant use yellow when making my skin
A3:44:50 <RaymondTracer> why?
A3:44:54 <Quatroking> uh
A3:44:55 <Quatroking> you can.
A3:45:08 <RaymondTracer> I dont know why I cant then
A3:45:13 <Quatroking> What are you using to make your skin?
A3:45:31 <Quatroking> MS Paint?
A3:45:34 <RaymondTracer> Nope
A3:45:37 <RaymondTracer> CS4
A3:45:40 <Quatroking> Photoshop?
A3:45:40 <RaymondTracer> Photoshop
A3:45:43 <Quatroking> Ah
A3:45:51 <Quatroking> I use Ultimate Paint for my skins
A3:46:03 <RaymondTracer> I'll try that then
A3:46:03 <Quatroking> check if you're not limited to a palette
A3:46:09 <RaymondTracer> I'm not
A3:46:18 <Quatroking> Strange, considering the skins are 32-bit
A3:46:24 <RaymondTracer> Yeah
A3:46:45 <Quatroking> anyways, when getting Ultimate Paint, just get the freeware version, it doesn't have any difference except that it doesn't have adobe plugin support
A3:46:49 <Quatroking> which you don't need.
A3:46:57 <RaymondTracer> Okay
A3:54:41 <RaymondTracer> Ultimate paint works, thanks
A3:55:20 <Quatroking> Its the best tool I've seen so far for pixelart
A3:55:40 <Quatroking> and it looks oldschool :P

A5:23:14 <Marach> ...
A5:23:37 <cryzed> Marach: It _should_ work
A5:23:41 <Marach> is there a way to emulate a server so levels can be saved offline too?

A5:24:07 <cryzed> You can run a server
A5:24:16 <cryzed> But I don't know if it's possible
A5:24:23 <cryzed> to locally connect to it
A5:24:35 <Marach> maybe there are some secret server software...
A5:24:47 <cryzed> Quatroking: I lol'd, he talks like some kind of script kiddie oO
A5:25:06 <Marach> when saving it shows "compressing", so maybe there is only one file uploaded
A5:25:09 <cryzed> "might have an 8 year old from facepunch forums come here" -> He is probably refering to himself oO?
A5:25:21 <Marach> maybe even same format as multi levels!

A11:00:31 <Minerman> Making skins in Minecraft is a pain

A11:00:46 <ZomBuster> its like 10 pixels
A11:00:48 <Minerman> Especially once you realize how silly some stuff looks on the square shapes
A11:01:05 <Minerman> For example, exposed limbs
A11:01:09 <ZomBuster> oh I get it
A11:01:24 <Quatroking> zombuster: its 8x8
A11:01:26 <ZomBuster> yeh its hard to get what you want with the limited dimensions
A11:01:45 <potato> i like the pixelated textures
A11:02:15 <Minerman> I wish there was a way to do what KuroBit did with his skins, only in-game
A11:02:15 <potato> but i wish we could do custom models
A11:02:20 <potato> yeah
A11:02:22 <Minerman> a la: Custom blocky add-ons to the models

P4:19:22 <ZomBuster> nice

P4:19:24 <citricsquid> I have the waterfalll working perfectly, making a thread :D
P4:19:25 <SteGriff> these things need documenting

P4:29:22 <ZomBuster> for what
P4:30:03 <JTE> Minecraft lead me to a nice OpenGL implimentation for Java which works in applets.
P4:30:03 <JTE> I know OpenGL. I've used it before. I can make things with it. >:3
P4:30:43 <Animator> We could do chess and checkers on the same board.
P4:30:57 <Animator> To make things easier, the board could just be documented.
P4:30:58 <JTE> Heh.
P4:31:10 <ZomBuster> oh JWGL?
P4:31:13 <Prime_2> can you make SRB2 adjust the field of view so that everything remains aspect correct no matter what the resolution is? :E
P4:31:14 <JTE> JTE could script a minecraft server to help you play chess or checkers without cheating
P4:31:41 <JTE> But nobody cares about that, because JTE's not supposed to be making minecraft servers...
13P4:31:41 * JTE grumble grumble...

P4:31:52 <Prime_2> you aren't supposed to me making servers?

P4:34:32 <ZomBuster> I will make a square minepedia logo
P4:34:49 <Animator> I could photoshop one.
P4:35:04 <Animator> But I'm busy making a board.
P4:35:17 <ZomBuster> ill make a thread on the forums
P4:35:27 <ZomBuster> then people can make contributions
P4:35:33 <ZomBuster> and citricsquid can choose one
P4:36:05 <Animator> That sounds fair.
P4:36:10 <potato> i'll give it a shot
P4:36:15 <potato> what size should it be
P4:36:20 <JTE> Animator, is it 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3 blocks per tile on your board? :3
P4:36:43 <Animator> 3 by 3, of course.
P4:36:47 <JTE> Very nice. ^^

P4:39:44 <citricsquid> editing it a bit, if that's ok?
P4:40:01 <JTE> The SRB2 minecraft server makes a lot of use of hidden sponges, to the point where someone came from there and saw a sponge in my server and removed it with the intention of "hiding" it and accidentally flooded the whole thing. >.<;
P4:40:25 <Animator> Excellent, the board is complete.

P4:48:25 <UnknownX> i didnt know you could wipe a logo up
P4:48:28 <JTE> nya, ...
P4:48:41 <JTE> So okay now I can render a cube.
P4:48:49 <JTE> With proper lighting.. No texture though ...
P4:49:20 <Parthon> is there a spleef league yet?
P4:49:21 <citricsquid> jte: you could also have a "jail" so users could do "/jail citricsquid" if >75% /jail citricsquid I get but in a big unbreakable box :D
P4:49:41 <potato> stopping griefing is simple
P4:49:48 <potato> just shut down the server
P4:50:11 <citricsquid> :D
P4:50:53 <Animator> That should be done when there's some heavy griefing to the point where it's just all-out war.
P4:51:04 <Animator> That actually sounds fun.
P4:51:39 <Parthon> is there a spleef league yet?
P4:51:47 <JTE> Muh ...
P4:52:13 <JTE> citricsquid: I bet I could code my client to be able to break the unbreakable and the server wouldn't even penalize me for it.
P4:52:33 <citricsquid> Parthon: think so
P4:52:40 <JTE> Even if it does, I could still walk right through it.
P4:52:44 <JTE> Like it's not even there.
P4:52:48 <JTE> I can even noclip ...

P6:04:37 <UnknownX> YOUR NOT LISTENING TO ME
P6:04:48 <vdgmprgrmr>  D:
P6:04:48 <Animator> I made it off to try and be proportional to the top.
P6:04:57 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I mean, it
P6:05:00 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P6:05:02 <vdgmprgrmr> ERK!
P6:05:11 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I mean, it is off-kilter even with the top.
P6:05:16 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not slanted right.
P6:05:43 <Animator> I blame the shadow.
P6:05:58 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not the shadow, man.
P6:06:29 <vdgmprgrmr> unknownx, I think the only name for it is white cloth...
P6:06:29 <Animator> It's probably not centered enough.
P6:06:37 <UnknownX> its like 3 degrees off
P6:06:43 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not due to centering, either...
P6:06:50 <vdgmprgrmr> It's just plain not rotated right.
P6:07:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Or, not skewed right.
P6:07:16 <UnknownX> im not talking about the original block
P6:07:30 <UnknownX> im talking about what it's called now that he edited it
P6:07:35 <Animator> THAT IS THE ORIGINAL BLOCK.
P6:07:50 <Animator> It's just been photoshopped with Greek symbols!
P6:08:03 <Animator> To mock a wikipedia logo!
P6:08:06 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it's not the original block anymore now that you photoshopped it.
P6:08:11 <UnknownX> IT HAS TO HAVE A NAME
P6:08:19 <vdgmprgrmr> It doesn't have to have a name.
P6:08:23 <Animator> It's the wiki-block.
P6:08:27 <Animator> There.
P6:08:29 <UnknownX> im not accepting wikiblock
P6:08:40 <vdgmprgrmr> UnknownX, you're just being stupid right now.
P6:08:41 <Animator> THEN I'M NOT ACCEPTING YOUR ARGUMENT.
P6:09:07 <Animator> Argh, God.
P6:09:30 <Animator> I'm going to get rid of that shadow now.
P6:09:31 <Adura> Don't mind vdgmprgrmr, they're just intentionally annoying.
P6:10:08 <Animator> That explains it well.

P7:12:30 <stickzanimator> aaah
P7:12:36 <citricsquid> I'm not 100% sure of the plan, but AFAIK it's free until final release, after that free users will only get sandbox "demo", paid will get survival mode etc.

P7:59:31 <Eagle> Is it coincidence that he was writing my nick, or was it coincidence that my nick is that word that he was writing?

P9:50:06 <SilentJ43> so, what's multiplayer like?
P9:50:16 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno, but perhaps you should try it.
P9:50:22 <PuyoDead> loaded with servers with the word "PENIS" floating in the air
P9:50:25 <SilentJ43> a good suggestion.
P9:50:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course, MP isn't free, so if you haven't registered...
P9:51:02 <vdgmprgrmr> You'll have to give us your soul.
P9:51:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Ah screw it, I'm not in the mood for sarcasm right now.
P9:51:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Just go play an MP game instead of asking what it's like here.

P10:01:28 <Eagle> Their retarded poster thing made me think that they hated imageshack because it hosted pictures
P10:01:36 <Eagle> :/
P10:02:50 <Eagle> Maybe they hacked it because the word "hack" is in it and it sounds clever to highlight that fact?
P10:03:03 <vdgmprgrmr> ...

P10:06:44 <vdgmprgrmr> They're oddly noisy.
P10:06:49 <Eagle> They display everything in size 78 font
P10:06:53 <Animator> If you automatically type fast in Hollywood, you are automatically conisdered to be the greatest hacker of all.
P10:06:58 <Eagle> i.e. "UPLOADING VIRUS"
P10:07:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I know of no OS where resizing a window actually makes a sound.
P10:07:23 <Minerman> Anyone here mind modelling a skin I just made for me?
P10:07:29 <Rroff> on some motherboards using onboard it does :(
P10:07:48 <Rroff> you get a kree kree kree sound in the speakers as you move/resize windows
P10:07:49 <Animator> Oh, also I saw this ad in Imageshack that said free virus.
P10:07:51 <Eagle> Also in hollywood computers come built with everything needed to hack anyting
P10:07:57 <Eagle> anything*

P10:08:08 <vdgmprgrmr> They're all running Windows 95.
P10:08:17 <vdgmprgrmr> In real life, you know.
P10:08:20 <PuyoDead> I like when hollywood computers project an image of the screen on people's faces
P10:08:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
P10:08:34 <Eagle> "Monitors don't work that way!"

P10:09:02 <Rroff> I was on a ferry ( a big ferry ) the other day
P10:09:21 <Rroff> and there navigation computers, etc. were running windows me
P10:09:23 <Rroff> for real
P10:09:28 <Rroff> scary

P10:10:20 <Rroff> lol
P10:10:31 <Eagle> Darkebrz you'd be safer that way. XD
P10:10:47 <vdgmprgrmr> And all our game disks and such would immediately become massive stacks of floppies.
P10:11:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Because DVDs don't exist in Hollywood.
P10:11:19 <Eagle> I'd want the hollywood OS. The theme they have is pretty snazzy.
P10:11:26 <Rroff> I love the 72 point "Hack" buttons
P10:11:35 <Eagle> "NOW UPLOADING VIRUS"
P10:11:39 <Eagle> Takes up the whole screen
P10:11:54 <Eagle> In a big, flashing font.
P10:12:08 <vdgmprgrmr> No one can see this information ever again. *shoots monitor*
P10:12:28 <Darkebrz> A fucking AA battery cant power a space station

P10:13:19 <vdgmprgrmr> srsly
P10:13:22 <Animator> Because they can.
P10:13:24 <Animator> And will.
P10:13:30 <vdgmprgrmr> I would at least go for a D battery.
P10:14:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Or maybe they use AA since it would be hella difficult to hit the power core on their ship.

P11:35:53 <tempestdevil> don't understand why i can't host anyway, all my firewalls are off and i forwarded ports.
