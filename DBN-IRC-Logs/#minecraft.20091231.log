A12:19:11 <UncleBibby> so I've got an interesting psychological question...

A12:19:59 <vurtual> You may just ask it to know how people will feel being probed.
A12:20:03 <UncleBibby> the question is:
A12:20:16 <UncleBibby> What sexual fetish makes the most sense to you?
A12:20:24 <vurtual> boob fetish
A12:20:34 <vurtual> /question
A12:21:05 <UncleBibby> uh what does /question mean?
A12:21:39 <UncleBibby> okay whatever
A12:21:53 <UncleBibby> the fetish that I can understand the easiest is:
A12:22:02 <UncleBibby> (besides the obvious ones)
A12:22:18 <UncleBibby> body inflation
A12:22:23 <i300> lol
A12:22:57 <UncleBibby> ask me a psychological question!

A12:23:35 <Animator> Okay then, UncleBiiby.
A12:23:39 <Animator> *Bibby.
A12:24:10 <Animator> If reincarnation is real, and I'm straight (and male), if I were to be reincarnated as a girl, would I become a lesbian?
A12:24:35 <UncleBibby> sexual attraction is part of the body not the soul!
A12:25:03 <UncleBibby> at least thats what I think

He got banned after a while, and supposedly this got seen on the TV(who IRCs on a TV?).

A2:21:55 <derp> OK.
A2:22:02 <derp> wireless = 191 = static
A2:22:08 <derp> ethernet = 199 = not static
A2:22:10 <derp> don't ask me why
A2:22:14 <bildramer> er.
A2:22:35 <bildramer> "The computer behind the IP never changes its IP"? so what...

A2:30:37 <bildramer> pointers suck somewhat
A2:30:43 <derp> don't use them
A2:30:45 <vede> I just cannot motivate myself to give a single bit a of a fuck if x is an integer, or a pointer to an integer.
A2:30:48 <bildramer> Their only use I can think of is passing to functions.
A2:31:03 <bildramer> well
A2:31:12 <bildramer> if it's a pointer, just use *x
A2:31:12 <vede> Or if, say, myrect is a POINTER to a rect, or just a plain old rect.
A2:31:28 <bildramer> well
A2:31:28 <derp> lol you said a rect
A2:31:30 <derp> lololol
A2:31:43 <bildramer> giving a rect to a function will send the whole rect
A2:31:48 <vede> The thing is, I've got myself into a situation where something (apparently) has to be both a pointer AND NOT A POINTER AT THE SAME TIME.
A2:31:53 <bildramer> a pointer is just an int.
A2:32:00 <bildramer> AARGH.

A4:58:18 <HAL9000> I'm looking at PCs better than the one he's buying.
A4:58:21 <HAL9000> and they're cheaper
A4:58:50 <HAL9000> Is the tower all you're getting?
A4:58:53 <HAL9000> no monitor, etc
A4:58:56 <Marach> yes
A4:59:12 <Marach> haha i hope old ones work :D
A4:59:16 <Quatroking> and this is going to be your main pc
A4:59:22 <Marach> YES, WHY?

A4:59:29 <Quatroking> Marach
A4:59:31 <Quatroking> what
A4:59:32 <Quatroking> the
A4:59:33 <Quatroking> fuck
A4:59:36 <Marach> this isnt better
A4:59:41 <Quatroking> do you know anything about computers at all
A4:59:42 <HAL9000> Yes it is.
A5:00:19 <Marach> i dont want shipping from other side of earth
A5:00:47 <Quatroking> build your own
A5:01:36 <Marach> i dont use pc for gaming (other than minecraft)
A5:01:38 <HAL9000> Quatro, he can't build his own. He doesn't have that much.
A5:02:16 <AndrewPH> Building your own pc is cheaper
A5:02:19 <Marach> i had much worse pcs and i know how to get the most of them
A5:02:27 <AndrewPH> Marach, ibuypower.com
A5:02:33 <Marach> ie. fitting 2 operating systems on 30bg HD
A5:02:38 <Marach> gb*
A5:02:39 <HAL9000> guys, he has less than $200
A5:03:08 <AndrewPH> HAL9000, and?
A5:03:18 <Quatroking> save up money
A5:03:19 <Marach> while other people have cluttered desktops and 500 gb of junk
A5:03:19 <AndrewPH> Buying a dell is probably the WORST thing he could do.
A5:03:24 <HAL9000> ibuypower is not the place to be sending him
A5:03:35 <Quatroking> Marach, don't buy a new pc and save up money
A5:03:38 <Quatroking> really
A5:03:49 <AndrewPH> HAL9000, yes sending him to a site that can let him build pcs for under $200 isn't a good idea
A5:03:50 <AndrewPH> yes yes 
A5:03:53 <AndrewPH> of course not
A5:03:54 <Marach> I DONT NEED A BETTER PC
A5:03:56 <Marach> REALLY
A5:03:58 <Quatroking> besides these intel GMA cards can't even run goddamn HL2
A5:04:08 <Marach> i dont want to play HL2!
A5:04:30 <Marach> i just want minecraft and gcc
A5:04:34 <AndrewPH> If you want the most for your money, build it yourself or use a not-expensive computer building site
A5:04:55 <AndrewPH> Because if you get a dell you're really getting ripped off
A5:04:56 <Quatroking> go buy a thinclient
A5:05:02 <Smashing> $200 for an entire computer? Yea, save up for $500 and do it right the first time
A5:05:18 <Marach> I DONT ANT WONT NEED A BETTER COMPUTER
A5:05:31 <AndrewPH> MARACH
A5:05:32 <Smashing> dont be stupid
A5:05:36 <HAL9000> Join the Master Race Marach.
A5:05:37 <AndrewPH> STOP BEING NOT SMART
A5:05:43 <HAL9000> You're computer commands you to.
A5:05:44 <Quatroking> hey guys
A5:05:46 <Quatroking> ima go and buy
A5:05:49 <Quatroking> atari 2600
A5:05:49 <Marach> stop stopping listening!
A5:05:51 <HAL9000> *Your
A5:06:01 <AndrewPH> Marach, if you get a dell you aren't getting your money's worth
A5:06:06 <Quatroking> and use it for processing purposes!!!!!!
A5:06:13 <Marach> ...
A5:06:19 <HAL9000> Sounds cool Qutro.
A5:06:22 <HAL9000> *Quatro
A5:06:47 <Marach> i could just save $330 and buy a Pnadora
A5:06:50 <AndrewPH> Marach, do you already have a mouse and keyboard
A5:06:51 <Marach> Pandora*
A5:06:58 <Marach> AndrewPH: lol yes
A5:07:08 <AndrewPH> and speakers?
A5:07:23 <Marach> i think
A5:07:30 <Marach> i dont listen to music on pc
A5:07:34 <Marach> anyway
A5:07:38 <HAL9000> >_>
A5:07:40 <HAL9000> What?
A5:07:58 <HAL9000> So you're intentionally screwing yourself?
A5:08:09 <Marach> what?
A5:08:17 <AndrewPH> Cheapest pre-configuring amd is $419
A5:08:23 <AndrewPH> It could probably play most games pretty well
A5:08:27 <AndrewPH> I can make that cheaper probably
A5:08:45 <HAL9000> I like marach. eh's a retard and doesn't afraid of Dell.
13A5:09:04 * Marach understands Visiiri
13A5:09:13 * Quatroking facepalms
A5:09:18 <HAL9000> We're actually trying to help you.
13A5:09:37 * HAL9000 tries to Open Marach's eyes to the world of better PCs.
A5:09:52 <Marach> what i would need a better pc for?
A5:10:00 <AndrewPH> Anything
A5:10:00 <HAL9000> Anything and everything.
A5:10:07 <Marach> in example?
A5:10:09 <HAL9000> You may not think you want it now.
A5:10:10 <AndrewPH> Seriously having a better pc is better in all cases
A5:10:18 <HAL9000> But when a game comes out you're interested in.
A5:10:26 <HAL9000> You'll be kicking yourself that you can't play it.
A5:10:29 <AndrewPH> Shit will start faster
A5:10:33 <AndrewPH> Minecraft will run better
A5:10:40 <AndrewPH> Youtube will play smoother
A5:10:42 <AndrewPH> etc etc
A5:10:47 <HAL9000> And just think when MC does have much bigger maps.
A5:10:53 <HAL9000> You'll actually not be lagging.
A5:11:01 <Marach> i dont watch youtube on my own @_@
A5:11:09 <HAL9000> How old are you?
A5:11:19 <Marach> ...
A5:11:21 <Smashing> marach, just buy whatever you want, you clearly are beyond logic
A5:11:45 <AndrewPH> If you feel like saving up $370, I configgerd a nice little custom pc that could play a lot of games fairly well.
A5:12:15 <Marach> i play games on handhelds
A5:12:23 <AndrewPH> Games include minecraft
A5:12:25 <Marach> and when i dont, i play games on emulators on handhelds
A5:12:44 <HAL9000> Well with a good PC you can emulate even better.
A5:12:45 <Smashing> AndrewPH, dont bother
A5:12:46 <Marach> and minecraft WILL work on this
A5:12:56 <HAL9000> You hope.
A5:12:59 <Marach> yes
A5:13:00 <Marach> :/
A5:13:11 <HAL9000> Now you understand the dilemna
A5:13:12 <AndrewPH> Let's put it this way: Do you want to get $100 worth of hardware in a $500 bundle from dell, or do you want a nice little $370 bundle.
A5:13:49 <Quatroking> let's put it this way: have a used condom for 30 cents or have a brand new one with free lube for 2 dollers
A5:13:54 <Quatroking> which one do you choose
A5:14:02 <AndrewPH> Or
A5:14:03 <Marach> i checked some other pcs from same website and this one has best power/price
A5:14:09 <AndrewPH> Have a condom with tons of holes for $2
A5:14:16 <Quatroking> dell doesn't have power
A5:14:18 <Quatroking> silly
A5:14:24 <AndrewPH> or have a nice condom with tons of free lube for $2.50
A5:14:28 <Quatroking> also their support sucks dick
A5:14:34 <AndrewPH> Dell is overprice
A5:14:35 <AndrewPH> d
A5:14:36 <Marach> lol support
A5:14:36 <AndrewPH> over
A5:14:37 <AndrewPH> priced
A5:15:08 <Quatroking> support as in "the monitor that came in last week broke again, send me a new one please" "we don't wanna"
A5:15:11 <Marach> turned out im an unintentional troll.
A5:15:20 <Marach> i dont buy a monitor
A5:15:28 <Marach> the one i have is 11 years old
13A5:15:35 * Smashing facepalms

A5:15:45 <AndrewPH> seriously
A5:15:47 <Marach> no
A5:15:54 <Marach> i dont need a new monitor
A5:15:55 <Quatroking> My monitorS are less than one year old
A5:15:57 <Marach> I
A5:15:57 <AndrewPH> the ___ that came in last week broke again, send me a new one please
A5:15:58 <Marach> DONT
A5:15:59 <Marach> NEED
A5:16:03 <Quatroking> yes, monitors
A5:16:08 <AndrewPH> goddamnit marach you're retarded
A5:16:13 <HAL9000> My monitor is 3 years old.
A5:16:14 <Smashing> i have a 28" monitor and i love it
A5:16:21 <Quatroking> I DON'T NEED A COMPUTER THAT IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING A PROGRAM
A5:16:21 <HAL9000> But it has EVERYTHING, except HDMI
A5:16:30 <Quatroking> I JUST WANT A COMPUTER BECAUSE I LIKE THE LEDS AND THE BEEPS
A5:16:34 <Marach> i dont need everything
A5:16:35 <HAL9000> XD
A5:16:46 <Marach> i need it to work
A5:16:47 <AndrewPH> Marach, I'm trying to be nice, but you're just being retarded
A5:16:51 <AndrewPH> Dell doesn't work
A5:16:54 <AndrewPH> let's put it that way
A5:16:57 <AndrewPH> Dell sucks
A5:17:01 <Marach> lets check
A5:17:03 <AndrewPH> Dell is overpriced by %500
A5:17:08 <Smashing> marach i have it figured out
A5:17:11 <Quatroking> Dell = Hell
A5:17:19 <Smashing> Marach you need to buy a mac, it is a computer made especially for stupid people
A5:17:19 <AndrewPH> Dell = <_>
10A5:17:23 * smn`offline is now known as smn

A5:18:36 <Smashing> i build myself so i rarely look at companies
A5:18:40 <AndrewPH> Seriously anything better would be great
A5:18:50 <AndrewPH> Marach probably wouldn't be able to use ibuypower
A5:18:53 <AndrewPH> :|
A5:18:56 <Smashing> when i do suggest a computer, it is usually dell so i dont have to "help" fucking family every time they fuck up
A5:19:20 <Marach> i dont fuck up.
A5:19:29 <AndrewPH> You want a dell
A5:19:31 <AndrewPH> you did fuck up
A5:19:34 <AndrewPH> .
A5:19:41 <Smashing> AndrewPH, dell is good for really stupid people
A5:19:50 <Smashing> cause even though their tech sucks, it is better than anyone else
A5:19:50 <Siiseli> Marach will fuck up buying his compiter
A5:19:52 <Siiseli> omputer
A5:19:53 <Smashing> which is sad
A5:19:54 <Siiseli> computer*
A5:20:01 <Siiseli> just becuase he buys an old computer
A5:20:04 <Quatroking> marach will even fuck up unpacking the box

A7:12:04 <HAL9000> vede we need you.
A7:12:31 <AndrewPH> HAL9000, I query'd you btw
A7:12:59 <Ten_Tacles> Hal9000 is a BIG fucking fag

A7:13:31 <Ten_Tacles> you think so?
A7:13:46 <TVC> can someone scale up an image for me without it blurring?
A7:13:46 <Marach> you insulted his companion-in-trolling
A7:13:54 <Marach> he does think so
A7:14:06 <Ten_Tacles> of course
A7:14:16 <Ten_Tacles> trolls hold together

A7:19:39 <HAL9000> I wish you would have saved your device workview
A7:19:41 <AndrewPH> ohai xemos
A7:19:47 <HAL9000> do you even remember what you used?
A7:19:49 <Xemos> so yeah i just got an attmpted DoS attack
A7:19:51 <AndrewPH> HAL9000, It was a bunch of random ones
A7:19:56 <HAL9000> oh.
A7:20:02 <AndrewPH> from that idiot kaitou I presume?
A7:20:06 <HAL9000> Yeah Xemos, I get those a lot.
A7:20:10 <Xemos> AND he has a hack that can no clip and strip maps from top to bottom
A7:20:15 <HAL9000> It means you're doing something right.
A7:20:20 <AndrewPH> Just blacklist his IP
A7:20:24 <AndrewPH> using your router
A7:20:27 <Xemos> litterally remove layers of the map
A7:20:35 <Xemos> he is changing his ip
A7:20:36 <HAL9000> That's new.
A7:20:39 <Xemos> BUT i got his isp
A7:20:42 <AndrewPH> blacklist the range
A7:20:46 <AndrewPH> :|
A7:20:46 <Xemos> anyone live in england and can give a nice call
A7:21:00 <AndrewPH> wait
A7:21:07 <AndrewPH> does the company have a 1-800 number
A7:21:09 <HAL9000> Most of the hacks I've seen are coming for the Qwest in Dallas
A7:21:18 <HAL9000> *coming from
A7:21:30 <AndrewPH> If they have a 1-800 number you can call them using skype
A7:21:33 <Xemos> if it in qwest, you can call them, i know they personally drop users who use them to hack :)
A7:22:06 <Xemos> and no, they dont have 1-800 they are in england
A7:22:10 <HAL9000> I'm not sure if Qwest is Dynamic or Static though
A7:22:15 <AndrewPH> HAL9000, both
A7:22:18 <AndrewPH> I have Quest
A7:22:20 <AndrewPH> qwest
A7:22:24 <HAL9000> Well that doesn't help then. =/

A7:22:38 <AndrewPH> :D
A7:22:43 <HAL9000> I'm pretty sure he's using Dynamic IPs
A7:22:46 <AndrewPH> just blacklist the range
A7:23:02 <Xemos> he is using a proxy im sure of it
A7:23:04 <HAL9000> I would but it extends from 67.x.x.x to 71.x.x.x
A7:23:16 <AndrewPH> that's not dynamic ips
A7:23:17 <Xemos> he has logged from 3 different class B addresses
A7:23:21 <AndrewPH> that's proxies
A7:23:31 <HAL9000> I've trace routed them.
A7:23:35 <Xemos> 71, 77, and 82
A7:23:42 <HAL9000> They all originate in Dallas
A7:24:04 <AndrewPH> one of qwests centers is in dallas
A7:24:15 <AndrewPH> so uhh
A7:24:19 <AndrewPH> It could be any number of people
A7:24:25 <HAL9000> Like I said.
A7:24:35 <HAL9000> blacklisting all of qwest would be a huge number of IPs
A7:24:51 <AndrewPH> inludin my
A7:24:52 <Xemos> which is why passive fixing wont work
A7:25:00 <Xemos> im on a mission to get him in legal trouble
A7:25:03 <HAL9000> Xemos, MAC addresses can be spoofed

A9:27:25 <08Notch> or just armor and hand
A9:27:27 <byte[]> or "is there an alternative?"

P3:58:12 <gordenfreechmen> its not supposed to be useful
P3:58:13 <SMP> Uh Notch? At fist I thought my problem was with indev. It would freeze after moving 1 step. I just tested it in SP, and it does the same thing. I'm playing this on Chrome. When I use the WOM client, everything works fine. Any idea what's going on?
P3:58:13 <Zuriki> It's still useless
P3:58:25 <Marach> omg ban
P3:58:26 <Zuriki> I was playing on Chrome
P3:58:30 <Zuriki> Works for me
P3:58:36 <PuyoDead> SMP, does it go back to normal when you alt-tab?
P3:58:42 <charrr> I found a lol worthy glitch
P3:58:44 <gordenfreechmen> zuriki, i saw some of your pixel art
P3:58:49 <gordenfreechmen> have you played gang garrison 2 before
P3:58:50 <SMP> i press escape and after a while, it brings upt he menu
P3:58:53 <SMP> from there everything runs fine
P3:58:58 <SMP> but when i get back in game, freeze
P3:58:58 <PuyoDead> Also, does moving with only the keyboard or mouse run normal?
11P3:59:01 <DBN> hey Notch, still waiting on you to fix the timing bug in the minecraft server :P
P3:59:07 <SMP> yeah i can move the mouse around
P3:59:08 <SMP> and look
P3:59:13 <SMP> but moving with the keyboard causes the lock
11P3:59:16 <DBN> it messes up my radio stream on the same server
P3:59:25 <PuyoDead> Hmm, that's how it acts under Chrome with me, too.
P3:59:31 <rcfighter> . . . I just turned water into wood.
P3:59:39 <SMP> gah
P3:59:41 <rcfighter> o_O
P3:59:42 <SMP> D:
P3:59:55 <PuyoDead> I can move around, and look around, but not at the same time.

P4:00:01 <gordenfreechmen> hi
P4:00:06 <rcfighter> hi :P
P4:00:10 <PuyoDead> If I do, it freezes, and I have to alt-tab away to get it back.

P4:02:54 <gordenfreechmen> i have to make an embarassing picture of notch
P4:02:59 <Meizlizard> Notch, could you change the button for arrows? On a mac you have to press Alt-Tab instead of just tab, which is really awkward.
P4:02:59 <Griob> Hey marach.
P4:03:19 <Marach> it will be changeable

P4:06:30 <Kimd41> Notch, make item pickup like this: you look at the objects you want to pickup and press E
P4:06:42 <vurtual> I'll be able to bind it to F, right?
P4:06:44 <Wolfgang132> i just burried the whole map in a cuten of wood
P4:06:45 <Wolfgang132> thow
P4:06:48 <Wolfgang132> how*
P4:06:54 <Kimd41> that way the player will pickup the object he wants 
P4:06:56 <Kimd41> easily
P4:07:19 <Kimd41> thats my suggestion btw, not a command :p
P4:07:19 <vurtual> Make it on release optionally, and client-change the object to outlined/glowing or something.
P4:07:21 <Drakkar> needs an infinity engine style loot dialogue
P4:07:26 <Drakkar> like

P4:07:38 <Drakkar> hit loot all
P4:07:39 <Drakkar> tada
P4:07:44 <asiekierka> Notch: Could you turn rain to fireworks for the whole of 01/01/2010 in the public SP/MP build?
P4:08:07 <Kimd41> also, to drop objects, we could press G
P4:08:18 <Kimd41> basically, look at objects and press E to pickup, press G to drop
P4:08:28 <Drakkar> g would make more sense for getting and d for drop
P4:08:35 <Drakkar> except people use wasd
P4:08:37 <Drakkar> silly wasders

P5:12:47 <Marach> suicide builder?
P5:12:48 <08Notch> Leonardo: Well, it was mostly in my head. But; rearrangable items, add support for non-tile items (that was a big one), add the ability to drop items, and reintroduce the ability to pick up items in the new client
P5:12:50 <Luminaflare> Notch I have some suggestions about the TNT
P5:12:59 <Xemos[AFK]> shift drop or shift move should allow a nuymber of items to be moved
P5:13:04 <Luminaflare> I had the idea a while ago but messing around with it on the indev reminded me
P5:13:05 <gordenfreechmen> well i gonna go
P5:13:07 <Leonardo> So Minecraft is turning into an RPG, no more Sandbox?
P5:13:12 <gordenfreechmen> bye
P5:13:15 <08Notch> sandbox will stay as an option. =)
P5:13:16 <asiekierka> Sandbox will always be there
P5:13:19 <Sean_TE> Survival mode would be rpgish

P5:13:43 <gordenfreechmen> by the way notch add dynamic lighting to creative mode

P5:13:45 <gordenfreechmen> please :(

P5:24:39 <Sean_TE> A scripting language
P5:24:47 <Leonardo> And why on Minecraft?
P5:25:03 <Sean_TE> For servers (and meaby SP maps?)
P5:25:05 <Daroh> so servers can script their own items/gamemodes etc
P5:25:07 <Luminaflare> Lua is a scripting language
P5:25:09 <Daroh> i presume

P5:29:41 <asiekierka> no, i didn't drink
P5:29:43 <asiekierka> too young to do so
P5:29:47 <asiekierka> i'm just sleepy
P5:29:52 <Leonardo> Sleep SAND?
P5:29:54 <asiekierka> after not sleeping well for 8 days in a row
P5:29:55 <emgmod> Notch, did you see my version of Apocalypse Flats in indev?
P5:29:56 <asiekierka> yes
P5:30:10 <asiekierka> sleep sand as in the unknown force wanting you to go to sleep already
P5:30:10 <Leonardo> I hate stores who think its still Christmas.
P5:30:11 <08Notch> no, I didn't
P5:30:11 <Leonardo> XD
P5:30:12 <asiekierka> this causes me to be more subliminally affected
P5:30:27 <asiekierka> just don't use it to control me! :)

P5:31:27 <Snuggletummy> They said I was crazy...they said that placing TNT from one end of the planet in a attempt to split it into two halves of a whole planet was crazy.
P5:31:33 <Levinous> i like how the torch block would only snap to one specific wall when there was more than one wall around the block
P5:32:44 <Luminaflare> I've done that snugs

P5:34:16 <asiekierka> Notch, will dynamic lighting be added to creative mode multiplayer?
P5:34:17 <Snuggletummy> Luminaflare, I want to fly 3000 miles back to your house.
P5:34:21 <08Notch> yes
P5:34:26 <emgmod> As an option?
P5:34:28 <Luminaflare> You should do that
P5:34:31 <asiekierka> mandatory or optional?
P5:34:43 <Luminaflare> (both flying to my house and optional lighting)
P5:35:13 <vede> Notch, how do you plan to implement handheld light sources?
P5:35:18 <08Notch> probably, yes
P5:35:25 <asiekierka> vede, just like torches i guess?
P5:35:25 <Daroh> Some fun me and a friend had a few days ago :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2cteurs-vw
P5:35:26 <08Notch> there are some issues with them currently
P5:35:27 <vede> Is your current system fast enough to handle things like that?
P5:35:39 <08Notch> no, not really, but there are some cheats. :D
P5:35:46 <08Notch> i could use opengl lighting
P5:35:49 <08Notch> but it'd feel out of place
P5:35:57 <i300> yeah
P5:36:01 <i300> i see your point there
P5:36:08 <Luminaflare> I love the current lighting
P5:36:11 <i300> same

P5:37:50 <i300> did the whole screen flash or only the java applet?
P5:37:57 <gordenfreechmen> Notch: you should try new lighting and release as a big page, "/ifyourcomputerisawesome/"

P5:38:08 <asiekierka> hahahaha
P5:38:15 <asiekierka> also
P5:38:25 <asiekierka> is a minecraft version for DOS possible in any way, shape or form
P5:38:35 <Snuggletummy> I wonder what this would be like on the Crysis engine.
P5:38:36 <i300> why would that be useful?
P5:38:39 <Luminaflare> DOS supports java?
P5:38:45 <i300> i dont think so
P5:38:47 <Snuggletummy> Minecraft text adventure?

P5:42:29 <Adam01> Basicly minecraft,  in cpp? why?
P5:42:39 <Luminaflare> Being done doesn't mean it's finished as such
P5:42:43 <Snuggletummy> You run like hell. After 5 minutes of running for dear life, you stop, mid-step, gasping for air. Suddenly, you hear the daunting sounds of a nearby spider. Before you can turn around you feel a sharp pain in your spinal column..as you slowly perish, you see a glimpse of what used to be your homeland.
P5:42:45 <Luminaflare> He means the core game mode
P5:42:48 <Luminaflare> and engine etc.
P5:42:58 <Luminaflare> There's still be new game modes and random content added most likely

P6:51:06 <vede> I hate when people mistake "realism" with "logic"
P6:51:30 <mail2345> ^^
P6:51:35 <vede> When someone makes a suggestion to make the game more "realistic" ANYONE can come by and say, "WHO THE FUCK CARES IF GAMES ARE REALISTIC BLAH BLAH BLAH"
P6:52:00 <vede> But a lot of these suggestions are to make games more LOGICAL.
P6:52:12 <vede> And no matter how UNREALISTIC a game is, it should still be logical.
P6:53:27 <Hunter2458> True that
P6:53:31 <gordenfreechmen> "Hey, don't you think the first level where you escape the prison should be easier then the second where you are in the forest?"

P6:54:27 <Ylle> People tout MW2 as realistic
P6:54:29 <vede> I mean, some lapses in logic are okay, but a lot aren't.
P6:54:45 <Ylle> last thing I heard running around with riot shield and throwing knives at eachother
P6:54:52 <Ylle> wasn't a realistic representation of war

P6:55:29 <mail2345> well
P6:55:33 <mail2345> you might be right
P6:55:35 <Snowman> If they are, they're often imbalanced
P6:55:42 <gordenfreechmen> perfectly realistic games are horrible
P6:55:43 <mail2345> ^
P6:55:57 <vede> Snowman, sometimes an imbalance created by realism is welcomed!

P6:57:12 <vurtual> ArmA 2 was realistic
P6:57:17 <vurtual> It wasn't horrible or unbalanced.

P6:57:40 <Snowman> And a normal soldier can't carry 2 assault rifles, 3 SMGs 2 pistols, a shotgun, 10 grenades and a knife
P6:57:44 <vurtual> Guerilla warfare is the balancing effect.
P6:57:58 <vede> The only games I LIKE extreme difficulty in are realistic first person shooters.
P6:58:08 <Hunter2458> Heck, as far as Snoman's comment is concerned, Halo met the realism in that aspect.
P6:58:14 <vurtual> Snowman, because they're already carrying survival gear and food and stuff.
P6:58:16 <Snowman> And if you die irl, you can't respawn
P6:58:26 <Snowman> Or load
P6:58:34 <vurtual> Take that away, it's useless in an FPS, and BAM. Enough room.
P6:58:40 <vurtual> Mooore than enough room for all that.
P6:58:44 <vede> I'd still like to see a one-life-one-death FPS game.

P6:58:52 <Snowman> Would suck though
P6:58:54 <Hunter2458> Snowman, unless it's a sci-fi technological interpretation of past events you're playing.
P6:58:59 <vurtual> ArmA 2, without saving.
P6:58:59 <Snowman> Die once by accident, end of the line
P6:59:00 <vede> With realistic difficulty, of course.
P6:59:04 <vede> (And ran-gen levels.)
P6:59:08 <vurtual> DIE ONCE AND YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO RETRY EVER AGAIN
P6:59:21 <Luminaflare> So...
P6:59:21 <vurtual> Seriously, I forget to save and bam, something kills me. I just can't will myself to do the whole thing.
P6:59:21 <Hunter2458> IWBTG
P6:59:23 <gordenfreechmen> thats why i hate that one game Life
P6:59:30 <Luminaflare> A quote from a post on facepunch "Usually it's The Germans, Aliens, Zombies, Insurgents, etc."
P6:59:31 <vurtual> It really puts some tense on you.
P6:59:31 <vede> I think I would like a game like that, despite my tirading against difficult games.
P6:59:35 <Luminaflare> This gives me an idea for a game!
P6:59:45 <Luminaflare> German Alien Zomie Insurgents FROM SPAAAACCCCEEE
P6:59:48 <Hunter2458> Wait, doesn't minecraft do that now?
P6:59:54 <Hunter2458> Die = Lose
P6:59:59 <Snowman> Aliens are usually from space
P7:00:08 <vurtual> Aliens... FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAANNNN
P7:00:12 <Snowman> Here's a cool one: German terrorists
P7:00:12 <gordenfreechmen> but they can be from mexico too.
P7:00:12 <vurtual> I'm cooolld
P7:00:27 <Luminaflare> Vurtual that's been done
P7:00:29 <vede> Hunter2458, yeah, but I'm talking about an actual, like, guns and ammo FPS.
P7:00:31 <Luminaflare> X-com terror from the deep
P7:00:33 <vurtual> I knooowww
P7:00:36 <vurtual> It's multiple movies.
P7:00:43 <vurtual> I want to see a game with American terrorists.
P7:00:46 <Hunter2458> Vede, I'm sure there's a mod for it out there.
P7:01:03 <gordenfreechmen> the most realistic game i've played is penumbra
P7:01:12 <vede> Penumbra sucked...
P7:01:18 <gordenfreechmen> i liked it :(
P7:01:20 <vurtual> It was scaaary
P7:01:31 <vurtual> Rednecks that cause trouble and terrorize VS rednecks that are the good guys. German military is there for lulz.
P7:01:45 <vede> It was only scary to me because I didn't want to have to play through the same shit again if I died.

P7:02:50 <vurtual> THE DOORS ARE MOUTTHHHHSSS

P7:03:02 <bildramer> well I messed up the countdown
P7:03:18 <Snowman> Happy 2010 Middle-of-the-ocean!
P7:03:18 <vede> I got to the point where I was just fucking running through hallways without any hesitation, so when I died, I could do the same thing, but react to what killed me.
P7:03:55 <vede> My friend was watching me, and there was this, like, big ominous dark scary hole.
P7:03:55 <bildramer> I have a countdown script!

P9:11:32 <Hunter2458> kaitou who?

P9:12:06 <Hunter2458> I know that
P9:12:24 <Hunter2458> The more we give him attention the more powerful he becomes.
P9:12:34 <gordenfreechmen> thats a troll, not a griefer
P9:12:37 <Hunter2458> Everyone knows to ban and be on the lookout for him, that's all.
P9:12:51 <Hunter2458> He's a troll on the forums, and a griefer in the game.
P9:13:10 <Hunter2458> And Griefers are practically trolls when they build you up to trusting them enough to op them.
P9:13:35 <vurtual> Imagine when this so called "open source minecraft" thing happens. Think of what griefers can do then.
P9:13:49 <vurtual> They'll make sapper blocks clientside, that delete a whole structure!
P9:14:09 <Hunter2458> But imagine how much power the server owners will have too.
P9:14:22 <Hunter2458> Maybe a method of detecting those blocks and preventing their use.
P9:14:32 <vurtual> yeah, but someone could push an innocent patch out for the "official" mod edition.
P9:14:34 <vurtual> With a trap in it.
P9:14:42 <vurtual> Griefers could call hidden kill instructions.
P9:14:52 <vurtual> or make security holes
P9:14:54 <Leonardo> New Years is like a normal day.
P9:14:56 <Hunter2458> If you get trapped by that you deserve it.
P9:14:58 <Leonardo> :\
P9:15:16 <vurtual> It could happen to anyone.
P9:15:19 <Hunter2458> And in reality I don't think there's much of that going to go around.
P9:15:33 <vurtual> Of course open source minecraft will have a few "official editions".
P9:15:42 <Hunter2458> -looks at the topic-

P9:53:41 <Hunter2458> maybe different sized cannons
P9:53:45 <Drakkar> but proper cannonade aren't static
P9:53:48 <Hunter2458> some that only take out smaller areas.
P9:53:58 <Hunter2458> Proper Castle cannons are.
P9:53:58 <vurtual> Seiken Densetsu 2 cannons were pretty static.

P9:54:26 <Drakkar> I'm talking artillery!
P9:54:35 <Hunter2458> We're talking siege defenses.
P9:54:55 <Jat> were talking little blocks that shoot other blocks
P9:55:03 <Hunter2458> exactly
P9:55:11 <Drakkar> which could easily be made portable if they're just a single block
P9:55:26 <Hunter2458> I definately can't wait for a CTF mode

P9:57:58 <Jat> wtf is fanning the hammer?
P9:58:12 <Hunter2458> Isn't that just hitting the hammer and holding the trigger?
P9:58:17 <Hunter2458> Like they show in westerns?

P10:15:21 <Hunter2458> They start bouncing.
P10:15:29 <vurtual> "DON'T WORRY! I'LL SAVE YOU!", and a taft rolls down at lightning speed and envelops the car, rolling it to safety through the avalanche.

P10:21:51 <AndrewPH> Script != server
P10:22:06 <vurtual> Can servers force player positino via packets?
P10:22:06 <Hunter2458> Yeah, but most scripts are used in the custom servers
P10:22:18 <Aeomin> <AndrewPH> Script != server
P10:22:26 <vurtual> If you're gonna custom server, then why not just code it in?
P10:22:32 <vurtual> Scripts are extensions to the real server.

P10:30:17 <fromethius> so i have this theory

P10:30:40 <fromethius> logic behind it:
P10:30:55 <fromethius> when you take a piss, you always have an epiphany in regard to your current programming problem
P10:31:03 <fromethius> and not just programming really, even life problems

P11:17:53 <Leonardo> In the movie 2012.
P11:17:58 <PuyoDead> What? oh.
P11:18:03 <PuyoDead> </joke>
P11:18:13 <Leonardo> XD
P11:18:54 <Leonardo> What's next? The Winter Olympics!
P11:19:16 <Jat> the ships will be structurally weak and heavy due to high lead content
P11:20:09 <Leonardo> I like the movie, I like the end.
P11:20:14 <PuyoDead> Wow, the Zelda marathon donations are nearing $8,000
P11:20:30 <Jat> that stream was way too jerky fgor me
P11:20:35 <Jat> unwatchable at a certain point
P11:20:41 <vurtual> PuyoDead, zelda marathon?
P11:20:52 <Leonardo> 8,000? Poor much?
P11:21:07 <PuyoDead> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ExtraLives-Marathons
P11:21:24 <PuyoDead> It's been pretty steady for me. But it runs much smoother in Chrome than Firefox for me.
P11:21:56 <Jat> what game are they on now?
P11:22:02 <Leonardo> Who thinks 2009 was the WORST year?
P11:22:10 <PuyoDead> The very end of OoT.
P11:22:17 <PuyoDead> I think 2000 itself was ass.
P11:22:17 <revenant> Wait what?
P11:22:23 <revenant> Too people playing OOT?
P11:22:26 <revenant> what are they doin?
P11:22:34 <Leonardo> Why 2000?
P11:22:39 <PuyoDead> Completing the games.
P11:22:54 <PuyoDead> If someone finishes first, off to the next game.
P11:23:50 <revenant> ?

P11:46:37 <Lapsus> Hello! Does anyone know of a way for me to be able to actually play minecraft on a locally hosted server, one that's NOT on the computer that I'm trying to play from, but is on the network?
P11:47:13 <revenant> Yeah, it should work fine right off the bat.
P11:47:16 <revenant> If not, read the readme.
P11:47:20 <revenant> You can use a direct ip link.
P11:47:42 <revenant> I believe its local ip, not external.
P11:48:52 <Lapsus> Nope, generates a new map if I try to use http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=192.168.0.3&port=25565
P11:49:01 <AndrewPH> use the externalurl
P11:49:08 <AndrewPH> Also turn verify names on if it's off
P11:49:14 <AndrewPH> and never connect using ip anymore
P11:49:24 <PuyoDead> http://i.imgur.com/WhdZm.png
P11:49:43 <PuyoDead> Also, if you use varify names off, don't make it a public server.
P11:49:56 <Lapsus> I can't seem to connect using the externalurl, good to hear that the verify-names issue might actually be fixed
P11:51:05 <Lapsus> Would anyone be willing to try joining it so that I can see if the problem's just my router sucking?
