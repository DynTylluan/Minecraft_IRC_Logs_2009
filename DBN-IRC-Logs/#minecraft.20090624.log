A2:12:08 <Eagle> XD
A2:12:18 <LazyWaffle> Also

A2:12:22 <Eagle> 'K?
A2:12:23 <LazyWaffle> Eagle, what does green look like to you?
A2:12:28 <Eagle> Yellow.
A2:12:32 <LazyWaffle> Really?
A2:12:35 <Eagle> Or Red, depending on the shade.
A2:12:37 <LazyWaffle> fucked up man
A2:12:39 <vdgmprgrmr> I can host a server.
A2:12:47 <LazyWaffle> Ok, can you host a small map then?

A2:13:12 <LazyWaffle> PRIVATE
A2:13:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Just a few minutes first.
A2:13:50 <Eagle> Actually more than one spleef map is a good idea, since ours can only hold 8 people in a tourney at a time. :P
A2:14:00 <Eagle> So yeah forget I said anything.

A9:18:47 <Quatroking> I hate my ISP
A9:18:57 <Quatroking> a LOT
A9:19:41 <Quatroking> they just randomly decide to update my modem's firmware without a fucking warning, and throw me off the web for over 10 minutes
A9:20:03 <Siiseli> :D
A9:20:06 <Quatroking> and sometimes do that 5 TIMES A DAY
A9:21:12 <Quatroking> and half the time I end up with an outdated firmware, too
A9:22:57 <Quatroking> for example it now takes fucking 5 minutes to open the modem's software
A9:24:06 <Quatroking> what the fuck they now gave me a german interface
A9:24:10 <Quatroking> the shit is this crap

A9:24:57 <Quatroking> well they apparantly are
A9:25:28 <Quatroking> they now DOWNGRADED my firmware from a version made in march to a version from december '08

A9:25:59 <Parthon> found out who it is
A9:26:00 <Parthon> get names
A9:26:01 <Parthon> have them fired
A9:26:04 <Parthon> egg their house
A9:26:07 <Parthon> sue their pants off
A9:26:20 <Quatroking> sue the whole ISP
A9:26:40 <Quatroking> I've called them multiple times but they keep on telling me they do it for security issues
A9:26:52 <Evil-Ville> isp changing modem firmware sounds really stupid
A9:27:12 <Quatroking> which is bullshit because I've been switching between the december and march version about 8 times now

A9:34:43 <akuryo> so

A11:05:46 <citricsquid> welcome back ez!
A11:05:46 <Quatroking> hey ez
A11:05:47 <Quatroking> long time no see!
A11:05:49 <venn177> I set up the server, run the software, try to connect, and it says I can't and that the server is down
A11:06:03 <ez> bah, my friend called said she was late, instantly bored lol
A11:06:03 <citricsquid> venn: Read the forum, you need to connect with local IP
A11:06:06 <citricsquid> not external
A11:06:09 <citricsquid> if you host the server
A11:06:15 <Rroff> you need either a route to your WAN IP or connect to localhost
A11:06:24 <Rroff> you may in some cases need to turn of verify names

A11:06:34 <venn177> I'm at that topic
A11:06:42 <Quatroking> citricsquid: So far I've always connected to my own server through the external link
A11:06:43 <venn177> back in two minutes with results
A11:07:07 <Quatroking> If I try to connect locally it's not working :P
A11:07:26 <venn177> "You can't connect to the server via this url any more!" it says at the top of the page on that link in #2
A11:07:28 <ez> IM HUNGRY
A11:07:28 <Rroff> not all routers will let you connect back to your own IP
A11:07:45 <venn177> also have a router, already forwarded the port
A11:07:50 <venn177> no one can connect to my server, though
A11:07:57 <Rroff> well more to the point they don't have a route defined for it rather than don't let
A11:08:01 <ez> so, u approved of my changes to wiki then? 
A11:08:04 <greenslimy> you have the right port in server properties?
A11:08:08 <venn177> Yeah
A11:08:09 <citricsquid> if nobody can connect you've not forwarded the port properly
A11:08:13 <Quatroking> Ez, you mean me?
A11:08:14 <ez> since u checked ip up and everything
A11:08:21 <ez> well, anybody! 
A11:08:25 <ez> but yeh
A11:08:37 <Quatroking> Well I was wondering who was adding so much, without even having an account LO
A11:08:40 <Quatroking> *:P
A11:08:46 <Quatroking> but yeah, your ideas are great
A11:08:53 <citricsquid> 8inches
A11:08:54 <Quatroking> it's just that we don't have the material to cover it
A11:08:57 <citricsquid> oops, wrong window =D
A11:09:05 <Quatroking> . . .
A11:09:10 <ez> I think there are alot of info pages that's not really linked to in an obvious way
A11:09:11 <Quatroking> WHAT is 8 inches?
A11:09:24 <ez> so I thought Id try to start connecting it all together
A11:09:30 <Quatroking> ez: make an account so its easier for us, and GO
A11:09:31 <citricsquid> some girl asked about a films length, I was trying to be funny :(
A11:09:34 <Quatroking> GO FOR IT
A11:09:40 <venn177> Question
A11:09:50 <ez> I'll make an account later
A11:09:59 <venn177> I'm gonna redo the steps on portforward.com in case I did something wrong, but how the hell do I know the model of my router?
A11:10:06 <venn177> its not anywhere ON my router
A11:10:14 <Quatroking> uh
A11:10:18 <ez> but pls help out cause Im a noob to this wiki thing
A11:10:23 <Quatroking> doesn't the itnerface say anything?
A11:10:32 <Quatroking> ez: I'm ready for anything
A11:10:35 <ez> seems pretty easy tho

A11:10:56 <Quatroking> touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable!
A11:10:56 <venn177> its a popular router, the white netgear one that everyone I know uses
A11:10:57 <venn177> >.<
A11:11:29 <ez> lol citricsquid
A11:11:59 <ez> I remember the good old days when u could determine the lenght of a film by the weight of the vhs tape
A11:12:33 <Quatroking> venn177: this thing? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Netgear-DG834G-Router.jpg
A11:13:46 <Rroff> might be the N or GT

A11:14:03 <Rroff> :P

A11:14:12 <Quatroking> in fact
A11:14:14 <Rroff> yeah I do really
A11:14:16 <ez> I got plenty.. somewhere
A11:14:17 <venn177> I found it
A11:14:24 <Quatroking> I've got a VHS linked up to my computer
A11:14:27 <Rroff> just it seems to have dissapeared completely around here
A11:14:27 <venn177> and the steps I followed are exactly what I did when forwarding
A11:14:47 <Rroff> I literally don't know a single person with a VHS recorder any more
A11:14:53 <venn177> I've got one
A11:15:03 <ez> used to work in a video store too, so got really good at carrying them

A11:16:18 <Quatroking> wait what
A11:16:25 <Quatroking> what the hell did you do to them to make them break?
A11:16:30 <ez> Rroff, think our broke, but might still be somewhere
A11:16:47 <Rroff> end of the 80s or early 90s
A11:16:47 <Quatroking> you have to put quite a lot of force on them to break 'em :/
A11:16:52 <Rroff> it went from everyone having one
A11:16:57 <Rroff> to almost completely dissapearing
A11:17:00 <ez> Quatroking, customers didnt know how to take them out of the thing, they bent them.. so cracks all over

A11:17:17 <Quatroking> just push the middle ..
A11:17:39 <Rroff> you'd be suprised how many people don't realise that Quatroking

A11:19:59 <venn177> I think I might have found my problem
A11:20:03 <venn177> and it lies in setting up my static IP
A11:20:15 <Zuriki> Heh
A11:20:20 <Zuriki> I just kicked from my own server
A11:20:26 <ez> we ended up using plastic bags for the DVDs instead, since they bent them to hell otherwise :)
A11:20:31 <Zuriki> "Cheat Detected: Distance"

P12:29:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Uummm.. Rroff, what's the point of that?
P12:29:20 <Rroff> it polls the server port to check if its responding
P12:29:32 <Quatroking> By the way Notch, have you seen what I'm working on?
P12:29:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> I see
P12:29:45 <08Notch> i haven't

P1:07:14 <osici> ah
P1:08:23 <Quatroking> so, what's wrong?
P1:08:56 <osici> Ok this is my fault. Not a bug. I thought maps had to all be powers of 2 in sides, so the editor forces them to be 64*64. I'll remove this restriction in the next version. Try a 64*64 map for now and see if works
P1:09:21 <Quatroking> so it's simply because its a non-standard size?
P1:09:28 <osici> yeah
P1:09:33 <Quatroking> bugger.
P1:09:54 <Quatroking> oh well, i'll just enlarge the canvas and copypaste
P1:10:00 <osici> I'll change that so it won't be a problem

P2:12:22 <ZomBuster> works fine for me..
P2:12:23 <Quatroking> Hey Notch, is what you earned with Minecraft more than you earn from your job?
P2:12:48 <Rroff> I should imagine in the short term
P2:13:23 <ZomBuster> he worked on it for like 1.5 month
P2:13:23 <Rroff> the other day in the time I was at work and earning ~100 euro he had made approx 300 lol

P2:13:32 <citricsquid> Will we ever be able to specify the IP for the server client to run from, Notch? =D Setting up VMs is tedious.

P2:13:57 <Rroff> VMs is better tho in so many ways
P2:14:08 <Shoy> VM being Virtual Machine? or what
P2:14:09 <Rroff> if a socket hangs (like they do atm a lot) and hold the server port open
P2:14:16 <Rroff> you can just reboot the VM instead of the entire server
P2:14:24 <citricsquid> or just switch the port? :D

P2:14:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, then the external URL changes
P2:14:34 <Rroff> people don't like that tho
P2:14:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> :(
P2:14:39 <Rroff> they have to find the new URL
P2:14:50 <citricsquid> true that
P2:14:54 <citricsquid> totally forgot :O
P2:15:04 <Rroff> you could set the keep alive time on the OS lower I guess
P2:15:05 <08Notch> yes, it's more than I get from my job..
P2:15:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> If Notch could fix that bug, I would be happy
P2:15:11 <08Notch> not sure if it is after taxes
P2:15:13 <Fishlips> what if he makes 1000 sales then buggers off :O 
P2:15:17 <Dilt> I can't seem to get my skin working. O_o
P2:15:17 <Rroff> tho sometimes the sockets stay open for a lot more than the 10 minute default
P2:15:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> We need a way to elegantly close the servers
P2:15:31 <citricsquid> I askedmy host to set up server for Xen, they did it for OpenVZ :| Now I've got to wait for them to fix it, again. :D
P2:15:31 <Dilt> Is there a specific way the .png has to be saved?
P2:15:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> or a way to load maps from within servers
P2:15:37 <08Notch> citricsquid: Sure. But not right now
P2:15:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> from within the console*
P2:15:45 <08Notch> I'm focusing on sound and then on survival
P2:16:06 <citricsquid> notch: yay, as long as it's planned, time doesn't matter <3 :D
P2:16:19 <Rroff> if your using linux theres ways to force an application to use a specific IP I think
P2:16:20 <Dilt> uhhh.
P2:16:30 <Rroff> prolly involving iptables :S
P2:16:31 <Dilt> nobody wants to respond to me? D:
P2:16:35 <citricsquid> rroff: I checked it out, have to modify the actual java setup to do it :(
P2:16:35 <08Notch> Dilt: You've uploaded a skin!
P2:16:39 <Dilt> I've uploaded several
P2:16:41 <08Notch> it looks like the normal skin. :)
P2:17:00 <Dilt> i've uploaded a few but none seem to be updating my guy at all
P2:17:01 <Dilt> :(
P2:17:12 <08Notch> are you sure you're not uploading the template file?
P2:17:16 <Dilt> 100%
P2:17:25 <Dilt> note the 'several' part
P2:17:26 <08Notch> the skin saving applet doesn't know about the original skin
P2:17:44 <08Notch> *servlet
P2:17:52 <08Notch> so it seems unlikely
P2:17:54 <Dilt> ... are skins broken in opera?
P2:17:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> His skin looks like it has a custom face to me
P2:17:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> but otherwise is the default
P2:18:06 <08Notch> now I see a new skin, dilt
P2:18:10 <citricsquid> Dilt: Opera has uploading problems with some apps, could be that?
P2:18:10 <Dilt> I don't see any change
P2:18:14 <08Notch> monochrome head
P2:18:15 <Dilt> It's probably that
P2:18:22 <08Notch> it might be image caching
P2:18:24 <Dilt> it's not showing any updates, even on refreshing/reloading it
P2:18:27 <Dilt> and forcing an update
P2:18:35 <Dilt> so it seems it can't force applet updates
P2:18:39 <Dilt> that'd explain it
P2:18:40 <08Notch> OMG GHOSTBUSTERS BBL
P2:18:46 <Rroff> if your using seperate user accounts for each server instance
P2:19:01 <Rroff> you can use netfilter/iptables to lock them to an IP/adapter
P2:19:14 <ZomBuster> ghostbusters?
P2:19:19 <flak> http://s61.radikal.ru/i172/0906/de/a33e9a1cf93a.jpg
P2:19:34 <Dilt> alright
P2:19:35 <Dilt> there, perfect
P2:19:45 <Rroff> but don't ask me for how - I hate iptables :P

P3:15:10 <LazyWaffle> Hey Vdg
P3:15:16 <LazyWaffle> Can you host the server?
P3:15:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, sure.
P3:15:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe.
P3:16:06 <vdgmprgrmr> There's other people in the house right now using the internet, so that might not fly as smoothly as one might hope.
P3:16:15 <LazyWaffle> Ok
P3:16:35 <Maulrus> urgh, I might as well totally reset teh server
P3:16:37 <citricsquid> I can set one up, private or public?
P3:16:38 <LazyWaffle> PM me the link when it's ready
P3:16:39 <vdgmprgrmr> If someone else wants to though I can give them the map.

P3:21:59 <potato> ew

P3:22:09 <Shoy> What happened to being able to send files on IRC? owo
P3:22:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I use the one I have an account on, which is willhostforfood.
13P3:22:13 * AlLnAtuRalX has RS premium, so I'm not biased.
P3:22:18 <citricsquid> who doesn't have premium on rs? :|
P3:22:21 <citricsquid> rs is awesome.
P3:22:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't.
P3:22:24 <Shoy> I don't.

P3:22:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Because there's better sites than RS.
P3:22:42 <citricsquid> people who dislike rs = cheap fags who won't get premium
P3:22:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> Really?
P3:22:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> where?
P3:22:46 <Shoy> Torrents require seeds and are bitchy and slow D:
P3:22:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Such as willhostforfood.
P3:22:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> Exactly citricsquid 
P3:22:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it's free.
P3:22:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> Who uploads there though?
P3:23:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Me.
P3:23:02 <Shoy> I like rapidshare, but I don't have premium, so bah
P3:23:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> all major uploaders use RS

P3:23:12 <LazyWaffle> [, the link, vdgm
P3:23:12 <citricsquid> rs is good because of its spread
P3:23:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> RS forces uploaders to use RS by giving them free accts for uploading
P3:23:30 <vdgmprgrmr> http://willhostforfood.com/access.php?fileid=71816
P3:23:36 <AlLnAtuRalX> and then people have to buy premium because suddenly, everything's on there
P3:23:40 <LazyWaffle> is that the level?
P3:23:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's genius, and it helps put everything in one place
P3:23:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, that's the level.
P3:23:52 <LazyWaffle> is squid hosting?
P3:24:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I think so.
P3:24:21 <ZomBuster> what is it?

P4:18:42 <PuyoDead> I'm not really big into anime, personally, but the good ones are very much worth mentioning
P4:18:50 <PuyoDead> there's a whooooole lot of crap anime out there
P4:19:24 <Quatroking> I really hate the anime's that just don't stop
P4:19:32 <Quatroking> pokemon, naruto, bleach, I dispite them
P4:20:06 <PuyoDead> yea, those are a dime a dozen
P4:20:16 <Quatroking> I want to watch a series that has an actual end, otherwise i won't have a "shit, that was some nice anime. Gotta watch that again sometime" feeling
P4:20:30 <PuyoDead> only to be replaced by the "next big show!" in a couple years
P4:20:34 <potato> amiminiminimimimime
P4:20:57 <Quatroking> not some lame anime that takes FIVE FUCKING EPISODES FULL OF TALKING before anything actually happens (dragonball Z)
P4:21:02 <PuyoDead> yea, Cowboy Bebop, perfect length. FLCL, only 6, but it worked great
P4:21:15 <PuyoDead> oh god, DBZ makes me sad
P4:21:19 <Quatroking> FLCL shows how awesome something small can be
P4:21:25 <potato> choo chooooo keep on ridin the amine train
P4:21:31 <Cameron> THE EYEBROWS.
P4:21:36 <Cameron> THEY ARE BURNED INTO MY MIND.
P4:21:54 <Quatroking> Oh, yes, the eyebrows.
P4:21:56 <PuyoDead> see, DBZ has excellent characters. the development is really nice. but the plot is god damned wretched
P4:22:23 <Quatroking> I never watched the anime more than 5 minutes yet I know quite a lot about the story
P4:22:24 <Cameron> What about Regular DB?
P4:22:26 <Quatroking> lolz
P4:22:28 <potato> he said while twirling his mustache and adjusting his monocle
P4:22:50 <PuyoDead> regular DB wasn't too bad. it was more focused on characters, and had an actual plot
P4:22:53 <Quatroking> I can't wait for Ponyo to be released in the US and EU
P4:22:57 <PuyoDead> still not the best, but decent
P4:23:00 <Quatroking> Ponyo on the cliffs by sea
P4:23:11 <Quatroking> Got released a few months ago in Japan
P4:23:23 <Quatroking> Ghibli movie :D
P4:23:27 <PuyoDead> oh man
P4:23:33 <PuyoDead> I'm always excited about those
P4:23:39 <PuyoDead> he's like Gilliam to me
P4:23:43 <Quatroking> I've seen the trailers and they just wet my pants
P4:23:46 <alexsuraci> AlLnAtuRalX: you about?
P4:24:10 <Quatroking> I love it how I can just see at the ponyo pictures it's a Ghibli

P5:32:37 <Rroff> yeah

P5:32:51 <Rroff> but kinda matrix style with a world within a world
P5:33:00 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't know anything like that, no.
P5:33:00 <Rroff> where nothing is quite what it seems at first glance
P5:33:09 <Rroff> there aren't many
P5:33:15 <Rroff> and the good ones are hard to find
P5:33:32 <PuyoDead> Brazil perhaps?
P5:33:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Imma go watch a movie now.
P5:33:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Bai.
P5:33:59 <PuyoDead> Brazil is very 1984-ish, so maybe that fits
P5:34:22 <Maulrus> Global just intruded in my query
P5:34:24 <Maulrus> wtf mang
P5:34:36 <Rroff> possibly tho might be a bit too old
P5:34:59 <Maulrus> how old is it?
P5:35:17 <Rroff> 80s
P5:35:26 <Maulrus> >_>
P5:35:29 <Maulrus> that is not very old
P5:35:39 <Rroff> I prefer movies where sci-fi isn't all big knobs and flashing lights if you know what I mean
P5:35:43 <PuyoDead> if that's too old, then you're pretty much out of luck
P5:35:49 <citricsquid> rroff: gay porn?!
P5:35:51 <Maulrus> yeah
P5:35:58 <Rroff> lol
P5:36:28 <PuyoDead> I think you're thinking of old 50's sci fi b movies
P5:36:33 <Maulrus> yes
P5:36:41 <Maulrus> we're not suggesting Plan 9 or something like that >_>
P5:36:47 <PuyoDead> good god no
P5:36:54 <El_Joe> I enjoy movies such as but not limited to "spiderman 2"
P5:36:55 <Rroff> hmm trailer for brazil doesn't look too bad
P5:37:00 <PuyoDead> Blade Runner is another good one
P5:37:10 <Rroff> yeah but I've seen blade runner a million times
P5:37:14 <PuyoDead> oh, heh
P5:37:16 <Maulrus> Manos: The Hands of Fate is one of my favorites
P5:37:25 <PuyoDead> 12 Monkeys maybe?
P5:37:31 <Maulrus> 12 monkeys is pretty good
P5:37:36 <Rroff> I'm not thinking of old 50s sci-fi
P5:37:38 <Maulrus> though i've sen it way too many times >_>

P5:37:52 <Rroff> just thats where most of these kinda movies started and finished really :(

P5:38:08 <Maulrus> shoy: same here since yesterday
P5:38:16 <Maulrus> though I'm just glad it's not on my server anymore
P5:38:19 <PuyoDead> ehh, the spleef thing will probably vanish once everyone realizes how quickly it gets boring
P5:38:25 <PuyoDead> that and when REAL game modes come out
P5:38:27 <Maulrus> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking
P5:38:46 <Maulrus> rroff: alien is from the 80's. alien != big knobs and flashing lights

P5:38:59 <Rroff> alien is ok
P5:39:07 <Rroff> aliens is one of my fav. movies of all time
P5:39:28 <Maulrus> aliens is great but it was much less of a thriller
P5:39:36 <Rroff> true
P5:39:46 <Maulrus> it's one of the rare sequels that might actually be better than the original though
P5:39:48 <Rroff> but I kinda liked the action
P5:39:52 <Maulrus> yeah me too
P5:40:02 <PuyoDead> alien/s are great movies
P5:40:06 <Maulrus> again, i'm biased, as I've seen aliens like 200 more times than alien
P5:40:11 <Rroff> 1 and 2 are great movies
P5:40:18 <PuyoDead> 2001 is good if you don't mind a total lack of action, heh
P5:40:19 <Rroff> 3 is terrible and 4 is just about watchable
P5:40:25 <Rroff> I don't like 2001
P5:40:32 <Rroff> I dunno why people rave about it
P5:40:57 <PuyoDead> at the time, it looked better than pretty much anything that ever tried to do what it did
P5:41:00 <Maulrus> 2001 is good up until the whole "psychadelic trip to jupiter + weird fetus floating through space" part
P5:41:03 <PuyoDead> so that lasted quite a while
P5:41:04 <Maulrus> the part with hal is very good
P5:41:14 <El_Joe> hey
P5:41:17 <El_Joe> that was the best part
P5:41:17 <Maulrus> yeah, for a 1968 movie, it's very pioneering
P5:41:19 <El_Joe> u totally gay
P5:41:21 <Maulrus> >_>

P5:41:47 <El_Joe> i dont enjoy good movies because i get ~bored~
P5:41:55 <El_Joe> I am a tremendous fucking baby
P5:42:01 <Rroff> I just felt like they couldn't think of any good ideas so they pretended there was some hidden depth to it

P5:42:23 <PuyoDead> it was a Kubrick movie, that's how he worked
P5:42:29 <Rroff> nah
P5:42:43 <Rroff> a lot of his other movies were better but hugely over-rated
P5:42:52 <notjotham> why would you need to dare someone to watch eraserhead

P5:48:16 <El_Joe> yo
P5:48:18 <El_Joe> yo
P5:48:28 <El_Joe> this game needs an echo feature
P5:48:36 <El_Joe> like if you standingat the top of a high mountain
P5:48:36 <PuyoDead> eh?
P5:48:41 <El_Joe> and you say some shit
P5:48:43 <El_Joe> it says it again
P5:48:45 <El_Joe> like an echo
P5:48:46 <Maulrus> >_>
P5:48:48 <Maulrus> not really
P5:48:48 <El_Joe> also add mtn goats
P5:48:49 <PuyoDead> that's... yea
P5:48:55 <Vahue> thats the dumbest shit i ever heard
P5:48:56 <El_Joe> like in the planet earth episode
P5:48:56 <Maulrus> mountain goats would be intense
P5:48:58 <El_Joe> w/ mtn goats
P5:49:12 <Maulrus> mountain goats to go in Quatro's teapot
P5:49:14 <Maulrus> fuck yes
P5:49:19 <El_Joe> it needs to have a way to yodel and then the game rates the quality of your hodel
P5:49:42 <El_Joe> like <yodeler> yodalehee!!!!
P5:49:49 <El_Joe> <echo> (yodalehee)
P5:50:00 <El_Joe> <yodel-rate> you scored 10 out of 10 great yodel!!!
P5:50:07 <Maulrus> that would be pretty awesome
P5:50:21 <El_Joe> I am emailing this shit to notch
P5:50:21 <Maulrus> yodeling underwater obviously kills your score
P5:50:26 <Maulrus> he needs to hear ths

P5:53:51 <El_Joe> is there a conan o brien skin

P5:54:27 <Maulrus> make it
P5:54:35 <Maulrus> make him in lederhosen
P5:54:44 <Maulrus> so when notch implements yodeling, you'll be set

P7:13:01 <notjotham> two of my tests: bandcamp.fieldsofnoise.org/mcmap001/ http://bandcamp.fieldsofnoise.org/mcmap002/
P7:13:07 <Quatroking> when 3D brushing you just select a radius
P7:13:34 <Quatroking> for example, choose 16, 3D brush round, and you brush spheres with a radius of 16 tiles.
P7:13:53 <Quatroking> if you'd do 2D brush you get a flat circle

P7:31:39 <Spazzo> No, the entire PC
P7:31:43 <Infinity> .....................
P7:31:46 <Infinity> i agree with quatro
P7:31:46 <Quatroking> Alienware is fucking dell
P7:31:57 <Infinity> you'd save a few hundred building it yourself
P7:32:07 <Spazzo> I don't have the patience or the time, though.
P7:32:14 <Spazzo> It's still a pretty damn kickass rig
P7:32:23 <Quatroking> I have a 1500 doller PC, self-built

P7:33:44 <Infinity> i'm running win7 rightn ow
P7:33:48 <Infinity> i do everything on win7 :D
P7:33:54 <Spazzo> I may install Win7 on my other partition on my new PC, but for pure speed, apparently Vista is still the way to go
P7:33:59 <Infinity> mines coolermaster i think might be 750w

P7:34:47 <PuyoDead> YAY
P7:34:48 <Spazzo> Pentium 4 Proc, 80 GB of ram spread across 2 partitions, two uglyass CRT monitors, 1 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon X700
P7:34:48 <Spazzo> Nope!~
P7:34:49 <Infinity> my build was $1250
P7:34:54 <Spazzo> 16 years of savings bonds!
P7:35:02 <Infinity> :/
P7:35:09 <Quatroking> my build is 1500 dollers excluding monitors mice keyboard and all that shit
P7:35:30 <Infinity> I pirated Windows XP even tho i have a disc lying around somewhere
P7:35:42 <Infinity> i passed Genuine Advantage
P7:35:44 <Infinity> :D
P7:35:55 <Spazzo> I'll live with Vista. I'm sure SP1 isn't that bad.
P7:35:59 <Spazzo> And with 7, when it goes retail
P7:36:11 <Quatroking> my monitors are 180 euro's each, my keyboard is a G11 (60 euro's) my mouse was a 20 euro Trust mouse, I've got 50 euro 4.1 speakers
P7:36:13 <Spazzo> Again, I'd do XP, but lack of DX10 support is :(
P7:36:14 <Quatroking> so..
P7:36:16 <Infinity> Quatro
P7:36:17 <Zuriki> Mine was ¬£500 : 4GB RAM, nVidia 8800GT 500GB SATA HDD 2GHz Dual Core Intel

P7:36:23 <Infinity> one sec
P7:36:25 <Infinity> it's on my webserver somewhere
P7:36:34 <Spazzo> I mean, this machine I got now is so bad that I'm encountering compatibility errors with old and new games
P7:36:43 <Infinity> lol i have no errors
P7:36:46 <Spazzo> Goddamn Pixel Shader 3.0
P7:36:46 <Infinity> and it's win7
P7:36:47 <Quatroking> I got this PC since march and I still didn't took the time to compile a list :P
P7:36:59 <Spazzo> It's my shitty gfx card that's doing it
P7:37:11 <Spazzo> I'm looking forward to playing TF2 at maxed settings :D
P7:37:30 <Infinity> so right now you're on a crap PC but you have enough money to buy overpriced computer and OS?
P7:37:43 <Infinity> when win7 is retail all i need is a crack porobably and don't need to uninstall beta
P7:38:01 <Zuriki> My chair just died on me lol
P7:38:06 <Spazzo> That about sums it up, Infinity
P7:38:14 <Spazzo> It's not overpriced, it's still a pretty hardcore rig.

P7:42:33 <Infinity> G5 mouse
P7:42:45 <Rroff> 40-50Kb for the server jar
P7:42:47 <Spazzo> In retrospect, it would have probably been smarter to do what you did, but there's a part of me that's a lazy bastard
P7:43:01 <Infinity> 2.5k build wouldn't been epic :(
P7:43:07 <Infinity> fail at spell
P7:43:09 <Infinity> would've
P7:43:12 <Spazzo> And I just simply don't have what it takes to do a custom build. And if I have a parent whose willing to fund part of the project, I may as well go all out :P
P7:43:16 <Infinity> im' 14
P7:43:19 <Infinity> and i foudn out myself
P7:43:21 <Infinity> k
P7:43:23 <Infinity> not that hard
P7:43:29 <Spazzo> Certainly wouldn't have guessed.
P7:43:31 <Spazzo> I'm sixteen. =P
P7:43:33 <Infinity> wait fund part of your project
P7:43:36 <Zuriki> Did you know squid was going to make a spleef.info site :P
P7:43:38 <Infinity> it took me like a day of work
P7:43:47 <Infinity> cuz it was first time
P7:43:54 <Infinity> and forgetting to plug in CPU fan to power
P7:43:58 <Quatroking> I've been tweaking my computer's hardware since I'm 13
P7:44:03 <Spazzo> I've tweaked, sure
P7:44:04 <Rroff> my minecraft server folder is 200Mb heh
P7:44:08 <Infinity> lolwut
P7:44:12 <Infinity> let me check mine
P7:44:13 <Quatroking> and I'm becoming 16 in two months
P7:44:15 <Spazzo> Well, moreso "upgraded"
P7:44:17 <Rroff> got about a week of backups on there
P7:44:21 <Spazzo> I haven't done any overclocking or anything
P7:44:26 <Spazzo> I'm not too risky when it comes to PC modding
P7:44:32 <Infinity> i haven't done Oc either :P
P7:44:43 <Infinity> i'm on stock fan so idk
P7:44:54 <Rroff> overclocking is only really a risk once you start increasing voltages
P7:45:03 <Infinity> none of my server folders on my Dedicated are over one megabyte cuz i don't do backups that often
P7:45:05 <Quatroking> I've got a huge scar on the side of one of my fingers
P7:45:11 <Infinity> lol
P7:45:11 <Quatroking> PIII overheat :D
P7:45:21 <Rroff> I need to tweak my backup settings a bit heh
P7:45:24 <Quatroking> cartridge CPU that is
P7:45:29 <Rroff> atm I do 10 minute backups with 1 month purge
P7:45:41 <Infinity> why :/ is it an artful server
P7:45:46 <Rroff> yeah
P7:46:07 <Infinity> i wonder if notch would IP block me if I started spamming servers
P7:46:09 <Rroff> prolly don't need more than 24 hours of backups tho relaly
P7:46:17 <Infinity> my dedi is only at 60% CPU with 3 garrysmod servers
P7:46:25 <Infinity> i could easily stuff a few hundred minecrafts ervers
P7:46:29 <Quatroking> I just LOVE video's like these: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzTc2gvS14I
P7:46:29 <Rroff> :P
P7:46:41 <Infinity> DO NOT WANT
P7:46:48 <Rroff> CPU and bandwidth wise I could host 1000s of minecraft servers
P7:46:52 <Spazzo> I should probably start the bigass backup project and get ready to departition and format this shitty PC.
P7:46:55 <Spazzo> Turn it into a media center.
P7:46:57 <Rroff> I don't have a lot of spare RAM on my server tho
P7:46:58 <Spazzo> For the basement.

P7:48:19 <Rroff> uses a lot of RAM but not much bandwidth and not _that_ much CPU relatively
P7:48:22 <Rroff> but eats RAM
P7:48:24 <Quatroking> I've had a cluster built out of old pentium 2's a few months ago
P7:48:32 <Quatroking> used it to process homework data :P
P7:48:36 <Rroff> lol
P7:48:54 <Infinity> Remote desktop is pissing me off

P7:49:00 <Rroff> in what way?
P7:49:05 <Rroff> weird never had that
P7:49:13 <Infinity> which caused it to start duplicate servers
P7:49:20 <Infinity> on different ports
P7:49:42 <Infinity> a new session is like logging in with another account

P7:56:02 <Rroff> you can configure shoutcast either to relay music from a collection on your server or
P7:56:03 <Infinity> do they need a special client?
P7:56:18 <Infinity> cuz there's a default format for streams that windows media player and itunes can play

P9:20:38 <fydo> if it sucked, it would be a lot more popular, that's for sure
P9:20:53 <vdgmprgrmr> It was still bad.

P9:30:21 <AnnihilatorBeta> good to be home
P9:30:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I didn't ever ask why Dexter airs on Showtime.
P9:30:43 <vdgmprgrmr> I said it DID, then you said it was strange.

P9:31:05 <fydo> 20:24 < vdgmprgrmr> Why?
P9:31:18 <vdgmprgrmr> I asked why you thought it was strange!
P9:31:24 <vdgmprgrmr> There was an extra message in there!
P9:31:27 <fydo> my strange was before all of that
P9:31:33 <vdgmprgrmr> NO IT WASN'T!
P9:31:43 <fydo> it was on my end, maybe you're lagged
P9:31:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not lagged.
P9:31:57 <fydo> heh, okay
P9:32:01 <downer> [21:23] <vdgmprgrmr> In America Dexter airs on Showtime.
P9:32:01 <downer> [21:23] <fydo> strange

P9:32:07 <vdgmprgrmr> See!
P9:32:11 <fydo> maybe I'm lagged then?
P9:32:26 <fydo> either way, it doesn't make a difference
P9:32:41 <downer> 8===============D
P9:32:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes it does, because it caused ridiculous confusion.
P9:33:09 <vdgmprgrmr> You made a sentence that relied on events that never happened because of it, so obviously it mattered.
P9:34:10 <fydo> the best I can do is respond to the text that appears on my text in the order that it appears
P9:34:20 <vdgmprgrmr> So?
P9:34:21 <fydo> if you don't like it, you can go pout in the corner
P9:34:29 <vdgmprgrmr> You said it didn't make a difference, which it obviously did.
P9:34:55 <fydo> no, I meant, it doesn't matter if it's me that was lagged or if you were the one that was lagged
P9:35:02 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P9:35:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes it does.
P9:35:46 <fydo> how so? the same events would have unfolded regardless
P9:36:27 <fydo> the net effect is that there was a delay between us causing confusion in our conversation
P9:36:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh my god.
P9:36:55 <vdgmprgrmr> I fucking give up.
P9:37:05 <fydo> i'm flattered, but i'm no diety
P9:37:41 <vdgmprgrmr> There was nothing at all in that statement to show that it was directed at you.
P9:37:53 <fydo> how about the fact that we're engaged in conversation
P9:37:59 <Infinity> conversation is serious business
P9:38:00 <fydo> who else would you be talking to?
P9:38:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Right, because "Oh my god" is obviously fucking directed at you.
P9:38:15 <vdgmprgrmr> It's a statement of disappointment.
P9:38:16 <fydo> unless your god is someone else in the channel
P9:38:19 <vdgmprgrmr> It has no target.
P9:38:37 <Maulrus> Drakkar: can you kick both of them please?
P9:38:47 <Drakkar> huh
P9:38:48 <Drakkar> ho
P9:38:49 <Drakkar> guys
P9:38:50 <fydo> kick? for what reason?
P9:38:55 <Drakkar> oh*
P9:39:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I already said I give up, it's impossible to reason with people.
P9:39:10 <Drakkar> arguments kind of detract from enjoyability in the channel
P9:39:10 <Kinhoshi> wow, what a conversation. rofl
P9:39:19 <Drakkar> I would ask that you at least take it to pm
P9:39:23 <Drakkar> or maybe another channel
P9:39:27 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm already done.
P9:39:48 <fydo> no arguments here
P9:39:55 <Maulrus> apparently
P9:40:10 <Drakkar> good to hear
P9:40:31 <Drakkar> there's nothing wrong with friendly conversation but when it gets nasty it tends to make people not interested in talking
P9:40:42 <Drakkar> for fear of inflammatory action
P9:41:11 <vdgmprgrmr> We already get it.
P9:41:16 <Maulrus> wow following the path of that argument made me lulz
P9:41:24 <Drakkar> anyway
P9:41:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Thus is the result of lag.
P9:41:47 <vdgmprgrmr> And absurd failure to realize where a conversation is at any given time.
P9:42:12 <Drakkar> no I'm just establishing precedent
P9:42:30 <Infinity> because IRC is super srs bsns
P9:42:37 <fydo> while you're establishing precedent, it might be good to write up some channel rules
P9:42:44 <Drakkar> up to notch tbh
P9:43:19 <Maulrus> most channels don't really like stupid arguments on them
P9:43:28 <Maulrus> in my experience
P9:43:30 <fydo> Maulrus: I hear that
P9:43:44 <Drakkar> yeah that was pretty much my point
P9:44:00 <fydo> however, it can be frustrating if one is kicked when no clear rules are set
P9:44:09 <Drakkar> 'swhy I didn't kick :P
P9:44:13 <fydo> ;)
P9:44:17 <fydo> anyways, back to minecraft! :D

P10:10:35 <Zuriki> IMO
P10:10:40 <Maulrus> I agree
P10:10:45 <vdgmprgrmr> (Just so everyone knows, I'm being sarcastic here.)

P10:11:33 <Zuriki> Murals are boring now, too many of them.
P10:11:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, the normal radiation symbol is way better.
P10:11:55 <PuyoDead> onyl when they're just the 356th mario
P10:12:15 <vdgmprgrmr> The normal one can be easily drawn on school notebooks or doodled on quizzes. That's just way too intricate.
P10:12:28 <Maulrus> it's not just intricate
P10:12:32 <Maulrus> it's just stupid

P10:12:49 <Maulrus> it's like "ohh there's skulls and radiation and RUNBITCH RUN"

P10:12:51 <PuyoDead> what the hell? does it stand for "Holy shit, run! There's a radioactively powered skull after you!"

P10:39:44 <yoshibot> it doesn't.
P10:39:54 <Maulrus> stupid microsoft
P10:40:01 <yoshibot> it makes it the antithesis -- since it's already in the box, you'd never WANT to customize it :D
P10:40:24 <PuyoDead> "Neither Firefox nor Chrome provide guidance or enterprise tools. "

P10:41:17 <Maulrus> wat
P10:41:18 <Maulrus> 	  Knowing the top speed of a car doesn't tell you how fast you can drive in rush hour. To actually see the difference in page loads between all three browsers, you need slow-motion video. This one‚Äôs also a tie.

P10:41:55 <PuyoDead> I'm not sure I understand that one in the first place
P10:41:56 <Infinity> Firefox and Chrome have more support for emerging standards like HTML5 and CSS3, but Internet Explorer 8 invested heavily in having world-class, consistent support for the entire CSS2.1 specification. 
P10:41:58 <Infinity> lulwut
P10:41:59 <yoshibot> just because it can load pages faster doesn't mean you can percieve it loading faster
