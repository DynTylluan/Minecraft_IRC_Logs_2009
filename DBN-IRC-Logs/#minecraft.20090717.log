P12:02:20 <Azjherben> Yup
P12:02:23 <Jat> oh
P12:02:27 <Jat> thats awful :|
P12:02:27 <Azjherben> I do comment and enter alot though
P12:02:32 <Azjherben> I use enter alot
P12:02:44 <Jat> what editor do you use?
P12:02:54 <Azjherben> Dev-C++
P12:03:04 <Azjherben> I know
P12:03:11 <Azjherben> It's older
P12:03:23 <Jat> i generally use dev-c++ for c
P12:03:23 <Testvan> laid back
P12:03:29 <Jat> so its fine as far as im ocncerned
P12:03:34 <Testvan> my mind on my money and my money on my mind
P12:03:40 <Jat> but yuo know it has automatic indentation formatting?
P12:03:58 <Azjherben> It dosn't enter for me
P12:04:05 <Azjherben> I mean indent
P12:04:10 <Jat> when you press tab?
P12:04:21 <Jat> it deosnt maintain indentation across lines?
P12:04:36 <Azjherben> Don't press tab so I would not know. :)
P12:04:44 <Jat> lol D:
P12:04:47 <Jat> it would probably make it easier to debug your own code if it used proper indentation
P12:04:48 <Jat> but anyway
P12:04:58 <Jat> whats wrong with the program when you try to run it?
P12:05:19 <Azjherben> Other than it can olny do one person
P12:05:25 <Azjherben> When I try to connect
P12:05:38 <Azjherben> My origional Minecraft Program I download from minecraft.net
P12:05:43 <Azjherben> Says Azjherben Logged in
P12:05:53 <Azjherben> And In my internet explorer
P12:06:04 <Azjherben> I get stuck on the "Welcome to my server!" window
P12:06:21 <Jat> it shows that message but it doesnt download the map?
P12:06:49 <Azjherben> It dosn't
P12:07:02 <Azjherben> I don't think it does anything after sending the log in message
P12:07:11 <Jat> thats odd

P12:07:38 <Azjherben> ?
P12:08:00 <Jat> when you add using namespace std at the top of the file i dont think you need to put std:: in front of functions
P12:08:10 <Jat> unless you change namespaces part way through or something
P12:08:53 <Azjherben> I know
P12:09:46 <Jat> im kinda confused
P12:09:51 <Jat> this program is the proxy?
P12:10:46 <Azjherben> yup
P12:10:56 <Jat> why is it talking to itself?
P12:11:12 <Azjherben> It hosts
P12:11:18 <Azjherben> It's the proxy server
P12:11:31 <Azjherben> It basically hosts its OWN minecraft server
P12:11:43 <Azjherben> Except all that server says is what the origional server says
P12:11:50 <Jat> but the comments say its sending stuff to the proxy server... which is itself?
P12:12:04 <Jat> and receiving from the proxy server

P4:26:28 <JTE> I can't release it. I want to.

P4:26:32 <Eagle> We're on your side.
P4:26:33 <JTE> I really want to.

P4:26:57 <JTE> Maybe reprogram it in C ....
P4:27:19 <JTE> I'll release it when it's written in C
P4:27:34 <fydo> what's this script? why can't you release it?
P4:27:47 <JTE> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=900bd3fb849ae3c06ed146e7be2d14fd -- This fydo.
P4:27:51 <JTE> It's a server.
P4:27:53 <JTE> I wrote it.
P4:28:03 <JTE> They'll kill me for being nice. :3
P4:28:06 <Eagle> It's a superneato script that allows managing a server much easier and it's more fun for the rest of the people on the server too.
P4:28:09 <fydo> does it have any of Notch's code in it?
P4:28:11 <Eagle> Aaaand
P4:28:13 <JTE> None.
P4:28:14 <Eagle> No it doesn't.
P4:28:20 <Eagle> Completely from scratch.
P4:28:24 <fydo> no legal reason why you can't release it then
P4:28:37 <JTE> You don't need legal grounds to ban someone from a forum and IRC channel.
P4:28:38 <Eagle> They're threatening with the banhammer.
P4:28:50 <liq3> JTE: I'm not against you.
P4:28:53 <fydo> well, that's dumb
P4:29:05 <Testvan> just appeal to notch
P4:29:06 <JTE> Well THEY'RE dumb. And there's nothing I can do about it. :)
P4:29:14 <Eagle> Notch is against it.
P4:29:28 <JTE> God is against the demigod.
P4:29:42 <fydo> I'd think that creating something that potentially helps the community is certainly not grounds for a ban
P4:29:54 <JTE> Unfortunately, it is in the minecraft community.
P4:29:58 <fydo> apparently
P4:30:02 <liq3> fydo: The problem is that it may give free users paid-only features later on.
P4:30:17 <liq3> Personally I don't see why Notch can't work with JTE to make sure it won't.
P4:30:26 <JTE> As if that's not gonna happen anyway until Notch fixes the client to do otherwise.
P4:30:51 <JTE> It can't even do anything in the present and will get broken in the future.

P7:20:51 <Animator> Oh hey, it did.
P7:21:00 <Animator> How hard should coding a game be?
P7:21:39 <Animator> Shouldn't be too hard.
P7:22:52 <Animator> Just a bunch of magical commands summed up by somewhere.
P7:22:59 <Animator> Yeah. I'm totally not in denial.

P7:25:17 <PuyoDead> We believe in you, good sir
P7:25:38 <liq3> Animator: It's not THAT hard...
P7:25:57 <liq3> But if you've never programmed before, expect a good 100 hours to learn to make even a 2D game, unless you're like super smart.

P7:26:24 <liq3> Yeh. :P
P7:26:38 <liq3> 100 hours isn't that much. Good 1-2 weeks solid study. xD

P7:28:18 <Animator> The position is still up for grabs!
P7:28:41 <liq3> Animator: If you want to learn programming, make this games in your language of choice. Pong, Tetris (with menus and shit), Space Invadars. 
P7:28:47 <liq3> In order btw.
P7:29:04 <liq3> If you manage to make Space Invaders, and it works, you can easily make a 2D platformer.

P11:31:09 <Eagle> He's not.
P11:31:16 <Eagle> JTE isn't making another Minecraft

P11:31:43 <JTE> >.>;
P11:31:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Not make his own MC, but outdo Notch on his own game.
P11:31:50 <Eagle> JTE just coded the server in a different language and added some benifits.
P11:31:53 <Eagle> He is not.
P11:32:00 <Eagle> He is trying to let people have more fun.
P11:32:04 <pl0x> help me

P11:32:06 <JTE> JTE just wants to make it better for everyone, mew.
P11:32:09 <Eagle> JTE has no bad intentions.
P11:32:16 <Adura> Jetty is doing something cool.
P11:32:18 <vdgmprgrmr> It's still discomforting.
P11:32:27 <Eagle> maybe because you love notch too much
P11:32:36 <Eagle> Honestly.
P11:32:39 <Adura> Notch should be the only one to complain, if he wants too.
P11:32:49 <Adura> *-o
P11:32:52 <Eagle> The only reason Notch doesn't like JTE's server is because MAYBE
P11:32:52 <pl0x> ffs
P11:32:52 <vdgmprgrmr> I'll complain where I want.
P11:32:54 <Eagle> AT SOME POINT

P11:33:11 <Eagle> JTE's server MIGHT have the ability to do what Notch wants us to pay for

P11:33:44 <Eagle> Okay.
P11:33:51 <JTE> You don't seem to care much about anything at all, vdgmprgrmr.
P11:34:01 <Eagle> You hate it because you think that it oneups Notch.
P11:34:04 <Eagle> It DOES NOT.

P11:34:08 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said I hated it!

P11:35:06 <pl0x> No
P11:35:15 <pl0x> Im not being abusive
P11:35:20 <pl0x> Im asking for help
P11:35:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I find it discomforting that an external party has made a superior version to the original creator's version before the game even hit beta.
P11:35:24 <Eagle> Nobody here seems to be able or wants to help
P11:35:30 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, even after beta.
P11:35:30 <Eagle> vdgm
P11:35:36 <Eagle> He didn't make another minecraft
P11:35:39 <Adura> vdgmprgrmr, you shouldn't care, Notch should.
P11:35:41 <Eagle> It is STILL minecraft
P11:35:42 <vdgmprgrmr> I NEVER SAID HE DID.
P11:35:49 <pl0x> well you're a great community arn't you's
P11:35:50 <Eagle> NOBODY WOULD NOTICE
P11:35:56 <vdgmprgrmr> I said he made a superior VERSION.
P11:35:57 <Eagle> pl0x, sorry
P11:36:02 <Eagle> OF THE SERVER
P11:36:10 <Eagle> Not the Minecraft
P11:36:12 <vdgmprgrmr> And Adura, that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to care.
P11:36:25 <Adura> But you can't do anything about it.
P11:36:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, which is still a VERSION that people PLAY.
P11:36:30 <Eagle> Yes
P11:36:32 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't care!
P11:36:32 <Adura> So, it's silly to fret.
P11:36:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> pl0x
P11:36:36 <JTE> @.@;
P11:36:39 <Eagle> But it is not outdoing Notch in any way
P11:36:41 <pl0x> what?
P11:36:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> this place turns into a debate club every friday night
P11:36:47 <pl0x> You going to help
P11:36:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, it is. It has more than Notch's version.
P11:36:58 <pl0x> I don't care.
P11:37:01 <pl0x> I want help
P11:37:11 <pl0x> and if this is the community then you guys suck.
P11:37:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> at least i tried to help you
P11:37:12 <Eagle> That's because Notch's version sucks.
P11:37:13 <JTE> Yes, this community is terrible. I know. @.@;
P11:37:16 <pl0x> how?
P11:37:18 <pl0x> How?
P11:37:20 <Adura> Ok pl0x, restart your computer.
P11:37:24 <pl0x> Done that
P11:37:27 <Eagle> Update java
P11:37:30 <pl0x> done everything
P11:37:32 <Eagle> Try a different browser
P11:37:33 <pl0x> Latest
P11:37:37 <pl0x> tried
P11:37:37 <Adura> Install a Linux VM.
P11:37:41 <pl0x> wtf?
P11:37:46 <pl0x> are they free?
P11:37:49 <Adura> http://www.virtualbox.org/
P11:37:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> what browsers have you used?
P11:37:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch's version sucks?
P11:37:52 <Adura> It's free.
P11:37:56 <Eagle> Currently it does.
P11:37:57 <pl0x> Firefox and IE
P11:37:58 <Adura> Now, try running it on the Linux VM.
P11:38:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I disagree.
P11:38:06 <Adura> Report back when you're done.
P11:38:09 <Eagle> It's a buggy ducttape alpha version.
P11:38:15 <vdgmprgrmr> It's still fun.
P11:38:16 <Eagle> JTE just coded it better.
P11:38:23 <vdgmprgrmr> EXACTLY
P11:38:24 <Eagle> That is the only difference.
P11:38:27 <pl0x> K ill download this stuff
P11:38:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Which I find awkward.
P11:38:30 <pl0x> then what i do?
P11:38:31 <Eagle> You don't like it when people do stuff better?
P11:38:43 <Eagle> I guess you hate every professional sports player.
P11:38:43 <pl0x> lol 67mbs
P11:38:46 <pl0x> wtf?
P11:38:52 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I don't like it when people don't even give the dev a chance to finish the goddamn game.
P11:39:01 <Adura> The Linux ISO will be 10 times that.
P11:39:05 <Adura> So, get crackin' now.
P11:39:05 <AnnihilatorBeta> it ain't that eagle, it just creates fear outta some people who think they might take over what notch's been wishing to do
P11:39:05 <Eagle> The server ISN'T the game.
P11:39:14 <vdgmprgrmr> It may as well be!
P11:39:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Seeing how it controls the gameplay in that server.
P11:39:23 <Eagle> Okay, lemme ask you.
P11:39:32 <Eagle> If you play singleplayer Minecraft
P11:39:38 <Eagle> Does it involve a server at all
P11:39:56 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said the original version ceased to exist, now did I?
P11:40:00 <Eagle> Yes you did.
P11:40:03 <Eagle> Pretty much.
P11:40:04 <vdgmprgrmr> NO I DID NOT
P11:40:05 <liq3> Eagle: If JTE released the server as Perl source files, people would be able to mod it to gain access to paid-only features later on.
P11:40:09 <pl0x> >.>
P11:40:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I said that JTE made a superior VERSION.
P11:40:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> all original goes to infiniminer
P11:40:16 <JTE> The client controls all the physics and everything.
P11:40:16 <Eagle> liq: That is what I told vdgm
P11:40:20 <pl0x> <.<
P11:40:24 <pl0x> >.>
P11:40:24 <JTE> The server only relays messages between clients.
P11:40:32 <Eagle> He doesn't like it because he thinks that it oneups Notch.
P11:40:35 <Eagle> That is the only reason.
P11:40:37 <liq3> Eagle: That's why people are getting mad. They don't want Notch to lose sales because of JTE.
P11:40:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> ... well, MC is based off of infiniminer, and you can get the source for that
P11:40:42 <Eagle> I KNOW THIS
P11:40:47 <Eagle> I'm on your side!
P11:40:49 <liq3> JTE: Does also control block.s :P
P11:40:53 <vdgmprgrmr> If you people aren't even going to fucking listen to what I'm saying, I'm not going to argue.
P11:40:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Because it's pointless.
P11:41:01 <Adura> Exactly.
P11:41:07 <Eagle> Okay, if you don't listen to what we say, then we won't argue.
P11:41:09 <Eagle> So let's stop.
P11:41:10 <Eagle> :P
P11:41:23 <liq3> Eagle: what is the argument about anyway?
P11:41:23 <JTE> @.@;
P11:41:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Awesome, just be an asshole.
P11:41:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> cool game
P11:41:37 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: What's the argument about?
P11:41:41 <Eagle> vdgm doesn't like JTE's server because he thinks it oneups Notch
P11:41:45 <Eagle> liq
P11:41:48 <Adura> Too much wasted effort talking about Jetty's server.
P11:41:52 <vdgmprgrmr> MAYBE YOU SHOULD FUCKING LET ME ANSWER?
P11:42:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> jetty's server?
P11:42:02 <Eagle> Turn down the caps.
P11:42:08 <Adura> I call JTE Jetty. :P
P11:42:14 <liq3> Adura: Why?
P11:42:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Instead of telling other people what I'm saying without a grasp on what I'm saying?
P11:42:17 <Eagle> Why not?
P11:42:24 <Eagle> Dude
P11:42:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> cause it sounds better?
P11:42:27 <Adura> I feel like it? Less highlighty?
P11:42:32 <liq3> Adura: kk
P11:42:42 <JTE> Heh.
P11:42:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm feeling that every little detail said in this chat evolves into a debate of some sort
P11:43:09 <liq3> Annihilator: Nah it doesn't.
P11:43:13 <Eagle> <vdgmprgrmr> Because it seems like total one-upps-manship.
10P11:43:20 * MisterX (MisterX@p5DDE7462.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
P11:43:23 <Eagle> How do I not know what you are talking about
P11:43:27 <Eagle> When you said it
P11:43:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> and the sides are all the same
P11:43:32 <pl0x> ok
P11:43:34 <pl0x> i downloaded
P11:43:35 <pl0x> it
P11:43:36 <vdgmprgrmr> I think JTE has made a superior version of MC (sure, it's just the damn server, but the server still dictates how it's played, otherwise editing the server wouldn't change the gameplay at all) before Notch even got significantly far into the game.
P11:43:37 <pl0x> now what
P11:43:38 <liq3> What IS one-upps-manship? o.O
P11:43:42 <vdgmprgrmr> And I don't like that.
P11:43:47 <pl0x> NOW WHAT!
P11:43:52 <Eagle> vdgm has JTE taken credit for Minecraft?
P11:44:03 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said he did.
P11:44:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I said he made a superior version.
P11:44:10 <Eagle> Then why do you have a problem with it
P11:44:12 <Eagle> That is good
P11:44:17 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it's not good.
P11:44:19 <Eagle> Notch will outdo JTE later
P11:44:26 <Eagle> When he does finish it
P11:44:31 <Eagle> But for NOW
P11:44:38 <Eagle> We have JTE
P11:44:41 <Eagle> That is all.
P11:44:42 <JTE> All JTE did was add admin commands, kick hacking attempts, and enforce Spleef rules. @.@;
P11:44:43 <liq3> I still don't see why Notch can't help JTE enough so JTE can make a version of JTE's server that won't give free users paid-only features.
P11:44:52 <vdgmprgrmr> JTE, you also added new blocks.
P11:44:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> say what? you downloaded linux vm?
P11:44:56 <Eagle> Wha
P11:44:59 <Eagle> No he didn't.
P11:45:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah he did.
P11:45:04 <liq3> JTE: People only care if you realese it... I think.
P11:45:06 <Eagle> :O
P11:45:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Super-sponge?
P11:45:11 <Eagle> Oh, pff
P11:45:14 <liq3> Eagle: he did...
P11:45:14 <vdgmprgrmr> DYNAMITE
P11:45:17 <Adura> Install a Linux distro.
P11:45:18 <Eagle> I thought you meant different blocks.
P11:45:20 <Adura> I suggest Ubuntu.
P11:45:22 <Eagle> Like DIFFERENT
P11:45:23 <JTE> I can't add new block types. They'd crash the client.
P11:45:44 <Eagle> He just gave a sponge the ability to suck lava
P11:45:45 <vdgmprgrmr> JTE, so you're saying that when I got on your server that block list I saw wasn't there?
P11:45:46 <Eagle> You don't like that?
P11:45:47 <JTE> You'd make a lava sponge too if your server had a rainbow diamond full of lava that some moron op insisted on keeping
P11:45:49 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: Servers can only change how blocks behave.
P11:45:57 <JTE> which constantly flooded your server from griefing.
P11:46:13 <vdgmprgrmr> He's still outdoing Notch at his own product.
P11:46:21 <Eagle> His own product.
P11:46:26 <liq3> vdgmprpgrmr: That's Notch's fault.
P11:46:28 <Eagle> He is outdoing Notch at Minecraft.
P11:46:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is a bit of a dick move if you ask me.
P11:46:47 <Eagle> Notch is still getting all the money.
P11:47:01 <Eagle> JTE doesn't want to infringe on Notch's moneyrights
P11:47:04 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not about fucking money.
P11:47:07 <Adura> I'm not asking you, heh.
P11:47:09 <liq3> vdgmprgrmr: Hey, I'm making my own server too. Lets see if I can manage to add finite water to it before Notch eH?
P11:47:12 <JTE> Everything I do is "a dick move" to you. Yes, I know this already.
P11:47:13 <pl0x> GUYS
P11:47:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> you can say that again
P11:47:18 <pl0x> WHAT DO I DO NOWWWWWWWW
P11:47:21 <pl0x> tell me
P11:47:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said that either!
P11:47:25 <Eagle> I don't know.
P11:47:35 <Eagle> pl0x what did just do?
P11:47:39 <Eagle> I wasn't paying attention.
P11:47:41 <vdgmprgrmr> If we're allowed to just say random shit about people, then I guess I'll join in.
P11:47:44 <Adura> Download the Ubuntu ISO already, read the Virtualbox docs.
P11:47:50 <JTE> No, I mean I've been hearing this phrase a lot. Directed at me. From this stupid community who hates me. :D
P11:47:54 <pl0x> Im on windows
P11:47:54 <pl0x> wtf
P11:47:56 <JTE> I understand.
P11:48:06 <liq3> Adura: What's virtualbox?
P11:48:07 <Eagle> pl0x I think he's getting you to change OS's.
P11:48:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm not stupid :<
P11:48:08 <Eagle> >>;
P11:48:14 <pl0x> OMfg
P11:48:14 <Adura> Damn it pl0x, stop acting like you're dumb.
P11:48:22 <pl0x> dude
P11:48:30 <pl0x> why do i need ubntu
P11:48:34 <pl0x> im on windows
P11:48:45 <Adura> To get you to do something instead of constantly asking for help.
P11:48:54 <liq3> plox: Sounds like a work around to play Minecraft.
P11:49:03 <pl0x> yes
P11:49:08 <pl0x> I want to host my server
P11:49:14 <pl0x> can i do that with this?
P11:49:17 <liq3> yes.
P11:49:21 <Adura> Sure, I've done it.
P11:49:23 <pl0x> ok
P11:49:30 <pl0x> Im at the system boot screen
P11:49:35 <Adura> If it still craps out, I don't know what your issue is.
P11:49:41 <Eagle> Crappy computer?
P11:49:41 <pl0x> and it says system boot halted
P11:49:44 <Adura> Read the Virtualbox docs.
P11:49:57 <Adura> Don't ask about it here, I doubt anyone knows how to help you with it.
P11:50:26 <pl0x> you're a great community arn't you
P11:50:38 <Eagle> We're just a dumb community.
P11:50:43 <Eagle> We're doing the best we can.
P11:50:47 <Adura> Do you really expect good support on a product in Alpha?
13P11:50:50 * JTE sighs...
P11:51:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> hey, sorry i couldn't help you out
P11:51:18 <JTE> Or you could just use JTE's server and have it work without Linux or cygwin or anything... Oops, I can't give it to you. :(
P11:51:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> but maybe if you come back tomorrow some more experienced people might be here
P11:51:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> like daytime, it's midnight
P11:51:41 <pl0x> I cannot wait till tomorrow
P11:51:44 <Adura> Quiet Jetty, I'm trying to get them to shut up.
P11:51:48 <Eagle> That impatient?
P11:51:51 <pl0x> people have been counting on me
P11:51:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> then you gotta leave yourself some patience
P11:51:54 <pl0x> to run server
P11:51:56 <pl0x> and i cannot
P11:51:58 <Eagle> Tell them to wait.
P11:52:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> pl0x
P11:52:02 <pl0x> No
P11:52:07 <Eagle> Then go away.
P11:52:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> fire up a server and give us the link
P11:52:08 <JTE> Is something else already listening on the port?
P11:53:05 <pl0x> k
P11:53:10 <pl0x> No
P11:53:16 <pl0x> none of my ports use 25565
P11:53:27 <pl0x> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=427bfd0aa83f6bf8b35f0dec0f0697b4
P11:53:33 <liq3> Isn't pl0x getting the "Wrong OS version: Windows Vista" error?
P11:53:37 <liq3> ...guess not?
P11:53:44 <pl0x> windows xp
P11:53:45 <pl0x> I have
P11:53:47 <JTE> No, liq3.
P11:53:50 <JTE> I already asked that.
P11:53:53 <liq3> pl0x: You have a router?
12P11:53:55 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P11:54:00 <pl0x> I've configed it
P11:54:06 <liq3> So, 25565 is forwarded?
P11:54:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> pl0x, i can't connect
P11:54:08 <pl0x> Look
P11:54:16 <pl0x> I've ran it before
P11:54:28 <Eagle> Update your server client?
P11:54:33 <liq3> Double check your router and firewall. :/
P11:54:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> server client?
P11:54:36 <pl0x> whats that?
10P11:54:38 * vdgmprgrmr (vdgmprgrmr@12.173.3.190) has joined #minecraft
P11:54:40 <pl0x> Server client?
P11:54:42 <Eagle> Er
P11:54:45 <JTE> I think the phrase "server client" is retarded too.
P11:54:47 <liq3> he means the .jar file.
P11:54:52 <Eagle> >>;
P11:54:54 <pl0x> How i update that>
P11:54:58 <liq3> i.e. make sure it's the latest version.
P11:54:59 <Eagle> Go to Multiplayer
P11:55:01 <liq3> You do that by downloading it again. :P
P11:55:13 <Adura> Server client... Near far... Wet dry...
P11:55:15 <pl0x> I tried that
P11:55:23 <pl0x> I've tried it all
P11:55:25 <liq3> pl0x:.... ok.
P11:55:30 <Eagle> I guess it'd be your firewall or something
P11:55:34 <pl0x> so i think it may conflict with it's self
P11:55:39 <pl0x> tried firewall off
P11:55:41 <pl0x> nope
P11:56:01 <liq3> pl0x: Start your server, then go here: http://www.canyouseeme.org/ Then check port 25565. If it's not open, YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR FIREWALL AND ROUTER.
P11:56:02 <Eagle> Hm.
P11:56:28 <Kinhoshi> I see his server in the server list, but cannot connect. *shrug*
P11:56:34 <Eagle> I was about to ask if his internet was down. XP
P11:56:38 <pl0x> Im only going to say this once
P11:56:42 <Eagle> Does this make me a bad person?
P11:56:46 <pl0x> I'VE CONFIGURED IT
P11:56:57 <pl0x> DO not ask if the firewall/router is problem
P11:57:03 <liq3> pl0x: I don't believe you unless you cehck with that site.
P11:57:05 <liq3> So stfu until you do.
P11:57:11 <pl0x> I have a port checker
P11:57:20 <pl0x> thank you very much
P11:57:22 <liq3> I don't care. Check with that site. :
P11:57:23 <liq3> :/
P11:57:32 <liq3> I know it's 100% reliable.
P11:57:37 <pl0x> fine
P11:57:44 <pl0x> ill play your stupid game
P11:58:10 <pl0x> Success: I can see your service on 124.197.8.206 on port (25565) Your ISP is not blocking port 25565
P11:58:12 <pl0x> Happy
P11:58:16 <liq3> yep. :]
P11:58:26 <pl0x> anyway
P11:58:27 <JTE> He already said what the error message was, too.
P11:58:28 <liq3> you using a static local IP?
P11:58:35 <JTE> The server says the connection gets aborted.
P11:58:38 <liq3> JTE: There was an error?
P11:58:43 <JTE> i.e. it's accepted and then poof.
P11:59:00 <liq3> possibly router or IPS is limiting number of connectionS?
P11:59:04 <JTE> Geeze, none of you were paying any attention to him. :(
P11:59:14 <liq3> JTE: I know, I only joined after he started yelling lol.
P11:59:14 <pl0x> No it's conflicting with software
P11:59:25 <pl0x> so java
P11:59:27 <pl0x> i.e
P11:59:34 <liq3> pl0x: use a different port? -_-
P11:59:38 <pl0x> tried
P11:59:41 <pl0x> still failed
P11:59:45 <JTE> Use a different Java? :3
P11:59:48 <liq3> lol.
P11:59:48 <liq3> xD
P11:59:50 <pl0x> :o
P11:59:51 <Adura> The VM will work if they read the docs and get it running.
13P11:59:52 * JTE hates Java. :(
P11:59:52 <pl0x> How?
