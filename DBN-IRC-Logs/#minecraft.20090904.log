A12:00:06 <vede> Just because your brain sees it differently means nothing other than things in your brain.
A12:00:06 <mib_t2k2w9> Yes, but people see it differently.
A12:00:17 <mib_t2k2w9> Which are everything.
A12:00:24 <mail2345|afk> the univese is objective
A12:00:25 <mib_t2k2w9> What you see is what matters.
A12:00:28 <mail2345|afk> not subjective
A12:00:31 <mail2345|afk> but eh.
A12:00:36 <vede> What you see is what matters to you.
A12:00:40 <mib_t2k2w9> Exactly.
A12:00:42 <Visiiri> Time might be a constant. seconds, minutes hours.
A12:00:43 <mail2345|afk> i should get back to being afk
A12:00:43 <Visiiri> But
A12:00:52 <vede> But that doesn't mean it's actually real.
A12:00:53 <Visiiri> It's not something that can be constant in all situations.

A12:00:57 <Visiiri> Walking a mile is a mile
A12:00:59 <PuyoDead> you should, don't you fall for it too, mail
A12:01:01 <mib_t2k2w9> So I won't wait as long if I don't care as much.
A12:01:04 <mail2345|afk> eh.
A12:01:08 <Visiiri> Walking a kilometer is a kilometer
A12:01:13 <mail2345|afk> gp puyo
A12:01:17 <mail2345|afk> back to afk stuff
A12:01:17 <Visiiri> Drinking two liters is peeing two liters
A12:01:23 <vede> You assume that just seeing things different ACTUALLY CHANGES THEM.
A12:01:28 <mib_t2k2w9> Honestly, puyo, I didn't come in here expecting to troll vede, he just wants it so bad.
A12:01:36 <PuyoDead> ehh, it happens
A12:01:38 <vede> Riiight.
A12:01:46 <mib_t2k2w9> Yes, I targeted you.
A12:01:47 <mib_t2k2w9> Vede.
A12:01:48 <Visiiri> Let's have a vote
A12:01:49 <vede> You're the one saying that your mind makes the universe change.
A12:01:55 <mib_t2k2w9> You were my goal all along.
13A12:02:01 * Visiiri proposes: IS TIME CONSTANT? (Y/N)
A12:02:02 <Visiiri> N
A12:02:04 <vede> Y
A12:02:08 <mib_t2k2w9> IN
A12:02:10 <mib_t2k2w9> Lol
A12:02:11 <mib_t2k2w9> N
A12:02:11 <PuyoDead> B
A12:02:12 <mail2345|afk> @mib who are you anyway?
A12:02:58 <mib_t2k2w9> I play a lot of Minecraft.
A12:03:01 <mib_t2k2w9> :]
A12:03:12 <Visiiri> Well, to conclude, reality is only what you think is real. There is no "real". It what you see. It's what you think.
A12:03:12 <vede> Time may not appear constant to your mind, but the particles in the universe WILL NOT speed up or slow down based on your brain.
A12:03:16 <mib_t2k2w9> Lol.
A12:03:19 <Visiiri> No device can tell you that.
A12:03:27 <mib_t2k2w9> But my brain can't tell the difference.
A12:03:30 <vede> There is a reality, EVEN IF we don't see it correctly.
A12:03:31 <Visiiri> Is red the same color for everyone?
A12:03:40 <vede> Doesn't matter.
A12:03:44 <Visiiri> Vede, does time move constantly in this reality?
A12:03:47 <mib_t2k2w9> Oh shit, visiiri no no no.
A12:03:52 <vede> There is only one reality.
A12:04:00 <Visiiri> Ugh
A12:04:01 <Visiiri> brb
A12:04:03 <Visiiri> I'm starving
A12:04:08 <Visiiri> I haven't eaten it eight hours
A12:04:09 <PuyoDead> is that wall behind you... REALLY THERE!?
A12:04:15 <vede> Yes, it is.
A12:04:29 <mib_t2k2w9> Vede, we all agree that time is constant, it's just not the same in our minds.
A12:04:31 <PuyoDead> *chuckle* I love that one
A12:04:49 <mib_t2k2w9> Even I objected the color question.
A12:04:52 <vede> You don't seem to be saying that.
A12:05:24 <vede> You're saying that "time goes faster or slower based on the person" which is not true. It simply appears to be going faster or slower to the person.
A12:05:54 <mib_t2k2w9> But you see, my head is the only one I'm using. It's the only one I'll ever ever see.

A12:06:01 <vede> So?
A12:06:05 <mib_t2k2w9> If time seems to go faster to me, it essentially has.
A12:06:13 <vede> No, it has not.
A12:06:37 <mib_t2k2w9> For all purposes, yes, because it seemed that way to me, the only reality I'll ever know, or need, is the one I see.
A12:06:43 <vede> The particles in the universe will keep going their standard ways.
A12:06:58 <vede> Right, so you need to stop saying that time literally moves faster.
A12:06:59 <mib_t2k2w9> But they won't always seem like it, and in that lies my point. 
A12:07:22 <vede> And acknowledge that it's only in your mind that it goes faster.
A12:07:37 <mib_t2k2w9> But it's only your mind that matters to you.
A12:07:47 <vede> That's like a person saying "Once you get used to it, it doesn't happen anymore."
A12:07:48 <Visiiri> Vede, there is "eye witness" evedence that suggests it, and nothing that goes against it.

A12:08:22 <asiekierka> Omg
A12:08:24 <asiekierka> I had a dream
A12:08:30 <PuyoDead> you did!?
A12:08:30 <asiekierka> where Notch gave me the source code to minecraftr
A12:08:32 <asiekierka> minecraft*
A12:08:35 <Visiiri> lol
A12:08:35 <aeiowu> hahaha
A12:08:35 <asiekierka> so i can work on it
A12:08:37 <Visiiri> and you lost it
A12:08:38 <asiekierka> while he's in indonesia
A12:08:38 <asiekierka> No
A12:08:40 <asiekierka> Actually I had it
A12:08:45 <aeiowu> what'd it look like
A12:08:47 <asiekierka> But there was some... problems with it
A12:08:49 <asiekierka> I think we fixed it
A12:08:50 <aeiowu> commit it to screen!
A12:08:51 <asiekierka> I got the ZIP
A12:08:53 <asiekierka> then I woke up
A12:08:53 <mib_t2k2w9> It was bananas.
10A12:08:57 * PD-lt (PD-lt@c220-239-226-191.carlnfd1.nsw.optusnet.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A12:09:01 <asiekierka> so i missed the source code part
A12:09:06 <mib_t2k2w9> That's BA, NA, NA, S.
A12:09:12 <asiekierka> Actually
A12:09:18 <asiekierka> I should practice lucid dreaming now
A12:09:22 <asiekierka> to access that dream
A12:09:28 <asiekierka> and maybe actually GET the minecraft source code
A12:09:32 <vede> Heh.
A12:09:49 <asiekierka> Or find out that I lost it anyway
A12:09:59 <asiekierka> I hope this would happen in real life
A12:10:00 <PuyoDead> good luck getting the words to stay the same :P
A12:10:00 <asiekierka> :P
A12:10:07 <PuyoDead> that's always fun in lucid dreaming
A12:10:13 <asiekierka> I didn't see the words
A12:10:19 <asiekierka> I remember he said some stuff... and a link.
A12:10:21 <PuyoDead> "Why the hell does that sign keep changing!?"
A12:10:25 <asiekierka> Then some more words
A12:10:34 <vede> You should be extra awesome, and make your mind actually affect the fabric of reality so the source code is on your computer in real life, too. >.>
A12:10:42 <asiekierka> vede: That's impossible
A12:10:46 <mib_t2k2w9> Lol.
A12:10:48 <vede> Heh.
A12:10:49 <asiekierka> except if you work at Intel and you're VERY psychic
A12:11:06 <asiekierka> so you can actually subliminally send the hex data to your subconscious
A12:11:15 <asiekierka> then send electrical impulses to the CPU to do just that
A12:11:26 <vede> Well, asiekierka agrees with me, and asiekierka's awesome, so obviously I win.
A12:11:28 <asiekierka> Then I wake up and I find out I just overwrote the master boot record
A12:11:36 <Visiiri> I'm psychic.
A12:11:43 <asiekierka> Visiiri: Okay, prove it
A12:11:49 <Visiiri> Well, it's not easy.
A12:11:53 <mib_t2k2w9> Oh, haha, okay vede. Looks like you win. I'm completely swayed.
A12:11:56 <Visiiri> If I know people, it helps
A12:12:02 <mib_t2k2w9> Your logic is incredible.
A12:12:04 <vede> Visiiri, what am I wearing?
A12:12:15 <asiekierka> Visiiri, I thought of a random number between 3 and 13.
A12:12:18 <Visiiri> Psychosis doesn't work like that.
A12:12:18 <asiekierka> What is it?
A12:12:22 <vede> It's just like how physical strength makes you more intelligent, mibbit-user.
A12:12:26 <Visiiri> It's not reading minds.
A12:12:31 <mib_t2k2w9> Ah!
A12:12:35 <asiekierka> But that can be done
A12:12:35 <mib_t2k2w9> Of course!
A12:12:38 <asiekierka> though it's way too unethical
A12:12:40 <Visiiri> It's not "seeing the future"
A12:12:47 <asiekierka> That's also possible!
A12:12:48 <Visiiri> In that sense, it's predicting an event

A12:12:52 <Visiiri> Before it happens
A12:12:56 <mib_t2k2w9> It must be your shining physique that grants you such supreme power.
A12:13:05 <vede> Wait, so you have basic instinct, Visiiri?
A12:13:06 <Darkebrz> Hmm

A12:13:10 <Visiiri> I, for one, believe in the string theory
A12:13:12 <Darkebrz> Im going to make a Minecraft Let's Play
A12:13:16 <asiekierka> So do I :P
A12:13:17 <vede> omfg u can predict ur suroundigns
A12:13:18 <Visiiri> vede, no.
A12:13:22 <asiekierka> And in a random seed theory in a way
A12:13:23 <Visiiri> >.<
A12:13:38 <Visiiri> Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
A12:13:45 <asiekierka> Yes or No
A12:13:49 <Visiiri> So what you see, and a "dream"
A12:13:59 <Visiiri> Sometimes overlap
A12:14:05 <Visiiri> Letting you see in your dream
A12:14:16 <asiekierka> You know
A12:14:20 <asiekierka> I wish I was psychic
A12:14:22 <asiekierka> and knew Notch
A12:14:29 <Visiiri> lol
A12:14:36 <vede> So the only thing you actually learn is things in your dream.
A12:14:39 <asiekierka> So I could try to motivate Notch to release the sauce code
A12:14:42 <Visiiri> Well, no.
A12:14:52 <vede> Which may or may not happen to coincide with reality.
A12:15:03 <Visiiri> There are some things, like preminissions, that occor when your dream strings and your "reality" strings twist

A12:15:21 <asiekierka> And that's lucid
A12:15:36 <asiekierka> Whoever is the first to edit a wikipedia article while lucid dreaming
A12:15:39 <asiekierka> is an epic winner
A12:15:47 <vede> So... you're... either dreaming lucidly, or sleepwalking, because you're talking like you have magic powers or some crap.
A12:15:56 <asiekierka> Psychic != magic powers
A12:15:56 <geekahedron> it's not too hard to get the source code from a java package anyway
A12:15:57 <vede> So I have no idea what you're trying to say.
A12:15:58 <Visiiri> If you choose to believe it like that.
A12:16:05 <asiekierka> geekahedron: But that's wrong
A12:16:12 <asiekierka> I mean that Notch explictly allowed me to edit it
A12:16:14 <vede> ONLY MORALLY
A12:16:20 <Visiiri> But can you explain why my best friend visited me the night before he got hit by a bus?
A12:16:21 <asiekierka> in the dream
A12:16:25 <Visiiri> I called him that morning.
A12:16:29 <Visiiri> I told him to watch out.
A12:16:38 <Visiiri> But I was on the fucking phone with him when it happened. :<
A12:16:46 <asiekierka> Visiiri: Was he psychic?
A12:16:49 <Visiiri> No
A12:16:52 <Visiiri> He was a dumbass.
A12:16:54 <Visiiri> >.<
A12:16:59 <Visiiri> I didn't "like" the guy
A12:16:59 <asiekierka> probably his subconscious >.>
A12:17:12 <Visiiri> You know, I can't prove it.
A12:17:32 <asiekierka> Maybe it was YOU that visited HIM, you just didn't know about it
A12:17:37 <asiekierka> Or prediction
A12:17:43 <Visiiri> But there are some things that I can know.
A12:17:48 <Visiiri> Some things that come to me
A12:18:13 <Visiiri> have you seen Star Wars?

A12:18:30 <Visiiri> Oh fuck
A12:18:30 <mib_t2k2w9> Broke?
A12:18:32 <TestDummy> yes
A12:18:35 <vede> Yeah...
A12:18:37 <Visiiri> Here comes trolls :<
A12:18:39 <mib_t2k2w9> I'm sorry.
13A12:18:40 * TestDummy points at mail2345
A12:18:46 <asiekierka> What are the chances of a dream coming true
A12:18:49 <Visiiri> What did he do?
A12:18:53 <mib_t2k2w9> Wow, he's so much more obvious than I was.
A12:18:57 <TestDummy> Nothing.
A12:18:58 <asiekierka> 1%? 0.pi%? 0.000000(0)1%?
A12:19:01 <Visiiri> Asiekierka, that depends on your strings.
A12:19:03 <TestDummy> Just got my attention, that's all.
A12:19:06 <vede> Predicting an entirely random event before it happens with no reason to believe it will happen == MAGIC
A12:19:11 <Visiiri> When they twine, it's 100%
A12:19:17 <Visiiri> Ok. 
A12:19:20 <mail2345> eh, back
A12:19:20 <Darkebrz> Well
A12:19:21 <asiekierka> I just saw that dream
A12:19:21 <Visiiri> He got your attention.
A12:19:25 <Darkebrz> I AM IN A FUCKING HELL CAVE

A12:19:28 <mail2345> wait what
A12:19:29 <Visiiri> Before people start trolling again...
A12:19:30 <vede> Or very good luck.
A12:19:34 <asiekierka> And i'm pretty sure... er... that wouldn't happen
A12:19:37 <asiekierka> Notch is not like that
A12:19:39 <Darkebrz> I demand everyone try that map
A12:19:45 <Darkebrz> Its horrid
A12:19:49 <asiekierka> And I don't believe a dream can be fulfilled in 3 weeks
A12:19:54 <mail2345> @TestDummy what?
A12:19:54 <Darkebrz> First of all there are about 7 creepers at the entrance
A12:20:10 <Darkebrz> Then there are also several more, including 5 zombies and a shitload of skeletons
A12:20:16 <TestDummy> mail2345: Ghost. :o
A12:20:19 <TestDummy> Boo!
A12:20:25 <geekahedron> asiekierka: did you make that claymation video?
A12:20:28 <vede> Goddamn I wish Notch didn't make enemies die of loneliness RIGHT BEFORE he left.
A12:20:30 <vede> THE BASTARD
A12:20:32 <Visiiri> It doesn't work you whore.
A12:20:51 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Yeah but vede.. that would consider "predicting". I mean if I guessed a number between 1-10 you were thinking... and I guess "8" and it's "8" it doesn't mean I predicted it =/.
A12:20:55 <asiekierka> geekahedron: Yes

A12:21:09 <asiekierka> also
A12:21:14 <asiekierka> I rarely get dreams
A12:21:15 <vede>  _03?

A12:21:21 <asiekierka> Like, I get no dreams at all most of the time
A12:21:29 <vede> What the fuck does _03 mean?
A12:21:35 <asiekierka> 0.24_03
A12:21:40 <vede> Ew.
A12:21:43 <tungsten> Is this a good place to shoot suggestions around for minecraft?
A12:21:46 <asiekierka> and 0.24_02 :P
A12:21:49 <Nohbdy|Xeros> probably lol
A12:21:55 <asiekierka> _02 did have the water bug
A12:21:58 <asiekierka> and _03 didn't
A12:21:59 <mib_t2k2w9> When we're not arguing the relativity of time, yeah.
A12:22:02 <geekahedron> sure, W

A12:22:11 <asiekierka> geekahedron: haha
A12:22:12 <Visiiri> LOL
A12:22:15 <tungsten> The exploding creeps
A12:22:18 <Visiiri> There's twenty mushrooms
A12:22:21 <Visiiri> next to an army
A12:22:23 <asiekierka> you made a skin of a clay version of a skin made by Quatroking
A12:22:23 <tungsten> Can they drop bomb bits?
A12:22:31 <tungsten> It would be incredibly useful
A12:22:32 <geekahedron> yes :P
A12:22:37 <mib_t2k2w9> Also, hellcave, good mushrooms across the lava.
A12:22:42 <tungsten> Instead of just exploding
A12:22:43 <asiekierka> the skin is awesome
A12:22:44 <geekahedron> not yes to you, W
A12:22:53 <tungsten> oh
A12:23:03 <PuyoDead> hey, TestDummy is back
A12:23:05 <geekahedron> but yes, people have suggested being able to carry bombs of some kind
A12:23:09 <PuyoDead> yay for being observant!
A12:23:10 <TestDummy> Sort of.
A12:23:31 <asiekierka> also
A12:23:36 <asiekierka> did anyone play the notchsong in reverse yet
A12:23:37 <tungsten> It would be much more useful
A12:23:49 <tungsten> allowing actual mining and sculpting to take place
A12:23:51 <Visiiri> No
A12:23:53 <Visiiri> Why?
A12:23:53 <TestDummy> wtf notchsong
A12:23:55 <geekahedron> what other chemical elements would make good irc names
A12:23:58 <Visiiri> does it sing something?
A12:24:07 <Visiiri> TestDummy, please be a little more polite :<
A12:24:07 <PuyoDead> oh hell... you didn't put something in reverse, did you?
A12:24:10 <geekahedron> I have a friend on foonetic whose nickname is "Potassium"
A12:24:11 <tungsten> Strontium?
A12:24:14 <geekahedron> I call him "K"
A12:24:21 <geekahedron> and tungsten can be shortened to "W"

A12:24:52 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Oh btw people, you don't have to type "Nohbdy|Xeros" to get my attention. This stupid mIRC doesn't notify me that my name has been called unlike mibbit, so you can just say Nohbdy or Xeros lol.
A12:25:01 <mib_t2k2w9> Ignorant to the periodic table of elements?

A12:56:10 <Hunter2458> Not too uncommon.
A12:56:10 <mib_theguythatwashereforabit> Such a web of secrecy.
A12:56:23 <Hunter2458> keely was her name though.
A12:56:36 <Hunter2458> Not much of a stretch to nickname.
A12:56:46 <geekahedron> gahhh
A12:56:50 <mib_theguythatwashereforabit> I wonder how it came about.
A12:56:56 <Hunter2458> I wouldn't know.
A12:57:05 <geekahedron> I hate the disappearing mobs =[
A12:57:10 <Hunter2458> lol
10A12:57:12 * mib_theguythatwashereforabit is now known as jockmo42
A12:58:36 <geekahedron> also the ridiculously unforgiving falling damage
A12:59:03 <jockmo42> I think it's pretty fair. You can't just fall off a cliff and not expect your knees to explode.
A12:59:17 <geekahedron> but two blocks?
A12:59:48 <Griskard> Geek
A12:59:54 <Griskard> You can fall of three and be ok
A12:59:55 <jockmo42> Must've been misjudged. You can't get hurt falling two blocks. Maybe you jumped from a higher point?
A1:00:16 <Griskard> Which considering its one and a half times your height (in my case thats like over 9 foot)
A1:00:22 <Griskard> You expect damage
A1:00:58 <jockmo42> It's hard to get a handle on, since everything is so mini-looking. But it gets to make sense.
A1:01:52 <Hunter2458> 1.7m guy falling 3 meters...
A1:02:28 <Hunter2458> I don't think you'd be mortally wounded.
A1:03:05 <Griskard> No, but you dont get mortally wounded in minecraft either
A1:03:27 <Hunter2458> You do in lava...or when hit by an arrow...
A1:03:38 <Hunter2458> and losing health sorta constitues as mortal wounding
A1:03:39 <Griskard> Not by the three block fall
A1:04:01 <Griskard> In minecraft you can take the 3 or 4 metre fall 40 times
A1:04:04 <Griskard> Before you die
A1:04:15 <Griskard> In real life most people couldnt move after that many either
A1:04:17 <Hunter2458> True.
A1:04:29 <Griskard> And considering you dont lose any agility despite having done that 40 times
A1:04:35 <Griskard> well, 39
A1:04:41 <Griskard> Id consider it fair
A1:04:41 <Hunter2458> True.
A1:05:19 <Griskard> If it was at all realistic, it wouldnt take off health, but each time you did it you would get slower, lose the ability to jump, and eventually only be able to crawl
A1:05:33 <Griskard> After mayve 10
A1:05:44 <Hunter2458> Yeah, and then there wouldn't be anything but pigs on the map.
A1:06:00 <jockmo42> Lol.
A1:06:13 <Hunter2458> So what'd you be running from?
A1:06:39 <jockmo42> One of my friend's uncles was actually eaten by a pig. No shit.

A1:08:24 <jockmo42> Maybe not the farm variety...

A1:18:21 <geekahedron> or 7x7
A1:18:22 <jockmo42> Lol, nope.
A1:18:39 <geekahedron> if there are three spaces between each sprig
A1:18:49 <jockmo42> Just try three empty blocks between each sprig, always worked for me. Never new the actual dimensions.
A1:18:54 <geekahedron> each sprig needs a 7x7 space
A1:18:56 <jockmo42> *Knew
A1:19:09 <geekahedron> 3 spaces, 1 sprig, 3 spaces
A1:19:21 <geekahedron> ok
A1:19:25 <jockmo42> Each TREE takes up 3x3.
A1:19:45 <jockmo42> Soo... They'll collide a little? But you'll always get the trunks.

10A5:34:29 * smn`offline is now known as smn
A5:34:47 <citricsquid> d0ohan: I have like, 2 GCSEs, I can't get on any course worth doing.
A5:34:57 <citricsquid> they tell me I'm too stupid and to do a lower course :D
A5:35:17 <d0ohan> Why don't you apply for courses like, i dunno the cisco ones?
A5:35:21 <d0ohan> Red hat ones?
A5:35:26 <d0ohan> Bit more expensive mind
A5:35:38 <citricsquid> normal college is free!
A5:35:42 <d0ohan> But worth a bit more than a btec.
A5:35:59 <citricsquid> do those courses take anyone?
A5:36:05 <d0ohan> Anyone with money.
A5:36:16 <d0ohan> And you might fail and have to sit the test again
A5:36:26 <d0ohan> Theres one that are just an exam
A5:36:33 <d0ohan> Everything else about it is self taught
A5:36:55 <d0ohan> But yeah, not cheap.
A5:37:08 <d0ohan> Anyway you might as well do the college stuff for now.
A5:37:15 <d0ohan> Like you said it's free, and probably very easy
A5:37:36 <d0ohan> Also, you could go to uni at some point if you get the entry requirements
13A5:37:44 * lobster_MB has no idea what firing arrows or using mushrooms is
A5:37:48 <liq3> d0ohan: it's also a terrible waste of time, and time is the most valuable resource on the planet. :p
A5:38:00 <d0ohan> liq3, tbh, having an education is never a waste of time
A5:38:14 <d0ohan> Opens all sorts of doors later.
A5:38:27 <liq3> d0ohan: yes it is. The current meaning of "education" is having a diploma or college cert, which to me actually mean your STUPID, not smart.
A5:38:38 <liq3> They're also only used to get sub-par jobs.
A5:38:46 <d0ohan> That's better than no job
A5:38:57 <d0ohan> Or being on the dole and wasting my tax money.
A5:38:57 <liq3> the only real courses I'd consider doing college worthy, are medicine ones.
A5:39:19 <d0ohan> Really? That's seems a little narrow minded.
A5:39:34 <liq3> d0ohan: there are exception, but that's the general rule.
A5:39:37 <liq3> exceptions*
A5:39:50 <citricsquid> education is, in theory, brilliant, but from what I've experienced it's a huge waste of time.
A5:39:50 <d0ohan> Oh you mean stuff like nursing, sorry I thought you meant in general.
A5:40:09 <d0ohan> citricsquid, at school yes.
A5:40:09 <liq3> d0ohan: hrm? I mean stuff like being a doctor or vet. Those would be worth going to college for. :p

A5:40:20 <d0ohan> They're stuff you do at university.
A5:40:31 <liq3> citricsquid: Education is awesome. The current system isn't interested in educating you, but making you stupid and obidient.
A5:40:33 <d0ohan> And those are places where any topic can get very very indepth.
A5:40:43 <citricsquid> I don't want to put up with 5 years of subpar college courses to do a potentially shit uni course though, I'd rather fail life.
A5:41:01 <liq3> citricsquid: I like your style of thinking! >.<
A5:41:55 <d0ohan> If you get a decent course, you can go to a uni starting in 2nd year or something
A5:42:04 <d0ohan> Decent college course that is.
A5:42:15 <citricsquid> yeah and there are none :(
A5:42:27 <citricsquid> http://staffordcoll.ac.uk/full-time.asp
A5:42:29 <liq3> Hrm that reminds, aren't there ways to courses more quickly? Like take most of thec classes at once?
A5:42:32 <d0ohan> Be willing to move and get a student loan too
A5:42:46 <liq3> Or did they stop doing that?
A5:42:56 <d0ohan> citricsquid, you need A levels?
A5:43:00 <d0ohan> Thats only 8 months.
A5:43:12 <d0ohan> And with A levels you can apply to a uni skipping the whole college thing.
A5:43:13 <citricsquid> I'm too stupid for A levels :D
A5:43:19 <liq3> d0ohan: "only"? >.>
A5:43:22 <citricsquid> wait
A5:43:29 <citricsquid> A levels are 2 years, you have to do AS before don't you?

A5:43:49 <d0ohan> Sorry I was being scottish there. Highers are 1 year.
A5:44:00 <citricsquid> I originally applied for that, told I was too stupid and had to do the lower course.
A5:44:28 <d0ohan> You have any GCSEs?
A5:44:41 <citricsquid> B in science, C in maths and another C in some other science.
A5:44:48 <citricsquid> nothing worth having
A5:44:48 <d0ohan> You got any cool excuses like dyslexia?
A5:44:54 <citricsquid> nope, just lazy :D
A5:45:06 <citricsquid> is long hair an excuse?
A5:45:16 <d0ohan> When you apply for the course do you provide a sort of cover letter?
A5:45:35 <d0ohan> You could also try another college and try to speak to someone.
A5:45:55 <d0ohan> Explain all the stuff you do with servers in your own time.
A5:46:03 <d0ohan> The websites your run etc
A5:46:09 <liq3> Yeh, that's probably a good idea.
A5:46:24 <d0ohan> The rules are guide lines.
A5:46:26 <liq3> I got into a TAFE course that way. Everyone else was pretty much 2 years old then me, and had their HSCs (I only had year 10).
A5:46:31 <d0ohan> They do make exceptions
A5:46:32 <liq3> TAFE = uni basically.
A5:47:02 <citricsquid> That's my problem, I'm too shy to even speak to most people, explaining what I do would close to impossible. 
13A5:47:07 * citricsquid has an excuse for everything

A5:48:31 <citricsquid> SUPPOSEDLY
A5:48:38 <citricsquid> it had web dev stuff, the course I ended up doing
A5:48:41 <citricsquid> that was a fucking joke.
A5:48:56 <d0ohan> Did you finish it?
A5:48:59 <citricsquid> The worst thing was the teachers
A5:49:08 <Azjherben> Oh yeah, there are kources out there...
A5:49:10 <citricsquid> telling the class they didn't give a fuck about the actual course
A5:49:19 <d0ohan> They don't.
A5:49:20 <Azjherben> I just asked everyone everything...
A5:49:33 <citricsquid> also no, I quit because it was so unbearably shit.
A5:49:42 <citricsquid> after 6 months i'd learnt nothing
A5:49:45 <Azjherben> What klass did you quit?
A5:49:45 <d0ohan> You need to just make the minimum commitment
A5:49:53 <d0ohan> Show up at only the times you need to.
A5:49:58 <d0ohan> Do the test at the end.
A5:50:02 <d0ohan> Do the course work.
A5:50:07 <d0ohan> Read the books.
A5:50:27 <d0ohan> Get the qualification.
A5:50:28 <liq3> d0ohan, citricsquid: or citric could, you know, just do the test to get the cert.
A5:50:34 <liq3> and skip everything else. ;]
A5:50:45 <d0ohan> Colleges can be a bit anal

A6:42:04 <liq3> ah.
A6:42:05 <liq3> hrm
A6:42:06 <liq3> weird.
A6:42:13 <Zuriki> It's the loading of SP maps
A6:42:23 <Zuriki> It disables block physics
A6:42:37 <Zuriki> And interaction with stuff like explosions
A6:42:41 <Zuriki> From creepers...

A6:43:26 <liq3> actually it seems to be just maps made in omen.
A6:43:37 <liq3> If you gen a map, save it in SP, then load it in Survival, it works just fine.
A6:47:14 <Peerko> maybe it's the non-natural block types

A6:48:48 <AlexVMiner> ok
A6:48:51 <AlexVMiner> what is it?
A6:49:18 <Zuriki> See if I can enable physics on Omen maps
A6:50:03 <AlexVMiner> I want it so creepers can actually kill blocks on my city map
A6:51:08 <AlexVMiner> And so monsters can't follow you if you are, say, underground and they are right above you
A6:51:58 <Zuriki> I think it might be the means in which the level is transferred from Omen to single plater.
A6:52:00 <Zuriki> player(
A6:52:06 <Peerko> you will still get hurt if a creeper blasts on the other side of a wall

A9:44:44 <Azjherben> You mean, stay on the internet? Oh, and who?
A9:44:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> If it pleases the FSM, I would like to stay on the Internet because I have no social life

A9:44:53 <d0ohan> yes thanks
A9:45:06 <d0ohan> Then you shouldn't be allowed to stay.

A10:29:45 <d0ohan> Dummy, you can use /ignore though

A10:30:03 <Marach> i think
A10:30:06 <Arzock> Poo flakes
A10:30:10 <Dummy> I still wish to know the command, only for knowledge.
A10:30:14 <PuyoDead> Omen is pretty basic to figure out
A10:30:16 <Arzock> I'll ask steven
A10:30:19 <Dummy> And yes, I know the Ignore trick
A10:30:20 <Arzock> for you maybe

A10:30:26 <Marach> .  /mode <yourmode>
A10:30:30 <Dummy> I Ignored me a while ago. Was weird.
A10:30:35 <Marach> +x is turn on, -x is turn off
A10:30:35 <Dummy> Thanks
A10:30:39 <Arzock> scdsd
A10:30:42 <Marach> you can set modes on users
A10:30:51 <AlexVMiner> ok, right now i have 8000 points
A10:30:51 <Marach> like /mode +b Dummy
A10:30:58 <Marach> this bans dummy

A10:30:58 <Dummy> B is...
A10:31:01 <Dummy> Oh
A10:31:09 <Marach> and -b is unban obviously

A11:28:07 <AlexVMiner> i died at 1000
A11:28:11 <AlexVMiner> left for 15 minutes
A11:28:13 <citricsquid> is it from monsters killing others Zuriki?
A11:28:15 <AlexVMiner> then when i came back
A11:28:19 <AlexVMiner> 2500
A11:28:30 <Miclee> It's probably from falling monsters and/or them killing eachother.
A11:28:30 <Evil-Ville> It's because the monsters die when they're alone in a cave
A11:28:33 <Zuriki> Probably.
A11:28:40 <AlexVMiner> and that was before the newer survival
A11:28:43 <potato> has anyone gotten over 100000 yet?
A11:28:46 <AlexVMiner> when monsters didn't respawn
A11:28:46 <Marach> I TOLD YOU BRO ABOUT THE STAIRS

P1:33:45 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I have no experience, it was just mentioned in the Linux.org FAQ
P1:34:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well, it's lightweight.  Debian based, KDE, the works.  There's also a big edition that fits on a DVD.  I wouldn't use it for production because it's designed on a live CD, but it's fun to screw around with
P1:34:48 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Alright sounds good!
P1:35:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also be aware that they haven't done as much interface polishing as larger distros have, even though Knoppix is pretty popular... So it may be a little less user-friendly, but any poweruser shouldn't have much of an issue :P
P1:35:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Also, read this.  I recommend it to everyone who is about to try or use Linux... http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm

P1:36:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> But if you're not that much of a noob, it's probably not for you
P1:36:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, yeah... Knoppix is frequently used for data recovery, fixing broken windows installs, stuff like that
P1:36:23 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I'm sure I'm a mix of noob and non-noob so I'll read it
P1:37:17 <Peerko> how many linux users are in this channel?
P1:37:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> one here
13P1:37:27 * Peerko counts himself
P1:38:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Peerko, I don't expect too many considering the median age/maturity/tech-experience of people who come here... Only the most savvy even attempt to try Linux in this channel it seems
10P1:38:11 * LG_Legacy (LGLegacy@71-82-103-142.dhcp.bycy.mi.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
P1:38:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Some people genuinely tried it and didn't like it, and that's fine
P1:38:27 <LG_Legacy> AND THEN
P1:38:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> But what pisses me off is people who have never used it or even tried it who spout BS about why it sucks
P1:38:49 <Peerko> how's sound working for you then, AlLnAtuRalX?
P1:39:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm on ALSA, so fine, but Minecraft hogs up all my sound
P1:39:20 <Peerko> same here
P1:39:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have to kill java to get sound on my other applications... I told Notch, he didn't seem to care, haha
P1:39:22 <Nohbdy|Xeros> If Linux is difficult to use, I'll probably like it more lol.
P1:39:22 <fydo> I use linux
P1:39:35 <Peerko> Notch mentioned it works for him, so I wonder about his alsa config
P1:39:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, that's quite odd...
P1:39:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> He uses ALSA he said?
P1:39:50 <Peerko> might be some special config
P1:39:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've never tried it on OSS or Pulse
P1:40:04 <fydo> minecraft works fine under ubuntu for me
P1:40:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Because pulse sucks for anything else, and I have no reason to try OSS
P1:40:07 <fydo> so there :)
P1:40:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> >:(
P1:40:26 <Peerko> fydo mail me your sound configs!! (plz?)
P1:40:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, he probably uses pulse with default config (?)
P1:40:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> I might go ahead and install pulse later just to test it
P1:41:13 <fydo> yeah, I think it comes with pulse
P1:41:23 <SteGriff> So I'm thinking of going Puppy to start off. I value speed, and the system isn't amazing.
P1:41:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Stats?
P1:42:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> You could probably handle XUbuntu if you actually wanted a production O/S written to disk
P1:42:23 <Peerko> as I tend to keep apps open all the time I found that 2GB RAM wasn't enough for me
P1:42:27 <Nohbdy|Xeros> lol Allnatural this article is kinda biased towards Linux, but that's not even a problem, it's just funny with phrases like: "robably the biggest example of this is the sheer amount of choice available to Linux users." when it was talking about being "too different" xD
P1:42:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> If you're interested in experimenting, the test ISOs of Lubuntu came out and LXDE will run for sure
P1:42:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha, well, it's true
P1:42:45 <Nohbdy|Xeros> as if it were beign mentioned as a con :P
P1:42:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> I use a tiling WM a lot for example
P1:42:53 <Nohbdy|Xeros> being* (my god keyboard)
P1:42:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Can you do that in Windows?
P1:43:13 <Nohbdy|Xeros> I don't know what tiling Wm is ^.^

P1:45:44 <Peerko> I used windows at some workplace and quickly found that the taskbar was too small
P1:45:50 <Peerko> so I set it to three rows
P1:45:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> But then again, I use lightweight DEs/WMs, LXDE XMonad, Awesome and the works
P1:46:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> haha

P1:47:10 <Snowman> FireFox eats memory for breakfast
P1:47:13 <Peerko> now with 4GB it's fine
P1:47:15 <Snowman> but that's what makes it fast and good
P1:47:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> Opera is also fast and good....
P1:47:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it won't eat memory
P1:47:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> Firefox's codebase is a mess I hear
P1:47:49 <Peerko> opera is pretty good
P1:47:59 <Peerko> but the ui is so alien to me
P1:48:03 <Snowman> Firefox has more useful applications than opera afaik, but let's not start a browser fight
P1:48:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Epiphany is great if you use GNOME... And it's also based on gecko (soon to be webkit)
P1:50:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> Did you finish reading Nohbdy|Xeros ?  If you just quit out, 3-5 are the most important
P1:50:47 <Snowman> I replaced skeletons with soldiers that throw grenades
P1:50:47 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Oh I was gonna continue reading but I decided of course to have Knoppix downloading as I was reading.. so right now I'm about to download it
P1:51:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Alright, cool
P1:51:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Use the torrent ;)
P1:52:32 <Snowman> Fuck
P1:52:45 <Snowman> I forgot the skeletons have tiny legs and arms
P1:52:57 <Snowman> there goes my perfect plan >.>
P1:53:51 <Peerko> it's the same 3D model with a transparent skin
P1:53:58 <Peerko> so ehm, what's your plan?
P1:54:25 <Snowman> no, their legs are 1 pixel x 1 pixel
P1:54:35 <Snowman> not just transparant
P1:54:58 <Peerko> oh, hmkay
P1:55:41 <Nohbdy|Xeros> Indeed using torrent.. it looks like the torrent is the only way anyway hah
P1:56:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup..  There might be some mirrors somewhere, but torrents are the best way

P3:30:09 <Visiiri> Buy the game.
P3:30:10 <Arzock> buy it then?

P3:30:40 <citricsquid> Arzock: shut up.
P3:30:43 <Arzock> nah
P3:30:43 <mdm> I'm experienced in advertsiting (what banner ad, Flash, etc.) so I'm wondering if Minecraft could use some exposures
P3:30:51 <Arzock> =O
P3:30:58 <Visiiri> Sure could, but notch doesn't share.
P3:31:22 <Visiiri> He's a selfish bastard that made me buy it too :<
P3:31:27 <mdm> I don't need anything except for some Flash image, animated image, and some still images, and it'll be all over the place
P3:31:42 <Visiiri> mdm, that costs money.
P3:31:44 <TrueWolves> Youed have to talk to notch, I'm sure he might listen, when he get's back
P3:31:47 <mdm> I'm willing to pay for a trail run myself
P3:31:48 <Visiiri> Notch likes steads, not spending money.
P3:31:53 <Visiiri> fuck
P3:31:54 <Visiiri> Steaks
P3:31:55 <Visiiri> mdm
P3:31:57 <citricsquid> Minecraft doesn't need advertising
P3:31:58 <Visiiri> <3
P3:31:59 <TrueWolves> He didn't let me help him web design when I offered him twice for free XD
P3:32:06 <Visiiri> I agree with citric
P3:32:12 <citricsquid> he let me fix the broken site css :)
P3:32:14 <Visiiri> we don't want any more 4chan assholes.
P3:32:15 <mdm> Yes, but Notch want more people to hear about Minecraft, don't he?
P3:32:21 <Visiiri> nope.
P3:32:33 <citricsquid> mdm: of course, but a few flash ads on some unknown sites won't work :)
P3:32:40 <citricsquid> unless you're willing to spend thousands for notch :P
P3:32:44 <Arzock> Alot of people post about it on other fourms
P3:32:46 <mdm> We'll see.
P3:32:46 <Arzock> besides
P3:32:52 <Arzock> we'd get moar griefers?

P3:33:38 <citricsquid> people come to the forum AFTER the game
P3:33:39 <Zuriki> Then you could host competitions like get 100 unique referals
P3:33:45 <Zuriki> So
P3:33:49 <Zuriki> The forum links to the game.
P3:33:55 <citricsquid> Yes

P5:05:53 <Zuriki> Hardly spawns anything.
P5:06:10 <Zuriki> I recommend trying out id=1 or 3

P5:06:19 <Zuriki> I can't remember which.
P5:06:21 <Zuriki> It's a city.
P5:06:26 <Zuriki> Really good for survival.
P5:06:37 <Zuriki> $15

P5:59:46 <TheoX> how did that person GET the flatgrass map into their maplist?
P5:59:48 <Zuriki> Something to do with backwards compatability levels.
P5:59:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Zuriki, I just did it this morning
P5:59:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> from a random server
P6:00:04 <Zuriki> I know.
P6:00:20 <Zuriki> I did with all my maps
P6:00:21 <TheoX> oh really? this is some client I probably don't have then? xD
P6:00:26 <Zuriki> But it messes up physics
P6:00:30 <Levinous> LMAO

P6:30:18 <Kratospie> the normal OP block is rather bland for building structure
P6:30:28 <potato> so
P6:30:37 <potato> use regular blocks

P6:37:59 <GeneralGuy> it's not funny
P6:38:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> this ain't some facepunch lookalike
P6:38:04 <PuyoDead> for being under 13
P6:38:15 <Levinous> i was waiting all of that time for your message and it was only three words!
P6:38:20 <Levinous> anyway, i think it's hilarious
P6:38:24 <Snowman> only 2 years?
P6:38:30 <Avenger> Oh Puyo u got that from my thread lolz
P6:38:39 <Snowman> Pfff, I've been playing it for at least 5 already
P6:38:40 <PuyoDead> it's wretched, and not funny in any way
P6:38:49 <Levinous> :/
P6:39:08 <GeneralGuy> its annoying
P6:39:09 <Avenger> Snowman....u fail.....ive been playing for -40 years
P6:39:15 <Kratospie> so because minemaster is under 13 and lied about his age, if banned criticsquid gets shutdown?
P6:39:24 <Levinous> well, i find it funny, nonetheless
P6:39:25 <Avenger> i duno

P6:39:46 <Kratospie> its not your fault?
P6:39:48 <Levinous> haha
P6:39:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> i think he was referring to my "report him to the police"
P6:39:53 <Kratospie> but you still get shut down?
P6:39:53 <PuyoDead> gamefaqs has a strict rule that if you admit to being uner 13, you get banned on the spot
P6:40:00 <PuyoDead> *under
P6:40:03 <citricsquid> Legally it's my duty to stop under 13s using the forum
P6:40:08 <citricsquid> if I let them I'm breaking the law.

P6:47:58 <Levinous> he edited his post
P6:47:59 <Zuriki> Reminds me of me.
P6:48:04 <Levinous> so that it said "3 months"
P6:48:08 <GeneralGuy> whats also nice he's proven my avatar right
P6:48:11 <citricsquid> Do you think if we ban him his parents would contact

P6:48:20 <GeneralGuy> stupidity is amazing
P6:48:24 <Avenger> yes i am
P6:48:25 <liq3> citricsquid: omg i hope so.
P6:48:28 <PuyoDead> what would they possibly say?
P6:48:36 <Avenger> I has idea of that
P6:48:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> i honestly don't think their parents would care
P6:48:39 <PuyoDead> COPPA along would make anything they say moot
P6:48:48 <liq3> PuyoDead: it doesn't matter, it'd be hilirious. :D
P6:48:54 <citricsquid> I mean, they're more likely to explain to him what he's doing wrong
P6:48:55 <Kratospie> blame COPPA
P6:48:55 <PuyoDead> err, alone
P6:48:55 <Avenger> "Unban my son, hes a sweet boy and he is just new to this computer thing."
P6:49:04 <PuyoDead> yea, good point
P6:49:06 <citricsquid> if you put hello@minecraftforum.net in the ban message he might have them email.
P6:49:08 <Zuriki> Inform them of the bad news, the tests came back. Unfortunately, their son IS retarded.
P6:49:11 <PuyoDead> because obviously he isn't listening to anyone else
P6:49:24 <Avenger> nice one zuriki
P6:49:29 <citricsquid> Yeah and if he really cares he'll whine to his parents, who will in turn email.
P6:49:40 <citricsquid> or hit him, depending on the parents.
P6:49:44 <Zuriki> Give them my email
P6:49:46 <Zuriki> :P
P6:49:52 <Zuriki> I'll have a nice chat with them.
P6:49:57 <Avenger> ya, set them straight!!
P6:50:09 <citricsquid> Zuriki: we were all 10 once, be nice!
P6:50:11 <Avenger> or that kid could be a 20 year-old retard
P6:50:17 <Snowman> doubt it
P6:50:22 <Zuriki> When I was 10, I was silent.
P6:50:26 <Avenger> just throwing suggestions out
P6:50:31 <Levinous> my parents wouldn't have took action if i was Mine Master and was banned
P6:50:33 <GeneralGuy> I was a smart-ass at 10
P6:50:34 <PuyoDead> my god, he necroposted in a nearly 3 month old thread
P6:50:39 <Zuriki> Because I knew, if a said something stupid, I'd be beaten with a belt.
P6:50:42 <Snowman> When I was 10, there was a war going on
P6:50:48 <Snowman> And nazi's were everywhere
P6:50:54 <Avenger> oh and snowman, how could u possibly tell that tommy's MC skin was an edit of ur SEAL?

P6:57:01 <AnnihilatorBeta> so you're not gonna ban someone for breaking the rules?
P6:57:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> so what, are they immune?
P6:57:23 <Levinous> ah, that's what i meant
P6:57:28 <GeneralGuy> how can we NOT ban him couse of COPPA?
P6:57:29 <Levinous> the :( emoticon spam is gone, now, though
P6:57:32 <Avenger>  BRB
P6:57:43 <Kratospie> if we do squid gets taken down
P6:57:47 <GeneralGuy> we should have banned him right when he told his age
P6:57:49 <Levinous> i like how you didn't put him in your list
P6:57:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> should've been more strict with the rules
P6:58:32 <Avenger> bak
P6:58:34 <AlexVMiner> what?
P6:58:42 <AlexVMiner> if you ban a douche your site is killed?
P6:58:50 <AlexVMiner> COPPA?
P6:58:52 <AlexVMiner> WTF?
P6:59:16 <citricsquid> well
P6:59:17 <AlexVMiner> general, that is rude
P6:59:20 <citricsquid> maybe I exagerated
P6:59:22 <Avenger> ya, first time ive heard of this
P6:59:22 <Kratospie> The goverment thinks the Internet Is Serious Buisness
P6:59:22 <AlexVMiner> I iz 10

P6:59:25 <AlexVMiner> i am 12
P6:59:26 <GeneralGuy> what?

P6:59:47 <AlexVMiner> well then ban me now
P6:59:55 <PuyoDead> honestly, the admitting to being under 13 thing should have been insta-ban, but I don't run the whole thing

P7:00:38 <mdm86> Then it's kinda unfair to ban AlexV, he owns the game but can't access the community?
P7:00:38 <Levinous> he's just being ridiculous
P7:00:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> i can feel so many people raging
P7:00:46 <Snowman> Ban the stupid fags, like miner man, who are underaged

P7:01:28 <Avenger> BAN BAN BAN BAN
P7:01:30 <PuyoDead> it's not for the age, it's for publically admitting to it

P7:02:08 <Kratospie> well minemaster hasnt been banned yet
P7:02:08 <Levinous> if i said that i was 3 years old, would something be wrong?
P7:02:11 <AlexVMiner> i did already, i think...

P7:02:29 <Levinous> SNOWMAN YOU'RE COMMITTING ILLEGALS!
P7:02:31 <vede> What's up with all the people who hate people just for being young?
P7:02:33 <GeneralGuy> quick! delete any post Alex wrote about his age!
P7:02:34 <Snowman> :O
P7:02:36 <Kratospie> if someone said they were -1 year old would the world explode?
P7:02:40 <citricsquid> vede: they're idiots :(
P7:02:42 <Avenger> so hows the weather?
P7:02:42 <AlexVMiner> yes
P7:02:44 <Snowman> I am pi years old
P7:02:47 <Kratospie> OH SHI-
P7:02:48 <AlexVMiner> that is impossible
P7:02:48 <liq3> Kratospie: no, because they'd be wrong.
P7:02:50 <mdm86> -1 year old = inside another male's scrotum
P7:02:53 <Levinous> i respect mature people, regardless of age
P7:02:54 <Kratospie> I DIVIDED BY ZERO
P7:02:56 <Snowman> I am pie years old
P7:02:57 <Zuriki> Ha ha
P7:02:59 <AlexVMiner> being -1 yars old would kill everyone
P7:03:01 <vede> Yes, citric, I believe that might be true.
P7:03:01 <Levinous> that's why all of my friends are three years younger than i am
P7:03:02 <Avenger> ya
P7:03:06 <liq3> mdm86: No, because sperm don't survive a whole year. :P
P7:03:11 <AlexVMiner> lol
P7:03:12 <mdm86> heh
P7:03:20 <AlexVMiner> but they can survive 3 months, right?
P7:03:24 <citricsquid> vede: I couldn't care less about age, I'd be the first to admit there are 10 year olds more mature than me.
P7:03:26 <AlexVMiner> and that is all they need
P7:03:26 <Snowman> OI!, no talking about sperm, there are kids here, like Alex :p
P7:03:31 <mdm86> okay, -1 year old = genetic materials yet to be transformed into sperms
P7:03:38 <Kratospie> OH SHI-
P7:03:38 <GeneralGuy> -1 = a sperm 3 months before it fertilizes the egg
P7:03:39 <AlexVMiner> lol

P7:04:23 <GeneralGuy> how long to an egg sell live?
P7:04:29 <GeneralGuy> cell*
P7:04:34 <vede> You people only give credit to the sperm in the reproductive process.
13P7:04:39 * Kratospie divided by 0 then added Pi.
P7:04:42 <mdm86> that's a pretty big jar of semen
P7:04:44 <AlexVMiner> lol

P7:44:42 <Mikeh> Some boards on -THE SITE- are respectable
P7:44:45 <Levinous> i often make mistakes like that
P7:44:47 <vede> And I reach a room, and I'm like, "ugh, been here three times now."

P7:46:36 <GeneralGuy> seen it already
P7:46:41 <Navt> wank
P7:46:49 <GeneralGuy> that was the British version?!
P7:46:56 <citricsquid> no, but there is one :D
P7:47:03 <GeneralGuy> I meant there
P7:47:19 <citricsquid> you've confused me :'(
P7:47:30 <GeneralGuy> I meant ...
P7:47:38 <GeneralGuy> There was a british version?!
P7:47:44 <citricsquid> oh
P7:47:48 <citricsquid> well yes there is!
P7:47:54 <Navt> one day im online
P7:47:54 <Dilt> I hate skeletons in caves
P7:47:57 <GeneralGuy> I thought there was an Australian version
P7:48:07 <Dilt> especially around that god forsaken lava pit
P7:48:08 <citricsquid> probably lots of other versions also
P7:48:13 <Dilt> they attack you melee, shoot an arrow
P7:48:15 <Dilt> and send you flying
P7:48:21 <Dilt> which takes a good number of hearts
P7:48:22 <citricsquid> skeletons are the worst :(
P7:48:28 <GeneralGuy> no'
P7:48:32 <GeneralGuy> creepers are
P7:48:32 <Dilt> falling in lava from a height enough to kill 3 hearts is just insult to injury
P7:48:42 <Dilt> creepers don't shoot arrows
P7:48:43 <Navt> how i shot arrow
P7:48:47 <Dilt> tab
P7:48:51 <citricsquid> Navt: haha
P7:48:57 <GeneralGuy> if creepers are in your castle, they're the worst
P7:49:01 <Hunter2458> how do i shot creeper
P7:49:05 <Levinous> citricsquid: is it the one with the celebrities?
P7:49:10 <Dilt> GeneralGuy: that's why you make windows
P7:49:15 <citricsquid> Levinous: yeah
P7:49:19 <Dilt> the creepers will happily follow you right out
P7:49:24 <Levinous> yeah, i saw that once
P7:49:35 <Levinous> i thought "they totally copied Takeshi's Castle!"
P7:49:40 <Dilt> and i have a large moat filled with water around my casle
P7:49:41 <Navt> how i make arrow
P7:49:43 <Dilt> *castle
P7:49:46 <Dilt> Navt: kill skeletons
P7:49:49 <GeneralGuy> And what do you do if the creepers are in your basement
P7:49:54 <Dilt> GeneralGuy: stairs
P7:49:55 <GeneralGuy> and theres water around it
P7:49:56 <Navt> how i heal me
P7:50:05 <citricsquid> i am from australia and i keep creepers in my basement.
P7:50:11 <GeneralGuy> and theres four of them
P7:50:15 <Dilt> well
P7:50:17 <Dilt> seal off your basement
P7:50:20 <Dilt> then never go there again
P7:50:28 <Dilt> until they all are starved to death
P7:50:32 <GeneralGuy> but my gold is down there!
P7:50:37 <Dilt> you don't need your gold

P8:08:02 <Chariot`> what did he request
P8:08:05 <GeneralGuy> no
P8:08:06 <PuyoDead> what the hell... what's with that guy?
P8:08:28 <GeneralGuy> I vote Critic should do it
P8:08:31 <Chariot`> what did he request
P8:08:35 <Real> Before anyone does it, they should run it by citricsquid.
P8:08:44 <Real> Go on his dev blog, tard.
P8:08:44 <Chariot`> what did he request
P8:08:45 <vede> Chariot, from the blogzarz
P8:08:47 <Chariot`> OK

P8:15:22 <Iguana> Okey doke. :P
P8:15:24 <Zuriki> You can put any skin there.
P8:15:51 <Real> Hey citric, are you going to disable posting in this section you create? Just have copies of the posts from elsewhere with rating abilities?
P8:16:03 <GeneralGuy> YES!
P8:16:06 <GeneralGuy> that is good
P8:16:13 <citricsquid> Real: it won't be a section as such, it'll just aggregate threads from the survival mode section
P8:16:26 <citricsquid> so it'll just be a list of the threads in order of popularity, as explained in that post
P8:16:34 <citricsquid> I can make an example if I explained poorly :P
P8:17:11 <Real> So then the only way threads appear in that section is when it is created in the Survival section with the specific tag(s) on it? Nobody can make a new thread in that section directly?
P8:17:30 <Real> Sort of a strainer for the Survival section, methinks.
P8:17:36 <citricsquid> basically, yes.
P8:17:36 <vede> Ooh!
P8:17:39 <vede> I HAVE AN IDEA
P8:17:44 <citricsquid> So it aggregates all ideas in order of popularity
P8:17:51 <Real> Then I understood you perfectly, sir citricsquid.
P8:17:55 <citricsquid> so Notch can go "most popular idea is <this> I'll implement!"
P8:18:00 <citricsquid> but bugs above ideas! :P
P8:18:01 <Levinous> lol
P8:18:03 <Real> I like this
P8:18:23 <vede> Maybe, instead of making a thread NOW and trying to maintain it (fat chance), we just let the forum go, then as the time nears for Notch to return, we go through all the most popular suggestions, and condense it into a neat little package to give to Notch.
P8:18:25 <Levinous> U NED 2 AD MACHIEN GUNZ !!!!!
P8:18:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> organized and helpful, i like it
P8:18:35 <Real> I feel like since I understood it, I helped create it... though that is definitely not true.

P8:18:37 <Levinous> S
P8:18:48 <citricsquid> Real: feedback shapes things!

P8:20:32 <Chemo> :oo
P8:20:37 <Chemo> i sneezed
P8:20:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> i farted
P8:20:51 <vede> So...
P8:21:02 <vede> Eventually, that section will be uberflooded with lame-ass ideas.
P8:21:12 <GeneralGuy> not really
P8:21:13 <Levinous> creepers that dance!
P8:21:23 <GeneralGuy> the bad rated ones will be at the bottom
P8:21:30 <GeneralGuy> the good ones at the top
P8:21:31 <citricsquid> vede: It'll just be the survivalmode section, but everything will be ordered by popularity - as voted by the users - and will have all the confirmed bugs at the top.
P8:21:37 <PuyoDead> it'll still become a mess over time
P8:21:47 <Levinous> for the greater good?
P8:21:50 <vede> Mess is inevitable, as PuyoDead says.
P8:21:54 <citricsquid> hm, would a thread be better then?
P8:21:58 <PuyoDead> but really, it's the best option we have
P8:22:01 <Real> With prpoer ordering and rating, it would not be a mess.
P8:22:04 <GeneralGuy> so is griefing
P8:22:04 <vede> I think currently, yeah, it's the best so far.
P8:22:05 <Real> proper*
P8:22:13 <GeneralGuy> but people always try to stop that
P8:22:20 <citricsquid> well, if anyone has a better idea I'd have no problem going with that :)
P8:22:25 <Real> With a thread, maintenance is not automatic.
P8:22:29 <liq3> citricsquid, PuyoDead: I think a thread to confirmed bugs and new features would be best.
P8:22:33 <PuyoDead> I mean a mess in the sense of duplicates, stupid ideas getting attention for being stupid, etc
P8:22:35 <Real> With an autmated section... well duh.
P8:22:38 <vede> Threads are removed if they're too badly rated?
P8:22:55 <PuyoDead> yea, a thread would be far more disorganized
P8:22:57 <AnnihilatorBeta> i don't really care about ratins and all that
P8:22:59 <vede> Or maybe moved to a separate "badly rated" section.
P8:23:02 <citricsquid> Threads will need xx ratings to show up, I think. Not sure though, probably can work it out when I make it.
P8:23:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> just a separate section for them would be good enough
P8:23:21 <Real> citric, you should have it so we can rate it, let's say 1-5 stars, and we can report it as a duplicate, and maybe if I dunno 5 people report as duplicate, it is removed from the new section
P8:23:21 <vede> Annihilatorbeta, the goal here is something easy to read.
P8:23:22 <liq3> citricsquid: Why not just have a confirmed bugs thread for a start?
P8:23:30 <vede> With no large amount of sorting required.
P8:23:40 <citricsquid> liq3: It's easier to do it automatically, instead of having people type it out and update manually :)
P8:23:41 <Real> This way, you could order it well.
P8:23:55 <vede> If we have a whole section, the section, in three weeks, will basically be a big mess of suggestions that may or may not be good.
P8:23:56 <liq3> citricsquid: well, if you really gonna that route, have a bugs/suggestions forum.
P8:24:05 <Zuriki> I like citrics idea with the rating and stuff
P8:24:11 <citricsquid> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewforum.php?id=24
P8:24:16 <citricsquid> you see how that is now?
P8:24:17 <GeneralGuy> I vote Critic 
P8:24:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> the ordering shouldn't be forced
P8:24:26 <liq3> citricsquid: this forum does it very well, albiet it's a lot smaller. x4000 is the dev btw. http://www.arcengames.com/forums/index.php?board=2.0
P8:24:43 <liq3> citricsquid: there's a suggestion and bugs forum, with threads sorted by the admins/dev.
P8:24:56 <citricsquid> liq3: yes but Notch doesn't want to sort it himself
P8:24:59 <vede> Ordering should be based on ratings, annihilatorbeta.
P8:25:04 <liq3> citricsquid: then you sort it for him! :p
P8:25:05 <citricsquid> he wants it to be there in order of the communities opinions
P8:25:15 <liq3> citricsquid: then use votes for the suggestions.
P8:25:16 <citricsquid> liq3: I'd rather the community chose than me :D
P8:25:22 <citricsquid> liq3: that's the plan!
P8:25:23 <liq3> citricsquid: but the bugs is a simple list. :P
P8:25:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> of course, vede
P8:25:28 <citricsquid> liq3: that's the plan!
P8:25:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm just stating that other options should be present
P8:25:38 <citricsquid> I thought I said that :( bugs will be entirely system based, no rating for them.
P8:25:43 <liq3> citricsquid: excellent! now get to work! :D
P8:25:56 <Zuriki> I LIKE THIS BUG!
P8:25:57 <Real> The way bugs are now is fine as far as operationally.
P8:25:59 <Zuriki> XD
P8:26:03 <Iguana> Zuriki.
P8:26:05 <GeneralGuy> liq3, your confusing Critic!
P8:26:07 <citricsquid> Zuriki: haha
P8:26:10 <PuyoDead> yea, bug system has been great so far
P8:26:10 <Iguana> What's gui.png?
P8:26:12 <citricsquid> GeneralGuy: I agree :(
P8:26:18 <Tommerry11> hey could i have some one host a map for a sec?
P8:26:22 <PuyoDead> bit of a pain to keep up with sometimes, but good, heh
P8:26:23 <Zuriki> Graphical User Interface
P8:26:24 <Iguana> I wanna change the inventory slot colours.
P8:26:24 <Zuriki> .png
P8:26:27 <Iguana> Yeah.
P8:26:28 <vede> Iguana, it's buttons, and the HUD stuff at the bottom of the screen.
P8:26:29 <liq3> citricsquid: You might wanna make a subforum for bugs. :/
P8:26:30 <Zuriki> Do it then
P8:26:32 <AnnihilatorBeta> an image format
P8:26:39 <Zuriki> And put it back in the same place.
P8:26:40 <Iguana> I know, but what are the random bars in the png?
P8:26:42 <liq3> citricsquid: i.e. i'd think you'd be crazy not to.
P8:26:46 <Zuriki> BUttons
P8:26:47 <vede> Iguana, they are the buttons.
P8:26:49 <Zuriki> Probably.
P8:26:55 <Iguana> OH!
P8:26:56 <vede> The game draws the buttons, then overlays text on them.
P8:26:59 <citricsquid> liq3: I like to keep it together for the actual forum, but the list that notch sees will be seperated.
P8:27:03 <Iguana> I'll try making it green when I press things. :D

P8:27:14 <liq3> citricsquid: well i'm just thinking you make a "bugs" subforum for survival.
P8:27:17 <Iguana> How do I reset all of the Minecraft stuff, when I start to hate it?
P8:27:22 <Real> citricsquid: Your suggested ordering of bugs/glitches first then suggestions is perfect. Furthermore, suggestions can be ordered by rating. Also they should only appear if they get X ratings of Y or higher, etc. That's good.
P8:27:35 <liq3> citricsquid: keep all the bugs threads away from everything else.
P8:27:36 <vede> Will the "Bugs" or "Suggestions" forum be public, for both reading and posting?
P8:27:36 <Zuriki> Delete the JAR
P8:28:00 <PuyoDead> that does sound good
P8:28:00 <GeneralGuy> onlt reading vede
P8:28:01 <Real> citricsquid: You pretty much said that already, I know. But I figured one big paragraph listing the whole thing is best for visual learners to understand.
P8:28:07 <vede> Deleting the jar will break the game.
P8:28:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> ugh
P8:28:18 <citricsquid> The sections I mentioned making won't be sections that you can post in, they'll just aggregate the posts from the survival forum but in an easy to view way, not listed like a forum would list them. 
P8:28:18 <Zuriki> No it wont Vede
P8:28:21 <Zuriki> I do it all the time
P8:28:23 <vede> All the times I've done it, it's caused an error.
P8:28:26 <Zuriki> Ok
P8:28:31 <vede> And I've just had to delete the whole Minecraft folder.
P8:28:31 <Iguana> Can't I just delete the whole folder?
P8:28:31 <Zuriki> Delete EVERTHING
P8:28:36 <Zuriki> Yeah
P8:28:40 <Iguana> And let Minecraft re-install all the stuff?

P8:28:44 <Zuriki> Yes
P8:28:44 <Iguana> Yeah. :P
P8:28:51 <Zuriki> YEAH!
P8:28:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> no
P8:28:57 <vede> INDEED
P8:28:59 <Real> I think you've got a good algorithm and design plan in mind. You should write it down (or copy and paste my messages to you ;P).

P8:29:14 <liq3> citricsquid: whatever, you're the one that has to run it. 
P8:29:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> try it out and see first
P8:30:03 <GeneralGuy> so the sub-forums will be like
P8:30:05 <GeneralGuy> bugs
P8:30:07 <liq3> citricsquid: Also, I must point out that the AI War dev is actually the forums as his bug/TODO list. :P
P8:30:11 <GeneralGuy> top rated suggestion
P8:30:19 <GeneralGuy> mediu rated suggestion
P8:30:25 <GeneralGuy> low rated suggestion
P8:30:26 <GeneralGuy> right?
P8:30:48 <liq3> Are these going to be public voting?
P8:30:51 <Real> citricsquid: I think you should just close discussion on this until after you implement the ideas we've discussed so far. Then, as I posted, we will tell you if it looks good and it looks like it's working.
P8:30:53 <GeneralGuy> yes
P8:31:10 <liq3> GeneralGuy: Then it's "popular", :P
P8:31:28 <GeneralGuy> what?
P8:31:35 <citricsquid> Real: yeah, I think that's what I'll do :) I'll make a basic prototype, easier than explaining!
P8:31:45 <citricsquid> liq3: Notch is scared of mc forums :(
P8:31:53 <liq3> citricsquid: I can understand why.
P8:32:00 <PuyoDead> indeed

P9:02:44 <PuyoDead> different god? get out.
P9:02:54 <citricsquid> vede: So many great ideas in the world that could never exist :( 
P9:02:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> burn the non believers
P9:03:30 <liq3> vede: you would be required to do nothing, and they'd support you your whole life.
P9:03:36 <citricsquid> my problem with religion is that quite a lot are encouraged to impose their beliefs, I don't care if you're christian/muslim, I do care if you try and make me one, I'd rather form my own opinion.
P9:03:38 <vede> I believe a "resource-based economy" COULD work, but an ENTIRELY resource-based economy with today's reliance on non-physical property would be impossible.
P9:03:39 <liq3> and by "they", i mean everyone else.
P9:04:21 <liq3> reliance on non-physical property?
P9:04:36 <vede> We don't have nothing but food, shelter, and clothing now.
P9:04:47 <liq3> hrm?

P9:05:29 <GeneralGuy> ah, had to go for a bit, what are we talking about?
P9:05:33 <LG_Legacy> :l
P9:05:35 <LG_Legacy> I hate you puyo
P9:05:35 <liq3> vede: why would they lose those?
P9:05:38 <PuyoDead> hehe
P9:05:53 <vede> It would be difficult to maintain with absolutely no form of currency.
P9:05:59 <liq3> why?
P9:06:08 <citricsquid> liq3: we want
P9:06:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> cheater
P9:06:21 <liq3> citricsquid: We are taught to want. We don't want by nature. :p
P9:06:30 <PuyoDead> suuuure
P9:06:31 <GeneralGuy> hello?
P9:06:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> howdy
P9:06:41 <liq3> We only desire 3 things by nature. Sex, survival and learning.
P9:06:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> welcome to hell
P9:06:49 <vede> I think that it would be best to have a VERY BASIC form of currency, rather than a fully everyone-owns-everything approach to economy.
P9:06:50 <citricsquid> liq3: and survival requires better things than others
P9:06:54 <citricsquid> ergo we want by nature
P9:06:54 <GeneralGuy> what are we talking about!?
P9:07:02 <PuyoDead> READ
P9:07:03 <vede> GeneralGuy, we're doing economy.
P9:07:05 <liq3> citricsquid: ...UH. Survival = food and shelter.

P9:07:31 <liq3> vede: I don't see any flaw with a resource based economy.
P9:07:40 <citricsquid> liq3: and to get food we need to be faster than everyone else
P9:07:50 <PuyoDead> humans do not = animals
P9:07:53 <liq3> citricsquid: no we don't. There's plenty of food to go around for everyone.
P9:08:04 <vede> Alright, so outline to me, how a normal day would (theoretically) go down, in such an economy as imagined with the Venus project.
P9:08:21 <liq3> vede: you do whatever you want.
P9:08:23 <vede> Say I go to a comic book "place" (since stores are no longer existent?).
P9:08:32 <vede> Could I just grab up everything?
P9:08:33 <liq3> you just go, and take one?
P9:08:38 <PuyoDead> why just one?
P9:08:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> two
P9:08:43 <liq3> vede: You'd probably be stopped, and ask what you are doing.
P9:08:49 <vede> Well, I want them.
P9:08:51 <vede> Of course.
P9:08:53 <PuyoDead> who enforces that?

P9:09:36 <PuyoDead> heh
P9:09:40 <vede> That's just not gonna happen.
P9:09:48 <PuyoDead> someone on that project forgot about human nature
P9:09:57 <liq3> vede: how do you know?
P9:10:05 <liq3> vede: never in history has a resource-based economy existed.
P9:10:17 <PuyoDead> red flag #1
P9:10:30 <liq3> PuyoDead: Is it?
P9:10:41 <vede> Honestly, yes, it is.
P9:10:44 <PuyoDead> let's say you get together a bunch of like-minded people who could pull this off
P9:10:51 <liq3> PuyoDead: by your logic, because we've never had quantum computers, we should curse them as evil and outlaw them.
P9:10:56 <PuyoDead> amazingly, they go for this... and it works!
P9:11:06 <PuyoDead> now they start having children
P9:11:07 <vede> liq3, Puyo never said it was BAD.
P9:11:14 <liq3> vede: he was implying it.
P9:11:28 <PuyoDead> these generations grow up... what are the chances these new generation are going to go for it?
P9:11:29 <vede> Not really.
P9:11:35 <vede> You know what a red flag is, yeah?
P9:11:51 <liq3> PuyoDead: I think the question is "what are the chances they won't?"
P9:11:56 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: you're forgetting that they never want and therefore how can they know want? everyone would be happy just eating and surviving!
P9:11:56 <vede> Has NOTHING AT ALL to do with evil or badness.
P9:12:16 <liq3> citricsquid: Your sarcasm is unwelcome and not constructive.
P9:12:24 <citricsquid> liq3: I'm serious.
P9:12:27 <PuyoDead> but makes a valid point

P9:12:35 <vede> We could avoid the problem of jerkbags taking everything they want in such an economy by implementing a limiter.
P9:12:46 <vede> That would be currency.
P9:12:51 <citricsquid> btw, if it's not human nature to want more, why did cavemen "make" fire?
P9:12:55 <vede> But not normal "I get this from working" currency.
P9:12:57 <citricsquid> why did they "make" the wheel?
P9:13:02 <PuyoDead> you can't deny that even somewhere along the line a bad seed could be born
P9:13:06 <liq3> citricsquid: Because they are more efficient.
P9:13:14 <vede> Just, like, a meter-type thing that stops people from deciding that everything is explicitly THEIRS.
P9:13:18 <liq3> PuyoDead: It's extremely unlikely.
P9:13:29 <PuyoDead> by what standards?
P9:13:50 <PuyoDead> this sounds an awful lot like aryans
P9:13:57 <liq3> aryans?
P9:14:04 <PuyoDead> the "master race"?
P9:14:13 <liq3> How would it be that?
P9:14:17 <PuyoDead> the perfect people?
P9:14:20 <liq3> Perfect? haha.
P9:14:28 <PuyoDead> you're describing exactly that
P9:14:39 <liq3> Venus Project would not create perfect people. Such a thing is impossible.
P9:14:49 <Parthon> the idea of the perfect race, and purging all others
P9:14:57 <vede> From what I can see, it requires "perfect people" to function.
P9:15:00 <liq3> There are struggles and challenges to overcome besides the ones present today.
P9:15:17 <liq3> vede: no, just the majority need to be... good.
P9:15:28 <vede> So it won't actually work.
P9:15:30 <citricsquid> is it not human nature to want to be the best then? if not, how did we get that "urge"? (serious question)
P9:15:49 <liq3> citricsquid: it was taught.
P9:15:55 <citricsquid> by what/who?
P9:15:56 <PuyoDead> from where?
P9:16:00 <liq3> School maybe.
P9:16:01 <Parthon> citric: it's more than that, it's greed and sloth
P9:16:05 <vede> Not that the "vast majority" of people are jerks, but a single jerk makes up for ten "good" people.
P9:16:07 <PuyoDead> what school?
P9:16:10 <citricsquid> liq3: cavemen had school?
P9:16:12 <Parthon> people want the best, but they don't want to work for it
P9:16:16 <PuyoDead> how can it be taught if it was never there?
P9:16:20 <liq3> citricsquid: You've met and studied cavemen?
P9:16:37 <citricsquid> liq3: my understanding of history is that before them there was no comparable human life form
P9:16:47 <liq3> parthon: That's also taught.
P9:16:52 <citricsquid> so it has to have come from somewhere and if they were the first humans, it must have come from them...
P9:16:54 <PuyoDead> again, from where?
P9:17:00 <LG_Legacy> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=18611#p18611 WHY?!
P9:17:01 <PuyoDead> where did this evil teaching come from?
P9:17:03 <Parthon> liq3: what do you mean "taught" though?
P9:17:10 <vede> liq3, that's not taught. It's basic behavior.
P9:17:12 <liq3> citricsquid: What? Greed? Greed is a dysfunctional behavoir. It's not default human behavoir.
P9:17:14 <GeneralGuy> hmmmm
P9:17:22 <vede> The goal of life is the best outcome with the least exertion.
P9:17:32 <liq3> Parthon: I mean they learned it after birth. It's not in the DNA.
P9:17:38 <Parthon> oh right, yes indeed
P9:17:43 <vede> If you can have everything but have to do nothing, that is the ideal situation.
P9:17:44 <Parthon> it's learnt
P9:17:52 <PuyoDead> you still haven't answered
P9:17:53 <citricsquid> liq3: Surely it is, we as humans want to be the best, whether we view that as having more posessions or controlling more people, how did that get into us? Where did we learn it from?

P9:23:13 <Parthon> citricsquid: yeah, and the countries with the highest "standard of living" have the highest suicide rate ... hmmmmm
P9:23:13 <PuyoDead> I'd have to disagree there
P9:23:24 <liq3> citricsquid: On a scale of life skills and happiness, "coping" is -1 out of 10.

P9:27:37 <citricsquid> GeneralGuy: yes, also different political groups, but religion is easiest to use as an example :)
P9:27:39 <liq3> Parthon: They can be weeded out.
P9:27:48 <liq3> Parthon: A resource based economy is the first step.
P9:27:52 <PuyoDead> they cannot be weeded out
P9:27:55 <LG_Legacy> Stop taking me away from my godmodding survival fun
P9:27:56 <vede> liq3, they cannot.
P9:27:56 <GeneralGuy> ok, just making sure that wasn't the ONLY thing
P9:28:01 <Parthon> what is a resource based economy?
P9:28:01 <citricsquid> liq3: how do you stop people taking advantage?
P9:28:03 <vede> You will never stop people from disagreeing.
P9:28:06 <liq3> "cannot"? What crazy talk is this you speak?
P9:28:06 <Roadcrosser> are ya talking politics?
P9:28:11 <PuyoDead> simply that
P9:28:14 <vede> Roadcrosser, yes.
P9:28:16 <Parthon> they can be weeded out, it will just take a different level of thinking that we currently use
P9:28:17 <Roadcrosser> ok
P9:28:23 <liq3> Parthon: Exactly.
P9:28:25 <Parthon> than
P9:28:33 <PuyoDead> there's a few key points here that would make it possible:
P9:28:50 <liq3> The thing about - I guess "higher" thinking - is that it's infectious. Once you have tasted it, it's hard to ever go back to the old thinking.
P9:29:15 <Zuriki> I think it is possible.
P9:29:26 <PuyoDead> 1. all religious thought removed. 2. all schooling completely revamped. 3. population control
P9:29:30 <Parthon> there's also the side effect of being able to better understand old thinking because you can see it without being a part of it
P9:29:30 <Zuriki> But people need to think it's possible.
P9:29:31 <liq3> citricsquid: What if they have nothing to take advantage of?
P9:29:32 <Roadcrosser> if ya wanna talk politics
P9:29:39 <PuyoDead> those are what one might call "giant hurdles"
P9:29:40 <liq3> Zuriki: Yep.
P9:29:45 <Roadcrosser> bring it to the #political channel
P9:29:49 <vede> Uh, hey wait.
P9:30:01 <liq3> PuyoDead: The biggest hurdle is the government.
P9:30:03 <citricsquid> Zuriki: doesn't work like that, you can't just tell people to change their way of thinking.
P9:30:10 <vede> I just read on the Venus Project website that... there won't be any police?
P9:30:11 <liq3> PuyoDead: All others are small compared to that.
P9:30:15 <PuyoDead> government is a small hurdle compared to religion
P9:30:19 <citricsquid> liq3: if you have 8 cakes and I have 5, I feel that I don't have enough cakes because you have more.
P9:30:20 <vede> That is an impossible society, throughout.

P9:30:23 <Zuriki> I never said that citricsquid.
P9:30:35 <liq3> PuyoDead: no. You can just co-exist with religion, and religion will die by itself.
P9:30:35 <vede> It assumes that every single person will never do anything wrong.
P9:30:45 <Zuriki> I said that people need to believe it's possible, I never said it has to be forced upon them.
P9:30:46 <Parthon> PuyoDead: see .. if you have 8 cakes and I have 5 cakes, I'm happy because I have 5 cakes :P
P9:30:47 <PuyoDead> people's core way of thinking is going to override any government action

P9:31:04 <liq3> GeneralGuy: Natural selection.
P9:31:06 <Parthon> and I'm extra happy, because we have 13 cakes :D
P9:31:11 <vede> liq3, that's crap.
P9:31:12 <citricsquid> Zuriki: and I'm saying it doesn't work like that ;) lots of people won't just believe it can happen.
P9:31:15 <PuyoDead> because religion has done a great way of coexisting so far
P9:31:19 <Roadcrosser> if ya wanna talk politics
P9:31:21 <Roadcrosser> bring it to the #political channel
P9:31:27 <citricsquid> Parthon: 6 each and we give the last one to the pet?!
P9:31:29 <Roadcrosser> umm
P9:31:30 <GeneralGuy> religiong won't die as long as thers holes in science
P9:31:33 <liq3> PuyoDead: Religion is already dying, incase you haven't noticed.
P9:31:37 <PuyoDead> road, shoosh
P9:31:38 <citricsquid> liq3: lmao
P9:31:41 <Roadcrosser> k
P9:31:42 <PuyoDead> please
P9:31:43 <vede> If "natural selection" will do away with religion, it wouldn't have been so popular for so long.
P9:31:49 <citricsquid> liq3: religion is CHANGING not dying
P9:32:12 <Zuriki> Religion is a joke.
P9:32:21 <GeneralGuy> Zuriki is a joke
P9:32:24 <liq3> Ah.
P9:32:28 <liq3> Yes, the scarcity mineset.
P9:32:28 <Zuriki> The basises of peace and prosperity are not.
P9:32:29 <PuyoDead> religion will always be around so long as more people teach it
P9:32:34 <vede> I think we all basically agree that religion is a joke.
P9:32:36 <liq3> The scarcity mineset is the root of all problems.
P9:32:41 <PuyoDead> vede: agreed
P9:32:42 <vede> But that's not what we're talking about.
P9:32:43 <liq3> mind*
P9:32:50 <liq3> vede: it's closely related.
P9:32:57 <Zuriki> But the fairy stories are completely irrelevant.
P9:32:59 <Parthon> liq3: but the root of the scarcity mindset is ego identification
P9:33:07 <liq3> Parthon: what's thaht?
P9:33:14 <PuyoDead> liq3, here's the thing. I would LOVE, LOVE for what you propose to happen
P9:33:25 <vede> I would not. >.>
P9:33:37 <PuyoDead> but I don't see any possible way for people to change that much
P9:33:45 <PuyoDead> I'm not talking venus projectm I'm talking peace
P9:33:54 <Parthon> liq3: the belief that we are all seperate from each other, and that there is an "I" identity that can be more by getting more stuff
P9:33:55 <liq3> PuyoDead: If you want it to happen, move YOURSELF towards it.
P9:34:01 <liq3> PuyoDead: Lead by example.
P9:34:10 <PuyoDead> liq3, as far I know, I don't promote people to fight
P9:34:13 <liq3> Parthon: Are yes, that belief.
P9:34:14 <citricsquid> liq3: that's just not possible.
P9:34:20 <Parthon> it's the belief that creates the thoughts such as "I am christian" .. "I am a good person." "What I know is right" .. etc etc
P9:34:23 <liq3> Parthon: I'd forgotten about it. >.>
P9:34:26 <GeneralGuy> I think I remember hearing something about this one group of people who tried making a "perfect society"
P9:34:29 <Parthon> and it's what allows people to commit atrocities against others
P9:34:38 <GeneralGuy> it worked, but then they had kids
P9:34:44 <GeneralGuy> and it fell apart
P9:34:50 <PuyoDead> that's one big problem
P9:35:00 <Zuriki> Litte brats need a beating.
P9:35:06 <PuyoDead> it may be a false pretext, but brainwashing from the start would do the trick
P9:35:09 <citricsquid> liq3: Surely we had a perfect society before, when we knew nothing but chasing animals and living in caves; what's to say this wouldn't happen again? 
P9:35:16 <vede> PuyoDead is right.
P9:35:21 <liq3> citricsquid: No, I highly doubt we've ever had one.
P9:35:21 <Parthon> puyo: brain washing in a good way
P9:35:30 <vede> Brain washing cannot be in a good way.
P9:35:31 <vede> Ever.
P9:35:32 <liq3> citricsquid: we weren't always top of the food chain.
10P9:35:45 * Griskard (chatzilla@230.125.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
P9:35:53 <Parthon> vede: but learning is brain washing :P
P9:35:53 <citricsquid> liq3: so it'd only work if we're top of the food chain and we're never contested?
P9:36:00 <PuyoDead> not so
P9:36:02 <liq3> citricsquid: we can be contested.
P9:36:04 <vede> Learning is not brainwashing.
P9:36:10 <liq3> citricsquid: But we have to be top, at least for this planet.
P9:36:14 <citricsquid> liq3: but when contested we need to be better
P9:36:17 <citricsquid> so we strive to be better
P9:36:23 <citricsquid> and then the problems begin...
P9:36:24 <liq3> citricsquid: Yes, obviously, or humanity would die off.
10P9:36:36 * Colain (Mibbit@122.58.2.131) has joined #minecraft
P9:36:38 <liq3> citricsquid: no, the problems begin when we try being better then each other.
P9:36:47 <Griskard> Technically learning IS brainwashing
P9:36:48 <GeneralGuy> and we always will
P9:36:51 <PuyoDead> liq3, have you ever read Ishmael or My Ishmael?
P9:36:56 <Colain> Griskard!
P9:37:01 <Parthon> vede: sure it is :D
P9:37:01 <liq3> PuyoDead: no.
P9:37:03 <Griskard> Colain!
P9:37:09 <PuyoDead> I strongly suggest you do
P9:37:19 <PuyoDead> and it has no stance on either side of this issue
P9:37:19 <Griskard> Colain, Colaaain Collaaaaain, Im begging of you please don't take, my man
P9:37:44 <Colain> Uh...
P9:37:44 <Parthon> both brain washing and learning change the way you think about the world
P9:37:50 <PuyoDead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael_%28novel%29
P9:37:51 <liq3> Haha, I love this video. He just said we're in a private dictatorship, and it makes perfect sense.
P9:38:08 <citricsquid> liq3: btw, out of curiosity, how old are you?
P9:38:14 <liq3> citricsquid: 18.
P9:38:18 <PuyoDead> brainwashing is forced knowledge. learning is finding things out on your own
12P9:38:23 * Colain (Mibbit@122.58.2.131) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P9:38:53 <PuyoDead> just read the first paragraph of that wiki entry, liq3
P9:38:58 <Griskard> So Schooling is brainwashing, wheras sticking your finger in a power point is learning. 
P9:39:00 <PuyoDead> I think you'd find it interesting
P9:39:04 <liq3> PuyoDead: I'll look into it more later.

P9:39:24 <Roadcrosser> hey its colain
P9:39:36 <Roadcrosser> colain wanna come to the 'archs'?
P9:39:47 <Parthon> which would make school half brainwashing, half learning
P9:39:53 <Parthon> I'd agree with that
P9:40:02 <Visiiri> Avenger?
P9:40:03 <Visiiri> You here?
P9:40:13 <liq3> Parthon: School half learning? School is maybe 5% learning at best.
P9:40:14 <citricsquid> school isn't really brainwashing, is it? You're not forced to accept certain ideas, you're just given them.

P9:40:18 <Griskard> Yeah
P9:40:21 <Parthon> liq3: true
P9:40:21 <citricsquid> I was never forced to accept anything in school.
P9:40:28 <Griskard> Schooling is just repeating what your told
P9:40:33 <liq3> citricsquid: Control what the people talk about and hear, and you control what they think about.
P9:40:35 <vede> I was never "forced" but the teachers tried hard.
P9:40:41 <Griskard> Yeah but your marked down if you give answers which arent what they want you too
P9:40:48 <Parthon> citricsquid: and then tested to see how well you learned what you were forced to learn

P9:40:59 <vede> Modern education is crap, through and through.
P9:41:07 <PuyoDead> "Takers as people often referred to as "civilized." Particularly, the culture born in an Agricultural Revolution that began about 10,000 years ago in the Near East"
P9:41:08 <Griskard> You can avoid learning it, but youll fail your test
P9:41:14 <Visiiri> Avenger?
P9:41:18 <BoirG> yes. corporal punichment was what kept the midgets inline
P9:41:24 <Visiiri> You say you're here, but you're not..

P9:41:44 <Visiiri> :D:D:D
P9:41:47 <citricsquid>     * the cognitive process of acquiring skill or knowledge; "the child's acquisition of language" 
P9:41:50 <Visiiri> ok

P9:41:57 <Ave> lil crowded here
P9:42:04 <vede> I think anyone who thinks that that Venus Project is even feasible is a bit loony.
P9:42:20 <BoirG> venus project?

P10:52:23 <vede> Artificial limitation: you may not hold any brown mushroom except to eat it.
P10:52:46 <vede> So you can't keep packs of shrooms for your adventures.
P10:52:51 <vede> But you can still heal yourself.
P10:53:55 <TrueWolves> EAT SHROOMS TO KEEP BREATHING UNDER WATER
P10:54:12 <Dilt> man
P10:54:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> shrooms are a viable source for oxygen
P10:54:24 <Dilt> i only have a few requests of notch
P10:54:28 <Dilt> most of which he already has planned
P10:54:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> in 3 weeks time
P10:54:45 <Dilt> 3 weeks is his vacation
P10:54:48 <Dilt> i mean by the time the game is done
P10:54:49 <Blackop2> i wanna get minecraft tomorrow D:
P10:54:54 <Dilt> i really would like that third person camera and finite water/lava
P10:55:11 <Dilt> (since finite water/lava means that you can pump/move it other places)
P10:55:20 <Dilt> as of right now i literally mine in fear
P10:55:23 <Dilt> that any second i may hit water or lava
P10:55:29 <Dilt> and be unable to clear out my mine
P10:55:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> git sponge bloks
P10:55:41 <Dilt> sponge blocks are sort of a workaround
P10:55:49 <Dilt> also are there any in the survival test?
P10:55:59 <Blackop2> If u load a sandbox map
P10:56:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> nope, but you should be able to place them in sandbox
P10:56:03 <Eagle> If you play survival on a map you made in sandbox
P10:56:06 <Eagle> with sponges

P10:56:50 <vede> Also, you may only pick mushrooms, not kill pigs.
P10:56:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> howdy
P10:57:02 <Avenger> hey can u save in survival???
P10:57:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> killing pigs is a crime
P10:57:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> press esc
P10:57:14 <Avenger> and be where u saved when you loaded?

P10:57:23 <geekahedron> you can't load survival maps in sandbox mode

P10:57:35 <Eagle> Avenger you'll have your points, blocks, etc
P10:57:40 <Dilt> TrueWolves: easy
P10:57:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> it can however load maps from sandbox
P10:57:45 <geekahedron> right
P10:57:45 <TrueWolves> But It requires flooding the whole level.

P10:59:07 <Dilt> it's very difficult
P10:59:24 <TrueWolves> Dilt	TrueWolves: easy
P10:59:28 <Dilt> because once you get that information you have to be able to do something with it
P10:59:45 <Dilt> you can't load it, for example, without being able to get that information back to the applet

P11:53:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> that was the bot's name
P11:53:03 <mail2345> hmm
P11:53:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> just looked up the tabs
P11:53:10 <mail2345> uhh, lg any ram issues?
P11:53:13 <LG_Legacy> Nope
P11:53:15 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P11:53:18 <LG_Legacy> And no image editing
P11:53:29 <Visiiri> LG
P11:53:31 <Visiiri> Tell
P11:53:32 <LG_Legacy> I fail hard at photoshop
P11:53:33 <Baroch> has to be Cheat engine
P11:53:33 <Dilt> memory editing
P11:53:37 <LG_Legacy> Baroch wins
P11:53:37 <Dilt> of course
P11:53:43 <LG_Legacy> :D
P11:53:44 <Baroch> woot
P11:53:45 <mail2345> well
P11:53:48 <Visiiri> "memory" editing?
P11:53:52 <LG_Legacy> Yes
P11:53:54 <Visiiri> you mean "file"?
P11:53:57 <LG_Legacy> Nope
P11:53:59 <mail2345> it still falls under the catagory of ram
P11:53:59 <LG_Legacy> Memory editing
P11:54:03 <Visiiri> dwah?
P11:54:04 <mail2345> ... cheater.
P11:54:06 <LG_Legacy> No it doesn't shut up >_>
P11:54:08 <Dilt> pretty much cheating.
P11:54:14 <Baroch> ya
P11:54:17 <LG_Legacy> None the less
P11:54:18 <Dilt> basically it takes the '20' arrows stored in memory
P11:54:20 <LG_Legacy> I had fun
P11:54:24 <Dilt> and changes that 20 to some other number
P11:54:29 <mail2345> time to work on !rolll
P11:54:32 <mail2345> and something els
P11:54:33 <mail2345> e
P11:54:34 <Visiiri> teach me teache me
P11:54:36 <mail2345> that i forgot to do
P11:54:41 <LG_Legacy> I had fun figuring out godmode
P11:54:45 <Baroch> you have to multiply it by 8 or something
P11:54:49 <LG_Legacy> Godmode does not work when drowning :l
P11:54:50 <mail2345> ...
P11:54:51 <mail2345> not
P11:54:53 <Dilt> mail2345: man, i love regex
P11:54:54 <Dilt> :(
P11:54:59 <mail2345> baraoch, that is only for flash
P11:55:02 <Visiiri> Teach me teach me
P11:55:07 <mail2345> cheat engine
P11:55:11 <Baroch> really?
P11:55:15 <LG_Legacy> Yes
P11:55:17 <mail2345> http://cheatengine.org
P11:55:20 <Baroch> tdamn
P11:55:33 <Dilt> i just call it memory editing regardless of program
P11:55:33 <LG_Legacy> I found a value, made it change, searched for the edited value from the orignal, and used that value and changed it. Easy.
P11:55:41 <Dilt> because that's really all it is
P11:55:52 <LG_Legacy> Godmode: Find the value/address of the Heart, freeze it.
P11:55:57 <LG_Legacy> Value = 20
P11:56:00 <Dilt> anyway
P11:56:13 <Dilt> obscuring the memory is actually a fun little trick
P11:56:13 <LG_Legacy> There, now i ruined everyones chances of legit high scores
P11:56:13 <Dilt> :D
P11:56:42 <Dilt> all you have to do is have the memory value be something else
P11:56:48 <LG_Legacy> Yeah ..
P11:56:50 <Dilt> and use a forumula on the value to obtain the 'display' value
P11:57:02 <Visiiri> lol
P11:57:05 <LG_Legacy> I tried to figure out how to fuck with block spawning, and i failed. But i'm stil ltrying
P11:57:05 <Dilt> notch probably just scratched it up quickly (since really, most of that will be server-side)
P11:57:11 <LG_Legacy> The old method doesn't work too well.
P11:57:21 <LG_Legacy> A. The address changes :l B. You can't go to Build
P11:57:38 <Visiiri> ok
P11:57:42 <Visiiri> I got cheat engline
P11:57:44 <Visiiri> moar info
P11:57:46 <Dilt> the address changes because of the uhh
P11:57:47 <LG_Legacy> But theres a way, i know it.
P11:57:48 <Dilt> data type involved
P11:57:56 <LG_Legacy> Has to be a fucking way
P11:58:19 <Dilt> i forgot what notch uses for his blocks but uhh
P11:58:20 <LG_Legacy> Visiiri, you can use Cheat Engine to fuck with almost anything with a number or more sometimes
P11:58:32 <LG_Legacy> It works like this
P11:58:33 <LG_Legacy> Arrows?
P11:58:39 <LG_Legacy> Scan for 20 on first search
P11:58:44 <Dilt> changing them with usual methods will be hard
P11:58:45 <LG_Legacy> Make it deduct by one (Fire one.)
P11:58:47 <LG_Legacy> Seek for 19
P11:58:51 <LG_Legacy> Edit the value
P11:58:52 <LG_Legacy> Done
P11:58:53 <LG_Legacy> :l
P11:59:03 <LG_Legacy> (Warning: Sometimes more than one value will come up.)
P11:59:09 <LG_Legacy> (Sometimes the ycrash the game.)
