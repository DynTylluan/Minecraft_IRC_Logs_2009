A4:39:02 <Fushigidane> I have 2 questions. hopefully someone can answer them
A4:39:11 <TrueWolves> Perhaps
A4:39:18 <Fushigidane> What are the system requirements for the server software?
A4:39:19 <Fushigidane> And
A4:39:31 <Fushigidane> Do you need ot have already purchased the game, or will Alpha work with it
A4:40:00 <TrueWolves> the purchased version of the game is the same as the alpha so far (besides skins)
A4:40:07 <Fushigidane> ok
A4:40:10 <TrueWolves> So I'm 100% sure that would work.
A4:40:17 <TrueWolves> What are your system specs?
A4:41:56 <Fushigidane> eMachines EL1200 Windows XP Home SP3, AMD Athalon (1.65 Ghz) 900MB RAM
A4:42:03 <TrueWolves> hmmmm
A4:42:05 <Fushigidane> Do you want video/audio info too?
A4:42:08 <citricsquid> server will run off almost any computer, uses around 150mb ram and 5% CPU
A4:42:20 <Fushigidane> I should be fine then
A4:42:22 <TrueWolves> Yeah, 900MB is enough
A4:42:28 <Fushigidane> Thank you for your help

A4:54:43 <Fushigidane> And now I have another question :P
A4:54:59 <TrueWolves> perhaps just stick around then? =3
A4:55:06 <TrueWolves> shoot away
A4:55:14 <Fushigidane> How do you set the size of the map you want to generate for the server
A4:55:31 <TrueWolves> I think you need map hacking to do that
A4:55:46 <Fushigidane> Is it a tool on minecraft somewhere?
A4:55:55 <TrueWolves> in the forums under map modding.
A4:56:04 <Fushigidane> ah. again, ty
A4:56:17 <Fushigidane> i think i wil lstick round a bit untill i can get my server running the way i want it
A4:58:11 <TrueWolves> defualt size with out hacking is... 256/256/64

A5:00:21 <Nidis> Yo!
10A5:00:38 * ChanServ sets mode: +o citricsquid
A5:01:24 <Nidis> Is there a common problem as to why a server might not connect?
A5:01:36 <citricsquid> *gets links*
A5:01:39 <Nidis> I'd like to host, and I turned my firewall off
A5:01:46 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=76
A5:01:51 <Nidis> and I read that thread...
A5:02:07 <citricsquid> so you've forwarded your ports and you're connecting from the internal url?
A5:02:07 <Nidis> =\
A5:02:17 <Nidis> Err, well, I'm at my parents house.
A5:02:17 <Nidis> So.
10A5:02:21 * Daedalus (hurdur@c-24-19-197-214.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A5:02:34 <Nidis> Port forwarding is a bit of a hassle
A5:02:42 <Nidis> Is that most likely the problem?
A5:02:48 <citricsquid> You need to: Forward ports, change "verfiy-names:" to false and connect from internal URL.
A5:02:56 <citricsquid> If it hangs on connecting the problem is ports.
A5:03:03 <Nidis> Ah, thanks.
A5:03:08 <Daedalus> Which ports need to be opened?
A5:03:47 <citricsquid> the port in your config...
A5:04:19 <Daedalus> In my config.
A5:04:25 <Nidis> external URL..?
A5:04:29 <Nidis> internal?
A5:04:32 <Nidis> is there a difference?
A5:04:35 <citricsquid> yes...
A5:04:36 <citricsquid> read the topic
A5:04:39 <citricsquid> that I linked
A5:04:51 <citricsquid> "2. Trying to connect to your own server but it won't work? Try using this url: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?serve … port=25565"
A5:04:56 <Daedalus> Could you link that again
A5:04:59 <citricsquid> that is the internal URL
A5:05:01 <citricsquid> http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=76
A5:05:08 <Daedalus> thanks
A5:06:14 <Nidis> Its just generating a new level.
A5:06:27 <citricsquid> what's the external url?
A5:06:35 <Nidis> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=43d038a847342ea97be24c30f86e86bd
A5:07:05 <citricsquid> ports aren't forwarded properly.
A5:07:12 <Nidis> D: balls.
A5:07:13 <Nidis> alright
A5:07:15 <Nidis> thank you
A5:09:39 <Daedalus> Is there some reason it's really hard to undo IP bans? Because every time someone says they've unbanned me, I still can't join the game cause the applet freezes
A5:09:56 <citricsquid> IP bans require a server restart afaik
A5:10:06 <citricsquid> and if you're IP banned you freeze on connect
A5:10:07 <Siiseli> sounds a bit silly
A5:10:09 <Daedalus> Hrm.
A5:10:10 <citricsquid> so you're still banned.
A5:10:15 <Daedalus> Yeah, I love that freeze on connect
A5:10:58 <Daedalus> We gave a closet griefer op powers on a server, and he banned a bunch of us
A5:11:13 <Daedalus> Sucks

A5:15:56 <jprogram> gigantic map
A5:16:06 <jprogram> party_cat is the admin

A5:16:45 <jprogram> yea, i heard about the rogue op
A5:16:49 <Daedalus> I wish party_cat was around more often, so I could be unbanned
A5:17:01 <Daedalus> He seemed trustworthy, he helped restore a bunch of things
A5:17:05 <jprogram> i just wish i could get a hold of party_cat, the server's down
A5:17:24 <Daedalus> The server goes down every day :\
A5:17:32 <jprogram> i know, but it's early
A5:17:33 <Daedalus> I don't think it's dedicated
A5:17:36 <Daedalus> true
A5:17:47 <jprogram> it still has about 1 hour left till usual closing
10A5:17:54 * notjotham (jotham@203-97-254-40.cable.telstraclear.net) has left #minecraft
A5:17:54 <jprogram> and, I was AFK for about 2 minutes
A5:18:25 <Daedalus> Wish we had a way to contact him
A5:18:40 <jprogram> yea, but party is very discreet
A5:18:40 <Daedalus> Man, I'm still banned from Redshift's server too
A5:18:43 <Daedalus> this sucks
A5:19:00 <citricsquid> play on a [dedicated] 24/7 Minecraft! ;)
A5:19:03 <Daedalus> Got friviously banned from both servers I've frequented so far
A5:19:06 <Daedalus> er
A5:19:10 <Daedalus> thats not how you spell that
A5:19:14 <Daedalus> frivilously
A5:19:23 <Fushigidane> Come to the server I'm making. I'll ban you there if you like :P
A5:19:26 <Daedalus> But which one? There's so many
A5:19:47 <jprogram> meh, i rather not go since i would be banned
A5:19:51 <Fushigidane> Mine's gonna be a sandbox when I get it up if that catches anyones interest
A5:20:30 <Fushigidane> Game sandbox. Not technical sandbox. There will be grass
A5:20:36 <jprogram> btw, that chrisdude, is he the one who got you band?

A5:21:17 <Daedalus> Craftmeister
A5:21:19 <Daedalus> was his name
A5:21:44 <jprogram> crastmeister, what made him pissy?
A5:21:56 <Daedalus> dunno
A5:22:08 <Daedalus> was probably his goal all along to become op
A5:22:13 <Daedalus> and then ban people
A5:22:17 <Daedalus> maybe he was bored
A5:22:21 <Daedalus> I can't ask him :\

A5:22:24 <jprogram> corrupted, like hitler
A5:22:47 <Daedalus> I didn't even think ops could ban other ops like that
A5:24:49 <jprogram> that's kindof a good thing
A5:25:10 <Daedalus> I think there should be some kind of hierarchy of ops
A5:25:30 <Daedalus> Like, some asshole that you give op powers to shouldn't be able to turn around and ban you
A5:25:35 <Daedalus> but you could still ban him
A5:25:55 <jprogram> sounds like a good suggestion
A5:26:35 <jprogram> shoot, im bored now
A5:26:54 <jprogram> must find hobby

A5:27:05 <Fushigidane> One last question
A5:27:39 <jprogram> shoot
A5:28:41 <Fushigidane> I'm constantly dropping and changing my IP because I use a single modem for 2 computers. If I start a server and switch the computers, naturally it will be unavailable, but when i re-attach to my comp that is hosting
A5:29:02 <Fushigidane>  (with a new IP obviously. This is unavoidable) will I be able to run the same server or will it negativly effect the site (add too many servers from the same guy or somethingto that effect)
10A5:29:09 * akuryo (chatzilla@86.63.251.140) has joined #minecraft
A5:30:29 <jprogram> are the two computer's ip the same or different?
A5:30:30 <Fushigidane> Im assuming that, when a new server comes up, it will be added to the list of servers. If that's true, would constantly changing my ip make the site 'assume' that the server is a new one and add it to the list?
A5:30:42 <Fushigidane> My ISP automatically re-assigns IPs
A5:30:44 <citricsquid> if a server is offline it's removed.
A5:30:49 <Fushigidane> Ah ok
A5:31:02 <Fushigidane> Thank you. That helps a lot

A9:50:03 <v1gr> Hi, yesterday i couldn't connect to my own server, but I could after setting verify names to =false. Today i set the server to be Private, but now I can't connect again :/ any tips from some bright heads?
A9:50:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> Are you using the same URL?
A9:50:40 <v1gr> yesterday i connected through the gamelist
A9:50:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Well if it's private it won't be on  the gamelist
A9:50:57 <v1gr> now i cant cus its private, i have tried using both url types
A9:51:02 <v1gr> yes i know...
A9:51:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> Have you tried logging out and back in?
A9:51:31 <citricsquid> externalurl.txt?
A9:51:43 <v1gr> yep, i tried external, i only get conn error
A9:51:49 <v1gr> fail fail to connect
A9:52:03 <Maart3h> i have the same problem
A9:52:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> have you tried ?ip=&port= ?
A9:52:32 <v1gr> i also tried plot in the ip for my laptop where im hosting it, both the external ip and the internal network ip, both fails
A9:52:33 <v1gr> :/
A9:52:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> You put the port in?
A9:52:44 <v1gr> others can join it
A9:52:47 <v1gr> yup
A9:53:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fry your cookies... maybe that has something to do with it
A9:53:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> Or try a new browser
A9:53:37 <Quatroking> God I'm gettig tired of this LucasAnderson guy
A9:53:41 <v1gr> Still no go :(
A9:53:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Ports are forwarded properly?
A9:54:13 <v1gr> yup, it worked yesterday when it was public, and ppl outside my network can join
A9:54:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> No antivirus or firewall?
A9:54:32 <v1gr> i set it to private today and now it wont work, looks like im only able to join it locally via the gamelist not via ip
A9:54:38 <v1gr> nop
A9:54:46 <v1gr> it worked yesterday so it cant be that
A9:54:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Okay, go to the server
A9:54:55 <v1gr> it will work again if i set it public
A9:54:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> and look at the externalurl.txt file
A9:54:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> go to that
A9:55:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> maybe it changed when you set it to private

A9:58:03 <v1gr> only thing i did was fixing it to private server
A9:58:08 <v1gr> i have avg, and nothing else
A9:58:12 <v1gr> avg doesn't block anything
A9:58:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> No Vista?  Allow/Deny crap?
A9:58:21 <citricsquid> does it work if you set it to public?
A9:58:21 <v1gr> i cant join my own server on the server machine.
A9:58:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've heard of problems with that earlier
A9:58:28 <v1gr> its win xp and win 7
A9:59:13 <v1gr> i can't even join on my hosting computer
A9:59:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> I wish I could compile all the Windows problems in this IRC lately into a booklet, and then say This is why we use Linux!

A9:59:54 <v1gr> that means it works

A10:06:43 <Quatroking> Why do some people just have to blatantly spam their shitty server everywhere
A10:06:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> I know Quatroking 
A10:07:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> I never spam REDDIT PUBLIC anywhere
A10:07:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> In fact, I never mention REDDIT PUBLIC
A10:07:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
A10:08:06 <Quatroking> what pisses me off even more is that this LucasAnderson guy doesn't even come on the IRC like I requested
A10:08:17 <Quatroking> He's just busy editing articles right now
A10:08:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> On the wiki?
A10:08:27 <Quatroking> Yeah
A10:08:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which server does he spam?
A10:08:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just go in there to talk to him...
A10:08:52 <Quatroking> his shitty Spleef N Arena thing
A10:09:04 <Quatroking> with all the crappy spleef ripoffs
13A10:09:28 * AlLnAtuRalX is getting to hate spleef more and more.
A10:09:32 <Quatroking> that even a retarded person with parkinson, braincancer and downs could make up
A10:09:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't think brain cancer affects mental capacity, but point taken :P
A10:10:00 <Quatroking> I've played it once and it sucks. (because I suck at it, logic!)
A10:10:07 <Quatroking> brain cancer does i think
A10:10:19 <Quatroking> having a giant tumor in your brain should affect SOMETHING
A10:10:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> It does... It hurts like a bitch
A10:10:28 <Adura> "It's not a tumor!"
A10:10:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> and gives you visual and auditory hallucinations
A10:10:38 <Quatroking> No, it's your FACE
A10:10:42 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
A10:10:43 <Quatroking> exactly.
A10:10:53 <Quatroking> so basically
A10:10:59 <Quatroking> all junkies just have brain tumors
A10:11:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> lolol
A10:12:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wow... Recent changes are like all on the Spleef article
A10:12:39 <Quatroking> Exactly.
A10:12:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> "Founder and Associate"
A10:12:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> what a joke...

A10:13:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> He's calling himself the associate of the server
A10:13:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> :P
A10:13:52 <Quatroking> I'm not going to moderate that page, alnaturalX
A10:14:01 <Quatroking> it's a server page so I don't care

A10:15:26 <Quatroking> citricsquid, is it possible to edit the html of the edit page?
A10:15:43 <Quatroking> so we can throw in a link to an article with rules or something
A10:15:52 <citricsquid> Sure, if you make an article I'll add it :D

A11:25:20 <Quatroking> Yep
A11:25:29 <Quatroking> took 460MB of ram to run the server

A11:27:14 <Quatroking> 512*512*128 isn't working so I'll just do 640*640*64

P1:21:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, we need more features
P1:22:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> votekick would be nice, so us Linux users could rival the Minecraft Server Admin Tool
P1:22:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> (If 3 people say votekick someone, they get kicked)
P1:22:33 <Adura> Oh, but remote administration has been covered by someone?
P1:22:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> For Windows, yes
P1:22:45 <Rroff> I can implement votekick if I can adapt my backup script
P1:22:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=376
P1:23:11 <Adura> I could certainly code it, but it'd be nice if some people used that script to see if it's not buggy.
P1:23:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll test it  a bit later today
P1:24:02 <Adura> Some description of the standard behaviour of votekick/ban would be nice.
P1:24:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Users say votekick [name]
P1:24:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> there is a threshold, ex - 3

P1:24:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> when three users votekick the same name within an interval
P1:24:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> the user gets kicked
P1:24:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> I don't think there should be voteban (too easily abused by a few griefers)
P1:25:20 <Testvan> so 3 griefers can kick too?
P1:25:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah, but it's worth the legitimate uses
P1:26:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it would be optional of course
P1:26:29 <Rroff> 60% of votes needed to kick is better :P
P1:26:58 <Adura> Part of why I didn't do votekick just yet, there's no standard.
P1:27:07 <akuryo> back guyz
P1:27:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Threshold would be customizable
P1:27:25 <akuryo> oh byz
P1:27:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> and Rroff, most of the time at least 1/2 of the people here are idlers
P1:27:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> So that won't help
P1:27:33 <Rroff> :P
P1:27:43 <Rroff> and its harder to get player load from std io
P1:27:51 <akuryo> if evil didn't mute me, i just wanted to ask him to stop being a such idiot, that's all
P1:27:51 <Rroff> unless you count up all connects and disconnects
P1:28:04 <Adura> Which is certainly doable.

P3:59:37 <tesseract> There are usually between 200 and 300 people playing this game at a time.

P4:03:09 <tesseract> not me.
P4:03:12 <ZomBuster> oh
P4:03:16 <ZomBuster> he had the same ideas
P4:03:27 <tesseract> I should change my name, because in minecraft I am onecircles.
P4:03:28 <ZomBuster> extreme controlled envoriment
P4:03:50 <tesseract> I don't think it's the only way to go, There should always be unmoderated free for all servers.
P4:04:03 <tesseract> But there should also be extremely controlled servers.
P4:04:18 <ZomBuster> of course
P4:04:28 <ZomBuster> I think those grieffests are fun too
P4:04:51 <ZomBuster> go there, build something quite big, come back a  week later and build on the ruins

P4:10:39 <Dilt> moderation mode shouldn't be that hard to add in
P4:10:46 <08Notch> how would moderation mode?
P4:10:48 <08Notch> work?
P4:10:54 <Adura> Just put them in a /solid block jail.
P4:10:57 <ZomBuster> we already have the required mod tools
P4:10:59 <Dilt> can't build/destroy until greenlighted by a mod
10P4:11:00 * Divagador (Mibbit@67.85.219.87.dynamic.jazztel.es) has joined #minecraft
P4:11:07 <ZomBuster> all other stuff is just.. extra
P4:11:12 <Divagador> Hi guys :D
P4:11:26 <Dilt> this can be default off
P4:11:34 <ZomBuster> sounds pretty stupid tbh
P4:11:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I think a report command might be good, though.
P4:11:36 <Dilt> but the option is pretty much necessary at this point
P4:11:44 <Adura> You can script reports.
P4:11:46 <Evil-Ville> Just play on a private server
P4:12:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I'd imagine a lot of griefers stop temporarily when they know there's an op on their tail.
P4:12:12 <Dilt> not really, vdgmprgrmr
P4:12:23 <Dilt> from blockland and my limited minecraft experience?
P4:12:31 <Dilt> the smart ones stop, but most are not smart
P4:12:45 <Dilt> they would probably do it right in front of you, if grief is their objective
P4:12:50 <ZomBuster> if you tele to them and quickly stand behind them they wont even notice
P4:13:04 <Daedalus> Oh, an idea. I think there should be a hierarchy of ops, where if you give someone an op they can't just turn around and ban you, but you can still ban them
P4:13:13 <vdgmprgrmr> But if someone shouts "User1337 is griefing!"
P4:13:15 <Daedalus> Because giving a griefer op really sucks
P4:13:49 <Dilt> By then it'd probably be too late
P4:14:25 <Dilt> this argument has been had on blockland, the guy eventually made the brickID solution - it helped somewhat, but I doubt it'd work for minecraft at all
P4:14:38 <Dilt> considering you'd have to completely border an underground build to make it work
P4:14:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, you can't script a good report command yourself, since to do the command you'd have to put it into the global chat.
P4:15:23 <tesseract> I think the mod should be able to designate a cube of space, and lock it. no deleting or adding.
P4:15:35 <vdgmprgrmr> That sounds nice.
P4:15:35 <tesseract> Players could request that the mod lock their creathion when it is finished.
P4:15:36 <Dilt> that, from personal coding experience, is way harder
P4:15:44 <Dilt> you have to be able to define the cube
12P4:15:50 * Lmaoboat (Lmaoboat@pool-71-126-132-107.washdc.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P4:15:57 <tesseract> defining a cube doesn't sound hard to me
P4:16:12 <tesseract> You could even just use a special mod cube.
P4:16:14 <ZomBuster> just a starting coordinate and an end one
P4:16:23 <Dilt> ZomBuster: and all z-levels?
P4:16:26 <tesseract> and put them at 4 corners around the creation.
P4:16:31 <vdgmprgrmr> "Magical protection stones."
P4:16:34 <tesseract> cube tower cube
P4:16:35 <ZomBuster> xyz coordinates
P4:16:37 <tesseract> if you know what i mean
P4:16:46 <tesseract> and the program could infer the volume.
P4:16:48 <Divagador> How to make a bigger map ?
P4:16:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Tesseract, you would only need two corners for a cube.
P4:16:50 <Divagador> o_o
P4:16:52 <tesseract> i don't think that would be hard.
P4:16:56 <Dilt> in the end, my coding, I had you shoot one corner, then the other, then the Z level
P4:16:58 <Divagador> like 1024x1024x256
P4:16:59 <tesseract> yeah.
P4:16:59 <Divagador> !
P4:17:14 <Dilt> anyway, minecraft doesn't seem like it wants something complicated like that
P4:17:15 <ZomBuster> you cant do that
P4:17:19 <ZomBuster> way too big
P4:17:24 <Divagador> oh :(
P4:17:28 <Divagador> 512 then ? lol
P4:17:54 <ZomBuster> 256x256x256 is the advisable max size
P4:18:06 <Dilt> oh
P4:18:14 <Dilt> and survival mode? i'd say let the griefers roam free
P4:18:14 <ZomBuster> you could do 512 but it will just.. go slow
P4:18:20 <vdgmprgrmr> If you have the bottom-left-closest corner and the top-right-farthest corner of the box you can find all its dimensions.
P4:18:20 <Dilt> kill them if they cause issue
P4:18:31 <Divagador> uhm, but i wanna try them
P4:18:32 <tesseract> This is a good idea. The moderator puts two cubes at one end with a tower between them for the height of the locked volume, then one cube at the opposite corner and that defines the remaining volume. 3 block placements and voila!
P4:18:32 <Evil-Ville> I prefer 512x512x64
P4:18:41 <Divagador> but how to make these maps ?
P4:18:47 <ZomBuster> thats so low
P4:18:48 <Divagador> with a map editor or something ?
P4:18:58 <ZomBuster> depends what you want
P4:18:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Why 3 block parameters?
P4:19:09 <ZomBuster> empty map?
P4:19:20 <Divagador> uhm
P4:19:31 <Divagador> can't i use the generator?
P4:20:00 <Divagador> like when you doesn't have any server_level.dat inside the folder
P4:20:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Have you been reading my messages, tesseract? Only 2 points are needed to find the other 6 points on a cube.
P4:20:22 <akuryo> lol
P4:20:24 <tesseract> yes, sorry i meant a rectangular prism.
P4:20:26 <akuryo> i can masturbate my ears
P4:20:39 <akuryo> really =)
P4:20:44 <vdgmprgrmr> For a rectangular prism, you still only need 2 points...
P4:20:56 <tesseract> say what?
10P4:21:04 * smn is now known as smn`offline
P4:21:09 <tesseract> Maybe you are not understanding.
P4:21:16 <tesseract> or i am not explaining.
P4:21:21 <Divagador> then ZomBuster  ?
P4:21:23 <vdgmprgrmr> You only need two points to figure out the other six points on any hexahedron.
P4:21:31 <tesseract> how would you define 10x10x20 using two points?
10P4:21:33 * Lmaoboat (Lmaoboat@pool-71-126-132-107.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
P4:21:38 <tesseract> i think you would need 3.
P4:21:40 <ZomBuster> not a cube
P4:21:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Or, any rectangular prism, rather.
P4:21:45 <vdgmprgrmr> No, you only need two.
P4:21:56 <tesseract> ok, please explain.
P4:22:18 <tesseract> in a volume of 100x100x100 how do you define a long thin tall rectangle with two points?
P4:22:26 <Lmaoboat> how goes sound?
P4:22:32 <vdgmprgrmr> If you have one point at 0,0,0 and another point at 10,10,20 you can find all other points on the object.
P4:22:41 <vdgmprgrmr> (Assuming the object is a rectangular prism.)
P4:22:43 <08Notch> sound goes good
P4:22:47 <08Notch> it's done, in fact
P4:22:53 <08Notch> working on triggering music now
P4:23:02 <08Notch> and looking if there's anything quick I can do in the feature or bug lists
P4:23:03 <C418> every third second
P4:23:03 <akuryo> hey notch
P4:23:10 <tesseract> are we imagining a rectangular prism with fixed proportions? if so, i understand what you are saying.
P4:23:12 <akuryo> i'm a ghost buster supa fan too =D
P4:23:28 <C418> that makes you a suppa nerd
P4:23:30 <akuryo> the only problem is that i never really looked the movie, but i'm a fucking great fan =)
P4:23:36 <akuryo> lol
P4:23:41 <akuryo> no really i saw it when i was...
P4:23:43 <akuryo> 5 i think
P4:23:44 <C418> so you never watched the films really
P4:23:50 <C418> oh
P4:23:51 <C418> well
P4:23:56 <akuryo> or maybe more
P4:23:57 <C418> try watching em again then!
P4:23:59 <akuryo> 6 7 8
P4:24:03 <akuryo> yeah i need to download it
P4:24:03 <tesseract> vdg, is it a rectangular prism with fixed proportions?
P4:24:07 <vdgmprgrmr> For any rectangular prism ever, you will only need two points to find the dimensions of the whole thing. You need the point with the smallest values on all axes, and the point with the greatest values on all axes.
P4:24:08 <C418> I will tomorrow when I buy the game with the bluray, heh
P4:24:11 <akuryo> but right now i'm in the star wars marathon
P4:24:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Or any two points with the same relationship.
P4:24:40 <tesseract> Oh, so the two opposite corners, right?
P4:24:47 <tesseract> I see now.
P4:24:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, two opposite corners.
P4:24:53 <akuryo> vdg
P4:24:54 <tesseract> even better.
P4:25:00 <akuryo> what you said is not right
P4:25:05 <akuryo> it depends of the angle on the rectangle
P4:25:14 <akuryo> but actually if we can the same its ok i presume
P4:25:21 <akuryo> take*
P4:25:35 <Quatroking> Hey notch
P4:25:47 <Quatroking> at this rate, when do you expect survival mode to come out?
P4:25:54 <vdgmprgrmr> We're assuming the rectangle is flat, because it HAS to be flat in Minecraft...
P4:26:01 <tesseract> well, sort of.
P4:26:08 <akuryo> i don't hate quatro king but i don't really love it, but i really hate evil-ville. This was the night information =D
P4:26:12 <tesseract> you can make diagonals and such. thay are cool.
P4:26:14 <akuryo> him*
P4:26:28 <Lmaoboat> Hey Notch, are sponges supposed to absosrb lava?
P4:26:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah but they aren't perfect due to the blocky nature.
P4:26:42 <Quatroking> What
P4:26:47 <08Notch> Quatroking: At THIS rate? Never, heh
P4:26:52 <Quatroking> D:
P4:26:55 <tesseract> still though, i think akuryo has made a good point.
P4:27:01 <08Notch> but that's because I keep getting sidetracked. =)
P4:27:07 <vdgmprgrmr> How?
P4:27:07 <tesseract> what if someone builds on the diagonal?
P4:27:16 <akuryo> yeah yeah yeah
P4:27:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you have a rectangle that covers the whole diagonal.
P4:27:27 <tesseract> Now if we define a locked volume without being able to define the angle of the rectangle.
P4:27:31 <Lmaoboat> Lava floods are a lot more messy than water because you can't see anything
P4:27:35 <akuryo> yeah
P4:27:38 <akuryo> and your fucking slow in it
10P4:27:39 * smn`offline is now known as smn
P4:27:40 <tesseract> You have locked Too large a portion of the map.
P4:27:46 <akuryo> its WORST than death lol
P4:27:52 <08Notch> Quatroking: Don't quote me on it, but I'd expect a month perhaps.
P4:28:01 <akuryo> a month is cool
P4:28:06 <akuryo> ALL mods in one month?
P4:28:07 <tesseract> You are so going to be quoted on that.
P4:28:10 <vdgmprgrmr> You could lock small portions of it.
P4:28:10 <08Notch> er, no
12P4:28:13 * Cue (cueball61@cpc2-alde2-0-0-cust719.glfd.cable.ntl.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P4:28:16 <08Notch> that's for first version of survival
P4:28:21 <ZomBuster> aka beta
P4:28:23 <tesseract> I think akuryo is right.
P4:28:23 <akuryo> will you releave a version with only survival?
P4:28:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Not really.
P4:28:44 <vdgmprgrmr> You don't need angled rectangles.
P4:28:47 <tesseract> We need to be able to define diagonally justified rectangles as well.
P4:28:51 <akuryo> you cant really make them
P4:28:59 <tesseract> They are not ABSOLUTELY NECISSARY, but very important.
P4:29:03 <vdgmprgrmr> If someone does build on the diagonal, you can protect the structure in smaller chunks.
P4:29:08 <ZomBuster> how
P4:29:14 <tesseract> But that would be a huge pain.
P4:29:15 <akuryo> you can define a perfect rectangle in three corner
P4:29:20 <akuryo> i think it's not too much
P4:29:30 <tesseract> Yeah, we just need one more point right?
P4:29:34 <akuryo> yeah
P4:29:35 <vdgmprgrmr> So would getting the rectangle at the perfect angle.
P4:29:41 <akuryo> everything will be included
P4:29:45 <akuryo> size angles
P4:29:55 <akuryo> you can not mess
P4:30:01 <akuryo> i mean...
P4:30:05 <ZomBuster> :/
P4:30:09 <akuryo> 2 opposite corners and one random
P4:30:21 <tesseract> I think this is a very good idea we have here though. I hope notch has heard it.
P4:30:27 <akuryo> tiz iz teh perfection
P4:30:35 <akuryo> i didn't.
P4:30:46 <vdgmprgrmr> I really think we could do perfectly fine with normal rectangles.
P4:30:53 <akuryo> wait
P4:30:59 <tesseract> I think we could get by with them.
P4:31:03 <akuryo> NOTCH
P4:31:03 <08Notch> what are you discussing?
P4:31:04 <akuryo> i know!!!
P4:31:07 <Lmaoboat> Notch, you need to make a dark blue cloth block in memory of Billy Mayes
P4:31:09 <akuryo> big revelation
P4:31:16 <akuryo> make like the cube engine!
P4:31:23 <tesseract> We have an idea for locking a volume.
P4:31:31 <ZomBuster> I think it's pretty stupid :/
P4:31:34 <tesseract> 3 blocks that a mod can place to lock a volume.
P4:31:35 <akuryo> notch do you know sauerbraten?
P4:31:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Why 3 blocks?
P4:31:52 <tesseract> for angle.
P4:31:53 <akuryo> 2 blocks are ok for this
P4:32:00 <akuryo> in minecraft there is no angle...
P4:32:02 <akuryo> lol
P4:32:06 <tesseract> it has angle.
P4:32:11 <akuryo> not really
P4:32:13 <tesseract> i build diagonal castles and such.
P4:32:16 <Snowman> Notch do you know knÃ¤ckebrÃ¸d?
P4:32:17 <akuryo> it's easyer to use 2 only
P4:32:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Not actual angle, and having angles in the system would be ridiculous.
P4:32:24 <akuryo> LOL
P4:32:24 <tesseract> dude, that's like saying there are no diagonals in ms paint.
P4:32:27 <akuryo> snowman i'm not joking
P4:32:29 <Snowman> :D
P4:32:31 <akuryo> do you know sauerbraten
P4:32:33 <akuryo> the cube engine
P4:32:37 <akuryo> this would rock for you game
P4:32:42 <akuryo> we could have gigantic flat maps
P4:32:48 <Snowman> it sounds like sauerkraut
P4:32:50 <akuryo> very light
P4:32:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Being able to set angles would be harder to implement, too.
P4:32:55 <tesseract> The voxels are very large so it's hard to visualize different angles, but you can do any angle in Minecraft.
P4:33:08 <tesseract> It's just like with pixels.
P4:33:12 <ZomBuster> yeh
P4:33:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Having flat rectangles would be much easier, and we would be able to do the same things with flat rectangles.
P4:33:16 <akuryo> but it's hard to lock certain areas this wait
P4:33:29 <akuryo> way
P4:33:34 <akuryo> so just take 2 =C
P4:33:39 <ZomBuster> I made a function to draw lines in 3D space for my model importer
P4:33:47 <akuryo> and it works pretty cool
P4:33:59 <tesseract> Zombuster, did you say you don't like our idea?
P4:34:03 <tesseract> If so, why not?
P4:34:04 <akuryo> an equivalent of the modelgen of VDOgamz
P4:34:08 <ZomBuster> dunno
P4:34:12 <ZomBuster> sounds complicated
P4:34:13 <vdgmprgrmr> And again, you can divide one area into just four or five and be able to protect diagonal structures.
P4:34:18 <tesseract> it isn't.
P4:34:37 <akuryo> tesseract: you want to do area locking cubes,
P4:34:38 <akuryo> ?
P4:35:07 <tesseract> The problem is this, someone makes something long and thin on the diagonal, if you are going to lock it you haveto make it so that no one can build anything in a large volume around the structure.
P4:35:25 <tesseract> unless you make like 100 little locked volumes.
P4:35:50 <tesseract> this is how it should work
P4:35:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Once again, you can divide it into NOT 100, but just four or five, or maybe ten in absurd cases, and it would be fine.
P4:36:15 <akuryo> i have a better idea
P4:36:17 <akuryo> everyone
P4:36:20 <tesseract> if you place two of these little blocks, it defines a rectangular prism on the normal axis of the program
P4:36:23 <akuryo> a new information on the cube
P4:36:30 <akuryo> when pressing a key you see it another color
P4:36:31 <tesseract> if you place a third, it angles the rectangular prism.
P4:36:36 <akuryo> you have to select every blocks but
P4:36:38 <akuryo> its cool
P4:36:50 <akuryo> like Y key which is totally useless atm
P4:36:56 <akuryo> noone revert tehere mouse i think lol
P4:37:02 <tesseract> vdg, what do you think of that?
P4:37:25 <tesseract> two block system for most circumstances, three if you need it.
P4:37:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Except angles are not necessary, they make it more complicated, and it would all be to protect a very small portion of structures built in Minecraft.
P4:37:41 <akuryo> i'm sorry but i agree vdgmprgrmr 
P4:37:52 <akuryo> angles are too hard to see
P4:37:58 <akuryo> in our lil brains
P4:38:01 <vdgmprgrmr> And they'd be MUCH harder to implement.
P4:38:04 <akuryo> yeah
P4:38:07 <tesseract> But building a system that is biased towards protecting only xyz perpendicular will bias the whole community towards not building on the diagonal.
P4:38:07 <akuryo> we only need two
P4:38:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Not really.
P4:38:20 <tesseract> i think in the future more and more people will build with diagonals and curves.
P4:38:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Not more than it already is.
P4:38:25 <Divagador> how can they make this??????
P4:38:25 <Divagador> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=9e07d8e7e494dcc4ebc60febb7c437ec
P4:38:30 <tesseract> i allready build with a lot of diagonals and cubes.
P4:38:31 <Divagador> its HUGE
P4:38:36 <tesseract> sorry, curves.
P4:38:49 <akuryo> ho Notch, this is random idea, but you could add particles when a non op try to break solid
P4:38:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Since the game ONLY HAS perpendicular, most people are already biased toward not building with curves.
P4:38:58 <Evil-Ville> The ultimate solution for griefing is already in the game but I am not going to tell you what it is
P4:38:59 <akuryo> like little yellow particles
P4:39:12 <akuryo> cant remind the name lol
P4:39:19 <tesseract> Saying that the game ONLY HAS perpedicular is like saying your moniter ONLY HAS perpendicular.
P4:39:21 <ZomBuster> Divagador they used their own generator
P4:39:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, we know, you think that public servers are made so griefers can have fun, no one cares.
P4:39:29 <ZomBuster> I got one too
P4:39:30 <Divagador> oh
P4:39:41 <ZomBuster> if you say a size ill  make a map for you
P4:39:50 <vdgmprgrmr> The game is perpendicular ENOUGH to say that it only has perpendicular.
P4:39:53 <Divagador> good *_*
P4:40:01 <ZomBuster> its a bit.. different from the normal generator
P4:40:01 <akuryo> xD
P4:40:05 <Divagador> i'm thinking of a big map
P4:40:12 <akuryo> zom buster
P4:40:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Seeing how the things in it are LARGE, whereas a monitor is made of lots of SMALL things.
P4:40:15 <akuryo> flatgrass
P4:40:20 <Divagador> but... no-lava ?
P4:40:21 <tesseract> I disagree, and I think that when sandbox mode is fully implemented there will be curve tools and circle tools and line tools.
P4:40:23 <akuryo> 2048*2048*512
P4:40:24 <Quatroking> Notch, what is the limit of blocks the client can handle?
P4:40:25 <ZomBuster> cool!
P4:40:26 <akuryo> flatgrass
P4:40:27 <Divagador> "pleeeeaaaasssseee"
P4:40:28 <akuryo> can you do it please?
P4:40:31 <ZomBuster> mine doesnt have lava
P4:40:37 <Divagador> nice then
P4:40:41 <ZomBuster> rivers sound good to you?
P4:40:42 <akuryo> zom?
P4:40:44 <tesseract> and if we only use two variables we will start running into more trouble.
P4:40:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I doubt we will have anything but normal building tools in sandbox mode.
P4:40:50 <akuryo> zombuster please
P4:40:50 <Divagador> totally *_*
P4:40:59 <ZomBuster> akuryo do it yourself!
P4:41:00 <tesseract> have you used OME yet?
P4:41:02 <akuryo> 2048*2048*512 TOTAL flatgrass
P4:41:04 <ZomBuster> flatgrass
P4:41:09 <akuryo> but i don't know how to improve the size lol
P4:41:12 <akuryo> increase*
P4:41:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, that's an external map editor.
P4:41:16 <tesseract> Its going to have line tools and curve tools. it allready has a sphere tool and circle tool.
P4:41:16 <ZomBuster> use MCTool
P4:41:17 <Evil-Ville> Curve tools and line tools would be stupid no offense
P4:41:30 <tesseract> I so disagree.
P4:41:37 <akuryo> meh too
P4:41:39 <akuryo> totally
P4:41:42 <vdgmprgrmr> It's not part of the actual game, and in the actual game, having line tools and circle tools would kind of ruin what the game is about.
P4:41:43 <akuryo> roads...etc
P4:41:48 <tesseract> The randomly generated terrain is full of curves, and you see them.
P4:41:56 <ZomBuster> http://download345.mediafire.com/jxjzjtinwajg/jmmyj2nwzz5/MCTool.zip
P4:42:03 <Evil-Ville> What does that have to do with anything tesseract?
P4:42:06 <akuryo> no
P4:42:09 <vdgmprgrmr> That's why Notch has said he doesn't want to add noclip for admins.
P4:42:16 <Evil-Ville> "there's curves in the terrain thus curve tool is only natural" heh
P4:42:42 <tesseract> If notch does not allow people to build maps using an editor instead of in game, someone else will. someone else allready has.
P4:42:54 <C418> well, let them
P4:42:59 <tesseract> I'm just saying that curves are not pointless.
P4:43:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I know but we're talking about THE GAME, not external editors.
P4:43:08 <tesseract> I really like curves, and i like building with curves.
P4:43:08 <akuryo> i have noclip
P4:43:11 <ZomBuster> curves for a map editor?
P4:43:11 <akuryo> i mean
P4:43:12 <Divagador> i'm counting on you ZomBuster :P
P4:43:13 <akuryo> not really
P4:43:14 <akuryo> i can fly
P4:43:20 <akuryo> but not go through thru things
P4:43:21 <C418> very high
P4:43:43 <ZomBuster> 256x256x128 is good? I can make it 256 high too but it would mostly be just air
P4:43:43 <akuryo> yes i can fly very high
P4:43:55 <C418> trough the sky
P4:43:58 <tesseract> In this game, external editors are part of the game.
P4:44:00 <C418> I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
P4:44:01 <akuryo> yes i can
P4:44:06 <C418> I BELIEVE I CAN SEARCH THE SKYYY
P4:44:09 <tesseract> Some of the most popular maps right now were made in OME
P4:44:11 <akuryo> i KNOW i can fly
P4:44:12 <08Notch> tesseract: I'm fine with people making tools for the game as long as it isn't used for piracy or to grief
P4:44:13 <vdgmprgrmr> And any curve/line/circle tools will probably NEVER be in-game.
P4:44:16 <tesseract> like THE HUGE MAP
P4:44:22 <08Notch> I just don't want certain things to be part of the core game. =)
P4:44:27 <Divagador> but how ?
P4:44:27 <tesseract> and the BIG CANYONS/BIG MOUNTAINS map
P4:44:31 <08Notch> I've got my artistic pride =D
P4:44:37 <ZomBuster> external tools ftw
P4:44:41 <Divagador> ZomBuster: can't be more huge? 
P4:44:44 <Divagador> o_Ã²
P4:44:46 <ZomBuster> uuh like what
P4:44:48 <tesseract> Lets ask notch
P4:44:52 <Divagador> like
P4:44:56 <Divagador> 512x512x256
P4:44:57 <tesseract> Will there ever be curve or line tools?
P4:45:00 <Divagador> or something
P4:45:10 <akuryo> bigger brush
P4:45:14 <ZomBuster> well if you really want it that big
P4:45:23 <akuryo> the next command we need
P4:45:28 <akuryo> is the /bring function
P4:45:30 <Divagador> i think it would be good
P4:45:31 <Divagador> *_*
P4:45:33 <akuryo> WAIT
P4:45:40 <akuryo> who wants to code the bring function with me
P4:45:48 <akuryo> we only need to op the user , then teleport then unop
P4:45:49 <ZomBuster> no garantue it will work!
P4:45:57 <akuryo> =D
P4:45:58 <Divagador>  : (
P4:47:04 <tesseract> Vdg, you don't know if there will be lines or curves. Why do you think you can say that they will NEVER be in the game?
P4:47:10 <tesseract> Did notch tell you something?
P4:47:29 <vdgmprgrmr> A main theme of Minecraft is blockiness, and curves kind of ruin that.
P4:47:56 <vdgmprgrmr> You can make blocky curves, but they're not really normal curves.
P4:48:01 <tesseract> The blocks will never go away unless the resolution increases to voxelstein levels.
P4:48:01 <Siiseli> agreed
P4:48:17 <tesseract> In minecraft we are working on the level of low resolution pixel art.
P4:48:25 <tesseract> but it's Voxel art.
P4:48:36 <tesseract> Curves are still very important to low resolution pixel art.
P4:48:49 <tesseract> And they should be used in low resolution voxel art instead.
P4:48:58 <tesseract> Think of the best sprites from the 8 bit era.
P4:49:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Another primary theme in Minecraft is having to build stuff manually, and having special tools IN THE GAME kind of ruin that.
P4:49:27 <tesseract> Well then you could have a tool that draws the curve for you and you fill it in.
P4:49:39 <vdgmprgrmr> In the game?
P4:49:47 <tesseract> anyway, imagine if you told the artists working on the nes that they couldn't use diagonals or curves.
P4:49:54 <tesseract> everything would look like dumb robots.
P4:50:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Dude, having any tools other than what we have will ruin the building theme in Minecraft.
P4:50:18 <tesseract> Yeah, you could have something draw the curve, and the parts of the curve would be see through blocks with no colision
P4:50:21 <Evil-Ville> Stop making retarded comparisons
10P4:50:27 * Spazzo (spazzo@CPE0022b0ca43d8-CM0011ae04842a.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #minecraft
P4:50:36 <tesseract> Don't call my comparisons retarded.
P4:50:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Ugh. Even that would not be good.
P4:50:39 <C418> let's compare minecraft with a cheesecake
P4:50:42 <vdgmprgrmr> They are retarded, though.
P4:50:48 <08Notch> there won't be curves or fancy non-orthogonal walls
P4:50:52 <tesseract> Voxels ARE analogous to pixels.
P4:50:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> There are curves on cheesecakes
P4:50:56 <08Notch> there might be sloped blocks
P4:50:57 <tesseract> BOO
P4:50:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> therefore, minecraft needs curves
P4:51:17 <ZomBuster> sloped blocks is a good idea
P4:51:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Devils advocate: the best cheesecake is blocky.  Minecraft doesn't need curves.
P4:51:26 <C418> like the visuals of roller coaster tycoon 1 and 2?
P4:51:31 <Siiseli> indeed
P4:51:43 <Siiseli> C418, I loved the visuals!
P4:51:50 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't even want sloped blocks anymore.
P4:51:56 <08Notch> i do =D
P4:52:02 <tesseract> I don't want sloped blocks either.
P4:52:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I've become attached to the whole nothing-but-standard-blocks thing.
P4:52:11 <Siiseli> I don't 
P4:52:13 <C418> I wouldn't mind
P4:52:23 <Siiseli> I am attracted to blocky feel
P4:52:48 <CheeToS> Siiseli: there is this game called tetris you might enjoy
P4:53:05 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P4:53:07 <Siiseli>  I hate tetris
P4:53:07 <Lmaoboat> RCT 2 > RCT 3
P4:53:10 <tesseract> I really really think that if you confine everyone to building on the perpendiculars, you will be limiting the creative potential of the community.
P4:53:12 <CheeToS> lol
P4:53:26 <ZomBuster> perpendicular what
P4:53:29 <tesseract> I think that diagonals and curves are the FUTURE.
P4:53:33 <Evil-Ville> tesseract nobody is confined to building in any way
P4:53:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, Notch, why not just remove the blocks, and make it non-grid-aligned structures.
P4:53:56 <tesseract> Nice straw man VDG!
P4:54:03 <Haruhi2> Notch any update yet
P4:54:19 <Lmaoboat> Would that mean starting from square one? (no pun intended)
P4:54:20 <Evil-Ville> tesseract if you want to build with curves and diagonals then go ahead and do it
P4:54:23 <Evil-Ville> There's nothing stopping you
P4:54:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Minecraft is blocky.
P4:54:48 <vdgmprgrmr> This will not change.
P4:54:49 <fydo> Blockcraft
P4:54:51 <tesseract> I think we should work to give the players all the tools they want to build their creations, and walk around in them.
P4:54:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=656b5887cbf258166109cdde6b09a653 Can  someone see if they can connect here?
P4:54:59 <tesseract> I don't want the voxels to go away. i love them.
P4:55:04 <Haruhi2> i liked the varied ground
P4:55:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Tesseract, get a 3d modeler if you want to do that.
P4:55:38 <vdgmprgrmr> The blockiness will never change.
P4:55:38 <tesseract> yes. this conversation is fairly pointless.
P4:55:39 <Adura> AlLnAtuRalX, loaded then "Disconnected!".
P4:55:45 <Divagador> same to me
P4:55:45 <Evil-Ville> I can't AlLnAtuRalX
P4:55:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah, that's what I'm getting....
P4:55:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> weird
P4:55:56 <tesseract> Even with curves the blockiness will never change.
P4:56:02 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P4:56:05 <Evil-Ville> There's now sound
P4:56:08 <vdgmprgrmr> In Minecraft, even curves are blocky.
P4:56:13 <tesseract> yes.
P4:56:21 <Adura> I think the game updated screwed over some servers.
P4:56:30 <tesseract> the point is, we need a lock volume tool.
P4:56:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless you make them on some ridiculous scale.
P4:56:41 <08Notch> i disagree
P4:56:42 <akuryo> I CAN NOT CONNECT ON ANY SERVER
P4:56:44 <akuryo> wtf
P4:56:47 <akuryo> notch you did an update?
P4:56:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, server update?
P4:57:01 <akuryo> it laods
P4:57:02 <vdgmprgrmr> wait, the point of "yeah curves are blocky" was "we need a volume lock tool"?
P4:57:03 <akuryo> then quit
P4:57:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Weird...
P4:57:06 <Haruhi2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EplEzRvZPBA i liked the way this looked

P4:57:12 <ZomBuster> I suddenly 
P4:57:14 <ZomBuster> hear 
P4:57:16 <ZomBuster> things
P4:57:18 <akuryo> lol
P4:57:31 <tesseract> No, the point of our whole conversation is that we need a lock volume tool.
P4:57:38 <tesseract> That's what we were talking about.
P4:57:38 <akuryo> i cqn not connect on ANY server anymore
P4:57:40 <akuryo> explantion?
P4:57:48 <vdgmprgrmr> We moved away from that long ago, man.
P4:57:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch!
P4:57:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> server update?
P4:57:55 <tesseract> I wonder what notch disagreed with back there.
P4:57:56 <akuryo> !!!
P4:58:07 <08Notch> I'm fixing
P4:58:12 <08Notch> I disagreed with lock volume
P4:58:15 <akuryo> EVEN SINGLE PLAYER lol
P4:58:17 <tesseract> Do you remember how we got onto this subject? It is directly related to the conversation about the lock volume idea.
P4:58:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> So no server update?
P4:58:22 <akuryo> no worry
P4:58:24 <akuryo> SP works
P4:58:26 <08Notch> no server update
P4:58:27 <C418> aah, it's good you made the sounds very basic
P4:58:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> yay
P4:58:33 <08Notch> there we go, the client should work again
P4:58:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> my sound lags also
P4:58:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, tesseract, but the conversation changed. They do that.
P4:58:36 <C418> that gives me free roam
P4:58:39 <08Notch> yeah, this is very basic sound
P4:58:42 <Divagador> How is it going, ZomBuster ? :P
P4:58:44 <Haruhi2> i liked vertex/color offsets notch
P4:58:48 <08Notch> I changed the structure around a bit, C418 
P4:58:48 <Haruhi2> it looks so stylish

P5:00:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> very
P5:00:33 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: bad samples, or choppy sound?
P5:00:34 <vdgmprgrmr> It's extremely choppy.
P5:00:37 <Haruhi2> is there any way you could make vertex/color offsets an option
P5:00:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> like a millisecond of sound, a millisecond without
P5:00:46 <Haruhi2> and have collision the same either way
P5:00:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I can't even tell what the sound is supposed to be it's so choppy.
P5:00:52 <Quatroking> what the
P5:00:55 <tesseract> Where are these so called "sounds"?

P5:06:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> okay, time do fire up recorder
P5:06:14 <08Notch> i took out the fps meter
P5:06:16 <eeme> breaking glass should sound like: breaking glass
P5:06:18 <08Notch> and added a framerate limiter
P5:06:18 <venn177> thank you :D
P5:06:19 <Snowman> whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
P5:06:20 <tesseract> Music is choppy for me. Footsteps work.
P5:06:23 <vdgmprgrmr> AHA!
P5:06:35 <Snowman> at least make the fps toggleable
10P5:06:37 * ReaperSWE (trashcan@bb-dhcp-85-11-200-56.ornskoldsvik.com) has joined #minecraft
P5:06:39 <Snowman> same for chunk update
P5:06:45 <vdgmprgrmr> If I go look at the edge of the map, where I can't see any blocks, the music and sounds get right!
P5:06:49 <tesseract> we need toggleable fps and chunk update.
P5:06:49 <Lmaoboat> Notch (and C418), music should get more intense the deeper you go in survival
P5:06:52 <08Notch> why do you need the fps meter?
P5:06:53 <ReaperSWE> Now we need S and M to toggle sounds n music
P5:06:57 <vdgmprgrmr> FPS meter is good.
P5:07:03 <Quatroking> did you change the lava texture?
P5:07:05 <ReaperSWE> not.
P5:07:09 <tesseract> So i can know how my computer is doing.
P5:07:10 <08Notch> fps meter means nothing with frame rate limiter. =)
P5:07:12 <Snowman> cause it shows me how fast my pc is going
P5:07:16 <Divagador> Snowman:  =(
P5:07:17 <ReaperSWE> Either your fps is 500 or 5.
P5:07:18 <08Notch> i'm limiting the fps now
P5:07:20 <vdgmprgrmr> That's not try notch.
P5:07:21 <ReaperSWE> you'll notice the difference
P5:07:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, it does when you get 10 FPS
P5:07:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I doubt my fps reaches the limit, like, ever.
P5:07:34 <08Notch> no, you just get a number to focus on
P5:07:36 <tesseract> Yes, I have LOW fps.
P5:07:45 <Snowman> just make it toggleable
P5:07:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Not everyone can do more fps than the limit!
P5:07:47 <venn177> I like the lack of meter, my epeen doesn't get hurt when I take screenshots
P5:07:52 <venn177> The whole UI should be toggleable
P5:07:53 <Lmaoboat> digging in rock sounds like cardboard
P5:07:54 <Snowman> and chunk update is good to see if someone is flooding
P5:07:56 <Haruhi2> music is kinda loud

P5:08:05 <venn177> Like, press U to toggle UI
P5:08:10 <Adura> I guess chunk updates could be considered griefing detection.
P5:08:12 <Quatroking> I always have fps on, in whatever game I play
P5:08:15 <Haruhi2> also the music skips a lot
P5:08:17 <venn177> Pretty Y to toggle music
P5:08:18 <Snowman> same quatro
P5:08:27 <Snowman> my music stopped?
P5:08:28 <Quatroking> the music played here once and doesn't come back
P5:08:29 <Trollfar> notch jävligt bra jobb med det här spelet alltså :)
P5:08:32 <Quatroking> wait
P5:08:36 <Evil-Ville> ah you made lava brighter
P5:08:39 <vdgmprgrmr> All you people with choppysounds should go somewhere where your fps is really high.
P5:08:41 <Quatroking> nevermind it came back with another crappy piano tune
P5:08:47 <Syndlig> Sound's a little strange.  :V
P5:08:53 <Fishlips> I did love the chunck update, it showed activity too
P5:09:07 <Evil-Ville> Shut up Quatroking
P5:09:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Go to the corner of the map and look away from all the blocks.
P5:09:17 <venn177> Like I said, U should toggle the whole UI
P5:09:43 <Mikesword221> Notch, mp3 for song please.
P5:09:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn, my head is exploding
P5:09:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> this is sooo choppy
P5:09:53 <Lmaoboat> Music is fine for me so far
P5:10:06 <Syndlig> I wish there was sound for PLACING blocks as well as deleting.
P5:10:08 <Quatroking> so Notch did you change the lava texture or something
P5:10:11 <Syndlig> And that you could hear other people deleting blocks.  :V
P5:10:12 <Quatroking> it looks a lot lighter
P5:10:18 <vdgmprgrmr> It turns out the sounds are both choppy, AND they suck. :P
P5:10:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> They dont' suck
P5:10:35 <Fishlips> lava has been changed
P5:10:38 <Fishlips> so much better now
P5:10:39 <Quatroking> Yep
P5:10:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> they are very, very choppy
P5:10:46 <Quatroking> just checked the pic on the wiki and this one is brighter
P5:10:48 <Quatroking> niiiice
P5:10:48 <vdgmprgrmr> The dirt sounds and walking sounds sound like static.
P5:10:52 <Syndlig> They don't suck, they're just not that good.
P5:10:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> New lava owns
P5:10:58 <Boinciel> Let's steal sounds from Lego Rock Raiders.
P5:11:01 <Syndlig> Most of the sounds seem like placeholders.
P5:11:15 <tesseract> It all sounds like krinkling sandpaper.
P5:11:49 <ReaperSWE> I DEMAND ATMOSHPERIC SOUNDS
P5:12:00 <venn177> I REQUEST MUTE BUTTON
P5:12:00 <08Notch> sounds will be tweaked over time. =)
P5:12:02 <venn177> :3
P5:12:04 <vdgmprgrmr> And unless you have high FPS, the sounds can barely be heard correctly anyway.
P5:12:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> way, way, way too choppy
P5:12:12 <venn177> Why demand when you can request? :U
P5:12:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> this is from a guy who averages 15 FPS
P5:12:19 <Syndlig> I was actually hoping you'd use the sound from the demo.
P5:12:23 <08Notch> sounds shouldn't depend on framerate, they run in a separate thread
P5:12:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Well they do.
P5:12:34 <Quatroking> Lava is faster now?
P5:12:35 <tesseract> Sounds Definitely depend on framerate.
P5:12:42 <08Notch> weird. very weird
P5:12:47 <Adura> Press F a few tiems.
P5:12:48 <Lmaoboat> This music should be more for survival, while creative mode should more upbeat sim-city type music
P5:12:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> I have bad sounds AND frames!
P5:12:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yay!
P5:12:53 <Adura> *times
P5:13:08 <08Notch> 0.0.22a_01 is up
P5:13:13 <08Notch> does it make the sounds less choppy?
P5:13:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Adura, playing the game blind is not fun.
P5:13:20 <08Notch> also, pressing "m" will mute the sound now

P5:15:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
P5:15:04 <tesseract> The sounds ECHO
P5:15:07 <Evil-Ville> That update made the music choppy for me too
P5:15:13 <Testvan> is there an option for sound volume?
P5:15:14 <ReaperSWE> music stopped :-(
P5:15:18 <tesseract> If i delete a tile i get an echo that reduces in volume.
P5:15:26 <Arf> [19:15] <Arf> let it be known
P5:15:26 <Arf> [19:15] <Arf> that I shit my pants in fear

P5:15:28 <vdgmprgrmr> tesseract, that's not an echo.
P5:15:38 <vdgmprgrmr> That's the sound playing with gaps in it.
P5:15:50 <Evil-Ville> Yes all sound is horribly choppy after this latest update
P5:15:51 <Fishlips> sound is very choppy
P5:15:52 <tesseract> There ya go.
P5:15:53 <Haruhi2> chrome still freezes every few steps
P5:16:02 <Testvan> IS THERE A VOLUME CONTROL
P5:16:05 <Lmaoboat> Now sound is chppy
P5:16:05 <vdgmprgrmr> NO
P5:16:06 <Zuriki> NO
P5:16:06 <tesseract> Yeah, that makes more sense.
P5:16:09 <Testvan> WHY THE HELL NOT
P5:16:10 <venn177> AHaha, oh man. Notch bro you really fucked some shit up in this update. :3
P5:16:12 <tesseract> Gaps.
P5:16:14 <Lmaoboat> wasn't the first time...
P5:16:23 <Syndlig> Man what computers do you guys have that you have such shit FPS?
P5:16:29 <Testvan> ADD IN A VOLUME CONTROL ASAP

P5:19:34 <Angrybanana> Choppy music is choppy :(
P5:19:38 <Evil-Ville> vdgmprgrmr that's because you have a 90s computer

P5:29:16 <akuryo> please!
P5:29:20 <akuryo> key mapping
P5:29:28 <akuryo> i saw like 15 guys now
P5:29:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Seriously, though, the sounds are pretty terrible.
P5:29:31 <akuryo> who needs it
P5:30:01 <tempestdevil> i just want the loud music to stop D:
P5:30:02 <08Notch> i don't really understand how you can think the sounds are terrible
P5:30:04 <Fishlips> i dont mind the sounds
P5:30:10 <akuryo> sounds are terrible
P5:30:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch: they're choppy
P5:30:12 <akuryo> they are =C
P5:30:12 <Fishlips> just the music needs to be happier imo :P
P5:30:14 <akuryo> sorry
P5:30:20 <08Notch> CHOPPY, sure. That's a bug
P5:30:23 <vdgmprgrmr> They sound like someone crumpling paper.
P5:30:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Terrible they're not
P5:30:29 <eeme> i think the music is too loud
P5:30:29 <tempestdevil> i don't mind them they're just really loud
P5:30:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> They're fine
P5:30:31 <tempestdevil> and i can't mute it.
P5:30:33 <eeme> and aggressive
P5:30:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> perfect for the game IMo
P5:30:34 <Evil-Ville> That's because of your shit computer vdgmprgrmr
P5:30:34 <vdgmprgrmr> When they're not choppy, they sound like crumpling paper even.
P5:30:38 <ZomBuster> MP sounds arent working yet?
P5:30:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, no, and shut up.
P5:30:46 <akuryo> they qre
P5:30:48 <akuryo> are
10P5:30:53 * smn is now known as smn`offline
P5:30:54 <Evil-Ville> How do you know they're still not choppy?
P5:31:09 <08Notch> _03 is up, put the fps meter back in
P5:31:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Because they don't continue to play after I stop doing things and the music plays normally.
P5:31:18 <akuryo> kool
P5:31:19 <Fishlips> and the block updater?
P5:31:20 <08Notch> keep in mind there's an fps limiter now, so it's going to be lower than before
P5:31:23 <08Notch> yeah, both
P5:31:28 <eeme> Notch when are we getting the scändinävish lëttërs in chat
P5:31:28 <Fishlips> nice thanks ;)
P5:31:33 <Syndlig> Limited to...: ?
P5:31:34 <08Notch> i don't really understand why you need it, but since you do, they're back, hehe
P5:31:35 <tempestdevil> Notch any idea why the muting isn't working for me?
10P5:31:39 * Kapow_ (kapox@c-68-37-80-138.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
P5:31:41 <Syndlig> Should be limited to 60FPS, Notch.
P5:31:45 <08Notch> Syndlig: I just added a 5 ms sleep each frame
P5:31:50 <Fishlips> block updater for anti greif purposes
P5:31:52 <08Notch> Syndlig: even on 100 hz displays?
P5:31:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, I'm weird and like seeing an fps meter in my games...
P5:31:58 <Fishlips> and fps meter, just so i know i guess :P
P5:32:02 <08Notch> yeah, so I put it back in. =)
P5:32:04 <Syndlig> You could add in vsync.
P5:32:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> Still choppy in _03
P5:32:11 <Adura> Ah chunk updates.
P5:32:16 <ReaperSWE> Notch, Please. Can we have copy-n-paste ingame?
P5:32:18 <08Notch> ok, if you get choppy sounds, you'll have to use m for a while

P5:33:17 <akuryo> first azerty support!
P5:33:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Just because I like da umlauts and such.
P5:33:29 <Syndlig> DVORAK support too
P5:33:31 <Adura> â€®Needs more RLO.

P5:34:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch, would taking the music out not help the choppy sounds?
P5:35:54 <akuryo> Notch, could you do :
P5:35:58 <Angrybanana> Why does the sand sound like someone eating chips?
P5:35:59 <Angrybanana> Lol
P5:36:05 <Fishlips> rofl
P5:36:07 <akuryo> All => [M] => only sounds => [M] => total mute

P5:36:55 <Trollfar> notch i am creating an online petition for the freedom of åäö. watch out.
P5:37:05 <08Notch> haha, ok
P5:37:16 <akuryo> i can do one for every non qwerty =D
P5:37:16 <Adura> Java not so good with Unicode?
P5:37:25 <08Notch> java's great for unicode
P5:37:29 <eeme> listen to your swedish brödern

P5:37:35 <eeme> free åäö
P5:37:38 <akuryo> xD
P5:37:50 <08Notch> and if I start adding åäö, I'll soon have to add ü. And then we're all screwed
P5:37:56 <eeme> oh fuck ü
P5:37:57 <akuryo> Notch. can you explain me why the chat is pretty good with azerty, but not the keys?
P5:38:01 <Trollfar> this is it. everyone gather your pitchforks
P5:38:01 <eeme> no one cares for him
P5:38:24 <Fishlips> who needs the weird letters, english is where its at!
P5:38:26 <08Notch> I uploaded a _04, it'll show up in a minute or two
P5:38:38 <Fishlips> whats in 04
P5:38:45 <eeme> free candy :O
P5:38:45 <Syndlig> Notch we're setting up a formal petition and protest for a newer, better glass block.
P5:38:47 <08Notch> it might fix the no-start-bug some people are getting, and i changed how sound gets queued, so choppiness might get better. or worse.
P5:38:50 <akuryo> could you ipload separatlyÂ§
P5:39:03 <akuryo> where can i suscribe syndlig?
P5:39:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch I think no music would help the choppiness immensely
P5:39:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> it seems to start around the same time as the music does
P5:39:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> for me at least
P5:39:14 <akuryo> yeah.
P5:39:19 <akuryo> For once i agree with AlLnAtuRalX 
P5:39:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P5:39:26 <akuryo> and i did not copy paste his name
P5:39:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> :O

P5:41:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> why*
P5:41:06 <Daidoji> yeah increase the chatbox to 256 characers
P5:41:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> walking on glass has few problems

P5:45:05 <08Notch> akuryo: Please stop

P5:46:49 <Daidoji> notch when you hit 30 commands I think it's time for a keyboard config menu
P5:46:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, Minecraft doesn't seem like a game that can really benefit from music to me.
P5:46:54 <akuryo> music+sound => sound => nothing
P5:46:54 <Monte> DanceDance REvolution
P5:46:56 <08Notch> Daidoji: Absolutely
P5:47:12 <08Notch> most of the commands shouldn't be keyboard shortcuts at all, but rather options in a settings menu
P5:47:15 <Evil-Ville> Well for me it does benefit from music
P5:47:21 <Rroff> the ambiant music works quite well imo
P5:47:23 <Syndlig> Music + Sound -> Music - Sound -> Sound - Music -> Mute
P5:47:27 <akuryo> Notch => until you do a setting menu it will be ok
P5:47:28 <08Notch> i like the music. I will of course make it an option.
P5:47:36 <Evil-Ville> That's how it should be
P5:47:37 <akuryo> synd , i'll never need only music
P5:47:42 <Adura> If anything the music needs to have more of an 8-bit feel to match the blockiness of the game.
P5:47:43 <akuryo> =D
P5:47:43 <C418> I knew most people wouldn't like it
P5:47:45 <eeme> i think m should have a random action
P5:47:50 <08Notch> right now it's still beta, and I'm mostly just interested in solving technical issues

P5:49:35 <Fishlips> c418 the music is good, just abit melancholy for minecraft
P5:49:43 <akuryo> is trollfest some medieval music?
P5:49:47 <akuryo> with violons?
P5:49:49 <Daidoji> they're from norway, notch you could probably go meet them
P5:49:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> is the music gone or is it just me?
P5:49:58 <C418> one should accept the fact that I make melancholic music
P5:49:59 <Fishlips> Haha trollfest
P5:49:59 <akuryo> trollfest is good?
P5:50:02 <Evil-Ville> What I'd like is a wind sound for when you are high up
P5:50:05 <akuryo> i LOVE medieval music
P5:50:15 <Daidoji> trollfest is fantasy viking metal
P5:50:21 <Daidoji> fantasy folkmetal
P5:50:24 <akuryo> could
P5:50:31 <akuryo> germanic folk is cool too
P5:50:35 <Daidoji> this song is pretty folky

P5:50:44 <greenslimy> The leaves have a "ground-breaking"(no pun) sound
P5:50:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Ambient sounds would fit so much more than music would...
P5:51:01 <FoxBlitzz> Hmm
P5:51:23 <Fishlips> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB4aMlc44Gc&feature=related
P5:51:23 <C418> of course, I have a few ambient sounds
P5:51:25 <Fishlips> try this
P5:51:30 <C418> the problem is, how do you use those?
P5:51:33 <FoxBlitzz> It'd be really cool if the music changed once the world became more developed
P5:51:44 <C418> I mean, the game can't know if the green bushy thing is a tree or something user made
P5:51:53 <FoxBlitzz> Or got flooded with lava, heh
P5:51:54 <C418> the game can't really know if you are in a cave or in a house
P5:52:00 <Daidoji> sure it can
P5:52:06 <08Notch> how?
P5:52:07 <C418> tell me how, that would be interesting
P5:52:08 <Daidoji> the game knows when grass is in the shade
P5:52:12 <Daidoji> so uh
P5:52:14 <Adura> Music trigger blocks, that'd sound awful if placed wrong.

P6:03:28 <ReaperSWE> lava should kill sponges
P6:03:56 <Fishlips> im glad i paid, thats all out of the way!
P6:03:58 <InsanePyros> Notch mentioned getting rid of free online level storage, so not nesecarily everything we have now will always be free
P6:04:18 <vdgmprgrmr> We'll probably be able to save levels locally by then.
P6:04:25 <ReaperSWE> wait what
P6:04:27 <vdgmprgrmr> We won't NEED online level storage.
P6:04:34 <ReaperSWE> singleplayer levels are saved online?
P6:04:36 <ReaperSWE> WTF Why
P6:04:39 <ReaperSWE> waste o space
P6:04:45 <Evil-Ville> So that other people can play them?
P6:04:55 <ReaperSWE> ...host a server then.,
P6:04:55 <InsanePyros> So when you go to a different computer you can play them and so other people can play them
P6:05:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Reaper, we haven't always had MP, you know.
P6:05:23 <ReaperSWE> I know that.
P6:05:32 <ReaperSWE> but online saving should be gone by now
P6:05:39 <ReaperSWE> i mean, 4+ GB of map data..
P6:05:41 <InsanePyros> Hell no
P6:05:52 <Divagador> I'm sorry to be so... but http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=4190#p4190 <- anyone knows?
P6:06:22 <InsanePyros> I was gone at a summer camp for 3 weeks but minecraft ran on the computers there
P6:06:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> Divagador, have you rebooted the box?
P6:06:36 <Divagador> yeah. two times
P6:06:39 <InsanePyros> If the levels were localy stored I wouldn't have got to play
P6:06:55 <vdgmprgrmr> You could have saved them to a jump drive.
P6:07:35 <InsanePyros> Anyway, speaking of playing other people's levels, anyone have a cool level I can explore?
P6:08:08 <vdgmprgrmr> I have a cool cave water research center.
P6:08:09 <Divagador> anyway AlLnAtuRalX , when i type the text: nohup java -cp bla bla bla

P8:11:04 <CaptainTardy> probably not the same as my problem then. i have an old (X series) ATI card on windows 7. they broke their opengl driver at some point, so i had to replace the open gl DLL with an old one

P8:46:55 <NiGMA> it was the thing that wouldnt install...
P8:47:08 <NiGMA> yep
P8:47:15 <NiGMA> wouldnt work
P8:47:19 <CheeToS> eh
P8:47:45 <CheeToS> if you click start, does it say Windows XP Home, Professional, or Media Center?
P8:47:46 <NiGMA> maybe not radeon?
P8:47:48 <Nalok> Pixel format not fucking accelerated and of course I have no idea about the workings of a laptop so fuck me
P8:47:58 <NiGMA> its home
P8:48:03 <CheeToS> k
P8:48:08 <Nalok> XP Professional
P8:48:27 <CheeToS> is there an ATI sticker on your laptop NiGMA?
P8:48:33 <CheeToS> or radeon
P8:48:36 <NiGMA> *sigh* it shouldnt be this hard
P8:48:39 <CheeToS> lol
P8:48:44 <CheeToS> it's easier if the laptops are current
P8:49:16 <CheeToS> neither of yours show up on the manufacturer's websites anymore
P8:49:27 <NiGMA> im such a noob, but i hav to ask... ATI?
P8:49:37 <CheeToS> ATI makes Radeon graphics chips
P8:49:46 <Daedalus> His card is ATI
P8:49:50 <Daedalus> It's a X700
P8:49:59 <NiGMA> ?
P8:50:05 <CheeToS> Daedalus: yeah, I saw that, but it's possible that there's an intel graphics version or something
P8:50:21 <CheeToS> I linked him to the X700 drivers but he says it said it can't be installed
P8:50:25 <NiGMA> intel inside centrino?
P8:50:27 <Daedalus> ah
P8:50:29 <Daedalus> Hrm
P8:50:32 <Daedalus> That's your processor
P8:50:35 <CheeToS> no
P8:50:36 <NiGMA> oh
P8:50:43 <NiGMA> uh...
P8:50:44 <CheeToS> centrino is intel's 'package' thing

P8:51:02 <NiGMA> how do i find what graffics card i have?
P8:51:14 <Quatroking> My new skin: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Quatroking
P8:51:19 <CheeToS> I believe that means he's using intel graphics
P8:51:41 <NiGMA> if i find out, maybe i can get portal working too...
P8:52:00 <CheeToS> ehh, if it's older than 2 years don't expect portal to run well, if at all
P8:52:20 <Daedalus> Centrino just means he has the intel CPU, mainboard and network interface
P8:52:28 <Daedalus> it does not say anything about the graphics card, I'm pretty sure
P8:52:32 <Quatroking> go to the store and buy a 50$ graphics card.
P8:52:32 <NiGMA> portal wont work on my comp...try to walk through first portal,freezes and crashes
P8:52:36 <Quatroking> problem fixed.
P8:52:42 <NiGMA> not that rich...
P8:52:43 <Daedalus> He has a laptop, Quatro
P8:52:45 <CheeToS> NiGMA: try this: http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/detect.htm
P8:52:48 <Daedalus> not so easy
P8:52:59 <Nalok> Yeah where's it show you graphics card on a laptop?
P8:53:00 <Quatroking> get a desktop, lappies aren't built for gaming in the first place :/
P8:53:09 <Daedalus> indeed
P8:53:14 <Quatroking> well they can, for 3000 dollar that is
P8:53:17 <Nalok> My desktop is a fucking piece of shit :/
P8:53:54 <Quatroking> anyways how does everyone like my new skin

P8:56:03 <NiGMA> this comp is completely mine. my mum has her own...
P8:56:05 <Quatroking> thank god I've always had my own pc
P8:56:18 <Nalok> My sister is always on fucking Myspace, and I only get on websites I know wont fuck with it -.- 
P8:56:20 <Daedalus> You rich bastard you
P8:56:25 <Quatroking> Yeah everyone here in the house has his own PC
P8:56:36 <Nalok> This is technically My laptop

P8:59:16 <Quatroking> it should open a screen with DirectX info
P8:59:39 <Quatroking> go to the monitor tab or something, it should say the name of your graphic card.
P8:59:56 <Nalok> It has a yes or no question >.>
P9:00:06 <Quatroking> what does it all say?
P9:00:14 <NiGMA> my driver is an "Intel  915GM"
P9:00:22 <Quatroking> ouch
P9:00:30 <Quatroking> big ouch
P9:00:36 <Quatroking> terminal sickness ouch
P9:00:50 <Quatroking> the GM series isn't exactly the best intel there is
P9:01:02 <NiGMA> ...
P9:01:04 <Nalok> Do you want DXdiag to check if your drivers are digitally signed as logo'd by Microsoft....
P9:01:21 <Quatroking> oh just select yes, it doesn't really matter

P9:10:25 <CheeToS> oh geez
P9:10:31 <CheeToS> yeah you're using a default graphics driver
P9:10:35 <CheeToS> useless
P9:10:40 <Nalok> What the fuck do I do?
P9:11:11 <Quatroking> hmm
P9:11:13 <CheeToS> there's a 33% chance you're using intel graphics
P9:11:15 <liq3> You, go to the ATI or nVidia website and download a real gfx driver.
P9:11:15 <CheeToS> try this: http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/detect.htm
P9:11:18 <Quatroking> You know what a driver is right
P9:11:30 <Nalok> In a sense
P9:11:31 <liq3> Nalok...
P9:11:37 <Nalok> ...?
P9:11:51 <liq3> ok hang on, i'll write it all out at once...
P9:11:52 <liq3> xD
P9:11:59 <Quatroking> Nalok, let me warn you..
P9:12:04 <Nalok> ?
P9:12:06 <CheeToS> liq3: he's using a laptop; he doesn't know what he has yet; it's equally likely he's using intel integrated graphics
P9:12:08 <Quatroking> Once you have the driver installed your brain will implode.
P9:12:12 <CheeToS> haha
P9:12:16 <Nalok> lol
P9:12:21 <CheeToS> Nalok: try this: http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/detect.htm
P9:12:25 <Quatroking> considering you have been working on the default driver all the time
P9:12:26 <CheeToS> see if it finds something for you
P9:12:27 <Quatroking> seriously
P9:12:30 <Eagle> Is there supposed to be seperate noises for water? :/
P9:12:32 <CheeToS> Quatroking is right
P9:12:33 <Quatroking> how the fuck can someone survive that
P9:12:39 <Nalok> I am Cheetos
P9:12:42 <CheeToS> alright
P9:12:46 <liq3> go into my computers properties > hardware tab > device manager, then expand the "display adapters" node.
P9:12:55 <liq3> it'll tell you the kind of card you have. :/
P9:12:59 <CheeToS> liq3: he has the generic driver installed
P9:13:01 <CheeToS> it's going to be useless
P9:13:04 <liq3> No.
P9:13:09 <Quatroking> Yes it is.
P9:13:14 <liq3> It tells me I have an ATX Radean HD 4800
P9:13:15 <Nalok> I'm mothafuckin generic
P9:13:18 <Nalok> ...
P9:13:22 <CheeToS> liq3: that is because you have a driver installed
P9:13:24 <liq3> ATI*
P9:13:25 <Quatroking> thats because you don't have the generec driver installed
P9:13:28 <liq3> :/

P9:14:50 <Quatroking> because my videocard is a bitch
P9:14:52 <Eagle> This Nalok fellow seems pleasant.
P9:15:06 <liq3> I'm tempted to unistall my video driver just to prove you wrong. :/

P9:16:32 <CheeToS> "the relevant part, anyway"
P9:16:42 <Quatroking> ffs liq3
P9:16:46 <CheeToS> vga.dll is the default driver windows uses for graphics when it can't find something suitable
P9:16:47 <Quatroking> go deinstall your driver then
P9:16:49 <CheeToS> it's completely useless
P9:16:50 <Nalok> Unable to evalvuate system hardware
P9:16:52 <liq3> There's a magical thing called "pastebin" he can paste the entire thing to.
P9:16:57 <Nalok> ....
P9:17:03 <Quatroking> UNINSTALL YOUR DRIVER LIQ3
P9:17:06 <Quatroking> DO IT

P9:17:23 <liq3> Quatroking: Nah, I'm scared I won't be able to boot. :P
P9:17:25 <Quatroking> Going on, Nalok, what is your lappy's brand?
P9:17:30 <Nalok> Er
P9:17:31 <liq3> My mobo lacks onboard Gfx.
P9:17:50 <Nalok> It's a sony vaio
P9:18:02 <Eagle> If you uninstall your drivers windows automatically reinstalls them.
P9:18:06 <Quatroking> well I don't think sony uses VIA chipsets..
P9:18:12 <CheeToS> liq3: on-board graphics require drivers too :ssh:
P9:18:13 <Nalok> ...
P9:18:23 <liq3> Ok, the following is a REAL dxdiag.
P9:18:24 <liq3> http://community.dawnofwar2.com/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=16723&p=377633&hilit=dxdiag#p377633
P9:18:27 <Quatroking> eagle: that is, when it has the drivers in stock :D
P9:18:34 <Nalok> Should I start FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU'ing now?
P9:18:35 <Eagle> ?
P9:18:46 <liq3> Notice how the first line under display drivers is "NVIDIA Gforce GTX 250"
P9:18:50 <Nalok> ...
P9:18:53 <liq3> IT does that even for onboard.
P9:18:53 <Eagle> But it says "searching the internet" or something
P9:18:57 <CheeToS> Nalok: if neither intel & nvidia could find out what it is, you likely have ati graphics
P9:18:59 <Quatroking> liq3 you just don't get it do you
P9:19:09 <Nalok> So what now
P9:19:16 <CheeToS> liq3: it does it for on-board WHEN YOU HAVE A DRIVER INSTALLED.
P9:19:20 <liq3> Quatroking: I've seen people paste those and it says "nVidia 6150SE"
P9:19:24 <Nalok> ...
P9:19:25 <liq3> Which is a piece of shit onboard.
P9:19:36 <Quatroking> thats because they have the right driver installed
P9:19:40 <Nalok> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
P9:19:43 <Eagle> Nalok, what is your problem in the first place?
P9:19:46 <CheeToS> Nalok: ati doesn't seem to have an identifier tool, so hang on
P9:19:49 <Eagle> I wanna join this discussion. :/
P9:19:49 <Quatroking> when you're running generic windows goes all apeshit and has no idea what you have

P9:20:01 <Nalok> I can't play minecraft because of a java error
P9:20:02 <CheeToS> Eagle: he has no graphics driver installed so he gets the pixel format not accelerated error

P9:23:46 <Nalok> OS?
P9:23:48 <liq3> So what, I've listed 4 ways now?
P9:23:52 <liq3> different ways.
P9:23:53 <Eagle> Operating System
P9:24:04 <Nalok> Windows XP Professional
P9:24:09 <NiGMA> operating sys-yeah, what eagle said...
P9:24:11 <Eagle> Hm okay
P9:24:12 <Eagle> Um
P9:24:22 <Eagle> Shouldn't it be in the display panel?
P9:24:24 <Nalok> Liq3 just shut the fuck up now and get the fuck out
P9:24:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Gotta love the ninjas, NiGMA.
P9:24:36 <liq3> Nalok: Public channel, I have every rigth to be here.
P9:24:39 <NiGMA> ?
P9:24:53 <Quatroking> Hey Nalok, install this and restart your PC: http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=PCGK12P&upd_id=1488&os_id=7
P9:24:57 <vdgmprgrmr> <NiGMA>operating sys-yeah, what eagle said...
P9:24:58 <Nalok> ok...
P9:25:04 <Eagle> In the Display settings. Where you choose your monitor and such
P9:25:06 <NiGMA> and...?
P9:25:10 <Nalok> Start prayin
P9:25:13 <CheeToS> Quatroking: ah, you actually found it!
P9:25:16 <Quatroking> according to several forums it works with your lappy too
P9:25:18 <CheeToS> I couldn't find it anywhere on ATI's site
P9:25:23 <vdgmprgrmr> In this case, Eagle = ninja.
P9:25:32 <vdgmprgrmr> And he ninja'd you.
13P9:25:33 * Eagle nunchucks
P9:25:35 <NiGMA> what does what i said have to do with ninjas?
P9:25:36 <Quatroking> Yeah, its a rare model
P9:25:36 <NiGMA> ?
P9:25:40 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P9:25:41 <Nalok> Prayyyy
P9:25:45 <vdgmprgrmr> You got ninja'd.
P9:25:49 <CheeToS> it will probably work Nalok
P9:25:52 <NiGMA> what....the....fuck?
P9:26:00 <Quatroking> if it doesn't work nothing really happens :P
P9:26:05 <vdgmprgrmr> *sigh* just ignore it.
P9:26:07 <Nalok> I'm praying to whatever computer god there is
P9:26:14 <NiGMA> what about meeeeeeeeeeee?
P9:26:14 <CheeToS> NiGMA: sorry, I lost track, did intel's site find updated drivers for you?
P9:26:15 <Eagle> What I'm wondering is how he has even gotten this far without drivers installed
P9:26:15 <Quatroking> if it DOES work, you die from awesomeness
P9:26:23 <Nalok> :O
P9:26:27 <Quatroking> Yeah thats what i wondered too
P9:26:28 <CheeToS> NiGMA or did you not use their scanner
P9:26:34 <Eagle> I mean doesn't the resolution get all messed up if you don't have the correct drivers?
P9:26:42 <CheeToS> Eagle: yep
P9:26:42 <liq3> Dude, windows has generic vcard drivers for just about every vcard there is. :/
P9:26:46 <Quatroking> maximum resolution of 1024x768
P9:26:57 <CheeToS> I thought it was 640x480
P9:26:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I've gotten my monitor's normal resolution before installing drivers.
P9:27:02 <CheeToS> with 16-bit color
P9:27:04 <NiGMA> i did...i forgot what it said...i already said what it said, didn't i?
P9:27:07 <CheeToS> or was that only with windows 2000
P9:27:08 <Eagle> In fact I remember having the dreaded nvlddmkm.sys error
P9:27:14 <Eagle> and then my DESKTOP turned BLACK
P9:27:14 <Quatroking> yeah, thats from before XP
P9:27:25 <vdgmprgrmr> After installing SP2, I was able to do full resolution and 32-bit color.
P9:27:31 <NiGMA> intel 95mg?
P9:27:37 <NiGMA> i think...
P9:27:41 <CheeToS> NiGMA: one sec
P9:27:47 <NiGMA> something like that
P9:27:56 <vdgmprgrmr> But I needed video drivers for games and such.

P9:47:39 <NiGMA> to a max of 3

P10:03:35 <CheeToS> if you are putting insects or needles in there it may expedite the process
P10:03:42 <NiGMA> it happened to me soooo many times
P10:03:47 <Quatroking> i never throw my headphones on max volume
P10:03:56 <NiGMA> dont need to
P10:04:05 <NiGMA> they just...die in in ear
P10:04:12 <NiGMA> in one ear
P10:04:14 <Nalok> Soooo about my problem
P10:04:14 <Quatroking> but my left ear has been clogged for about one day now
P10:04:31 <Quatroking> already washed it several times but not working
P10:04:37 <Quatroking> might visit the doc tomorrow or something
P10:04:48 <Nalok> WHO GIVES A DAMN YOU ARE ON THE INTERNET YOU DON'T NEED EARS TO USE THE INTERNET
P10:05:09 <Nalok> Sorry >.>
P10:05:11 <Quatroking> i have a fucking surround system here which isn't even a month old

P10:05:30 <CheeToS> Nalok: on this: http://help.mybluelight.com/img_support/display_800x600.gif make sure it's set to 32-bit color and click Advanced
P10:05:41 <CheeToS> and see if it mentions the ATI Radeon anywhere in there
P10:05:53 <CheeToS> (so we know the driver was actually installed)
P10:06:23 <Quatroking> it's been 5AM now, I'm going to bed

P10:07:05 <Nalok> Ok...
P10:07:13 <Nalok> I clicked advanced
P10:07:21 <CheeToS> is there "Adapter" in there
P10:07:33 <Nalok> Ye
P10:07:34 <Nalok> s
P10:07:40 <CheeToS> what is "adapter type"?
P10:07:56 <Nalok> Radeon IGP 345M
P10:08:04 <CheeToS> alright, then you do have the driver installed
P10:08:11 <Nalok> Woo
P10:08:12 <CheeToS> was it set to 32-bit color too?
P10:08:15 <Nalok> yes
P10:08:30 <CheeToS> did you try minecraft in firefox & IE?
P10:08:33 <Nalok> yes
P10:08:39 <CheeToS> did you update java?
P10:08:52 <Nalok> Well in Firefox, not IE yes I updated Java
P10:09:16 <CheeToS> and the java part of the site just completely disappears and you see the background image?
P10:09:39 <Nalok> On Firefox
P10:09:51 <Nalok> IE is still loading
P10:09:56 <CheeToS> hm
P10:10:03 <Nalok> fucking slowly too
P10:10:28 <CheeToS> odd
P10:10:50 <Nalok> It generates the level then....blackness
P10:10:52 <CheeToS> I don't have an idea at the moment but it wouldn't hurt to update java on IE too :P
P10:11:10 <Nalok> Not like firefox
P10:11:30 <Nalok> The java just...goes black
P10:11:41 <Nalok> I'll try updating on IE
P10:12:08 <Nalok> It's updated..
P10:13:47 <CheeToS> & same thing?
P10:14:05 <Nalok> Ok so, IE's Java gets a black screen while there is no Java on Firefox at all
P10:14:11 <Nalok> What the fuck
P10:14:30 <CheeToS> does this work? http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Quatroking

P10:15:47 <Eagle> You're not supposed to have a pointer in minecraft...
P10:16:11 <NiGMA> thats kind of the point...

P10:35:44 <Nalok> Everytime I try to access MC it generates the level, then java crashes
P10:35:45 <Infinity> is it running from your computer
P10:35:47 <Digmaster> others connect

P10:35:56 <Digmaster> its running from another computer
