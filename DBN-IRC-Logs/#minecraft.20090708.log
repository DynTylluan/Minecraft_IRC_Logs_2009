A3:49:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, Siiseli, that's pretty dumb.
A3:49:31 <vdgmprgrmr> The best way would be to give up and shoot yourself.
A3:49:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Faster and easier.
A3:49:48 <Siiseli> yeah that's what I thought
A3:49:59 <Siiseli> though seriously speaking
A3:50:04 <Siiseli> if i were ever to kill myself
A3:50:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Hanging's only best if you know what height to hang yourself from.
A3:50:06 <Siiseli> which i won't
A3:50:17 <vdgmprgrmr> So as to die quickly.
A3:50:24 <Siiseli> I'd kill myself doing everything I've been afraid to do
A3:50:26 <Siiseli> in a way
A3:50:41 <Siiseli> like you might fear just going out and traveling without a plan
A3:50:49 <Siiseli> what's the worst that can happen?
A3:50:50 <Siiseli> you die?
A3:50:55 <Siiseli> no longer a problem, yay
A3:50:56 <Siiseli> :D
A3:50:57 <vdgmprgrmr> That'd certainly be the coolest way to kill yourself.
A3:51:04 <vdgmprgrmr> "Suicide via world-traveling.)
A3:51:07 <vdgmprgrmr> "
A3:51:09 <Siiseli> I think it wouldn't result in dying
A3:51:27 <vdgmprgrmr> It could if you go all-out.
A3:51:27 <Siiseli> it would prolly result in regaining ones happiness or at least a will to live
A3:51:35 <Siiseli> to keep doing what you do
A3:51:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Mehbeh.
A3:51:45 <Siiseli> so in that way it's a great way to kill yourself!
A3:51:51 <Siiseli> either have alot of fun in the process
A3:52:03 <Siiseli> or have alot of fun and remain alive
A3:52:17 <vdgmprgrmr> But like if you travel the world and end up saving a bunch of hostages from terrorists in some random african nation and dying.
A3:52:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Since you're in travel-without-restraint mode.
A3:52:50 <Siiseli> well yeah
A3:53:03 <vdgmprgrmr> There's none of that "avoiding warzones" crap to deal with.
A3:53:17 <vdgmprgrmr> No no wait.
A3:53:26 <Siiseli> :D
A3:53:34 <vdgmprgrmr> If I ever kill myself, it'll be from radiation poisoning.
A3:53:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Because I've decided to illegally enter the Chernobyl exclusion Zone and stay until I die or authorities kill me.
A3:54:49 <Siiseli> :D
A3:54:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Freakin' kill yourself by exploring Chernobyl IN REAL LIFE.
A3:55:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Most awesome way to go, I'd say.

A4:00:37 <08Notch> oic :D
13A4:00:44 * Notch greets all
A4:01:36 <Siiseli> Notch, I suppose you want to fix my xml parser thing
A4:01:37 <Siiseli> :D
A4:01:47 <Siiseli> cos' I can't fucking get this thing to work
A4:01:50 <08Notch> gah, xml parsing. :D
A4:01:58 <Siiseli> (no srsly if you care to help, please do)
A4:02:02 <08Notch> i hate that stuff, it's always a pain in the ass
A4:02:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah, Notch, I just wanna say, your post about eyes kinda sucks.
A4:02:08 <Siiseli> it totally is
A4:02:16 <Siiseli> but yeah Notch I'm supposing this is a common problem
A4:02:17 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: Perhaps, but I'm right. =)
A4:02:26 <Siiseli> or something you might've ran into
A4:02:29 <vdgmprgrmr> About eyes, yeh.
A4:02:34 <Siiseli> care to helpan?
A4:02:40 <08Notch> as soon as you start following motion with your eyes, no amount of framerate will be enough
A4:02:43 <vdgmprgrmr> But what you're saying is also true of film.
A4:02:56 <08Notch> Siiseli: What's the problem?
A4:03:00 <vdgmprgrmr> You used some pretty bad analogies.
A4:03:06 <Siiseli> pms on the way
A4:03:27 <08Notch> true of film?
A4:04:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, an eye, with all its light-reactive cells, will act pretty much like film on a camera.
A4:04:40 <vdgmprgrmr> They work on the same basic concept.
A4:04:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Light hits stuff, the stuff reacts, and an image is formed.
A4:05:02 <08Notch> no, they don't. film samples light into discrete images. the eye doesn't.
A4:05:14 <peerkoel> depends on shutter speed..
A4:05:18 <vdgmprgrmr> "Discrete" images?
A4:05:20 <08Notch> if you follow a moving object with a film camera, the background will be blurry on the background, right?
A4:05:28 <08Notch> yes, discrete.
A4:05:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes.
A4:05:39 <08Notch> what if the viewer choses to look at the background?
A4:05:45 <08Notch> it shouldn't be blurry then, but it will be
A4:05:52 <vdgmprgrmr> But that is essentially the same as viewing an image through eyes you aren't controlling.
A4:06:05 <08Notch> yes, that I agree on. (somewhat)
A4:07:05 <vdgmprgrmr> If you were (somehow) recording images from another person's eyeballs, and you did the same thing (trying to follow a moving object), the effect would be the same as if it were a camera and not eyes recording.
A4:07:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless the person who owned the eyes were to follow it.
A4:07:52 <Siiseli> can has url to this post?
A4:08:03 <vdgmprgrmr> It's on the blog.
A4:08:05 <peerkoel> http://notch.tumblr.com/post/134701406/at-what-hz-does-the-eye-see
A4:08:09 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: I'm still right. =)
A4:08:13 <Siiseli> thx
A4:08:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Now that's just not a good argument, man.
A4:08:27 <08Notch> the eye does not sample discrete images, a video camera does.
A4:08:55 <vdgmprgrmr> But the surface of film also does not sample discrete images.
A4:08:58 <08Notch> the eye is MUCH more complex. The outer regions of your vision, for example, react much faster to motion than the center parts do
A4:09:08 <08Notch> correct, when SAMPLING
A4:09:24 <08Notch> but when you play it back, it always is discrete images
A4:09:51 <vdgmprgrmr> The brain processes the eye's surface into a discrete image.
A4:09:58 <08Notch> no, it doesn't.
A4:10:04 <08Notch> seriously.
A4:10:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, dangit, you seriously need to define "discrete".
A4:10:14 <peerkoel> how do you know?
A4:10:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Because I've always known "discrete" to mean "subtle" or similar.
A4:10:45 <08Notch> it's pretty well documented. vision is a very complex phenomena
A4:11:03 <08Notch> oh, discrete = separated small part, kinda. discreet = subtle.
A4:11:04 <Adurah> Look at higher framerate games with the periphery of your eyes.
A4:11:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Done it.
A4:11:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, Notch, so how does the eye see, then, eh?
A4:11:48 <Siiseli> vdgmprgrmr, you silly man
A4:12:10 <Siiseli> how well an eye sees depends on the person, if you're old you see worse(LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL)
A4:12:13 <Siiseli> isn't I funneh
A4:12:20 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A4:12:32 <peerkoel> wait, before Notch spends his whole day explaining to vdgmprgrmr how an eye works... wouldn't he be of better use coding Minecraft? :)
A4:12:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure he's all sick and stuff anyway.
A4:12:56 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception
A4:13:02 <Adurah> Parts of your eye see at different precision.
A4:13:29 <peerkoel> well I have more coding to do anyway :)
A4:13:41 <08Notch> and different parts of your eye even see in different ways
A4:14:06 <08Notch> as said, periphical vision (and night vision) is much more motion sensitive than the small focused part of your vision
A4:14:20 <vdgmprgrmr> That doesn't mean that we don't end up with lots of small images in our heads.
A4:14:25 <08Notch> yes it does
A4:14:30 <vdgmprgrmr> If we don't have lots of small images, what do we have?
A4:14:54 <08Notch> small gnomes of course.
A4:15:08 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A4:15:20 <08Notch> the images you see in your head are mental images, not photographs
A4:15:29 <vdgmprgrmr> But they are still images.
A4:15:31 <08Notch> they're made up of memories, guesses and fantasy
A4:15:43 <08Notch> not in the way a film frame is an image, no
A4:16:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Eyes still detect light with the same basic concept as a piece of film will (with light reactant materials) and they convey an image somewhere.
A4:16:36 <Adurah> Your brain makes a lot of guesses about the reality of an image.
A4:16:51 <vdgmprgrmr> That's still just processing a single image.
A4:17:15 <08Notch> it's not that simple, vdgmprgrmr
A4:17:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not talking about recognizing things in an image, I'm talking about getting the image in the first place.
A4:17:29 <08Notch> and the eye does not have the same physical process as a film surface does
A4:17:31 <vdgmprgrmr> In order to see, we need some kind of image.
A4:17:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Not the same, similar.
A4:17:46 <08Notch> no, I don't know of any motion sensitive film.
A4:17:58 <vdgmprgrmr> "Motion sensitive"?
A4:18:19 <08Notch> some (all?) receptors in your eye reacts to motion.
A4:18:24 <LKA> oh its notch
A4:18:25 <LKA> HI NOTCH
A4:18:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Motion which is conveyed via light hitting the eye.
13A4:18:37 * LKA flails
A4:18:38 <08Notch> a film surface will never ever fall for an optical illusion, but the eye will.
A4:18:52 <JJames19119> Fix java speeding up system clocks PLEASE
A4:18:53 <JJames19119> ;;
13A4:19:00 * LKA pats JJ on the back
A4:19:13 <JJames19119> It still isn't fixed and it's rather detrimental to an IRCd's health
A4:19:29 <JJames19119> Since the IRCd relies on the system clock being synched to even run at all
A4:19:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, that link above didn't help me at all.
A4:19:46 <08Notch> this is the first time someone has told me it still doesn't work, JJames19119. :-(
A4:19:59 <vdgmprgrmr> Perhaps you should try actually explaining it instead of linking or saying "I'm right."
A4:19:59 <LKA> I wanted to tell you but I never was on at the same time you were ._.
A4:20:11 <JJames19119> It doesn't appear to go faster but
A4:20:14 <JJames19119> It honestly does.
A4:20:20 <08Notch> i can't, I don't know exactly how the eye works, but I do know it doesn't produce discrete images
A4:20:42 <08Notch> JJames19119: Do you know how much?
A4:20:57 <JJames19119> Roughly 30 seconds gained every minute.
A4:20:57 <vdgmprgrmr> What is a non-discrete image then?
A4:21:00 <08Notch> apparently sun's fine with this bug. They said they wouldn't fix it
A4:21:13 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: That's a really good question. Perhaps the eye doesn't see images at all. ;)
A4:21:19 <Adurah> Looks like Minecraft makes you impotent, Notch. :( http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=887
A4:21:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course, we actually see magic.
A4:21:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Pure magic.
A4:22:06 <JJames19119> Not being able to enjoy minecraft because java likes toying with my system clock and freezing my IRCd is really painful :\
A4:22:17 <08Notch> JJames19119: But you don't move too fast in the game?
A4:22:34 <JJames19119> No. It doesn't appear faster, at least not to the eye.
A4:22:57 <08Notch> guh, so the system clocks runs too fast but not the game..
A4:23:05 <JJames19119> I've noticed java is speeding up the system clock when the FPS counter in minecraft and an external FPS counter like FRAPS both show different values.
A4:23:09 <08Notch> it's like sun's trying to make me cry
A4:23:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Regarding the system clock issue, how loudly have you complained at Sun?
A4:23:20 <Adurah> But yeah, a forum mod should deal with that post. :P
A4:23:22 <JJames19119> Like for instance, FRAPS will report 200FPS but Minecraft says 130FPS
A4:23:31 <08Notch> i haven't, others have.
A4:23:37 <JJames19119> However the game itself doesn't seem any faster.
A4:23:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Well then you should complain too.
A4:24:05 <Adurah> The answer, play Minecraft in a VM.
A4:24:15 <Adurah> (maybe)
A4:24:23 <JJames19119> That's actually not a bad idea
A4:24:41 <JJames19119> I might try that sooner or later, if Sun doesn't feel like getting off their asses to fix this

A4:32:47 <08Notch> lol, ok then. =)
A4:33:23 <vdgmprgrmr> It basically outlines the mechanical process by which the eye detects light and color.
A4:33:46 <08Notch> read about how the visual system calculates color and intensity.
A4:33:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I did.
A4:33:58 <08Notch> it should give you a hint that it's more complex than film
A4:34:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said it was the same or even as simple as film.
A4:34:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I said that the way the eye detects LIGHT is similar to the way film detects it.
A4:34:39 <LKA> also placeable water/lava in single-player is awesome ;_; it'd be neat if like a server runner was able to place them like with /lava or /water and placing normal stone would place the non-flowing version, then you could build around it to start the flood if that's where you wanted it
A4:34:44 <vdgmprgrmr> With light-reactant stuffs.
A4:36:04 <08Notch> but the thing you just said you read tells you that it doesn't work the same way
A4:36:17 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A4:36:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I really don't wanna use caps.
A4:36:37 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said it works the same way.
A4:36:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I said that both of them use LIGHT-REACTANT MATERIALS.
A4:37:05 <vdgmprgrmr> And if you're gonna try and say the the eye doesn't react to light, you're just plain dumb.
A4:37:22 <08Notch> did you even read the stuff you claimed you read?
A4:37:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes.
A4:37:44 <vdgmprgrmr> they only signal the presence of light in the visual field.
A4:37:49 <vdgmprgrmr> They signal the presence of light.
A4:38:10 <Wolfram> Arguing about eyesight resolution or what have you?
A4:38:17 <Wolfram> I think I remember seeing a dev blog post about that.
A4:38:20 <08Notch> "A given photoreceptor responds to both the wavelength and intensity of a light source. For example, red light at a certain intensity can produce the same exact response in a photoreceptor as green light of a different intensity."
A4:38:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Signaling light's presence is a reaction to light being there.
A4:38:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, I read that.
A4:38:47 <08Notch> ok, then we're just misunderstanding each other
A4:38:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Then it goes on to say that it figures out light intensity and color by comparing nearby photoreceptors.
A4:39:17 <08Notch> yes, which means that vision is a mental process, not a physical process
A4:39:27 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm claiming that all that stuff that the eye detects/processes ends up as a mental image.
A4:39:37 <08Notch> it might guess wrong, and does so in the case of optical illusions
A4:39:37 <vdgmprgrmr> And the way the eye detects light is physical.
A4:39:51 <08Notch> absoltely, but you also claimed that the eye sees discrete images
A4:40:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying the brain gets discrete images.
A4:40:08 <08Notch> it doesn't.
A4:40:09 <vdgmprgrmr> The eye does not.
A4:40:19 <08Notch> the brain does not in any way get discrete images
A4:40:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Then it gets what?
A4:40:28 <08Notch> mental images are made up out of memories and guesswork
A4:40:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, I realize this.
A4:40:40 <08Notch> i have no idea, I'm not a neurosurgeon
A4:40:46 <Wolfram> Hold on, vdgmprgrmr; what exactly is your case?
A4:40:50 <Wolfram> And what's Notch's case?
A4:41:05 <08Notch> he's claiming that my blog post is wrong because film works like the eye does
A4:41:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I claim that the brain processes many single images.
A4:41:30 <08Notch> I'm saying that while film might SAMPLE light in a similar way as the eye does, the thing you watch on the screen is still discrete images
A4:41:51 <vdgmprgrmr> We're most definitely misunderstanding eachother on the film aspect.
A4:42:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying that the way the eye detects light is similar to the chemical process by which an image appears on any piece of film.
A4:42:42 <08Notch> even if they sampled light in exactly the same way, it wouldn't in anyway invalidate my claim
A4:42:50 <08Notch> so it's a moot point
A4:43:01 <Wolfram> The brain certainly doesn't make its images out of "mental pixels"
A4:43:01 <08Notch> it's the playback that's the problem
A4:43:17 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not saying it makes them out of "brain pixels"
A4:43:25 <08Notch> indeed, and nor do you get discrete sample values from the eyes
A4:43:34 <Wolfram> I'm not saying you are either, don't worry
A4:43:39 <Wolfram> Just an observation
A4:43:44 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying that, mentally, we recognize lots of singular images.
A4:43:47 <Wolfram> God, that sounds like a pun
A4:43:55 <08Notch> we don't, vdgmprgrmr.
A4:44:10 <08Notch> you can remember mental images, sure
A4:44:15 <08Notch> but that's not how vision works
A4:44:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Then how does it?
A4:44:41 <08Notch> some other way
A4:44:45 <Wolfram> If you're watching a film
A4:44:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
A4:44:57 <Wolfram> And the picture is crafted of thousands of tiny images
10A4:44:59 * CMDBob (CMDBob@79-64-7-22.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com) has joined #minecraft
A4:45:08 <Wolfram> You're not forming all of those images in your mind
A4:45:12 <Wolfram> You're only forming the whole
A4:45:33 <Wolfram> The eye receives the image but the mind deciphers it as a whole piece
A4:45:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Your eyes are still detecting the images.
A4:45:41 <08Notch> gaaaahhhh
A4:45:43 <Wolfram> Well, that's really just hair-splitting
A4:45:44 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Which is basically what I was about to say.
A4:45:49 <Wolfram> None of us can prove it one way or the other
A4:45:57 <08Notch> watch the background in a fast pan in a movie.
A4:46:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, watching a movie is not like seeing things with your own eyes.
A4:46:22 <Wolfram> What!
A4:46:23 <Wolfram> Yes it is!
A4:46:33 <Wolfram> Spin your head around really fast, then
A4:46:43 <Wolfram> A better example would be to say
A4:46:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, but it's, as I've said, like watching it through eyes you aren't in control of.
A4:46:53 <Wolfram> Produce a mental image of just one tiny image
A4:47:01 <Wolfram> If you can do that, the eye must be picking up on it
A4:47:23 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: What the hell?
A4:47:33 <08Notch> of COURSE it's seeing things with your own eyes
A4:47:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Watching a movie, you're the second person.
A4:47:44 <08Notch> they use a lot of psychology to get you to look where they want
A4:47:46 <vdgmprgrmr> The camera is the first.
A4:47:47 <08Notch> no, you're third.
A4:48:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Wrong area, man.
A4:48:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Camera is the first viewer, you are the second.
A4:48:27 <Wolfram> Ay carumba
A4:48:33 <Wolfram> Stick to the main argument
A4:48:35 <vdgmprgrmr> The story is told in third-person, yeah, but I'm saying you ARE the second person.
A4:48:37 <08Notch> you've never looked at an unfocused area in a movie?
A4:48:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course I have.
A4:48:51 <Wolfram> I'm going to research for a moment
A4:48:54 <Wolfram> Get a second opinion
A4:48:57 <Wolfram> Or a third, rather
A4:48:59 <08Notch> that would never ever happen in real life.
A4:49:07 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A4:49:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Dude.
A4:49:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I've said it.
A4:49:25 <08Notch> this is so very much beside the point anyway
A4:49:28 <vdgmprgrmr> You can look at an unfocused area on film because you aren't in control of the focus.
A4:49:43 <vdgmprgrmr> The camera is in control of the focus.
A4:49:49 <08Notch> ok, I'll grant you absolute win on this one, just for the sake of argument
A4:49:54 <08Notch> still doesn't change a thing, though
A4:50:13 <08Notch> the eye doesn't work like a film does, you don't see in hz, higher framerates are always better
A4:50:41 <Wolfram> This makes it sound like there is no such thing as "physical" sight
A4:50:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Your entire argument is basically, "I have no idea what the hell actually happens, but you're wrong for some reason!."
A4:50:46 <Wolfram> Since the retina is part of the brain
A4:51:03 <Wolfram> That implies that him being wrong makes you right, vdgmprgrmr
A4:51:16 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I'm not saying that.
A4:51:23 <Wolfram> That's good, because that would be silly
A4:51:28 <vdgmprgrmr> I know.
A4:51:39 <Wolfram> Okay. So if the retina is part of the brain
A4:51:43 <Wolfram> There IS no physical vision
A4:51:50 <Wolfram> Only interpreted light
A4:52:07 <Wolfram> It's ALL so-called mental vision
A4:52:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Um, pretty sure that the retina picks up on actual light.
A4:52:29 <vdgmprgrmr> And it starts out as a physical process.
A4:52:57 <vdgmprgrmr> In the early stages, light-reactant cells on the surface of the eye react to light. This is physical.
A4:53:00 <08Notch> yes, and mental processes are physical processes as well
A4:53:13 <Wolfram> Well, that's true
A4:53:16 <08Notch> doesn't change a thing, though. you seriously don't see individual images when looking
A4:53:21 <Wolfram> Think I got a little confused
A4:53:32 <08Notch> memories and mental images can take the form of images, sure
A4:53:38 <08Notch> but actual vision doesn't work that way
A4:54:03 <08Notch> you block out things you're not interested in, you focus on a very small area of the viewing field, you pick up motion better in some areas of the brain
A4:54:21 <vdgmprgrmr> That can all be explained by processing smaller images.
A4:54:42 <08Notch> sure, and gravity can be explained by having small angels push things towards each other
A4:54:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well yeah.
A4:55:17 <Wolfram> Here's a quote I found. Not sure if it's totally pertinent
A4:55:20 <Wolfram> The human visual cortex is capable of distinguishing around 25-30 ‚Äúflashes‚Äù per second, or about 25-30 Hertz. Anything that flashes at a faster rate appears as a constant light source. Knowing your visual refresh rate is important if you want to animate a cartoon. You need to display at least 24 cartoons frames, or cells, per second in order to see smooth mov
A4:55:31 <08Notch> gAAAH!!
A4:55:39 <08Notch> stab that guy in the face with a screwdriver NOW
A4:55:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Where'd that come from, Wolfram?
A4:55:57 <Wolfram> http://www.physlink.com/Education/askExperts/ae473.cfm
A4:56:12 <Wolfram> No idea how credible that is
A4:56:21 <Wolfram> Just looking for whatever tidbits I can find
A4:56:29 <08Notch> oh wow, that article is actually kinda correct!!
A4:56:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Although I am certainly aware that in the peripheral, the brain can recognize up to at least 50 hertz.
A4:56:33 <08Notch> nevermind what I said =D
A4:56:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Firsthand experience there.
A4:56:58 <Wolfram> Here's a wikipedia quote from the frame rate article
A4:57:03 <08Notch> when standing still and looking at a fixed position, the problem is very small
A4:57:07 <Wolfram> Even though computers, video and film works on distinct frames, sampled at discrete points in time, there is no evidence suggesting that the human visual system works in the same way. Therefore, it is impossible to express the limitations of human perception as a given maximum framerate.  It may be possible, however, to investigate the consequences of changes
A4:57:08 <08Notch> the problem happens when looking around
A4:57:41 <Wolfram> in framerate for human observers. The most famous example may be the wagon-wheel effect, a form of Aliasing in time, where a spinning wheel suddenly appears to change direction when its speed approaches the framerate of the image capture/reproduction system.  Different capture/playback systems may operate at the same framerate, and still give a different
A4:57:50 <Wolfram> level of "realism" or artifacts attributed to framerate. One reason for this may be the temporal characteristics of the camera and display device.  Some rumors says that the human eye can only see up to 30 frames per second and some others something over 400 frames.
A4:57:57 <08Notch> waaait, that article claims that the eye has a refresh rate.. it doesn't
A4:58:03 <08Notch> so I'm going to consider that article pure bunk
A4:58:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Uh-huh...
A4:58:48 <Wolfram> I don't see that it says that.
A4:58:58 <08Notch> "For example, the beat frequency between my eye and my monitor is 80 Hz - 24 Hz = 56 Hz."
A4:59:15 <Wolfram> Oh, the article before the one I just posted?
A4:59:18 <08Notch> the odds of all the neurons in the eye firing at the same frequency is insanely low
A4:59:25 <08Notch> the physlink one
A4:59:29 <Wolfram> Right, right
A4:59:34 <Wolfram> I was reading over the wikipedia quote
A4:59:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree with Notch on that.
A4:59:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I actually KNOW that they don't fire at the same frequency.
A5:00:12 <08Notch> indeed, it depends on the receptor type, the receptor sensitivity, and the intensity of the light
A5:00:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Because I've set my monitor to the lowest possible refresh-rate and and seen flashing when I looked at in the peripheral.
A5:00:28 <vdgmprgrmr> But not directly.
A5:00:50 <08Notch> so the brain receives a more or less constant supply of random signals from the physical eye
A5:00:50 <vdgmprgrmr> (Which does not invalidate my original argument, justsoyouknow.)
A5:01:12 <08Notch> then inteprets that information to make a mental image of what's in front of the eyes
A5:01:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Mmm, I wouldn't agree immediately with that, but that's at least better than what you had before.
A5:01:37 <08Notch> there's no need to sample things into individual images, it'd take a LOT of complicated brain design
A5:02:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Actually yeah that sounds way better than my original idea.
A5:02:12 <08Notch> wait.. what? =D
A5:02:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Random sampling of signals from the eye.
A5:02:34 <08Notch> are we reaching an agreement? on irc?
A5:02:43 <Siiseli> this is impossilbe
A5:02:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Construction of mental concepts of surroundings based on patterns in the samples.
A5:03:01 <Siiseli> sacre bleu, c'est impossibel
A5:03:06 <vdgmprgrmr> I move my original idea to that idea.
A5:03:20 <08Notch> that's exactly how I think it works!
A5:03:22 <Wolfram> Do you abandon the original case, then? o.o!
A5:03:30 <vdgmprgrmr> See, why the hell didn't you say that earlier?
A5:03:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Instead of saying "I'm right and you're wrong so there!"
A5:03:57 <08Notch> because I hadn't properly formulated my thoughts, and I misunderstood your arguments
A5:04:05 <Wolfram> Well, if you moved your case to one that coincides with his, abandoning your old case
10A5:04:08 * Zaratustra (Zaratustra@189.32.1.30) has joined #minecraft
A5:04:09 <Wolfram> Then he WAS right, and you WERE wrong

A5:04:10 <08Notch> once we got down to the details, I forumlated them
A5:04:28 <vdgmprgrmr> So you were trying to convince people you were right even though you weren't even sure what you thought int he first place?
A5:04:32 <vdgmprgrmr> That's plain stupid, man.
A5:04:39 <Wolfram> Well, he didn't know HOW he was right
A5:04:41 <Wolfram> Just that he was
A5:04:49 <Wolfram> It's like knowing how to use a word but having trouble defining it
A5:04:58 <08Notch> I just knew that the eye sampling individual images is both not needed and needlessly complicated
A5:05:00 <Siiseli> aggressive
A5:05:04 <Wolfram> More accurately, he knew that he wasn't wrong
A5:05:06 <Siiseli> iss one of those words
A5:05:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Aggresive?
A5:05:20 <Siiseli> I can't define it
A5:05:40 <vdgmprgrmr> "intending to cause harm"
A5:05:48 <Wolfram> You are coming off as somewhat argumentative, vdgmprgrmr
A5:05:53 <Siiseli> mm no that's not a full definition imo
A5:05:53 <08Notch> indeed
A5:05:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I am argumentative.
A5:06:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Not fully, but still.
A5:06:10 <08Notch> but, hey, I convinced you. :D
A5:06:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah after you managed to tell me what you were even saying!
A5:06:30 <08Notch> lol
A5:06:42 <08Notch> to be honest, I was kinda hoping you'd think for yourself.
A5:06:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I knew EXACTLY what my ideas were.
A5:06:55 <Siiseli> Notch, bad plan, remember, internet
A5:07:14 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'd never thought of the random-signal thing before.
A5:07:17 <08Notch> yes, and I knew what you were saying was like saying that gravity is caused by angels pushing things towards each other
A5:07:22 <Wolfram> The debating wounds will never close
A5:07:26 <Wolfram> If you two don't stop poking them
A5:07:28 <08Notch> it's needlessly complicated, there are plenty of simpler explanations
A5:07:30 <vdgmprgrmr> No, that's nothing like what I was saying.
A5:07:35 <08Notch> to me it was
A5:07:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I would say it's actually a lot simpler to think about.
A5:07:52 <08Notch> I don't know exactly how gravity works either
A5:08:03 <vdgmprgrmr> That's fine, no one is really sure how gravity works.
A5:08:04 <Wolfram> But it's different from flight?
A5:08:11 <08Notch> yes, but it doesn't match the physical evidence I've seen
A5:08:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Scientists are still pondering.
A5:08:27 <08Notch> nobody really knows how vision works either, vdgmprgrmr..
A5:08:43 <Wolfram> I know how gravity works. =/
A5:08:48 <vdgmprgrmr> You do?
A5:08:55 <vdgmprgrmr> You know like for sure?
A5:09:09 <Wolfram> Sure. Objects in space with enough mass create a pull on other objects with lesser mass.
A5:09:15 <Wolfram> That's gravity. o.o
A5:09:17 <vdgmprgrmr> That's just what happens.
A5:09:26 <vdgmprgrmr> The thing no one knows it what causes it to happen.
A5:09:28 <Wolfram> So you want to know WHY it happens
A5:09:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah.
A5:09:33 <08Notch> you can cut out the "with enough mass" part
A5:09:43 <Wolfram> Well, ALL objects have it, okay
A5:09:45 <08Notch> and "with lesser mass" as well
A5:09:53 <08Notch> all objects pull on all other objects
A5:09:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch is right.

A5:21:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Due to the fact that photoreceptors aren't instantaneous things, and have residual effects from light (assuming that's true since we can "burn" images onto our eyes with very bright lights) and because the brain will remove the instances where we don't see the light via those crazy inferences.
A5:21:31 <08Notch> you wouldn't see a single blurred ball, but rather 100 samples of the ball
A5:22:00 <08Notch> i agree with you in principle
A5:22:10 <08Notch> I'm just trying to point out that it isn't quite that simple
A5:22:23 <08Notch> there will always be sampling effects with strobe lights
A5:23:11 <vdgmprgrmr> You would eventually reach a point (assuming you have the power of magic or something to make whatever it is flash at such a ridiculous speed) where photoreceptors themselves just don't catch the spots where the light is in an off-state.
A5:23:30 <08Notch> that's not how it works. they're sensitive to react to a single photon
A5:23:32 <08Notch> (if hit)
A5:23:40 <08Notch> *sensitive enough
A5:24:01 <Siiseli> http://i.servut.us/i/screenieg.png this is how I feel right now. Expressed in what I'm doing right now
A5:24:04 <08Notch> and when hit, if the intensity matches their input range, they will fire
A5:24:33 <vdgmprgrmr> If what you're saying is true, then it's impossible for those residual images to appear from seeing a bright light.
A5:24:40 <vdgmprgrmr> And we know that there are residual images.
A5:24:42 <08Notch> no, not at all!
A5:25:02 <08Notch> i see what you mean now, if you blink a very intense light. :D

A5:25:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Or if you blink a weak light a number of times per second that is just ridiculously large.
A5:25:44 <08Notch> well... err
A5:25:55 <08Notch> light source = photon emittor
A5:26:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Make sure to contemplate the sort of number I'm talking about.
A5:26:13 <08Notch> if you blink it so it's off 50% of the time, you've got a light source at half the intensity
A5:26:18 <Siiseli> when I'm in a completely dark room and hold my hand in front of my eyes and flash the light quickly, why do I still see my hand there for some time
A5:26:25 <Siiseli> I find it rather an amusing activity
A5:26:47 <08Notch> partly it's a mental image. :D
A5:27:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Mostly it's a mental image formed from residual buzzed-ness of photoreceptors.
A5:27:14 <vdgmprgrmr>  :D
A5:27:16 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: If you agree there will be sampling effects, I will agree with you
A5:27:26 <08Notch> about the blinking
A5:28:08 <vdgmprgrmr> It might actually not appear at half-intensity even if it's off half the time.
A5:28:24 <08Notch> if 50% of the photons don't get emitted, it will

A5:28:34 <vdgmprgrmr> It would probably appear at some amount larger than 50%, but not 100%.
A5:28:56 <08Notch> it depends on when you blink it and when the source emits photons
A5:29:08 <08Notch> if you turn it off between it emitting photons, it'll be full intensity of course
A5:29:18 <08Notch> but then one might question how you define turning it off

A5:29:58 <vdgmprgrmr> No I mean, because the photoreceptors can have residual "buzzed-ness" it would appear (to us) to be at perhaps 70% intensity or something.
A5:30:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Not exactly 50%.
A5:30:24 <08Notch> no, the brain is used to compensating for that buzzed-ness.
A5:30:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Then why do we have residual images?
10A5:30:44 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
A5:30:45 <08Notch> i don't in my day to day work
A5:30:50 <08Notch> i get it in extreme conditions
A5:31:06 <08Notch> when looking at a very strong light source, I always get it
A5:31:07 <vdgmprgrmr> You just don't notice them readily, I'd say.
A5:31:22 <vdgmprgrmr> But you probably still get them.
A5:31:24 <08Notch> yes, the brain compensates for it.
A5:32:04 <vdgmprgrmr> If you close your eyes after looking at a standard monitor, you'll probably notice a faint rectangular green splotch in your vision, even if you look away from the monitor.
A5:32:21 <08Notch> yes, that's a pretty extreme change
A5:32:38 <08Notch> if i'm watching a movie, I don't just see a blurred mess
A5:32:39 <vdgmprgrmr> It shows that the residual image is still there, though.
A5:32:45 <Siiseli> when I've been a while on the computer I notice a flicker in the right side of my eye
A5:32:48 <08Notch> absolutely, that's now what I'm saying
A5:32:51 <Siiseli> never had it before I got a second monitor
A5:32:59 <Siiseli> right corner
A5:33:34 <08Notch> Siiseli: The periphical vision is more sensitive to motion, might be that. =)
A5:33:48 <Siiseli> mmkay
A5:33:57 <Siiseli> it's a bit annoying
A5:34:10 <08Notch> what kind of monitor is it?
A5:34:18 <vdgmprgrmr> So if you can get something flashing so absurdly quickly that the residual image left on the eye compensates for the time when the lights aren't shining, the flashing would be unnoticeable.
A5:34:21 <08Notch> if it's two crt monitors, try moving them apart
A5:34:44 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: Yes, absolutely. this is why we can watch movies and not throw up
A5:34:48 <Siiseli> Notch, not ctr
A5:34:50 <Siiseli> crt*
A5:35:09 <08Notch> BUT, there will be sampling effects, and I don't agree with your claim about the perceived intensity not having a linear falloff curve
A5:35:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, I'd say the eye isn't sensitive to motion in different areas. We just notice motion more in the peripheral areas because the peripheral areas "update" more quickly.
A5:35:31 <08Notch> what's the difference between those two statements?
A5:35:46 <vdgmprgrmr> One relies on the eye, the other relies on the brain.
A5:35:55 <08Notch> ok, then you're wrong. =D
A5:36:15 <vdgmprgrmr> You're saying the eye is motion-sensitive, whereas I'd say that the brain detects "motion" from signals sent from the eye.
A5:36:46 <08Notch> yes, but there are more rods in the periphical area.
A5:36:54 <08Notch> so there's a definite physical difference in the eye
A5:37:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I never said there wasn't.
A5:37:15 <08Notch> most likely because people who did see motion well at the edge of their vision surived better than people who didn't.
A5:37:17 <vdgmprgrmr> But I'm saying that motion-detection is a brain thing, not an eye thing.
A5:37:48 <08Notch> ok then =)
A5:38:02 <08Notch> (the eye is part of the brain)
A5:38:10 <vdgmprgrmr> But the eye's different areas are more well-equipped than other areas to send more accurate information to the brain, so it would appear that peripherally, motion is more easily detected.
A5:38:30 <vdgmprgrmr> I differentiate the eye and the brain, personally.
A5:39:24 <08Notch> as do I, that's why I put it in parenthesis. But it's not as simple as to just say "this happens here, that happens there"
A5:39:38 <08Notch> well, on one level it is.
A5:40:12 <vdgmprgrmr> One does one thing, the other does something with what the other thing did.
10A5:40:20 * doohan (doohan@nat66.mia.three.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
A5:40:37 <08Notch> yeah, sure, but then you're just blackboxing the entire brain while being very specific about the eyes
A5:41:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, I'm also "blackboxing" the eyes.
A5:41:24 <vdgmprgrmr> There's more parts to the eye than just "the eye".
A5:41:48 <08Notch> er, ok
A5:42:05 <08Notch> you mean like rods and cones?
A5:42:21 <08Notch> i thought we were discussing them, how they work, and how they're laid out in the eye
A5:42:26 <08Notch> that's quite specific, I'd say
A5:42:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Rods, cones, retina, cornea, all those other eye parts.
A5:42:54 <vdgmprgrmr> We could prolly figure out what part of the brain handles vision.
A5:43:11 <08Notch> right. =D
A5:43:42 <vdgmprgrmr> yeah.
A5:43:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Rods/cones -> optic nerve -> visual cortex
A5:44:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Then we could get super-accurate and describe all the parts of rods/cones, the optic nerve, and the visual cortex (maybe).
A5:44:53 <08Notch> i don't really see any difference between saying "your eye is more sensitive to motion in some areas" than to say "no, no, it just sends more signals that can be used to intepret motions from some areas"
A5:45:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Because they're different.
A5:45:27 <08Notch> yes, and things don't fall down
A5:45:32 <08Notch> they fall towards each other
A5:45:47 <08Notch> and THAT'S an analogy, kids =D
A5:45:51 <vdgmprgrmr> The result is the same, yeah, but the process is different.
A5:46:22 <08Notch> no, you're just omitting things in your summary because you can't be absolutely correct in every step
A5:46:30 <08Notch> this is different from reaching false conclusions
A5:46:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Eye detecting motion is different from the brain detecting motion.
A5:47:03 <08Notch> do you also say that you pick up stuff with your brain?
A5:47:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I'd say the brain pretty much does all the stuff with the signals the eye sends it.
A5:47:16 <vdgmprgrmr> The eye is just a conveyor of raw information.
A5:47:48 <08Notch> as is each individual neuron in the brain
A5:48:06 <vdgmprgrmr> True.
A5:48:17 <vdgmprgrmr> But they add up to a lot more functionality than the eye.
A5:48:21 <08Notch> granted
A5:49:06 <doohan> Can't detect motion of something on the horizon with you sense of touch can you?
A5:49:12 <doohan> Unless it was massive :)
A5:49:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Not quite seeing what that was for...
A5:49:35 <08Notch> the eyes are much more than just passive input devices, though
A5:49:55 <vdgmprgrmr> What else do they do?
A5:50:18 <08Notch> adapt to different light levels, white balancing (to some extent), control focus
A5:50:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Okay, yeah, not quite RAW information.
A5:50:33 <vdgmprgrmr> They're prolly responsible for figuring out colors.
A5:50:48 <08Notch> why would they be?
A5:50:57 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno, just seems like they would be.
A5:51:01 <08Notch> great argument
A5:51:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep.
A5:51:16 <vdgmprgrmr> You've made some about as good before, man.
A5:51:21 <doohan> Rods and cones detect different parts of the spectrum aren't they?
A5:51:31 <doohan> don't
A5:51:34 <vdgmprgrmr> No, doohan. We've figured out that they don't.
A5:51:38 <doohan> Ah
A5:51:53 <doohan> For some reason I thought they did.
A5:52:21 <doohan> Like cones absorber more blues
A5:52:23 <doohan> absorbed
A5:52:24 <08Notch> vdgmprgrmr: Except we've already discussed how color information is processed in the brain
A5:52:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Trichromatic color is figured out by comparison of the intensities of photoreceptors that are close to each other.
A5:52:39 <vdgmprgrmr> We have?
A5:52:46 <08Notch> you just QUOTED it
A5:53:05 <vdgmprgrmr> That could TOTALLY be an eye thing!
A5:53:11 <vdgmprgrmr> It's really simple!
A5:53:13 <08Notch> but motion can't?
A5:53:14 <08Notch> hahaha
A5:53:20 <vdgmprgrmr> No, motion can't.
A5:53:24 <08Notch> lol, ok. =D
A5:53:27 <08Notch> derp, derp. doop
A5:53:31 <doohan> Isn't motion esentially a change in detected colours?
A5:53:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Motion is figured out from multiple "images".
A5:53:39 <08Notch> no, vdgmprgrmr.
A5:53:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Color is figured out from one "image".
A5:53:48 <08Notch> THERE ARE NO IMAGES!
A5:53:55 <vdgmprgrmr> That's why I used quotes!
A5:54:01 <08Notch> THERE ARE NO QUOTES!
A5:54:02 <08Notch> wait..
A5:54:04 <08Notch> ok, there are quotes.
A5:54:09 <08Notch> i just was on a roll there
A5:54:31 <vdgmprgrmr> In order to figure out motion, you'd need separate sets of data.
A5:54:48 <vdgmprgrmr> The eye only handles one at a time.
A5:54:53 <08Notch> yeah, and you also need that to figure out color
A5:55:04 <vdgmprgrmr> You only need one set of data to figure out color.
A5:55:24 <08Notch> what's to say you can't have two receptor cells next to each other called Cell A and Cell B
A5:55:25 <Rydia> Notch what are we getting in the next update?
A5:55:49 <08Notch> Cell A starts out lit, Cell B starts out dark. A gets dark when B gets lit. They look at each other and go "OOOH!! MOTION!!"
A5:55:50 <Adurah> After more IRC arguments.
A5:55:55 <doohan> http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080319114627.htm
A5:56:02 <doohan> However, our results in the fly demonstrate that color is strictly excluded from processing directional motion information, which suggests two separate functional pathways,"
A5:56:13 <doohan> Quote from the article
A5:56:27 <08Notch> great link! =D
A5:56:36 <vdgmprgrmr> Since color is figured out by nearby photoreceptors at the same time as eachother, and what you just described also relies on two different cycles.
A5:56:48 <08Notch> cycles? really?
A5:56:53 <08Notch> are we back to that now?
A5:56:55 <vdgmprgrmr> No!
A5:57:23 <vdgmprgrmr> You said that at one point, A is light, B is dark, then at ANOTHER point, A is dark, B is light.
A5:57:29 <vdgmprgrmr> That's TWO sets of data.
A5:57:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Which means the comparison between the two would have to be left to the brain.
A5:58:18 <08Notch> which individual neuron would do the comparison?
A5:58:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Probably quite a few neurons would be involved.
A5:58:48 <08Notch> probably, yes. and the same is true for analyzing color
A5:58:49 <vdgmprgrmr> And it would vary from person to person, seeing how brains aren't identical.
A5:59:01 <doohan> Wait, surely it can be in the eye. The rods detect motion and send a signal to the brain stating that something moved run away!
A5:59:09 <08Notch> my gut feeling (especially after the grat link doohan posted) is that both happen in the brain
A5:59:49 <08Notch> still, nevermind. =)
A5:59:51 <vdgmprgrmr> It's possible that both do, but we can only really be sure that movement definitely does not happen in the eye.
A5:59:54 <citricsquid> <interuption> Notch: Have you seen the stuff JTE has done with the server client? </interuption>

For example, the pulvinar is thought to help maintain the stability of the body's visual environment by compensating for the effects that body movements"
A6:01:53 <08Notch> letting people play on modified servers is fine
A6:01:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, wouldn't distributing modified clients/servers make the game very, very not-mod-friendly?
A6:02:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean...
A6:02:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Wouldn't disallowing distributing modified clients/servers make the game very, very not-mod-friendly?
A6:02:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah that's better.
A6:03:02 <08Notch> why would it?
A6:03:13 <08Notch> are you allowed to distribute modified versions of other games?

A6:03:48 <doohan> Didn't citricsquid say it was a proxy?
A6:03:51 <08Notch> you share the mods, not the modified software.
A6:03:57 <doohan> So it was actually not even part of the server?
A6:04:05 <vdgmprgrmr> How would we do that with Minecraft?
A6:04:09 <08Notch> if you could fly, it probably was a client hack

A6:05:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Well those aren't really mods.
A6:05:09 <08Notch> er, yes they are.
A6:05:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Scripts, maybe, but level editors, definitely not mods.
A6:05:43 <08Notch> ah well, rightie-o
A6:05:51 <08Notch> you're right about everything you say ever, vdgmprgrmr.

A6:06:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I thought everyone already knew this.

A6:07:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Ahh, okay.

A6:08:30 <Adurah> "Mod" can imply a lot, like modifying the binary.

A6:15:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is pretty hard with a game like MC, I guess.
A6:15:52 <LKA> lol tourneyfagging minecraft
A6:16:02 <LKA> the only possible way i could see that happen would be spleef elitism
A6:16:12 <vdgmprgrmr> Although I guess it's possible with Spl...
A6:16:13 <LKA> well, for now, anyway
A6:16:13 <vdgmprgrmr> DAMMIT
13A6:16:14 * citricsquid is the spleef champion, apparently
A6:16:16 <Adurah> Well, I do hear enough about games on Minecraft to assume the audience is certainly not in the casual gamer camp.
13A6:16:30 * LKA comes out of nowhere riding an ice wall to ninja your sentences
13A6:16:40 * LKA dynamically backflips off of it and salutes
A6:17:00 <LKA> I really do need to try spleef sometime
A6:17:33 <LKA> I'll have to get over my paranoia of public servers first
A6:17:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I thin the "I think the game could use this so I think I'll manually edit it in myself" hardcore camp is a really cool camp.
A6:18:09 <Adurah> You sure about that?
A6:18:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Yup.
A6:18:24 <Adurah> Attempting to eclipse the creator is a good thing? :P
A6:18:36 <08Notch> why not just start a new project instead of leeching?
A6:18:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Not attempting to eclipse the project creator.
A6:18:57 <LKA> it'd be better if people would openly share changes they make with the creator themselves
A6:18:59 <vdgmprgrmr> But making your own improvements if you want to.
A6:19:11 <vdgmprgrmr> Is really interesting, I think.
A6:19:12 <LKA> so it could save them time of adding stuff in with code and whatnot
A6:19:22 <08Notch> LKA: Minecraft isn't an open source project
A6:19:28 <Adurah> Yeah, was going to say that. :P
A6:19:29 <LKA> yeah I know
A6:19:30 <LKA> :U
A6:19:38 <LKA> but I mean in general
A6:19:43 <08Notch> oh yeah. =)
A6:19:48 <08Notch> I'm getting a lot of great feedback
A6:19:57 <Adurah> Report bugs, do feedback, but... provide code?
A6:20:01 <Adurah> Eh.
A6:20:11 <08Notch> i don't want to accept code, since it's a commercial project
A6:20:19 <Adurah> Yeah, indeed.
A6:20:19 <08Notch> I won't want people going "oh, remember that code I gave you.." in a year
A6:20:21 <LKA> I mean it's one thing to take something that's open-source and make a ton of amazing add-ons for it, brag on about them and give it to the maker of the stuff itself for an open-source game
A6:20:23 <LKA> but
A6:20:32 <LKA> if they're going to do that and then hoard it themselves going I HAVE THIS AND YOU DON'T HA HA
A6:20:43 <LKA> it's like.. wtf do they expect they're gaining from it
A6:20:52 <08Notch> LKA: What what I meant with "leeching"

A6:24:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Eh? Eh?
A6:24:23 <Spadge> it says it in the topic...
A6:24:23 <doohan> But who's going to explain it?
A6:24:31 <Spadge> Sometimes a potato is just a potato.
A6:24:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I dunno, one of you maybe?
A6:24:41 <Spadge> it does not need explaining
A6:24:48 <doohan> I mean as Spadge points out we'd just be repeating it.
A6:24:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well even if it's literal it makes no sense.
A6:24:59 <doohan> Yeah it does.
A6:25:02 <Spadge> it does
A6:25:16 <vdgmprgrmr> THERE IS IMPLICATION THAT IT IS A METAPHOR AG CAPS
A6:25:19 <vdgmprgrmr>  D:
A6:25:25 <Spadge> its not a metaphor...
A6:25:27 <doohan> In one sense it's quite an ironcic statement.
A6:25:36 <Spadge> :D
A6:25:42 <Spadge> although it can be taken as one
A6:25:49 <vdgmprgrmr> If it's not a metaphor than what's with the "if you know what I mean
A6:25:51 <Spadge> but what can't these days
A6:25:53 <vdgmprgrmr> " statement?
13A6:26:16 * Spadge runs away at that question.
A6:26:17 <doohan> vdgmprgrmr, obviously it's all about you.

13A6:26:27 * vdgmprgrmr cries.
A6:26:42 <vdgmprgrmr> What does it mean!? T_T
A6:26:47 <Spadge> vdgmprgrmr: as a programmer you should know exactly what it means
A6:26:55 <doohan> I means an apple is sometimes, just an apple.
A6:26:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Wat
A6:27:02 <doohan> it*
A6:27:11 <Spadge> lol
A6:27:17 <Spadge> i love the irony in the topic
A6:27:28 <doohan> There's nothing more to it. It is as it appears. A potato.
A6:27:28 <Spadge> and doohan sees it too
A6:27:44 <vdgmprgrmr> OH I GET IT NOW
A6:27:47 <Spadge> >_<
A6:27:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And it's pretty hilarious.
A6:28:01 <doohan> No it's not.
A6:28:02 <Spadge> ^_^
A6:28:04 <vdgmprgrmr> It is!
A6:28:06 <doohan> What's funny is you failing to grasp it.
A6:28:09 <doohan> That was funny.
A6:28:11 <Spadge> it is because he took ages to get it
A6:28:32 <Spadge> and thats what he means as well
A6:28:34 <Spadge> :D
A6:28:34 <vdgmprgrmr> But seriously you totally could have explained it without repeating it.
A6:28:35 <Siiseli> you should change it to "winkwinknudgenudge"
A6:28:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Without JUST repeating it, anyway.
A6:29:02 <citricsquid> Finally the forum has almost over taken purchases :D
A6:29:10 <Spadge> lol

A6:29:14 <Spadge> buy the game
A6:29:19 <Spadge> must not let forum overtake
A6:29:37 <doohan> I'm not buying it twice.
A6:30:12 <vdgmprgrmr> "Sometimes a potato is just a potato" means that occasionally things are just as they seem to be, while the "if you know what I mean" is an implication that the potato statement is the opposite of what it highlights; a metaphor.
A6:30:14 <vdgmprgrmr> See?
A6:30:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Easy!

A6:32:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I like it..
A6:32:57 <vdgmprgrmr> And you guys are douches.
A6:33:31 <doohan> Spadge: "<vdgmprgrmr> And you guys are douches." This is a metaphor for: I'm slow.
A6:33:33 <doohan> :P
A6:33:38 <vdgmprgrmr> NO
A6:33:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Seriously, it's just annoying.
A6:33:51 <doohan> It read that way. I'm sure of it.

A6:36:45 <Zuriki> I'm going to attempt to play S4 League me thinks.
A6:36:51 <doohan> Ask vdgmprgrmr. He can tell you all about it.

A6:37:44 <vdgmprgrmr> You don't get it?
A6:37:46 <Spadge> zombuster: the irony is that you are looking for something in a topic when there isn't truely anything to it.
A6:37:55 <vdgmprgrmr> There is something to it.

A7:41:54 <doohan> peerkoel, selectable?
A7:42:16 <peerkoel> a select() call waits for data to be available
A7:42:42 <peerkoel> but you can often give it a timeout
A7:43:52 <doohan> And by console are you talking about the Java Conole for applets and the like or just anything to do with the terminal?
A7:44:04 <doohan> I take it the later
A7:45:44 <peerkoel> the console in this case is the DOS box or terminal that you have the java process running in
A7:45:53 <doohan> Gotcha
A7:45:59 <peerkoel> where you get messages and where you can enter admin commands
A7:48:05 <doohan> And you're trying to read a redirected stdout?
A7:48:57 <peerkoel> ehm no, I'm trying to read what someone types in the terminal
A7:49:02 <doohan> Ah ok
A7:51:10 <doohan> If I remember rightly things like BufferedReader have a readline method that should be blocking
A7:52:42 <peerkoel> except blocking isn't what I want :)
A7:52:44 <doohan> So you can do stuff like: BufferedReader myReader = new BufferedReader(System.in); String line=""; while((line=myReader.readLine())!=null ){System.out.println("You  typed:" + line );}
A7:52:48 <peerkoel> I wan't non-blocking
A7:52:51 <doohan> Or something like that
A7:53:05 <doohan> Put that console reading on a seperate thread.
A7:53:08 <doohan> the*
A7:53:17 <peerkoel> yes, then the thread will block
A7:53:29 <doohan> So a thread for user input, and a thread for doing other stuff.
A7:53:29 <peerkoel> and I'd have to kill the thread
A7:53:34 <doohan> Why?
A7:53:34 <peerkoel> on shutdown
A7:53:48 <doohan> No, you'd leave the thread to die.
A7:54:02 <peerkoel> except it won't because it's blocked
A7:54:05 <doohan> readLine would set line to null since it had got an eof effectlvley
A7:54:12 <doohan> So that while loop would break.
A7:54:26 <peerkoel> well, I tried that and it won't get eof or die

A7:55:41 <doohan> <doohan> readLine would set line to null since it had got an eof effectlvley
A7:55:41 <doohan> <doohan> So that while loop would break.
A7:56:02 <doohan> If you really need asynchronous IO then take a look at the nio stuff. But for terminal input that seems a little like overkill
A7:56:55 <doohan> I mean nio is usually for file and network stuff
A7:58:57 <doohan> Does any of that make sense peerkoel?
A7:59:32 <peerkoel> hm
A7:59:43 <peerkoel> I wonder if nio has some console support
A8:00:07 <doohan> It's overkill for what you're doing though.
A8:00:56 <peerkoel> I think I prefer overkill to thread unsafety
A8:01:01 <peerkoel> thanks for your input btw
A8:01:23 <doohan> Thread's are usually pretty safe.

A10:38:27 <peerkoel> what does the script do cryzed?
A10:38:40 <cryzed> okay lemme explain
A10:38:52 <cryzed> first off it's completely written in python using the stdlib
A10:39:01 <cryzed> It is plugin compatible
A10:39:05 <cryzed> that said i already wrote 2 plugins
A10:39:10 <cryzed> MessagePlugin and BackupPlugin
A10:39:30 <cryzed> which are both completely configurable through a CONFIG dict value withing the python file (really easy)
A10:39:38 <cryzed> It also supports Commands
A10:39:46 <UnknownX> citricsquid: i challenge you to spleef on SNL server
A10:39:54 <cryzed> That said, you as a Python programmer can really easily extend the script
A10:39:55 <citricsquid> later, working atm :D
A10:40:07 <cryzed> Also, it is supposed to restart the server if there is an java exception
A10:40:15 <cryzed> That works - except there's the "Already in use" issue
A10:40:23 <cryzed> I haven't found a workaround for that yet
A10:40:27 <cryzed> most of the script is OOP
A10:40:37 <cryzed> Some parts are ugly, some parts really clean
A10:40:43 <cryzed> for commands
A10:40:46 <cryzed> I implemented
A10:40:49 <cryzed> !quote <add>
A10:40:53 <cryzed> and !quote
A10:40:58 <cryzed> You can guess what it does
A10:41:06 <cryzed> and !run "<name> runs away"
A10:41:14 <cryzed> also !help to give a overview of available commands
A10:41:41 <cryzed> You are able to extend it in all ways though using for example the MinecraftServer class I wrote
A10:41:52 <cryzed> it's all contained in one script because i didn't want to split it
A10:42:05 <cryzed> Also there is a clean shutting down of plugins
A10:42:10 <cryzed> and the server executable
A10:42:13 <cryzed> if something goes wrong
A10:42:19 <cryzed> and after that a clean restart of the Plugins
A10:42:28 <cryzed> so they get the new stdin input pipe
A10:42:33 <cryzed> from the server executable
A10:42:44 <cryzed> well I think that's about it

A11:18:24 <cryzed> thanks :)
A11:18:41 <citricsquid> done + stickied because it's awesome :P
A11:18:48 <citricsquid> well, looks it.
A11:19:14 <chrstfer> i like how you wrote it, but i dont know python, and therefore have no idea how to compile. 
A11:19:41 <cryzed> Thanks citricsquid :)!
A11:19:45 <chrstfer> c++ FTW! even though i cant program a GUI!

A11:20:09 <chrstfer> oh, how then? im getting unknown filetype
A11:20:13 <cryzed> chrstfer: So it's more like a scripting language than a programming language
A11:20:19 <cryzed> Install python

A11:20:32 <cryzed> and place it in the server-folder

A11:21:16 <cryzed> It's source

P12:09:42 <cryzed> how much chatting overall in percent is done via IRC? Is IRC dying? what do you think?
P12:09:52 <Rroff> heh]
P12:10:01 <Rroff> IRC ebs and flows
P12:10:07 <cryzed> hrm
P12:10:11 <Rroff> tho doesn't seem to be as busy as it once was
P12:10:11 <citricsquid> depends on the time of day and the presence of Notch
P12:10:35 <Ylle> IRC overall?
P12:10:48 <Ylle> IRCs problem is that is spread out too much.
P12:10:49 <Rroff> I was assuming he meant IRC overall
P12:10:54 <citricsquid> oh
P12:10:56 <citricsquid> overall
P12:10:56 <Ylle> Back in the day, it was a few big servers.
13P12:10:59 * citricsquid blushes
P12:11:08 <Ylle> Now? Everyone and their mother runs their own server.
P12:11:17 <Rroff> I remember the day when some of the gaming channels had well over 4000 people normally
P12:11:24 <Rroff> and could hit over 10K on events
P12:11:44 <ZomBuster> thats just uuh
P12:11:48 <ZomBuster> that would never work
P12:11:50 <Ylle> I'm pretty sure activity is still high and all that, but yeah we won't see that many in one room for a long time.
P12:11:57 <Ylle> Sure it works
P12:12:02 <Ylle> it's just a tiny bit chaotic
P12:12:07 <Ylle> little bit.
P12:12:39 <Ylle> Also unrelated: Sometime I want to see mobs that build/dig.
P12:13:06 <Ylle> Like the spongemob that is hellbent on sponging up water,
P12:13:08 <Rroff> could flood a 56K modem out on those channels just with chat lol
P12:13:29 <cryzed> Rroff: :D
P12:13:34 <citricsquid> Servers are so cheap now everyone can run their own IRC server. Same reason there's a huge amount of gameservers around on popular games.
P12:13:40 <Rroff> yah
P12:14:00 <Rroff> I ran my own quite popular ircd for awhile
P12:14:05 <citricsquid> in the few years I've been involved with web hosting, the prices have dropped dramatically and accesibility has increased massively.
P12:14:15 <Rroff> got a bit silly when it dropped to like 4-5 people tho
P12:14:16 <cryzed> well yeah but there are only a few really awesome servers. For example "cryzed's server #1" :P *laughs*
P12:14:29 <Rroff> true
P12:14:37 <ZomBuster> I saw a a starving african child on the internet
P12:14:41 <ZomBuster> it made me realise
P12:14:48 <Rroff> even 4-5 years ago it wasn't unusual for dedis to come with 10gig/m bandwidth for like £600/m
P12:14:48 <ZomBuster> I forgot to turn on AdBlock
P12:14:53 <Rroff> lol
P12:15:01 <cryzed> lol
P12:15:25 <Rroff> now you can get 10Tb a month for £60 if you hunt around
P12:15:31 <citricsquid> Yeah, exactly.
P12:16:02 <citricsquid> Even a year ago it cost a lot more, same time last year I was paying 100% more than I pay now for the same setup, hosting is becoming a lot more competitively priced.
10P12:16:09 * Genisi (what@76.226.29.82) has joined #minecraft
P12:16:20 <Rroff> what I don't get is how the hosts survive that are still offering "Professional" dedicated servers for like £300+ a month
P12:16:28 <Rroff> and they only have 20-30gig bandwidth
P12:16:41 <cryzed> I habe 1,5TB Bandwith :O
P12:16:45 <cryzed> per mo
P12:16:57 <Rroff> I have unlimited on one of mine and 3 or 4tb on the others
P12:16:58 <cryzed> Though that's overselling but still
P12:17:05 <citricsquid> Nothing wrong with overselling.
P12:17:09 <cryzed> yeah
P12:17:09 <Ylle> On the plus side, most of the time people on IRC are literate.
P12:17:12 <Rroff> depends on how oversold
P12:17:14 <cryzed> btw citricsquid 
P12:17:20 <cryzed> do you know what FlexRAM is?
P12:17:26 <citricsquid> overselling at any level is fine, as long as it's managed properly.
P12:17:29 <citricsquid> not a clue cryzed
P12:17:34 <cryzed> citricsquid: okay
P12:18:14 <cryzed> citricsquid: Do you have all ports closed except the 22565 on your minecraft servers?
P12:18:31 <Rroff> I don't even bother with a firewall on my servers
P12:18:37 <Rroff> I just make sure I know whats opening ports
P12:18:38 <cryzed> citricsquid: just asking out of interest because I don't see the security thread with opened ports as long as there is no service running on it
P12:18:51 <cryzed> *threat
P12:18:56 <citricsquid> I just disabled all firewalls, so yes all my ports are open.
P12:19:04 <cryzed> citricsquid: So it's still safe, right?
P12:19:08 <Rroff> aslong as you know what your doing
P12:19:12 <cryzed> Okay
P12:19:18 <Rroff> and don't have uncessary services listening
P12:19:19 <citricsquid> Just don't run anything important from it.

P12:19:40 <cryzed> citricsquid: why not?
P12:19:47 <Rroff> you only need a firewall really if you have multiple users capable of introducing new executables to the system
P12:20:19 <cryzed> Rroff
P12:20:23 <citricsquid> because you're asking for trouble, sure it's unlikely but there's always the chance you'll get caught out. It's like keeping your credit card details written down; 99% of the time you'll be k but there's a chance you'll get in trouble with it.

P1:16:37 <cryzed> if my hoster says
P1:16:41 <cryzed> 384mb ram
P1:16:47 <cryzed> and 786mb flexram guaranteed
P1:16:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid, I run the server out of my house (have a special FiOS plan that allows me to do that), and that particular box ran me $90
P1:16:55 <citricsquid> flexram, I assume, is burstable.
P1:16:59 <cryzed> that means I actually have 384mb + 786mb, right?
P1:17:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> I want to make some of that back :P
P1:17:07 <cryzed> because it is guaranteed
P1:17:11 <citricsquid> it means you have 384 guaranteed and can sometimes burst up to 1GB
P1:17:19 <cryzed> no it says
P1:17:26 <cryzed> 384mb ram GUARANTEED
P1:17:26 <cryzed> and
P1:17:33 <cryzed> 786mb ram GUARANTEED
P1:17:36 <citricsquid> um
P1:17:37 <cryzed> so that means I can burst up anytime
P1:17:41 <citricsquid> why didn't thety just put 1gb?
P1:17:44 <cryzed> I dunno
P1:17:49 <cryzed> it probably seems cooler
P1:17:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think if you sustain 1gb usage they'll delete you

P1:25:37 <Rroff> theres no way they could cover the cost of a server with even 16gig of RAM at $14 per customer
P1:25:47 <Rroff> which means hideous swapping to HDD on the host end
P1:26:15 <citricsquid> minerman: lol, not /b/ though =\
P1:26:30 <citricsquid> Rroff: Pretty easy on their scale, actuall.
P1:26:36 <citricsquid> actually*

P1:27:32 <Rroff> you can't oversell more than 1 in 3 or all customers are going to see horrid performance

P1:27:40 <citricsquid> 14 * 16 = $220/server @ 16gig, with their commitments it'd be easy especially with their bandwidth pooling ability.
P1:28:36 <Rroff> I doubt even at that level they can make any profit on a 16gig server without selling it atleast twice over
P1:28:48 <Rroff> bandwidth is entirely another matter
10P1:29:06 * Adura (Adura@bas2-toronto21-1242351129.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
P1:29:08 <citricsquid> the money they save on bandwidth commitments can be used to spend on servers
P1:29:27 <Rroff> yeah but even so
P1:29:43 <citricsquid> + I assume they do oversell, but cleverly, they monitor who uses what resources and if a server has only 50% of resources they sell on it.
P1:29:44 <Rroff> a server with that kinda spec bought out right is gonna cost around $5000
P1:30:01 <Rroff> I guess with very careful management it might work to a limit
P1:30:12 <citricsquid> $220/m * 24 = 5280
P1:30:17 <citricsquid> so after 2 years it pays for itself
P1:30:26 <Rroff> by which time it will be out dated
P1:30:35 <Rroff> and have little resale or future use value :S
P1:31:11 <citricsquid> The age of a server only matters when buying servers though, I'd not rent a 5 year old server but if I was on a VPS and the hardware still worked, why would I care?
P1:31:13 <Rroff> you only need the smallest spike in useage patterns to upset everything
P1:31:20 <Adura> Mien Kraft
P1:31:34 <Rroff> when other hosts are offering packages that are twice as good as your old hardware can provide
P1:31:40 <Rroff> your not gonna last long
P1:32:14 <Rroff> end of the day for a throw away vps I'm sure it fine
P1:32:26 <Rroff> but for any serious useage its a mistake
P1:32:37 <citricsquid> very few people in my experience ever use VPSs seriously, I'd honestly guess at <10% of customers ever hitting their limits.
P1:32:51 <Rroff> heh
P1:33:14 <Rroff> bandwidth wise you get maybe 5% of customers coming anywhere near the limits
P1:33:21 <Rroff> those that do usually hammer it something silly
P1:33:42 <citricsquid> one day I'm going to try and use my entire limit, I've never done that before :(
P1:33:56 <Rroff> I've never done so bandwidth wise

P1:49:10 <yoshibot> 1024x1024x128 should only take 128mb if each block was a byte
P1:49:23 <Rroff> it uses a lot more memory than raw map size
P1:49:42 <Rroff> twice the map size right off the bat

P3:01:22 <JTE> I have no source of income. Without any income, I have no money. Without any money, I can't pay anyone to work with me. Without anyone working with me, I can't finish any games from scratch. Without any finished games from scratch, I can't sell anything. Without selling anything, I get no income.

P3:04:21 <Eagle> Yeah, if I could use more moves besides Cannon.
P3:04:22 <Eagle> D:

P3:04:35 <JTE> z = A button
P3:04:38 <JTE> x = B button
P3:04:46 <Eagle> I know that. :P
P3:04:53 <JTE> There is no chip select system yet, the cannon is actually supposed to be your charge attack... :(
P3:05:03 <JTE> There's no charging, either.
P3:05:10 <Eagle> Hm.
P3:05:21 <JTE> However, there IS a chip system.
P3:05:30 <Eagle> ?
P3:05:37 <Eagle> Is there a way to /use/ it?
P3:05:55 <JTE> In the data/chips folder is other folders containing all of the graphics and XML data on every attack we used.
P3:06:05 <JTE> There is no character-specific battlechip stuff whatsoever.
P3:06:28 <JTE> :3~ Thus, any navi that anyone makes can use any chip and it should look right.
P3:06:40 <JTE> data/navi contains the characters, of course
P3:06:59 <Eagle> Stupid default one. :/
P3:07:24 <Eagle> I never got why some people had crappy regular navis, and some people had superawesome customized navis.
P3:07:40 <ZomBuster> navis? chips? uuh
P3:07:59 <Eagle> ZomBuster you silly goose. Megaman Battle Network.
P3:08:16 <Eagle> Or if you want to stretch it, StarForce too.
P3:09:13 <JTE> Officially, some people had crappy regular navis because they use their PET like a cellphone and never bothered to customize it or buying upgrades or special navis was too expensive or something.
P3:09:40 <JTE> Unofficially, Capcom didn't want to come up with a thousand designs for citizens and just made them all look the same. :P
P3:09:46 <Eagle> That's dumb. They're dumb.
P3:09:53 <Eagle> :P
P3:10:06 <JTE> Either way, I've taken it to heart and made the Normal Navi what you start out with.
P3:10:13 <JTE> There will be no Megaman in this game.
P3:10:30 <ZomBuster> ooh so thats where its based
P3:10:31 <ZomBuster> on
P3:10:32 <Eagle> Good. Otherwise EVERYBODY would be Megaman.
P3:10:33 <JTE> (Everyone starting with Megaman is what Capcom would do, and that's even worse.)

P6:56:30 <asianRanger> yo, i just portfowarded and edited my server prop to my liking. 
P6:56:36 <asianRanger> how do you get custom maps onto your server?
P6:56:55 <Thi3f> Others maps or do you want to make your own?
P6:56:56 <asianRanger> and how do people get admin "helpers" to work in conjuction to thier server
P6:56:59 <asianRanger> other maps
P6:57:03 <asianRanger> i downloaded one
P6:57:09 <asianRanger> renamed it and put into my server folder
P6:57:18 <asianRanger> but it just said it wasnt compress right or seomthing
P6:57:27 <Thi3f> Then you might have accidentally unpacked it
P6:57:35 <cryzed> guys
P6:57:38 <Thi3f> I think it's supposed to be gzipped packed

P6:59:32 <asianRanger> so how do i get the map to work?
P6:59:40 <Thi3f> Redownload it, or repack it
P6:59:49 <asianRanger> repack :/ ?
P6:59:50 <Thi3f> Where did you get it from?
P6:59:56 <asianRanger> forum
P7:00:05 <Thi3f> Which map?
P7:00:22 <asianRanger> half flatgrass/ half water
P7:00:29 <Terror1> i had the same problem
P7:00:30 <Terror1> but
P7:00:42 <Terror1> download from the megaupload link, if you mean the plenty o' maps topic
P7:00:47 <asianRanger> mhm
P7:01:16 <asianRanger> k
P7:01:30 <Thi3f> Well, when I download from the megaupload link, it gives me a .gz file
P7:01:38 <Thi3f> Just rename that whole thing to server_level.dat
P7:01:41 <Thi3f> Don't unpack it or anything

P7:03:18 <asianRanger> ocsi
P7:03:20 <asianRanger> or seomthng?
P7:03:50 <Terror1> you also need to download the server software 
P7:04:00 <Terror1> because the map editor has to be in minecraft_server to work
P7:04:05 <Terror1> wait a sec

P8:46:41 <Adura> Right now it captures everything after the timestamp if it exists.
P8:46:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait what is IRC bot?
P8:47:22 <Adura> In this case it's a connection to IRC to help you administer your Minecraft server.

10P8:47:40 * Rydia (Haruhi@68.186.97.143) has joined #minecraft

P8:48:53 <Adura> The bot will try to reconnect if it gets disconnected.
P8:49:06 <vdgmprgrmr> oic
P8:49:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Moderating servers without having to be on the server.
P8:51:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura: next on the list.. multi-line join messages?

P8:52:33 <Adura> Multi-line is doable, sure.
P8:52:40 <Adura> Test out the IRC features.
P8:52:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll restart in 30 mins or so
P8:52:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> I prepared the channel and everything already

P8:54:50 <PuyoDead> spiffy
P8:59:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, isn't the default IRC port 6667?  Does esper use 6668?
P8:59:34 <Adura> I just put that for those with crap routers.
P8:59:40 <Adura> You can change it to whatever.
P9:00:19 <AlLnAtuRalX>  that port shouldn't need to be forwarded...
P9:00:30 <Adura> Eh?
P9:00:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll leave it 6668 though
P9:00:52 <Adura> Sure, you can connect to 6668 on the server I'm on now.
P9:01:04 <Adura> You'd think the other servers of the network would follow suit.
P9:02:01 <Adura> By people with crap routers I mean the disconnect on DCC SEND 012345678901234
P9:02:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, couldn't load POE component

P9:03:36 <Adura> Did you install POE::Component::IRC?
P9:03:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> That would be a good idea
P9:03:51 <Adura> Yup.
P9:07:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Do you guys know of any way to speed up the whole "Bind exception, address already in use" thing?
P9:08:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> I've been kicking everyone before putting the server down, I used SIGINT, I still get it <every> damn time
P9:08:49 <Adura> Have you tried kicking everyone?
P9:09:06 <AlLnAtuRalX> ^
P9:09:08 <AlLnAtuRalX>   |
P9:09:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> damn, that didn't come out right
P9:09:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> ^
P9:09:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> |
P9:09:54 <Adura> Blah.
P9:11:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> god.  damn. it
P9:11:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm going to be waiting 45 minutes until I can get the server back up at this rate
P9:11:57 <Adura> Restart networking?
P9:11:59 <AlLnAtuRalX> I mean, I'm sure if you go from 20 -> 0 there's going to be some keepalives left over somewhere, but come on!
P9:12:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura, I have 2 other servers running of here, I really don't want to do that
P9:12:35 <Adura> Dang.
P9:13:04 <AlLnAtuRalX> I am going to strangle Notch if he doesn't implement some way to gracefully shut down the damn minecraft server
P9:13:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> It's not like it's difficult, and I've asked him 4 times already
P9:14:11 <PuyoDead> it greatly confused me at first when I was typing things in the console when first running a server, thinking something would shut it down
P9:14:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> I mean, it's never a problem when 1-6 users are on
P9:14:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> but with 16-26 it just won't work
P9:17:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura: http://pastebin.com/m481383dd Is that normal because the server won't start?
P9:18:35 <Adura> I've not tested it in a situation where the minecraft server doesn't start.
P9:18:56 <Adura> Looks like you're still waiting on that bount port, eh?
P9:19:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> I will likely be for at least 30 minutes
P9:19:11 <AlLnAtuRalX> one time I was in the city
P9:19:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> so I put it down from my phone
P9:19:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> And there were reboot problems, so I couldnt remotely reboot at the time
P9:19:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> 12 hours after I reboot I was trying every hour... Nothing
P9:19:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> sorry, 12 hours after server kill
P9:19:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Still the same bind exception
P9:19:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> It drove me insane...
P9:20:20 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'll give it 10 minutes, but I'll likely have to reboot

P9:32:33 <Adura> Must be a way of releasing the bind.
P9:32:50 <AlLnAtuRalX> There *must* be but the only solution I can find online is change the ports
