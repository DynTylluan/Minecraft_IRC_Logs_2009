A2:03:21 <Blade`Skydancer> . . .in Omen, what controls the vertical height of the map as opposed to its length/width?
A2:03:36 <Blade`Skydancer> Or rather, what direction are the axes?
A2:03:40 <vede> In Omen, the Y axis is up/down.
A2:03:51 <vede> with y=0 being the top
13A2:03:57 * Blade`Skydancer usually understands X as left/right, Y as forward/back, and Z being up/down.
A2:04:09 <vede> I understand Y as vertical usually.
A2:04:25 <vede> But I can see why Z as vertical would make more sense.
A2:04:37 <vede> I just learned it as Y=vertical, so I can't easily change from it.
A2:04:44 <Blade`Skydancer> It's the way I learned it doing 3D modeling.
A2:04:47 <vede> And my programming language of choice says Y=vertical.

A5:51:36 <citricsquid> ahh yes
A5:51:45 <citricsquid> You need to be given voice by Notch for it to be auto.
A5:52:17 <peerkoel> you need to be given lvl 30 access for it to be auto
A5:52:41 <citricsquid> yep and only Notch can apply that, I think. I can't apply auto op to anyone anyway :(
A5:53:33 <peerkoel> why is it always on a sunday that I feel like going shopping
A5:56:03 <citricsquid> sunday is a day to feel female.
A5:56:31 <peerkoel> even though I know some females I'd like to feel, I'm not sure what you mean there
A5:56:44 <peerkoel> also, what's with the ghostbusters image on the dev blog?
A5:56:55 <citricsquid> it's some game dev in joke, I think.

A6:18:14 <Marach> you wrote that yourself? :)

A6:18:28 <vede> Now that your brains have been appropriately FUCKED ALL TO HELL, I'll show you the wikipedia article for malbolge.

A6:18:38 <vede> And no, I did NOT write that myself.
A6:18:49 <Marach> i know what is that
A6:18:54 <Marach> for a long time
A6:18:56 <vede> Most interesting line, I think: Malbolge was so difficult to understand when it arrived that it took two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. The program was not even written by a human being: it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp.
A6:19:19 <Marach> dont impress people with a code you didnt write yourself :)
A6:20:22 <UnknownX> Citricsquid have you noticed what I have done!?!?

A6:22:21 <vede> You start with brainfuck, and give each command a number from 0 to 7.
A6:22:44 <vede> Language number one had two commands, one to increment the current command, the other to execute it.
A6:23:02 <vede> The two commands were O and X.

A6:26:35 <Marach> lol
A6:26:49 <vede> It's a SHORT program, but that's a basic idea of how the code would look.

A6:27:20 <UnknownX> Citricsquid i have a gun pointed to your head don't move
A6:27:38 <vede> Where each downward-moving "**" increments to the next brainfuck command (looping, so it goes 012345670123...), and "**" executes the current command selected.

A7:19:10 <UnknownX> I found one that had Real Name...
A7:19:19 <UnknownX> And then it was 404 not found
A7:20:03 <vede> Ooh.

P3:08:33 <citricsquid> Jeffman12: No
P3:08:40 <citricsquid> IPs change, why would you do that? o.0
P3:08:45 <LG_Legacy> When you can't use firefox, you have to.
P3:09:05 <citricsquid> everytime you use IE a developer cuts himself.
P3:09:30 <Jeffman12> Because I have a static one, and if it's by name people can pretend to be admins on a non-verified server
P3:09:49 <Jeffman12> Which I have to run it as because it won't let me join, otherwise.

P3:12:06 <testvan> o
P3:12:07 <vede> So?
P3:12:23 <Misterangry> I think what he's getting at is he wants to op himself based on IP
P3:12:31 <vede> Yeah.
P3:12:32 <Misterangry> and since he has a static IP, it'll work
P3:12:50 <Jeffman12> Yes, if I could op by IP
P3:12:53 <vede> You could write a script to kick anyone who joins with your name but not your IP.
P3:13:08 <Jeffman12> Hey, that's a good idea
P3:13:11 <vede> But I don't believe imitation is, like, WILDLY common.
P3:13:26 <Jeffman12> Right, I just like to have my bases covered.
P3:13:50 <citricsquid> also, uh, IP can be spoofed afaik.
P3:14:07 <vede> Yeah.
P3:14:14 <vede> Pretty sure.
P3:14:25 <citricsquid> so all you have to do is go to my website, or join my server and I have free reign on your server.
P3:14:28 <Jeffman12> I could set it to use my local IP, maybe? My server is on the same network...
P3:15:02 <vede> I don't think that would work.
P3:15:16 <Misterangry> lol
P3:15:24 <Jeffman12> Yeah, I can't even join via local IP
P3:15:41 <Jeffman12> It was working yesterday, though.
P3:15:48 <vede> Pretty sure the info the server sends goes outside your network, then back in if you're joining your own.
P3:15:55 <vede> So you'd need an external IP.
P3:17:13 <testvan> ever put PB on your teste?

P5:27:47 <mail2345|semi-afk> gah ninjas

P5:31:29 <citricsquid> If it had some sort of timeout, so it couldn't say it again for like, 60 seconds.
P5:31:36 <Super-Dot> Yeah
P5:31:44 <mail2345|semi-afk> hmm
P5:31:47 <PuyoDead> and without the spam on url titles, 8ball, stuff like that
P5:31:58 <mail2345|semi-afk> spam on url titles require direct addressing
P5:32:01 <mail2345|semi-afk> but calc is useful
P5:32:22 <mail2345|semi-afk> and the url title is so I can check what a page title is. eg, no rick rolls
P5:32:41 <Super-Dot> Calc should probably be a PM thing
P5:32:46 <mail2345|semi-afk> actually
P5:32:48 <PuyoDead> or at least a notice
P5:32:54 <mail2345|semi-afk> just set all fo them to pms
P5:32:59 <citricsquid> if it isn't relevant to minecraft or this channel, it's pointless.

P5:33:00 <testvan> Trusses and struts spread out across pits
P5:33:01 <vede> I think it's good for non-PM.
P5:33:11 <PuyoDead> I still vote notice
P5:33:27 <Super-Dot> testvan, that was awesome
P5:34:28 <Super-Dot> xkcd's channel has a bot that searches comic transcripts
P5:34:31 <LG_Legacy> Minecraftness
P5:34:44 <Super-Dot> A bot that searches the forums could be useful for troubleshooting

P5:35:18 <mail2345|semi-afk> of course the fourms need to be on :P

P5:36:03 <citricsquid> I think someone got annoyed by that before, it alerted them.
P5:36:08 <vede> Oh.
P5:36:11 <PuyoDead> hmm, not sure if that's default or not
P5:36:11 <Super-Dot> Notice can ding individual people, like PMs
P5:37:36 <Super-Dot> My client doesn't display notices by default
P5:37:45 <Super-Dot> It just beeps and gives me an excerpt
P5:38:00 <PuyoDead> interesting

P6:06:19 <Darkebrz> So
P6:06:27 <Darkebrz> When I'm done with this one, I have 10 more pages
P6:06:32 <Darkebrz> And it is the same for every page
P6:06:42 <vede> It's fractal.
P6:07:08 <Darkebrz> What is?
P6:07:26 <vede> Each page has ten subsets, which also have ten subsets.
P6:07:31 <vede> Which also have ten subsets.
P6:07:41 <vede> tvtropes is fractally interesting.
P6:07:46 <mail2345|semi-afk> fractal tabs
P6:07:50 <vede> Almost, since it's not theoretically infinite.

P8:52:16 <calzoneman> oh I want to know how it works so I can code them from scrath
P8:52:28 <calzoneman> basically the format
P8:52:30 <calzoneman> and the encoding
P8:52:31 <Jat> what language do you want to use?
P8:52:40 <mail2345|afk> i know that it is gzipped
P8:52:43 <calzoneman> I don't care what language, I know a lot of them
P8:53:04 <calzoneman> are they stored as arrays of heightmaps or 3 dim arrays of blocks or what?
P8:53:05 <mail2345|afk> jte mentioned one of the formats being a java serialised class
P8:53:12 <Jat> well if you use java the wiki had a download for the class file that let you easily manipulate maps in java
P8:53:22 <Jat> and yes there is a thr5ee dimensional array

P8:55:27 <mail2345|afk> i know
P8:55:27 <Jat> one of the problems with the map file format is that while the wiki used to have information on the locations in the file of the different data that information was not applicable to all map files

P8:56:19 <Jat> a serialized class is basically the format that java saves an instance of a class in
P8:56:23 <Jat> when you write it to a file
P8:56:25 <calzoneman> I have Omen, but how do I get access the methods for my own use
P8:56:47 <calzoneman> is there something in the jar?
P8:57:17 <Jat> i think if you open up the jar file for the minecraft server somewhere in there is the class file with the methods and such you want
P8:57:34 <Jat> but im not sure since i dont use java and im not exactly sure how java works with that kind of stuff
P8:57:57 <Jat> do you have a hex editor?
P8:58:28 <calzoneman> yes
P8:58:39 <calzoneman> I found Level.classs

P8:58:50 <calzoneman> most other stuff has nondescript names

P9:00:06 <mooogle> electronica :D
P9:00:09 <Jat> if you just want to edit the map data just ungzip a map file and open it in the hex editor to find the start location of the 3 dimensional array
P9:00:19 <Jat> and then with your program just edit that array
P9:00:24 <Jat> and when youre done regzip it
P9:00:29 <Jat> re-gzip
P9:00:52 <calzoneman> so to ungzip
P9:00:58 <calzoneman> do I rename .dat to .gz
P9:01:09 <Jat> if you read on suns web site about the java object serialization file format you can also find the other data to change like spawn location and rotation... its not as hard to learn about that as it sounds
P9:01:11 <calzoneman> or do I have to use a stream 
P9:01:39 <Jat> if you have a program that can do gzip just rename it to gz or something i guess
P9:01:58 <Jat> or it might just open as a gzip file if you manually open it through the unzipping program too

P9:14:25 <Jat> hi spadge
P9:14:34 <Blade`Skydancer> 'cause half the channel was on one of the servers that stopped talking.

P9:14:49 <Visiiri> Could you do him?
P9:14:49 <Visiiri> :D
P9:14:51 <Jat> so a channel actually exists on more than one server at a time?
P9:15:02 <Blade`Skydancer> Example, on sorcery.net there's two servers, ironforge.sorcery.net and iuturna.sorcery.net
P9:15:12 <Visiiri> and irc.esper.net

P9:15:23 <KuroBit> I'm trying to find a better picture...
P9:15:41 <Visiiri> look for "timeshift renders"
P9:15:46 <Blade`Skydancer> If iuturna.sorcery.net stops talking to ironforge.sorcery.net, then the people on ironforge see the iuturna people quit, while the reverse is true for the ironforge people.
P9:15:54 <Blade`Skydancer> Err, iuturna people.
P9:16:04 <Visiiri> top half http://media.photobucket.com/image/timeshift%20render/sygmazx7/timeshiftcopy.png
P9:16:08 <Jat> oh so everything is sort of distributed amongst the servers in a network? a channel isnt just on one server?
P9:16:21 <spadge> thats correct jat
