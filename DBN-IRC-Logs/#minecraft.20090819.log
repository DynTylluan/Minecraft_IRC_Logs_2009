A1:36:27 <setveen> grr
A1:37:00 <setveen> Now this is a story all about how 
A1:37:04 <setveen> My life got flipped turned upside down
A1:37:09 <setveen> And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there 
A1:37:13 <setveen> I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
A1:37:18 <setveen> In West Philadelphia born and raised
A1:37:24 <setveen> On the playground is where I spent most of my days
A1:37:36 <setveen> Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
A1:37:44 <setveen> When a couple of guys who were up to no good
A1:37:46 <setveen> Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
A1:37:53 <setveen> I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
10A1:37:55 * Nalok (gdhammerbo@c-24-126-0-81.hsd1.wv.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A1:37:58 <setveen> And said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
A1:38:04 <setveen> I begged and pleaded with her day after day

A1:38:08 <setveen> But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
A1:38:13 <setveen> She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket 
A1:38:17 <setveen> I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
A1:38:23 <setveen> First class yo this is bad 
A1:38:27 <setveen> Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
A1:38:32 <setveen> Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like 
A1:38:36 <setveen> Hmmm this might be all right
A1:38:40 <setveen> But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois and all that
A1:38:46 <setveen> Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat
A1:38:51 <setveen> I don't think so I'll see when I get there 
A1:38:54 <setveen> I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
A1:39:00 <setveen> Well uh the plane landed and when I came out
A1:39:05 <setveen> There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out
A1:39:09 <Magnulus> Wow...
A1:39:10 <setveen> I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here
A1:39:15 <setveen> I sprang with the quickness like lightening disappeared
A1:39:18 <setveen> I whistled for a cab and when it came near 
A1:39:22 <setveen> The license plate said "Fresh", and it had dice in the mirror
A1:39:27 <setveen> If anything I could say that this cab was rare 
A1:39:31 <setveen> But I thought man forget it yo home to Bel-Air
A1:39:35 <setveen> I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 
A1:39:39 <setveen> And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo Holmes, smell ya later!"
A1:39:43 <setveen> Looked at my kingdom I was finally there

A5:14:22 <Maxiflex> Hello there
A5:14:27 <Dav1d> gday
A5:14:37 <Maxiflex> Could I ask you for some support?
A5:14:42 <Dav1d> Yup
A5:14:49 <Maxiflex> When I try to host a server
A5:14:52 <Maxiflex> I get this
A5:15:33 <Maxiflex> 'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
A5:15:41 <Maxiflex> Press any key to continue . . .
A5:15:49 <Maxiflex> Does this sound familiar?
A5:16:34 <Dav1d> you need to install java ;)
A5:16:37 <Maxiflex> I have
A5:16:44 <Maxiflex> Just updated to the latest version :S
A5:16:45 <Dav1d> this is on windows right?
A5:16:53 <Maxiflex> Correct
A5:16:56 <Maxiflex> Vista 64-bit
A5:17:11 <Dav1d> try going to where java installed too
A5:17:20 <Maxiflex> and then?
A5:17:36 <Dav1d> D:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin
A5:17:40 <Dav1d> and run the command from there
A5:17:46 <Dav1d> replace D:\ with C:\ tho
A5:17:51 <Maxiflex> :)
A5:17:57 <Maxiflex> What should I open there?
A5:18:11 <Maxiflex> Whate file?
A5:18:43 <Dav1d> in command prompt, change directory to C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin
A5:18:50 <Dav1d> and run the command from there
A5:19:01 <Maxiflex> Okay :)

A5:20:33 <LG_Legacy> Redshifts?
A5:20:58 <Maxiflex> What command should I run again?
A5:21:02 <Maxiflex> First time :)
A5:21:11 <Dav1d> the one you where trying
A5:21:14 <Maxiflex> java -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer?

A5:47:55 <Dav1d> donations? contract?

A6:31:25 <Dan> So, if I wanted to pay a hosting company to host a server for me, does anyone know a good one to use?
A6:32:04 <Dav1d> a minecraft server?
A6:32:16 <Dan> Yeah
A6:32:28 <Dav1d> you'd be better off finding someone to host it for you and paying them
A6:32:41 <Dav1d> or you could get a cheap vps, but its a bit overkill just for minecraft
A6:33:00 <Dan> Depends how big your map is
A6:33:26 <Dav1d> i dont think that really matters
A6:34:37 <Dan> Well it does, I need a computer powerful enough to handle the size of the map
A6:34:49 <Dan> 10 000x 10 000 x 2000
A6:34:54 <Dav1d> minecraft, even with a large map, dosnt require much power
A6:35:05 <Dav1d> can you even get maps that large lol?
A6:35:15 <Dan> I dunno
A6:35:19 <Dan> :p

A6:36:35 <Dav1d> what currency are we talking in?
A6:36:38 <Dav1d> usd?
A6:37:18 <Dav1d> you could get a server for around $10-$15usd a month 
A6:37:32 <Ankha> If i buy Minecraft, will Vulnerability be permanent? D:
A6:37:52 <Dav1d> Vulnerability?
A6:38:12 <Dav1d> this is a much more expensive solution, but its what your looking for http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/dv/
A6:38:39 <Ankha> Well, the homepage features a version with hearts and fall damage~
A6:39:25 <Dav1d> that's not implemented just yet. And im presuming it'll differ on different server
A6:39:27 <Dav1d> servers*
A6:39:40 <Evil-Ville> That's for survival mode just like it says
A6:39:41 <Dav1d> not sure entirly how Notch is handling the game types
A6:40:31 <Dan> Think I almost killed OME
A6:40:41 <Dav1d> I told you ;)
A6:40:43 <Dan> I tried 2000^3
A6:40:52 <Dan> And its only loaded some buttons so far
A6:41:08 <Dav1d> it'll probabally freeze up until its finished
A6:41:55 <Dan> Hehe
A6:42:04 <Dan> I killed it, trying with only 256 depth
A6:42:37 <Dav1d> try a depth of 8 but see how large you can get it
A6:42:50 <Dav1d> just to see if there is a size limit that OME will take
A6:42:51 <Dan> Is 8 min depth?
A6:42:53 <Dan> :p

A7:41:15 <LG_Legacy> Well fuck
A7:41:37 <citricsquid> LOL
A7:41:47 <citricsquid> So on some forum we're discussing how shit some companies website is
A7:41:52 <citricsquid> then someone comes in and says
A7:42:02 <citricsquid> "I'm a bit confused!! Whats worng with them?"
A7:42:10 <citricsquid> and then "I have been following this website for quite sometime actually"
A7:42:15 <citricsquid> so we searched for info on him
A7:42:18 <citricsquid> and he owns the company.
A7:42:20 <citricsquid> silly person.
A7:42:30 <Magnulus> Hahah.
A7:42:31 <LG_Legacy> How nice.
A7:42:32 <LKA> nice public relations
A7:42:39 <LG_Legacy> Oh yay minecraft is back
A7:43:38 <Magnulus> Is there any way to make lava go upward? Some way to "Pump" it?
A7:43:44 <citricsquid> nope :(
A7:43:51 <citricsquid> There's no pressure for water or lava, kinda sucks.
A7:44:11 <Magnulus> Oh well.
A7:44:31 <LKA> i'm pretty sure upwards-traveling lava would be the nightmare of 80% of the player base lol
A7:44:58 <citricsquid> It'd be cool to have it as a server property
A7:45:02 <citricsquid> pressure=true
A7:45:34 <antinull> lol nice
A7:46:12 <Magnulus> heheh, probably. But on a private server, you should be able to to have some fun with it.
A7:46:16 <antinull> i was only on one lava server, and i couldnt see nor find anything

A8:35:38 <citricsquid> Nah, my neighbours got 3 for their garden and they're on holiday so my dad looks after them, but he was busy today so I offered to do it. We don't have our own.
A8:35:42 <citricsquid> Might get some though, they're awesome.

A8:51:55 <gear|slacking> they just look up his IP

A9:29:54 <smn> ain't he tha total douche?
A9:29:56 <citricsquid> yeah, he's a big poopy head.
A9:30:08 <Visiiri> Recently, somone kidnapped a young boy named Robert. The community got t-shirts, ribbons, and spent tons of man hours searching for him. When I woke up today, I turned on the news to see what time it was. (they have a little bar) And I find out that he died in the care of his mom and his boyfriend and they dumped him in a canal. Both are being charged with first degree murder.
A9:30:49 <citricsquid> oh well, if they got ribbons, it must be serious!
A9:30:59 <Visiiri> That's not the point.
A9:31:36 <Visiiri> These people were giving the family sympathy. They had huge hopes for this kid. And it was fake. Now they are shitheads.
A9:31:50 <doohan> citricsquid, that isnotch service is relatively busy.
A9:31:51 <Visiiri> She says- "He fell and hit his head on a table."

A9:34:49 <doohan> Graveyard.
A9:34:59 <citricsquid> Visiiri: Depends entirely on the person and their way of thinking. If someone died in your care you may very well call the police, but for some people they could panic and dump the body. I know I'd dump a body if I ended up with one.
A9:34:59 <Visiiri> Yeah.
A9:34:59 <doohan> No one looks for a dead body in a grave yard right?
A9:35:08 <ZomBuster> make sure you don't feed the pigs for like 2 weeks\
A9:35:16 <ZomBuster> then they get really hungry
A9:35:27 <citricsquid> ZomBuster: I saw that on CSI! :D
A9:35:35 <ZomBuster> CSI?
A9:35:39 <Visiiri> But citric, the blood splatter prooves that he was alive while his mother was over him.
A9:35:42 <ZomBuster> I saw that on some movie
A9:35:47 <ZomBuster> uuh Snatch I think
A9:36:00 <citricsquid> ZomBuster: Actually, might have been a movie. I watch too much CSI, everything turns into CSI.
A9:36:07 <Visiiri> I'd call the police, as she DID NOT push him, and is there for just ignorent.
A9:36:20 <Visiiri> And I kinda want to grow up into a CSI...
A9:36:27 <Magnulus> Snatch, yeah. There's also Hannibal.
A9:36:36 <doohan> Visiiri, surely you'd call an ambulance first?
A9:36:37 <citricsquid> Visiiri: you said "and I find out that he died in the care of his mom ", that could mean any number of things.

A10:52:31 <PuyoDead> it only took a few days to beat it while being good
A10:52:44 <Magnulus> There are far more effective ways of getting evil.
A10:52:52 <Magnulus> Just eat some crunchy chicks!
A10:52:59 <Iguana> I found that the first one, was much hardy to be evil.
A10:53:00 <Magnulus> Om-nom-nom.

P2:42:18 <liq3> flying lava.
P2:43:02 <Noctraptor> distance cheat? ok so is there a way to turn off detection for this?

P2:43:30 <nilsding> today i've filled up my whole server with lava xD
P2:43:37 <nilsding> 15times!
P2:43:43 <liq3> noctraptor: And dw, in the next couple of months, even better anti-cheat is being added (althouggh, I think these will have the ability to turn off).
P2:44:58 <Noctraptor> I would hope so because in all truth its not a cheat.. flying should be standard in this game. it REALLY is usefull.
P2:45:11 <liq3> well, the new anti-cheat is for survival mode.
P2:45:18 <liq3> Where flyingg would most definately be cheating.
P2:45:29 <Noctraptor> Ahh see I just want to build and be artistic LOL
P2:46:13 <liq3> yeh.
P2:46:13 <liq3> :P
P2:46:34 <liq3> I do agree real flying would be nice, but sandbox is like... It's the worst mode in the game.
P2:46:34 <Noctraptor> And option to tun on and off cheating or  flying and fast movement would be sooo nice.
P2:46:48 <liq3> It's the mode that can do everything, and nothing.

P3:29:06 <JoeyJo0> Rushing is lame
P3:29:19 <JoeyJo0> It's the worst RTS tactic ever.

P5:37:43 <Magnulus> Because THAT is a game-to-movie adaptation I would totally watch.
P5:37:54 <vede> I wouldn't.
P5:37:55 <Iguana> Holy shit. I glanced at it REAL FAST, and it DID look like Faith had 3 legs.

P7:25:24 <tarkata14> alright, noone's joining my server, I'm sad now.
P7:25:36 <Mourne> yes, but he clicked on preferences and it says: Please buy the game if you wish to change your skin  or something similar
P7:25:43 <PuyoDead> ahh, ok
P7:25:57 <Mourne> Ok, he said he emailed
P7:26:05 <Mourne> thx for the help. he says thx too
P7:26:15 <PuyoDead> it was instant for me, so something in the payment must have hiccupped
P7:26:21 <Mourne> me too

P7:33:42 <Darkebrz> ET
P7:33:44 <Eagle> Wasn't that the game that they had to put a bunch of copies of into a
P7:33:44 <Eagle> Oh

P7:34:13 <Darkebrz> Sweet
P7:34:18 <Darkebrz> Is it good?
P7:34:28 <PuyoDead> very much, if you're into FPS
P7:34:36 <Darkebrz> I kinda am
P7:34:46 <Darkebrz> Wolfenstein, right?
P7:34:52 <PuyoDead> it's a little more aim-precise (unlike TF2, which is more run and gun)
P7:34:54 <PuyoDead> yea
P7:35:07 <Darkebrz> I havn't played TF2
P7:35:20 <Darkebrz> Most of my experience is with BF2/142
P7:35:28 <PuyoDead> it'll be a little more similar to that
P7:35:33 <Darkebrz> Which are both very aim-precise
P7:35:42 <PuyoDead> different classes, team oriented, etc
P7:36:21 <Darkebrz> Well, looks like fun :)

P7:37:20 <Darkebrz> They fail at polls
P7:37:25 <Darkebrz> Should we continue to offer 2.55 version or just keep the 2.60b full installer
P7:37:26 <Darkebrz> yes, patching scares me 
P7:37:26 <Darkebrz> no, make people play safe 
P7:37:31 <Darkebrz> This is an "or" poll

P7:37:43 <PuyoDead> what kind of crap place is that?
P7:37:49 <PuyoDead> my god, nobody used 2.55
P7:37:53 <PuyoDead> err, uses
P7:38:10 <Darkebrz> They are asking if they should continue to offer 2.55

P7:46:42 <Super-Dot> Chatzilla is better

P7:46:46 <Super-Dot> e
P7:46:49 <Darkebrz> Chatzilla is okay
P7:46:51 <Darkebrz> But its not standalon e
P7:46:59 <Super-Dot> You can get it standalone
P7:47:06 <Darkebrz>  Then what is the point?
P7:47:07 <Eagle> XChat 2 is still better. >:O
P7:47:09 <Super-Dot> Most people use it with Firefox, though
P7:47:13 <Darkebrz> Chatzilla=Firefox add-on
P7:47:14 <Super-Dot> The point is it's a good client
P7:47:19 <Darkebrz> It is
P7:47:19 <tarkata14> I just use mIRC because it works, and you don't NEED to register.
P7:47:27 <tarkata14> I've never tried xchat though
P7:47:28 <Darkebrz> tarkata14: Thats what I said :P
P7:47:35 <PuyoDead> mirc just becomes nagware after 30 days
P7:47:38 <Super-Dot> Chatzilla=IRC client which can be installed and run within Firefox
P7:47:53 <Darkebrz> And that is its purpose
P7:48:04 <Super-Dot> No, its purpose is to be a good IRC client
P7:48:05 <Darkebrz> Xchat 2/mIRC are much better with standalone
P7:48:19 <tarkata14> Some member from the WoM server is trolling on the FP minecraft thread.
P7:48:20 <Super-Dot> Making it a Firefox extension is just a distribution method

P8:27:54 <TheoX> are there any other common problems that keep people from joining a server?

P8:29:20 <TheoX> I already have those things taken care of
P8:29:33 <Amatsu> It doesn't have to be on your end to be a problem.
P8:29:42 <Amatsu> Or is no one able to join at all?

P9:00:19 <vede> Like, servers that are actually any good?
P9:00:23 <Eagle> H4X running a list of approved servers is hilarious
P9:00:32 <H4X> lol
P9:00:35 <vede> I've never had a thing for empty lists, but I guess that's just me.
P9:00:37 <Visiiri> It's just servers that he griefed and didn't get banned from.
P9:00:41 <H4X> I'll take it down if you hate it lol?
P9:00:52 <Visiiri> It fails
P9:00:57 <Darkebrz> Visiiri: Completely true

P9:31:46 <vede> Whereas the GOOD version is where everyone works together to try to survive.
P9:31:54 <Darkebrz> Oh
P9:31:55 <Darkebrz> Well
P9:31:58 <Darkebrz> Er
P9:32:04 <Darkebrz> How is it fun with no danger at all?
P9:32:09 <vede> There is danger.
P9:32:16 <Darkebrz> The danger of...
P9:32:18 <vede> The lava starts flowing, and then everyone starts building
P9:32:22 <Darkebrz> Oh
P9:32:24 <Darkebrz> Hm
P9:32:30 <Darkebrz> That is an interesting way
P9:32:32 <Eagle> Hey that describes my lava survival
P9:32:34 <vede> That's the way it was done in the early days.
P9:32:38 <Darkebrz> So it floods from the start?
P9:32:40 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P9:32:41 <Darkebrz> I will do that
P9:32:43 <Darkebrz> Sounds like fun
P9:32:45 <Eagle> It floods down a track
P9:32:47 <Darkebrz> Oh
P9:32:48 <Darkebrz> Well
P9:32:49 <vede> No track.
P9:32:53 <vede> Just a big rectangle map.
P9:32:57 <Eagle> That's not nearly enough time
P9:33:02 <vede> With a single block of lava on one side.
P9:33:11 <vede> The whole point is that there's not much time.
P9:33:13 <Eagle> That's lag central
P9:33:15 <vede> It's very tense.
P9:33:18 <Darkebrz> Lol
P9:33:21 <vede> And it's not really all that laggy.
P9:33:27 <Darkebrz> Yes it is
P9:33:31 <vede> LilRobot did it and it was fine.
P9:33:37 <TheOne> sounds interesting
P9:33:40 <Eagle> In mine it would flow down a track and it would take maybe a minute, minute and a half, and then the server would flood
P9:33:41 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P9:33:44 <Darkebrz> I would like to try both
P9:33:52 <Darkebrz> TheOne: What size are your maps?
P9:34:05 <vede> They weren't "big" maps.
P9:34:11 <TheOne> 64x64x64 I don't dare go much bigger
P9:34:20 <Darkebrz> Well
P9:34:20 <vede> Just, say, 16x64x64 maybe.
P9:34:26 <Darkebrz> are you willing to share some?
P9:34:28 <Darkebrz> Woah
P9:34:33 <Darkebrz> 16x64x64 would suck
P9:34:37 <vede> Not really.
P9:34:40 <Darkebrz> Fucking small as shit
P9:34:47 <vede> Maybe a bit longer, but it was really fun.
P9:34:54 <Darkebrz> Wait
P9:34:55 <vede> Or a bit taller.
P9:34:59 <TheOne> I have 2 I'll share
P9:34:59 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P9:35:07 <Darkebrz> Okay
P9:35:07 <Darkebrz> Thanks
P9:35:10 <Darkebrz> Visiiri
P9:35:18 <Darkebrz> vede: It was probably 64x64x64
P9:35:34 <vede> No.
P9:35:40 <vede> It was distinctively rectangular.
P9:35:43 <vede> I assure you.
P9:35:47 <Darkebrz> Then 32x64x64
P9:35:57 <vede> Definitely not that wide.
P9:36:05 <vede> It was very thin.

P9:59:07 <Eagle> achoo
P9:59:08 <Real> i know not of what you speak

P9:59:22 <Eagle> To them it looked like you quit
13P9:59:36 * TheOne *thunder, thunder everywhere...*
P9:59:46 <Real> an illusion, interesting
P9:59:52 <Super-Dot> Imagine the Earth splitting along the equator to become two planets
P9:59:59 <Visiiri> it'd be epic
P10:00:04 <Super-Dot> Now imagine the same but on a smaller scale and much less awesome
P10:00:04 <Visiiri> but then gravity would hit
P10:00:07 <Real> most life would die
P10:00:08 <Darkebrz> Back
P10:00:10 <Visiiri> and they would collide
P10:00:13 <Eagle> Lava in space
P10:00:16 <Visiiri> and the water would all bounce
P10:00:21 <Darkebrz> Meh
P10:00:21 <Visiiri> the ecosystems would change
P10:00:25 <Darkebrz> The netsplit d/ced me
P10:00:27 <Visiiri> dinosaurs would be born again
P10:00:28 <triddin> so dark, is this just being setup?
P10:00:30 <Darkebrz> Visiiri: Is it almost up?
P10:00:33 <Visiiri> a glacier would hit mexico
P10:00:35 <Visiiri> yeah
P10:00:35 <Darkebrz> Is what being setup?
P10:00:36 <Visiiri> it was up

P10:01:05 <triddin> or has it been griefed?
P10:01:17 <Darkebrz> It has been griefed
P10:01:22 <Visiiri> then lightning storms will hit low things
P10:01:32 <Visiiri> so everyone rushes to the mountains
P10:01:39 <Visiiri> then giant ninjas start eating them
P10:01:54 <Darkebrz> And I dont give a shit
P10:01:55 <Real> time would not progress
P10:02:05 <Real> split = no spin
P10:02:18 <Real> then there's the moon to factor in
P10:02:21 <Visiiri> half of the world would freeze
P10:02:27 <Visiiri> the moon would crash in the ocean
P10:02:32 <Visiiri> and become a spot for tourists
P10:02:46 <Visiiri> the man on it would drown
P10:03:01 <Real> anything flying at the time of the split would probably crash or sail into space
P10:03:04 <Eagle> That'd be one huge tidal wave
P10:03:10 <Visiiri> Yeah
P10:03:12 <Eagle> If the moon crashed into the ocean
P10:03:15 <Visiiri> but they'd only be wet for a while
P10:03:19 <triddin> nobody like their server griefed though
P10:03:20 <Visiiri> lol
P10:03:21 <Eagle> because they'd be dead
P10:03:23 <Visiiri> tidal wave is a pwn
P10:03:27 <Visiiri> total pun
P10:03:29 <Visiiri> **pun
P10:03:40 <Visiiri> because tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon

P10:03:54 <Visiiri> fuckink
P10:03:58 <Visiiri> wink
P10:04:01 <Real> it would be a tsunami not a tidal wave
P10:04:05 <Real> calm down
P10:04:09 <Visiiri> Exactly why it's a pun
P10:04:21 <Real> that is not a pun
P10:04:22 <Visiiri> because it was caused by the gravitational pull of the moon :D
P10:04:26 <Eagle> Real, you're right. :P
P10:04:31 <Visiiri> It is a tsunami
P10:04:32 <Visiiri> I know that
P10:04:33 <Real> it may be ironic, but it is not a pun
P10:04:37 <Visiiri> but tides are fromt he moon
P10:04:42 <Visiiri> and the wave is fromt he moon having mass
P10:04:49 <Visiiri> it's a fucking pun

P10:05:04 <Real> that is not a pun. you must not know the definition of a pun.
P10:05:08 <Visiiri> Yeah
P10:05:15 <Visiiri> It's like being in a world of water
P10:05:20 <Visiiri> and saying "my head is swimming"
P10:05:22 <Visiiri> or whatever
P10:05:28 <Visiiri> the moon caused the tsunami
