A11:56:19 <TheOne> hi all
A11:56:37 <Cial> hello
A11:57:08 <mail2345> ehllo
A11:57:15 <TheOne> gte my memo?
A11:57:15 <mail2345> gonne fix that issue now
A11:57:16 <Eagle> vede
A11:57:18 <TheOne> get*
A11:57:20 <Eagle> why did you just leav
A11:57:21 <Eagle> *leave
A11:57:30 <vede> I was bored and annoyed.
A11:58:07 <TheOne> spent about 5 min trying to figure out why it didn't work for tyteen4a03
A11:58:14 <Eagle> annoyed at what?
A11:58:17 <Eagle> bored at what?
A11:58:19 <Eagle> we just started
A11:58:25 <vede> Everyone was just farming.
A11:58:29 <Eagle> TWO PEOPLE
A11:58:40 <vede> Everyone who was doing anything was just farming.
A11:58:46 <Eagle> WE JUST STARTED
A11:58:47 <AlexVMiner> ...
A11:59:06 <mail2345> agh
A11:59:11 <mail2345> grifefers make me so angry
A11:59:15 <Eagle> vede that only serves to reinforce that you only look at something for like two minutes and say "IT'S CRAP"
A11:59:22 <mail2345> not their just their actions
A11:59:25 <mail2345> but their attitude
A11:59:28 <Eagle> we were arguing about that last week
A11:59:32 <vede> So... obviously when the game has just started, you should only farm and do pointless crap.
A11:59:35 <Marach> vede!
A11:59:35 <mail2345> which shows a degration of culture
A11:59:43 <Marach> ARGH
A11:59:52 <Eagle> vede we were just screwing around and thirty seconds later you say YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DONE
A11:59:54 <vede> I much prefer Wolfhunt when people actually play the game.
P12:00:05 <Eagle> Guess what we're doing now
P12:00:09 <Eagle> It's Night 1
P12:00:12 <mail2345> see they understand that
P12:00:19 <mail2345> griefing drains time from others
P12:00:34 <mail2345> but they don't care
P12:00:44 <mail2345> this reflects on them irl
P12:00:51 <mail2345> and the sheer number of griefers
10P12:01:19 * TheOne is now known as TheOne-AFK
P12:01:29 <mail2345> leads me to belive that there are a large porporton of people who are that selfish
P12:01:35 <mail2345> and acknolage it
P12:01:39 <mail2345> and don't give a shit

13P12:44:24 * mail2345 totaly forgot what he was supposted to be working on
13P12:44:35 * asiekierka is supposed to be adding PNG loading support to his JTE fork
13P12:44:58 * mail2345 remebers that he was supposted to be studying perl
13P12:45:27 * asiekierka notices someone here either got JTE's server, that is paid her a tenner, got it leaked, or entered a PIME TARADOX
13P12:45:38 * asiekierka notices it is mail2345
13P12:48:10 * mail2345 has a time machine
P12:48:15 <mail2345> i can do fun stuff with it
P12:48:22 <tyteen4a03> yay
P12:48:26 <asiekierka> *sigh*, everyone now considers me an attention whore
P12:48:26 <mail2345> later today I will send myself the server
P12:48:29 <asiekierka> just because i have a life
P12:48:45 <asiekierka> (Today: I'm off for 8 hours cuz i'm outta house)
P12:48:48 <asiekierka> (Comments:)
P12:48:50 <mail2345> and i will get some money from the futrure(billions of dollars)
P12:48:55 <mail2345> invest that
P12:49:01 <asiekierka> I think Asiekierka's doing this for attention. His server is down and he doesn't use an online/offline indicator, He won't update this enough, and it just seems like it won't happen.
P12:49:04 <asiekierka> by Skittles
P12:49:05 <mail2345> to get enough money to send back
P12:49:08 <mail2345> and done
P12:49:09 <mail2345> :D
P12:49:17 <asiekierka> My reply:
P12:49:18 <asiekierka> Yes. We already built a set and i have a life so i couldn't get it on for 8 hours. Nor am I now except if demand arises.
P12:49:18 <asiekierka> ...I said I have a life.
P12:49:18 <asiekierka> ...STOP LAUGHING!!!

P12:50:17 <Eagle> I went to prehistoric twice
P12:50:27 <Eagle> Also what happened to being able to choose?
P12:50:41 <Eagle> Or the whole "going to the future" part

P12:59:35 <liq3> TestDummy: what's inappropiet about crossing that boundry?
P1:00:03 <xXtyskenXx> Im 12
P1:00:03 <TestDummy> I would never consider talking about such an adult topic with an instructor to be appropriate.
P1:00:07 <TestDummy> I just don't see where it would be.
P1:00:12 <TestDummy> ESPECIALLY considering your age.
P1:00:18 <xXtyskenXx> :)
P1:00:32 <TestDummy> We've had people like Letourneau because of this.
P1:00:50 <TestDummy> Which come to think of it, was before you were born.

P1:01:33 <Marach> lol
P1:01:33 <xXtyskenXx> suprise buttsecks
P1:01:51 <liq3> TestDummy: but what's inappropriate about it?
P1:02:35 <TestDummy> I don't see why it isn't obvious.
P1:02:44 <TestDummy> I shouldn't have to point it out.
P1:03:04 <liq3> You're still avoiding answering the question. :]
P1:03:06 <flyboy> Go ahed
P1:03:15 <flyboy> Pretend that we don't get it
12P1:03:16 * Hideous (Hideous@81-224-198-214-no30.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
P1:03:38 <liq3> Actually, I really don't get it.
P1:03:39 <TestDummy> Allow me to rephrase it in a way that makes it easier to digest: Anybody under 18 in here, unless they've been emancipated is according to the system, a child.
P1:03:48 <flyboy> And...
10P1:03:51 * Quatroking (Quatroking@86.90.159.252) has joined #minecraft
P1:03:53 <Marach> i love the wtfness of isometric graphics
P1:03:55 <TestDummy> Children and adults shouldn't be discussing such things.
P1:03:58 <flyboy> Conversation is rape now?
P1:03:59 <liq3> Why not?
P1:04:04 <TestDummy> Let along a teacher and a student.
P1:04:12 <xXtyskenXx> dude
P1:04:12 <liq3> You still haven't given any reasons.
P1:04:15 <xXtyskenXx> I live in sweden...
P1:04:21 <xXtyskenXx> badabish
P1:04:32 <Quatroking> Hey guys, I just released a skin: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=22865#p22865
P1:04:36 <flyboy> So hang on, you shouldn't be open with people that have wisdom and experience?
P1:04:54 <xXtyskenXx> also its just porn
P1:04:55 <TestDummy> So, the Swedes are the trendsetters when it comes to pushing the envelope?
P1:05:08 <flyboy> So it's innapropriate for your parents to have "the talk" with you?
P1:05:10 <offset> I think you'll find it's still highly illegal
P1:05:11 <TestDummy> LOL LIBERALS
P1:05:21 <liq3> offset: what's illegal?
P1:05:21 <flyboy> Bullshit
P1:05:32 <mail2345> haha first politcal debate i have seen here
P1:05:32 <TestDummy> It probably isn't in Sweden.
P1:05:32 <mail2345> :D
P1:05:40 <TestDummy> You could fuck a moose and they'd endorse it.
P1:05:40 <mail2345> well
P1:05:43 <liq3> mail2345: this is political?
P1:05:45 <mail2345> closest liberal
P1:05:46 <Quatroking> mail2345, first? lol
P1:05:47 <mail2345> dammit
P1:05:51 <offset> A gym teacher telling a 12 year old about personal experiences, ect -- it's trouble
P1:05:52 <mail2345> i get words mixed up
P1:05:57 <mail2345> closest to politcial
P1:05:58 <xXtyskenXx> wtf
P1:06:09 <Quatroking> offset, is the gym teacher a woman
P1:06:09 <liq3> TestDummy: You still haven't said why it's inappropriate.
P1:06:18 <TestDummy> offset pretty much said it for me.

P1:06:19 <xXtyskenXx> stop being a bitch and accept the awesomeness of the situation
P1:06:21 <mail2345> most of the time it seems like vede and liq debating over some random thing
P1:06:25 <liq3> Quatroking: lesbian.
P1:06:33 <Quatroking> cupsize?
P1:06:46 <flyboy> Butch or Fem?
P1:06:47 <liq3> offset: why?
P1:07:06 <flyboy> Quatro:That's innapropriate
P1:07:13 <flyboy> ;)
P1:07:23 <offset> I didn't make the rules, it's just considered wrong
P1:07:25 <Quatroking> why is it innapropriate for people to have a cupsize
P1:07:27 <TestDummy> So, in advance, I have to apoligise if I find something wrong about it.
P1:07:41 <liq3> Dunno why you're apologizing.
P1:07:43 <Quatroking> i prefer a double C or a D over a nothing, honestly
P1:07:53 <TestDummy> About a teacher and an underage student discussing something of that sort.
P1:07:56 <flyboy> I'm not a fan of big ones really.
P1:08:03 <TestDummy> I guess in Europe this sort of thing is okay.
P1:08:06 <liq3> TestDummy: underage is a human construct. :]
P1:08:11 <TestDummy> But I don't live in Europe, now do I?
P1:08:27 <Quatroking> flyboy: I like them handful
P1:08:29 <liq3> TestDummy: You still haven't given a reason. :P
P1:08:32 <Quatroking> is the student a guy or a gal?
P1:08:34 <TestDummy> I don't need to.
P1:08:36 <flyboy> Fair enough
P1:08:38 <xXtyskenXx> Im a guy
P1:08:40 <liq3> And offset's isn't complete.
P1:08:52 <liq3> TestDummy: Yeh, you don't have to. I'd like it if you did tho. :]
