A12:42:01 <YQM> Anyone know about the sand bug?
A12:42:15 <YQM> I'd post it on the forums but it has huge potential for abuse :X
A12:42:24 <kryptn> What is it?
A12:42:32 <YQM> It moves water up..
A12:42:46 <kryptn> seriously?  i wanna try that :D
A12:42:55 <YQM> ill send you a pm
A12:43:14 <potato> oh
A12:43:21 <potato> it only works in single player
A12:43:58 <YQM> really?
A12:44:03 <potato> yep
A12:44:06 <YQM> Multiplayer seems to be broken atm

A12:56:09 <JTE> mew.
A12:56:23 <kryptn> hi there.
A12:56:42 <JTE> Everyone knows about the sand bug, and it doesn't work in multiplayer because the official server was never updated with the new code for it
A12:56:57 <JTE> So sand only properly falls through water on JTE's server.
A12:58:01 <JTE> On JTE's server, it falls through anything non-solid and turns where it was into air, entering water, crushing flowers, etc. :3
A12:58:57 <kryptn> ah, cool
A12:59:14 <kryptn> so just a temporary fun thing to exploit on single player
A1:00:50 <JTE> It's useful to use for intentionally bringing water up a pipe to higher platforms, for floating islands and such. :P
A1:01:12 <JTE> You'd better make use of it soon, Notch is already intent on fixing it.
A1:01:29 <JTE> next client update.
A1:01:38 <kryptn> haha, i dont do much with single player.

A1:04:11 <JTE> Hi. :3
A1:06:16 <vdgmprgrmr> What is your server, JTE?
A1:09:15 <JTE> My server is the JTE's AWESOME Custom Server server.
A1:14:40 <YQM> yeah tried it in multi. I made a custom map that is exactly a normal map + little cages of water and lava in the sky
A1:14:49 <YQM> cause sky castles need moats too

A1:30:09 <Super-Dot> JTE, you should make your sand act like REAL sand.
A1:30:17 <Super-Dot> Where it doesn't get stacked up in a pillar.
A1:30:18 <UnknownX> JTE when will your server be up?
A1:30:34 <UnknownX> just wait until finite water come out
A1:30:46 <UnknownX> then use that on the sand
A1:30:54 <UnknownX> but tweak it a little
A1:31:02 <JTE> Heh.

A1:40:34 <UnknownX>  /load
A1:41:07 <UnknownX>  /unloadtheload
A1:41:33 <JTE> JTE's server is down because it keeps getting attacked by 4chan-ians and somehow my simple timer code keeps getting caught in some weird loop where it keeps saving the map over and over and over again until I run out of memory. X_x;
A1:41:36 <Colain> JTE, don't make me cry :(
A1:41:38 <Colain> Oh.
A1:41:57 <Colain> so, you can't like, make it private?

A2:07:18 <Zuriki> Evidence?
A2:07:55 <JTE> My server keeps no logs, but I has a witness. :<

A2:13:54 <doohan> JTE is crazy
A2:14:01 <doohan> Just ignore him.
A2:14:04 <doohan> :P
A2:14:13 <Zuriki> Yeah, I think I will.
A2:14:28 <Zuriki> Personally, I think he should get out more or something.
A2:14:36 <Zuriki> Cause he seems like he has no friends.
A2:15:04 <doohan> He does refer to himself in hte 3rd person.
A2:15:51 <Zuriki> Stemming from his desire to be known by people perhaps?
A2:16:05 <Zuriki> So he pretends that people are talking about him and praising him.
A2:16:31 <Zuriki> That or he's got some personality disorder.
A2:17:07 <kryptn> Zuriki: sometimes 4chan can be brilliant.
A2:17:19 <Zuriki> Sometimes*
A2:17:26 <Zuriki> *Almost never
A2:17:28 <kryptn> Yes, sometimes
A2:17:51 <kryptn> the Time most influential person vote rigging?
A2:18:04 <Zuriki> No matter. What they are bad, outweighs what they are good.
A2:18:30 <Zuriki> I personally didn't find that amusing.
A2:18:46 <kryptn> i found it ironic.
A2:19:01 <kryptn> and very fitting.
A2:19:47 <kryptn> though moot was not directly responsible for doing the vote rigging, the fact that he created 4chan in the first place led to the creation of the group Anonymous.
A2:20:02 <kryptn> and this group found the need to promote moot on the Time election
A2:20:17 <kryptn> Not only that, but also to make an acronym too.
A2:20:23 <Zuriki> It was some undue ego boost to some dork who locked himself in a basement and birthed a somewhat prejudice, sadist and sick community of fuckbags.
A2:20:34 <kryptn> Influential if you ask me.
A2:20:40 <kryptn> only /b/ is really fucked up.
A2:20:50 <Zuriki> All of 4chan is fucked up.
A2:21:26 <kryptn> Have you spent a whole day on 4chan?
A2:21:35 <Zuriki> There have only been some rare cases I have visited there. And most of them are to offend people by proxy.
A2:22:10 <kryptn> most of the time you only hear about /b/.
A2:22:21 <kryptn> that's where anonymous is

A2:24:00 <kryptn> (sorry about that)
A2:24:03 <Zuriki> I only found out when on 4chan text me and told me to check it out.
A2:24:15 <Zuriki> So I gave them his home address and phone number.
A2:24:16 <kryptn> ah
A2:24:55 <Zuriki> It goes both ways. And as much as I hate his guts, I'd never do anything like what he did without due cause.
A2:24:57 <kryptn> lol.
A2:25:03 <Super-Dot> Zuriki said even more bad things about JTE D:

A2:26:55 <Zuriki> That's an honest judgment based on what he's said to me.
A2:26:57 <Super-Dot> I consider myself to be his friend, incidentally
A2:27:06 <kryptn> When something is morally wrong and it finds its way into 4chan's /b/, most of the time they will play internet detective and set it right.

A2:29:10 <Zuriki> I saw a cat skinned alive.
A2:29:12 <Zuriki> :(
A2:29:28 <kryptn> so both of them together managed to find out who these two guys were

A2:29:47 <kryptn> they got arrested.

A3:06:34 <Zuriki> Wait for Lua.
A3:06:49 <kryptn> fair enough
A3:07:12 <Zuriki> I have fears about this Lua system.
A3:07:21 <Zuriki> That it will change the game too much.
A3:07:53 <kryptn> That'll probably depend on how extensive the api is
A3:08:13 <Zuriki> Mm
A3:08:41 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm perfectly okay with modding support.
A3:08:49 <kryptn> I'd like to have tools to actually build and form a map from scratch
A3:09:00 <vdgmprgrmr> But I do think the server list should have two different menus.
A3:09:07 <vdgmprgrmr> One for vanilla and one for modded servers.
A3:09:14 <kryptn> Yea.
A3:09:34 <Colain> I'm scared of new game modes...
A3:09:43 <kryptn> If you can make the map within the game, there's not much real need for map editors.
A3:09:56 <Colain> How'd you play on one server which does all game modes and how will you know when really?
A3:09:58 <kryptn> That, and it can be a whole 'nother thing to do past building
A3:10:33 <Zuriki> I look forward to Survival mode.
A3:10:35 <vdgmprgrmr> What are you saying, Colain?
A3:10:44 <Zuriki> But I feel user made modes are going to suck,
A3:10:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Not all of them, I'm sure.
A3:10:59 <kryptn> You dont have to play them, Zuriki 
A3:11:05 <Zuriki> I know.
A3:11:11 <Zuriki> But I'll want to sample
A3:11:15 <kryptn> lol.
A3:11:19 <Zuriki> Cause I know there will be good ones.
A3:11:30 <Zuriki> But I know also there will be lots of bad ones.
A3:11:37 <kryptn> I personally havent even tried any other type of mode
A3:11:45 <kryptn> havent played any of the games
A3:11:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Thus you use the filter that is people.
A3:11:56 <Adura> I've enjoyed flood control on Jetty's server.

A3:28:13 <Colain> odd, I seem to be great with girls, its so freaky
A3:28:24 <Zuriki> Are you secretly gay?
A3:28:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Online girlfriends... I don't think that's something I could muster.
A3:28:27 <Colain> Then again, Real life, 5 girls, 5 weks.
A3:28:40 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm actually pretty great with girls too.
A3:28:43 <Colain> vdg, its amazing...
A3:28:54 <Colain> Online its like...
A3:28:55 <Colain> Well..
A3:28:57 <Tripknotix> online girls is like porn
A3:29:03 <Tripknotix> its about the same
A3:29:13 <Colain> It's dating a girl without the needyness
A3:29:16 <Tripknotix> atleast ur learning about them, but they arent anything like they are irl
A3:29:24 <Colain> It's were they're more open
A3:29:30 <Tripknotix> pffft im in california, every girl here is spoiled
A3:29:35 <Tripknotix> or stuck up, or a btich, or a slut
A3:29:45 <Tripknotix> except my gf =D, ok and maybe a few thousand other girls -_- but they arent pretty =)
A3:29:48 <Colain> And you can have sex with them without them being insecure about their appearence :D
A3:29:59 <Colain> Haha trip

A3:30:09 <Colain> I'm in New Zealand. Whores galore
A3:30:12 <Colain> Er, not really
A3:30:14 <vdgmprgrmr> It's like... well... they're less of a person and more of an object. I've noticed this with all online people. Talking with a person IRL is far different from online messages.
A3:30:48 <Zuriki> Im a big burly manbeast
A3:31:02 <Zuriki> D:<
A3:31:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I've found that when I think about people I know online, I think about things like "did this" or "is against/for x" whereas with people in "real life" I tend to think about personality traits.
A3:31:34 <Colain> Scrawny kid here.
A3:32:01 <Colain> I get with girls in internet because of who they are, girls in real life its more how hot they are
A3:32:32 <vdgmprgrmr> I would say "that's odd" but I guess it's actually not.
A3:32:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Hm, it's odd to me.
A3:33:07 <Tripknotix> Colain new zealand is a great palce, how old are u, i know a girl in nz, 25
A3:33:08 <Zuriki> I'm not really a big burly manbeast.
A3:33:12 <Zuriki> :3
A3:33:17 <Zuriki> I'm just bored.
A3:33:26 <Colain> Well, I don't see the girls I get online, which makes me closer
A3:33:41 <Colain> I'm 14, shes 11 years older...
A3:33:44 <Tripknotix> yikes
A3:33:50 <Zuriki> 11 years...
A3:33:58 <Colain> Yeah, I don't think I can meet this chick you know Trip
A3:34:02 <Colain> Unless it's friendly
A3:34:07 <Zuriki> :3
A3:34:13 <vdgmprgrmr> My only girlfriend ever I actually "got with" because we started talking and I discovered that she is also a "computer person" and is a hobbyist programmer.
A3:34:16 <Zuriki> I'm 16 and I fancied someone 21
A3:34:19 <Zuriki> Still do
A3:34:26 <Zuriki> But we keep it friendly.
A3:34:27 <Tripknotix> well colain not all girls are sluts out there ,youve got alot of computer chicks that dont socialize, those are the best ones, they will clean ur house, do the dishes, and wont talk back often, ... no offense.. but its called small country syndrome, if i remember correctly
A3:34:30 <Zuriki> With a little teasing.
A3:35:24 <Colain> shes gonna go into her room and read her porn apparently.
A3:35:34 <Zuriki> Read porn?
A3:35:41 <Zuriki> Get with the times.
A3:35:47 <vdgmprgrmr> If course, she was so totally against any form of debate and I was FAR too straight-forward for her to deal with.
A3:35:55 <Colain> It's a book she likes, it has sex in it though
A3:36:08 <Zuriki> Oh I see.
A3:36:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Not porn.
A3:36:16 <Colain> Hehe.
A3:36:27 <Colain> some vampire one, obviously
A3:36:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless it's seriously textual porn. Which is nice occasionally.
A3:36:49 <vdgmprgrmr>  >.>
A3:36:56 <Zuriki> Ok I've decided.
A3:37:07 <Zuriki> I'm going into city center on Sat alone.
A3:37:10 <Zuriki> With a sign
A3:37:18 <Zuriki> Saying "Talk to me please"
A3:37:27 <Zuriki> Then gonna have a sad face like :<
A3:37:35 <Colain> lol
A3:37:40 <Zuriki> And hope someone smexy talks to me
A3:37:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Where did "smexy" come from?
A3:37:52 <Zuriki> Then I'll buy them a muffin and a hot coffee.

A3:38:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Honestly, "smexy" actually sounds like a word that would be applied to someone who was just downright disgusting.
A3:38:23 <Zuriki> sexy
A3:38:25 <Zuriki> It means.
A3:38:27 <Zuriki> XD
A3:38:27 <Colain> I was talking to the chick that I've been talking with and talking about here and she's reading this vampire book with sex in it
A3:38:35 <Colain> I had a good idea :D
A3:38:55 <vdgmprgrmr> No.
A3:39:11 <Colain> Get my school reading it by giving it to one girl, the whole school, and guys will come up to me "Hey Luke, thanks for getting <insert name> horny"
A3:39:26 <Zuriki> No.
A3:39:38 <Colain> And i'd be like "Thanks, but, they might be thinking of edward or some other random vampire from the book" :D
A3:39:59 <Colain> Edward or the vampires from the book they have... I mean
A3:40:01 <vdgmprgrmr> If you're talking about fucking Twilight, there's a few problems.
A3:40:05 <Zuriki> You'll get "What the fuck you sick pervert why are you giving me this book you pscho"
A3:40:07 <Colain> Edward that "Twilight" guy
A3:40:16 <Zuriki> psycho*
A3:40:21 <Zuriki> Twilight sucks.
A3:40:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Problem number 1: Twilight sucks too much ass to try to spread around.
A3:40:38 <Colain> I wouldn't ^_^ I got everyone in the class reading a sex scene from a book once
A3:40:42 <Colain> Even the teacher
A3:40:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Problem number 2: Twilight's already immensely popular.
A3:40:48 <Colain> I hate Twilight
A3:41:00 <Zuriki> Your best bet is
A3:41:08 <Zuriki> To sit between 2 hot girls
A3:41:13 <Colain> But I mean another book, but all the girls already like twilight... both books are about vampires so they'd <3 the other bookk.
A3:41:17 <Zuriki> And flirt with them both
A3:41:19 <Zuriki> :3
A3:41:24 <Colain> Haha, nah.
A3:41:41 <Colain> I'm after one girl and I'm gonna stick at trying to break into... her
A3:41:41 <Zuriki> A little bit of ass pinching goes a long way.
A3:41:49 <Colain> I mean that in a non-sexual way by the way.
A3:41:53 <Zuriki> :3
A3:41:54 <Zuriki> Pop
A3:42:22 <vdgmprgrmr> In my experience, most girls will start to like people who have direct advice.
A3:42:27 <Colain> Zuriki, I'm a scrawny 14 year old teenager, they'd kick me in the nuts and seeing as they're from New Zealand, twist my arm behind my back and smash me into the ground
A3:42:41 <Zuriki> o.o
A3:42:47 <Zuriki> Don't scare me like that
A3:42:53 <vdgmprgrmr> That's some hardcore shit, man.
A3:43:00 <Zuriki> I'm going to Australia which isn't far from New Zealand.
A3:43:00 <Colain> And trust me.... their twist arms behind the back and thrusts into the ground hurts
A3:43:11 <Colain> >: ( I hate you zuriki
A3:43:15 <Zuriki> Why
A3:43:27 <Colain> As vdg knows, I'm slightly racist only to Australians
A3:43:33 <Colain> Like every other New Zealand
A3:43:34 <Colain> er
A3:43:38 <Zuriki> I'm not Australian :3
A3:43:44 <Colain> I know
A3:43:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't think I could ever go to Awstrayleeuh.
A3:43:55 <Zuriki> Whhhhhhhhhy
A3:44:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Too hot.
A3:44:10 <Adura> With the gov't being anti-internet, I'd avoid Aus.
A3:44:16 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, it's not racism if it's based on nationality.
A3:44:18 <Zuriki> Colain, you couldn't hold a grudge on me ;)
A3:44:31 <Colain> Touche vdg
A3:44:40 <vdgmprgrmr> Could prolly never go to Noo Zeelind either.
A3:44:40 <Adura> I'd also avoid Germany.
A3:44:43 <Colain> I could if you moved to Australia >: (
A3:44:51 <Zuriki> Nope.
A3:45:01 <Zuriki> I could make you forgive me :)
A3:45:06 <Colain> we're happy without you cdg
A3:45:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Is it common for New Zealanders to dislike Australians?
A3:45:22 <Colain> You could never unless your a hot girl zuriki

A4:47:09 <Notch> yeah, he said he's intentionally trying to leech off minecraft's popularity
A4:47:11 <Colain> And vdg, learn that your not exsistant when a two-way convosation is on :P
A4:47:22 <vdgmprgrmr> No I'm not!
A4:47:27 <Colain> Leech of Minecraft's popularity?
A4:47:31 <vdgmprgrmr> I never cease my existence!
A4:47:45 <Notch> yeah, something like that.
A4:47:51 <Notch> but nevermind. =)
A4:48:01 <Colain> He merely runs a server completely codeed by him, except for maybe the acutal Minecraft non-multiplayer parts.
13A4:48:04 * Notch is going to malmö!
A4:48:38 <vdgmprgrmr> It almost seems like he's one-upping Notch with his uber-server to me.
A4:48:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Which is mean.
A4:49:04 <Notch> sure, yes. But if he turns it into his own game that runs on the client I wrote, and gets people because of the popularity minecraft has, it's not really doing things in a nice way
A4:49:07 <Colain> I think all he wants to do is customise the game a little for his own wants without trying to do it.
A4:49:23 <Notch> that would be fine, colain. I have no problem with that part. =)
A4:49:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, without trying to do it?
A4:49:30 <Notch> it's just his attitude about it that's bothered me.
A4:49:45 <Colain> Yes Notch, your right, but if he does make the client, it's copyright.
A4:49:47 <Notch> it's like he's trying to compete instead of just doing cool stuff
A4:49:51 <Colain> Infringement*
A4:49:54 <Notch> but things are getting better :D
A4:50:01 <Colain> Wow, I never heard of that part to it Notch.
A4:50:17 <Notch> what part? 
A4:50:39 <Colain> The attitude
A4:50:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I was on a server today and someone was talking about releasing a download for a client they made. >.>
A4:51:01 <Colain> See, I was first involved in an agruement that I didn't quite understand, then I went and checked out the server, it seemed just normal
A4:51:03 <Notch> i think it's just a misunderstanding actually
A4:51:12 <Notch> he seems to be a good guy. =)
A4:51:20 <Colain> yeah, he's really nice
A4:51:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I think it'd be cool to make a server mod with fireworks...
A4:51:48 <Colain> I came onto his server said "Oh yeah, just checking out servers to see if I'll film them for a project, heard yours was great"
A4:52:25 <Colain> Due to reading about it I said "Oh yeah can I see dynamite in action" and I was instantly oped when I meant him showing himself
A4:52:34 <Colain> But he seems really nice.
A4:52:48 <vdgmprgrmr> So I told they guy who was talking about releasing his homemade client and he was all like "Will lucky for me I'm a big boy and can make my own decisions." and I was all like "..."
A4:53:15 <vdgmprgrmr> *told him about you saying you were against distribution of custom clients/servers

A4:56:42 <Notch> if you're using my art for cool things, you can and probably will get special permission from me, if you want to be legal. =)
A4:56:43 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course.
A4:56:46 <Colain> Ah, a female, explains a lot Quatroking
A4:56:55 <Quatroking> Notch: Minepedia logo uses your textures
A4:57:09 <Notch> that's fine. =)

A4:58:34 <Notch> actually, I'm overweight, balding and bearded :D

A4:58:48 <Quatroking> hold on vdgmprgrmr, I'll get you a pic
A4:58:50 <citricsquid> beards make everything better

A4:59:25 <Colain> I'm into overweight balding bearded like 20 years older men.
A4:59:33 <citricsquid> Anyone can have a beard and they're instantly awesome and forgiven of anything crap. 
A4:59:40 <Colain> Well, not really, due to straightness.
A4:59:43 <Quatroking> True dat

A5:00:16 <Quatroking> Santa Claus is based n it

A5:00:53 <Colain> lol@pic
A5:00:55 <Notch> my turn-offs are sanity
A5:01:00 <Quatroking> Notch: so... Ez is a horrific coded cheese with arkham influences?
A5:01:00 <Notch> it's a board game based on cthulian mythos
A5:01:04 <Colain> Yay! I'm in the running!
A5:01:12 <Quatroking> Good gd
A5:01:13 <Quatroking> god
A5:01:16 <Notch> oh yeah, also, they include elin.
A5:01:24 <Colain> Haha @ Quatrokin
A5:01:39 <Colain> Thats got to go on the Minepedia page for her.
A5:01:47 <citricsquid> does ez have a beard?

A5:01:58 <citricsquid> women suck :(
A5:02:05 <Quatroking> she has one between her legs :#
A5:02:06 <Notch> some do, and that's fine too. A bit creepy, but fine.

A5:02:10 <Quatroking> Don't tell her I said that

A5:02:49 <Notch> three full weeks of minecraft per week
A5:02:52 <Notch> err, DAYS
A5:02:55 <Quatroking> YES
A5:02:57 <Quatroking> YES
A5:02:57 <Notch> not weeks, that'd be very stressful
A5:02:58 <vdgmprgrmr> AW, damn.
A5:03:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Three weeks of minecraft per week...
A5:03:14 <Quatroking> AVERAGE HOURS A GAMER SPENDS BEHIND HIS PC: 32 HOURS A DAY
A5:03:14 <Colain> Whats the next Minecraft update Notch? Can you slip it?
A5:03:15 <vdgmprgrmr> That's like, fractal minecraft.
A5:03:48 <vdgmprgrmr> You'd theoretically have MC at the final version and it'd be old enough to be freeware in less then a second.
A5:03:55 <Notch> colain: The next update will probably be an early test of singleplayer survival mode for premium players only
A5:03:59 <vdgmprgrmr> And that'd be super duper sveet.
A5:04:04 <Quatroking> BAWWW
A5:04:06 <Quatroking> AWESOME

A5:04:30 <peerkoel> need ... make ... coffee ....
A5:04:30 <Colain> And I didn't even need to pay :D
A5:04:32 <Notch> i'm not sure.. It depends on how much stuff happens.
A5:04:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah Notch I have a request.
A5:04:42 <Quatroking> I'm premium and I didn't notice I paid
A5:04:42 <Notch> =D
A5:04:52 <Colain> My friend bought it, saved me like 7 New Zealand dollars :D
A5:05:13 <Colain> canyouhavemybabiesnotch?
A5:05:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Do you have any MC versions that still have the level-in-the-sky and the older level generator?
A5:05:26 <Quatroking> I'll make him have my babies
A5:05:31 <Quatroking> hmp hump
A5:05:33 <Quatroking> hump
A5:05:35 <Quatroking> hump hump
A5:05:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I've been getting nostalgia for the level-in-the-sky, and for the MASSIVE cliffs it could make.
A5:06:05 <Notch> vd ( no tab completion here..): Yes, well, but it doesn't work with the new file format and so. And it probably won't compile, haha
A5:06:18 <Notch> but those level types will be possible later on. =)
A5:06:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Doesn't work with the new file format?
A5:06:19 <Quatroking> Hey Notch, using LUA, will it be possible to make something like a Spacebuild mode?
A5:06:27 <Notch> spacebuild?
A5:06:29 <Quatroking> with planets, areas with no gravity at all
A5:06:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh, I see.
A5:06:39 <vdgmprgrmr> New level file format...
A5:06:49 <Notch> oh, I don't think that'll be very easy to do, no
A5:07:00 <Colain> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5SUiTMnoqo <- Notch is on there... with Yellow name :O
A5:07:02 <Quatroking> Not even simple gravity modification?
A5:07:08 <vdgmprgrmr> It doesn't have to save the level...
A5:07:21 <citricsquid> "Special appearance"? Haha.
A5:07:22 <Notch> i'm not planning any gravity modification at all. It could be possible to add..
A5:07:43 <peerkoel> mining operations in space hmm
A5:07:45 <vdgmprgrmr> I've been pining to play, like, 0.0.11 again...
A5:07:46 <Colain> Notch, you kinda have the babies, I can't. I mean, take out some of the fat, should be room there for a baby.
A5:07:46 <Quatroking> It would be pretty awesome to be able to change that using LUA or something
A5:07:54 <peerkoel> sounds like a dilithium mine to me
A5:08:07 <Notch> lol, really?
A5:08:11 <vdgmprgrmr> srsly
A5:08:19 <Adura> Hah, vd.
A5:08:26 <Quatroking> we could simulate space a bit using air tiles with water-like specifications
A5:08:27 <citricsquid> Watching this video makes me laugh, it's like notch is an ingame celebrity, everyone follows him =o
A5:08:32 <Notch> what features do you miss?
A5:08:44 <Colain> Do you think, if we remove some fat, we can fit a baby there and still make Notch look the same?
A5:08:45 <Quatroking> so you could "fly" through space but still hvave some contrl
A5:08:55 <vdgmprgrmr> level-in-the-sky, insane level-gen, mostly.
A5:09:03 <vdgmprgrmr> It just had that raw feel to it.
A5:09:22 <vdgmprgrmr> And the lack of blocks to use encouraged making underground structures.

A5:20:54 <Colain> It's somewhat, short.
A5:20:55 <Quatroking> citricsquid: no its about a bearded dwarf who needs to collect his money (stolen by bandits ofc) before the train to Notch's Mega Saucefactory leaves
A5:21:12 <Notch> it might be a good idea to show a pic in order to raise my internet popularity. :D

A5:26:45 <Notch> so called "sheep-shaggers"
A5:26:47 <Quatroking> 120% ACCURATE

A5:27:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh.
A5:27:34 <vdgmprgrmr> That makes sense.
A5:27:39 <Colain> The name sheep shaggers indeed came from using Sheep intestines as condoms, due to latex not yet invented(?). True fact.

A5:33:07 <Colain> I'm going to need to shave next holidays :'(
A5:33:16 <Quatroking> he keeps pandas in his beard

A5:34:14 <vdgmprgrmr> I vote Mutton Chops for worst and friendly mutton chops for best.
A5:34:15 <Colain> infact, when they sent Notch into space, they needed to rename space to full, because of his beard
A5:34:28 <citricsquid> lmao
A5:34:42 <Quatroking> notch's beard gets fucking burnt from the rocket's engines
A5:35:07 <Quatroking> and produces so much CO2 that the entire environment collapses
A5:35:13 <Quatroking> WITHIN 5 MINUTES
A5:35:15 <Notch> haha
A5:35:27 <Quatroking> THANK YOU NOTCH FOR DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT

A5:35:40 <Colain> Notch's beard is the source of global warming, it blocks the glaciers in the south pole and warms them up.
A5:35:41 <Quatroking> he's still there

A5:54:32 <Quatroking> vdgmprgrmr: there's a freeware edition
A5:54:35 <postlogic> And it doesn't keep the colors you choose, for some odd reason.
A5:54:46 <Quatroking> the difference is no support for adobe plugins which you won't be using anyways

A6:04:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Hey Notch can we PLEASE get individual arm/leg textures?
A6:04:12 <Colain> Oh, I can't say it because he's not her :(
A6:04:35 <Colain> Hey Notch, can you come back from your dissappearnce?
A6:05:03 <Notch> huh? =D
A6:05:16 <vdgmprgrmr> My gangster skin is suffering from lack of tattoo-able arms.
A6:05:19 <citricsquid> notch is busy driving the train (he's multi talented)
A6:05:34 <Colain> Hehe.
A6:05:57 <Colain> Vdg, you can't be a gangster! Your too nerdy
A6:06:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Well I'm a gangster!
A6:06:09 <Colain> its like weird al's song, too white and nerdy...
A6:06:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Complete with lack of shirt and bling!
A6:06:18 <Colain> Link time.
A6:06:20 <Notch> yeah, the arm and leg textures should've been different
A6:06:25 <vdgmprgrmr> I can't link.
A6:06:29 <Notch> but now there are 900 skins with the old system
A6:06:36 <Colain> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw
A6:06:46 <citricsquid> This video is not available in your country due to copyright restrictions. 
A6:06:48 <Colain> NOTCH IS TALKING :D
A6:06:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well obviously you should make it so that you can use either the old system or the new system for skins.
A6:07:00 <citricsquid> Notch doesn't talk, talk notchs.
A6:07:04 <Notch> well, true. :D
A6:07:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Not sure how that would work, though...
A6:08:01 <Colain> Notch doesn't pay prostututes, prostotutes pay Notch.
A6:08:08 <Colain> Not that thats ever happened...
A6:08:10 <citricsquid> prostitutes*
A6:08:12 <Colain> Notch doesn'
A6:08:19 <Colain> t need prostitutes.
A6:08:28 <Colain> He's got a great husband
A6:08:32 <citricsquid> Notch doesn't have sex, sex has notch.
A6:08:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch doesn't pay for advertisement. Advertisers pay to advertise Notch.
A6:08:37 <Colain> Haha
A6:09:04 <Colain> Notch doesn't fit in box... Sorry, was there meant to be a moral?
A6:09:51 <d0ohan> Colain, that video on the notchs dev blog is cool
A6:09:58 <Colain> Thanks
A6:10:06 <d0ohan> That map has loads of cool stuff in it.
A6:10:12 <Colain> well, I can't take glory for it
A6:10:25 <Colain> Rodifan, (Whos helping me make Minecraft TV) filmed it
A6:10:28 <d0ohan> Some amazing buildings
A6:10:31 <Colain> I just showed Notch
A6:10:58 <Colain> I can't believe it though... Notch has a yellow name
A6:11:10 <Colain> When I saw that I almost jizzed in my pants

A6:11:17 <vdgmprgrmr> There.
A6:11:21 <vdgmprgrmr> My gangster skin.
A6:11:26 <Colain> Untill I got a blue name in JTE's server.
A6:11:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Except you can't see the earrings.
A6:11:46 <Colain> That's oddly, cool.
A6:12:13 <vdgmprgrmr> He has some gold earrings...
A6:12:34 <d0ohan> 931 purchases

A6:12:39 <Colain> >also guys, if someone calls you a boob, heres the perfect responce..
A6:12:42 <d0ohan> Will there be a party then?
A6:12:49 <Colain> "Least I can squeeze myself"
A6:12:52 <citricsquid> d0ohan: already arranged ;)
A6:12:59 <d0ohan> Yeah?
A6:13:10 <Colain> Does it involve sex with Notch, citric?
A6:13:13 <citricsquid> yes, just bring a party hat
A6:13:20 <Colain> :o
A6:13:23 <LKA> well this is a lovely context moment to wake up to
A6:13:28 <d0ohan> A hat themed orgy eh?
A6:13:30 <Colain> Thats it, I'm making a party hat...er hair, skin!
A6:13:56 <Colain> Except, I'm going to make it based on my blonde haired, pink shirt and purple pants charater
13A6:14:00 * vdgmprgrmr thinks preset character accessories would be cool.
13A6:14:17 * Colain thinks female skins would be better.
A6:14:29 <Adura> Bloobs?
A6:14:34 <d0ohan> If you set bits of the skin to transparent do those parts of the model appear transparent?
A6:14:47 <Colain> Actually, I was meant to do it eariler, so I shall
A6:14:57 <Colain> Just lower the hair and make boobies.
A6:15:02 <Colain> I can do that easy!
A6:15:21 <Colain> anyone here females?
A6:15:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Like, head-gear, back-gear.
A6:15:36 <vdgmprgrmr> (Hats, rifle-on-the-back.)
A6:15:49 <vdgmprgrmr> (Or shield-on-the-back, or sword-on-the-back.)
A6:15:55 <vdgmprgrmr> (Or both.)
A6:16:01 <vdgmprgrmr> (Or maybe some parentheses.)
A6:16:10 <Colain> Make it then VDG...
A6:16:19 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A6:16:27 <Colain> It might look like a picture on his back, at least it'll look coolish...
A6:16:32 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, like, additions to the actioal model.
A6:16:39 <vdgmprgrmr> *actual
A6:16:49 <vdgmprgrmr> At LEAST hats.
A6:16:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Back-gear can be achieved with the skin.
A6:17:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Hats, not so much.
A6:19:14 <d0ohan> Doesn't work
A6:19:29 <d0ohan> I was hoping I could have a arms, legs a head and no body.
A6:20:17 <postlogic> d0ohan: It would open up to people going invisible.
A6:20:30 <postlogic> Think of the griefing! Only empty names running around removing stuff.
A6:20:44 <d0ohan> Yeah that'd be so much harder to kick ban then....
A6:20:45 <d0ohan> :P
A6:22:54 <Colain> I'm about to test female skin
A6:23:15 <citricsquid> http://minecraftskins.net/preview/ :D

A6:26:32 <JTE> But it's fully automatic and client-side
A6:27:04 <Colain> Huh?
A6:27:06 <JTE> And I think it may be why color codes work in names in the first place, but I dunno
A6:29:22 <Notch> actually, it's the string printer code. =)
A6:29:46 <JTE> Ah. That essplains why it works in server name and motds.

A6:31:46 <Colain> Notch, you should make a female skin and make a checkbox to use it or not
A6:32:09 <Notch> how would it looks? breasts?
A6:32:30 <citricsquid> we need a party skin for when purchasers hits 1000 :D
A6:32:34 <vdgmprgrmr> I think a female MODEL would be better...
A6:32:43 <Malcovent> dont we all x_x! <3
A6:32:45 <Colain> Even if your not upgraded.
A6:32:52 <Colain> The breasts I'm working on
A6:32:56 <Notch> citricsquid: That might be this weekend :D
A6:33:05 <Notch> oic :D
A6:33:16 <citricsquid> Notch: You might miss it :O :(
A6:33:33 <JTE> A female MODEL? You silly.
13A6:33:41 * vdgmprgrmr suggests special firework blocks for 1000 sales day.
A6:34:01 <JTE> It would just have an extra rectangle box for the 'breasts' if that's what you're after. :|
A6:34:10 <Colain> I think I got breasts done
A6:34:16 <Siiseli> lololol boobs lolol :|
A6:34:29 <vdgmprgrmr> You place it, it automatically does the motions for fireworks.
A6:34:45 <citricsquid> it'd be cool to have a female version that walked differently :P
A6:34:48 <vdgmprgrmr> And changes color!
A6:34:51 <Colain> Having hair problems.
A6:35:22 <JTE> It would be cool to have joints so everyone doesn't run around like a robot. Meeh.
A6:35:43 <vdgmprgrmr> I've sorta grown attached to the roboticness of it.

A6:35:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Just like I've grown attached to the blockiness.
A6:36:07 <JTE> Heh.
A6:36:28 <JTE> And that's why the first skins on minecraftskins.net should've been Cave Story-themed. :3
A6:36:43 <JTE> Robots~
A6:36:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, I've even started to think that there shouldn't even be slope blocks.
A6:37:14 <Colain> I see a floor in my plan.
A6:38:03 <Colain> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Colain Hmmm.
A6:38:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah, something from earlier, Notch: I suggest that EVERYTHING except for things like flowers be blocks.
A6:38:39 <vdgmprgrmr> So a vase would be a vase-textured block.
A6:38:48 <Adura> I think notch is pretty intent on not making more detailed blocks.
A6:38:56 <vdgmprgrmr> And a wheel would be a wheel-textured block.
A6:39:21 <vdgmprgrmr> (For example.)
A6:39:41 <Malcovent> i think the low-detail blocks look nice x_x
A6:39:45 <Malcovent> too much detail would ruin big stuctures.
A6:39:56 <Colain> guys, the skin?
A6:39:59 <vdgmprgrmr> I think seeing block versions of normal objects would really add to the theme.
A6:40:01 <JTE> JTE would like different sized and rotated blocks, but nah, not a priority...
A6:40:08 <JTE> Colain: Looks like a monkey. :3
A6:40:16 <Malcovent> looks erm.. interesting
A6:40:22 <Malcovent> kind of cross-dresser'like x_x

A6:41:12 <Malcovent> its frowned upon by girlfriends and mothers alike...
A6:41:14 <Colain> sexist pigs.

A6:43:16 <Malcovent> alternatively, if theres a dangerous animal
A6:43:18 <JTE> Malcovent: Spike blocks! >:3
A6:43:22 <Malcovent> have the spleef version of maze, with dangerous animals in!

A6:55:12 <Malcovent> that would make a really interesting survival mode.

A8:12:00 <peerkoel> it is very good game yes!
A8:12:20 <Notch> I'm not entirely sure, actually.. I'm trying to do something that makes sense in the new economy
A8:12:34 <Notch> it's somewhere in between
A8:12:38 <citricsquid> It counts as goods in Paypals eyes
A8:12:55 <peerkoel> imho a service is something someone does or performs for you, a good is something of value
A8:12:56 <Notch> i think good is the better fitting description
A8:13:01 <peerkoel> so I'd say pre-order is a good
A8:13:16 <chrstfer> ok. 
A8:13:18 <Notch> goods?
A8:13:30 <citricsquid> It's the same way steam is goods, even though you don't have physical access. 
A8:13:38 <Notch> but it's digital distribution.. how does steam classify their service? does anyone know?
A8:13:46 <chrstfer> notch u should try to get on xfire
A8:13:48 <citricsquid> I'll check, it'll say I think
A8:14:54 <Notch> I'd love to get on steam, actually :D
A8:15:27 <chrstfer> i guess. xfire tracks usage of the game, so its easier
A8:15:32 <chrstfer> or Both!
A8:15:43 <citricsquid> If it was on steam, xfire would add it by default.
A8:15:48 <ZomBuster> yuck xfire

A8:18:21 <Notch> ok, goods then =)
A8:19:18 <JTE> o.o Oh hai.
A8:19:19 <citricsquid> Yeah, just checked; payments sent as "service" don't have a quantity displayed, paying for a steam game displays a quantity, so I assume that means it's classed as goods. Probably an iffy area though.
A8:19:41 <Notch> yeah, it's really neither..
A8:19:48 <ZomBuster> software is an odd thing
A8:20:01 <Notch> I guess more clever people than I have thought about this though, and decided electronic stuff can be goods as well
A8:20:14 <ZomBuster> it takes work to make, but non to duplicate
A8:20:18 <Notch> and steam has the same system as me where you can download it over and over but need the account to play

A8:21:30 <netzero> Hey everyone
A8:22:27 <citricsquid> Maybe when the final game is released you could offer for an extra $ sum a "real life" copy of the client on a CD or something, that would make it goods with the option of downloading?

A8:32:36 <citricsquid> lobster_MB: You have a beard?!
A8:33:50 <chrstfer> NO. actually paypal does not convert credit card currency
A8:34:25 <chrstfer> they believe the card will already convert. which is why i cannot do it.
A8:34:46 <citricsquid> as far as I'm aware they have always converted to the currency of the account. if I send notch £10 it'll auto convert to euros because his account is configured with euros (I assume euros anyway)
A8:34:53 <chrstfer> what are you planning next, notch?
A8:35:26 <chrstfer> right, but thats not coming from your creditcard, and if it was, and if it was a gift card then no it wouldnt
A8:35:57 <citricsquid> Shall I phone them? :D
A8:36:13 <chrstfer> who?

A8:43:25 <peerkoel> mostly keeping the sound device open
A8:43:25 <netzero> Interesting, I've never noticed that at all. The only complaint I have on Ubuntu with it is that it takes a few clicks to get keyboard focus back
A8:43:26 <Notch> works for me, though, and always has. :-(
A8:44:03 <citricsquid> sound has always worked for me also =\
A8:44:18 <peerkoel> it's stuttering for me
A8:44:25 <peerkoel> and the sound device isn't closed
A8:44:38 <citricsquid> it stutters when my PC is lagging, but that happens with all programs.
A8:44:41 <peerkoel> maybe the applet needs a "Close" option?
A8:46:36 <Notch> does it stop playing music when you leave the page?

A8:46:43 <JTE> and I'm probably better off that way.
A8:46:47 <peerkoel> I have sounds disabled
A8:46:52 <peerkoel> I'll need to check

A10:01:53 <liq3> rofl 
A10:02:09 <Ausfriendlaptop> C++ Is a completely bs way to do something that would of taken 1 line in something else
A10:02:11 <Ausfriendlaptop> for example
A10:02:22 <liq3> Ausfriend: The only thing faster then C++ is C.
A10:02:23 <Ausfriendlaptop> C++ = displaying 1 line of text takes like 4-6 lines?
A10:02:43 <Daidoji> eh
A10:02:44 <JTE> C++ isn't a scripting language.
A10:02:50 <do0han> Actually vala is faster than c++
A10:02:57 <liq3> It's why Assassin's Creeed, DoW2, Supcom, etc etc are all made in it. :P
A10:03:07 <Daidoji> but you can code a block of text and call on that thing with a short bit later
A10:03:09 <do0han> And D is pretty fast too.
A10:03:20 <do0han> Obj C is just syntax hell though.

A10:23:27 <PuyoDead> those idiots never get more than, say... 3 people
A10:23:47 <JTE> liq3: By chance, both me and my right hand man were on at the same time, and able to watch three or four people joining at once and catch them the exact moment they even start trying to flood me.
A10:24:12 <JTE> We mute them, they continue on and wonder why the water won't move, and we're all happy~
A10:24:12 <liq3> JTE: lol :D
A10:24:18 <liq3> hahahahah
A10:24:21 <JTE> Plus, even if they did flood, I have super sponges and /load.

A10:25:55 <JTE> Technically I can, but then it might kick people for lagging. DX
A10:26:11 <liq3> That's a bad thing? XD

A11:00:02 <JTE> I am a programmer, not a hacker.
A11:00:14 <Azjherben> When you start a server what do you open?
A11:00:24 <JTE> Notepad.
A11:00:27 <liq3> JTE: Then how did you figure out packet structure?
A11:00:34 <Azjherben> Exactly
A11:00:45 <JTE> liq3: Watching what goes through and guessing what it means.
A11:00:53 <Azjherben> How did you watch?
A11:00:57 <Azjherben> What program?
A11:01:35 <JTE> The first version of my server was a proxy server which pretended to be a real server, waited for connections, and then connected to the real server and relayed messages back and forth while watching them.
A11:01:48 <JTE> i.e. no program that I hadn't completely written myself as well.
A11:01:57 <Azjherben> Wait
A11:02:04 <liq3> Haha tricky.
A11:02:10 <Azjherben> How did you find out what the origional program sent and recived?
A11:02:24 <Spadge> packet sniffing
A11:02:25 <JTE> I connected to the original program.
A11:02:41 <Azjherben> How do you packet sniff?

A11:02:50 <Azjherben> I
A11:02:56 <Azjherben> I'll google it
A11:03:00 <Spadge> hes not gonna write a tutorial here on IRC
A11:03:01 <Spadge> :P
A11:03:06 <liq3> Azjherben: Google won't help.
A11:03:25 <Azjherben> Why?
A11:03:37 <liq3> Because what JTE did is fairly basic networking.
A11:03:37 <liq3> :P
A11:03:42 <Azjherben> No
A11:03:42 <JTE> I doubt it will do you much good, generic packet sniffers are errenous in many ways. Instead I just wrote my own proxy and that was good enough.
A11:04:02 <Azjherben> How did you know what to make the proxy do?
A11:04:11 <Azjherben> I can make a winsock program that sends and recives
A11:04:13 <liq3> Azjherben: basic networking. :/
A11:04:24 <JTE> Then make a winsock program that sends and recieves.
A11:04:25 <Azjherben> I know C++ and Winsock for C++
A11:04:28 <JTE> ... That's all you need.
A11:04:28 <liq3> proxies just send and recv. They have no idea what the data means.
A11:04:34 <Azjherben> I know
A11:04:55 <JTE> Then what's the problem?
A11:05:01 <Azjherben> Well, first 
A11:05:10 <Azjherben> I need to find some "Packet Sniffer"
A11:05:11 <liq3> JTE: How did you find out if it used UDP or TCP? Or did you just test both?
A11:05:39 <JTE> liq3: I tried TCP first and it worked. So I didn't even need to try UDP. Either way, there's only two options. :P

A11:06:45 <JTE> The idea of a packet sniffer in general was all yours and Spadge's.
A11:06:53 <JTE> I already answered this question three times now.
A11:06:58 <Spadge> yeah
A11:07:01 <Spadge> he used a proxy

A11:49:39 <Azjherben> Is it a client program

A11:50:10 <liq3> It's a proxy. :/
A11:50:19 <Azjherben> Well witch one is a proxy
A11:50:27 <liq3> the program i wrote.

A11:51:40 <liq3> It connects to both my server and the client, then recieves packets from one and sends them to the other.
A11:52:11 <Azjherben> What IPs?
A11:52:20 <Azjherben> I can guess it sends to 127.0.0.1
A11:52:26 <JTE> @.@;
A11:52:49 <Azjherben> But what's the other IP
A11:53:07 <liq3> The server is 127.0.0.1...
A11:53:09 <liq3> lol JTE
A11:53:10 <liq3> xD
A11:53:20 <Azjherben> I already knew that
A11:53:37 <liq3> Grrr, I keep getting kicked because I'm not logged in. :(
A11:53:41 <JTE> The client connects to it, when it gets that connection it connects to the real server, the real server can be anywhere, you just have to code the address to it into your proxy, in the case of using the same machine it would be 127.0.0.1 and another port.
A11:54:15 <JTE> The official server has a 10 second timeout for new connections, waiting for a login message which the client is set to immediately send upon connecting.
A11:54:47 <Azjherben> What is the login message?
A11:55:25 <liq3> Well, I dunno what's wrong. I'm thinking it's packet size. :/
A11:55:39 <JTE> :/
A11:55:42 <JTE> Silly.
A11:55:47 <liq3> Eh?
A11:56:12 <JTE> Azjherben: Your proxy doesn't need to know what the login message is, because it should just relay what the client says to it, which will include the login message.
A11:56:58 <JTE> liq3: Note that the login message has a trailing 0, as one byte is used by the server and not the client (and might in the future represent the "is the client a premium user?" factor or something)
A11:56:59 <Azjherben> Okay, first I need to make a client that connects to localhost (127.0.0.1) on the port I chose
A11:57:08 <JTE> No
A11:57:13 <Azjherben> And in that same program I need to make a host....
A11:57:14 <JTE> You don't need to make a client at all. :|
A11:57:21 <Azjherben> Okay....
A11:57:27 <JTE> @.@; One program.
A11:57:35 <JTE> Listens for connections from minecraft.
A11:57:41 <Azjherben> What IP is that
A11:57:46 <JTE> It doesn't matter.
A11:57:46 <liq3> JTE: Well, I have no idea it's what it sending. Atm I'm just recieving 75 bytes then sending off whatever I get.
A11:58:11 <liq3> I know it works somewhat, because I get the lovely "you need to log in" message. >.>
A11:58:32 <JTE> You guys fail at writing simple proxy servers. :(
A11:58:44 <Azjherben> Because you won't tell me what two IPs it connects to
A11:58:48 <liq3> lol.
A11:58:49 <Azjherben> O wait
A11:58:52 <JTE> It would take less effort for me to just tell you everything about how the entire server works.
A11:58:53 <liq3> no he fails, I'm just a newbie. :P

P12:00:16 <Azjherben> Okay I hope i've figured this out
P12:00:33 <Azjherben> First I need to start hosting in a program
P12:00:37 <Azjherben> Also in that program
P12:00:54 <Azjherben> I need to have a client connection to 127.0.0.1 on port in my MC propertys
P12:02:12 <JTE> Maybe you're only recieving and sending one-way, liq3?
P12:02:17 <liq3> Nope, both.
P12:02:32 <JTE> Azjherben: No, you can't do that.
P12:02:52 <JTE> First you need to start hosting in a program. That program must WAIT for a connection before doing ANYTHING else.

P12:03:17 <iPope> minecraft forums is down :(
P12:03:25 <Azjherben> What!
P12:03:30 <Azjherben> Anyway....
P12:03:33 <JTE> When you get a connection, you connect to the server the same way.
P12:03:44 <JTE> Client -> Proxy -> Actual server
P12:03:59 <Azjherben> Do the ports have to be different
P12:04:07 <Azjherben> Port in my propertys = 15777
P12:04:15 <JTE> Yes, so that the client connects to the proxy and not the server.
P12:04:25 <JTE> You cannot have two programs opening the same port.
P12:04:25 <Azjherben> Port that I listen to on localhost is 15777
P12:04:30 <Azjherben> Port I host on is 15776

P12:07:54 <Azjherben> Okay, I have a program that hosts any ip on port 15776
P12:08:03 <Azjherben> And recives from port 15777 on localhost
P12:08:18 <Azjherben> then would send what it recives though the hosting socket
P12:08:45 <JTE> It has to send both ways.
P12:09:03 <JTE> When it recieves from one socket, send to the other. For both.
P12:09:10 <Azjherben> I know
P12:09:13 <Azjherben> I'm half done
P12:09:19 <Azjherben> But I don't get one thing
P12:09:35 <Azjherben> How will Minecraft know to connect to my host?
P12:09:55 <JTE> The URL you give to play.jsp contains an IP address and port number.
P12:10:11 <JTE> The difference between your proxy and the actual server are different port numbers.
P12:11:08 <liq3> lol JTE i don't know why you're trying with this guy. o.O
P12:11:15 <Azjherben> Hey.
P12:11:18 <Azjherben> I can do this.
P12:11:54 <JTE> I don't know why I'm trying with either of you, since you'll only pose competition for my own server, which everyone ALREADY hates me for.
P12:12:20 <Azjherben> Competition?

P12:14:17 <JTE> >.>; and then I won't get anything DONE all day.
P12:14:19 <Azjherben> So, why complain about it being empty
P12:14:28 <JTE> Because I'm not complaining about it being empty.
P12:14:31 <JTE> That's your assumption.
P12:14:37 <Azjherben> Um, okay
P12:14:40 <JTE> :/
P12:15:07 <Zolyx> I'd join it for a little while, if only to build one of my Union Jacks on it
P12:15:35 <Azjherben> Okay, so first I need to make a hosting socket on port 15776 and a client on port 15776
P12:15:46 <Azjherben> Then once they are both connected run a loop 
P12:16:04 <Azjherben> To send from the proxy to my server program
P12:17:37 <JTE> Maybe that's what liq3's problem is.
P12:17:42 <Azjherben> ?
P12:17:49 <liq3> Eh?
P12:18:04 <JTE> Maybe the "recieve stuff" command is blocking, waiting for something to recieve before it returns.

P4:43:20 <Sean> tcp
P4:43:22 <Sean> ok
P4:43:24 <cryzed> when you start the server it connects to the master minecraft server
P4:43:27 <cryzed> and register itself
P4:43:36 <cryzed> the master minecraft server regularly pings your server

P4:45:31 <Sean> any suggestions?
P4:45:33 <JTE> I see the repeatedly-saving-until-I-run-out-of-memory error is still there after all.
P4:46:51 <Sean> what is the ip of the master server?
P4:47:00 <ZomBuster>  minecraft.net ?
P4:47:14 <Sean> the one my server reports to
P4:47:14 <ZomBuster> run a whois on that
P4:49:00 <Sean> the one that pings my server repeatedly
P4:50:00 <Sean> well i added a firewall exeption
P4:50:09 <Sean> and now i see it in the list
P4:50:17 <Sean> but when i go through the list
P4:50:25 <Sean> it says it cannot connect
P4:50:37 <Sean> why?
P4:51:22 <JTE> Sean: Nothing pings your server repeatedly.
P4:51:43 <JTE> Your server sends an HTTP POST to minecraft.net/heartbeat.jsp every 45 seconds.
12P4:51:45 * Redshift (chatzilla@c-98-232-237-235.hsd1.or.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P4:52:47 <JTE> The POST contains information on your server's name, user count, max players, if it should be publicly listed, and the server's secret randomly selected salt for name verification.
P4:53:21 <JTE> Oh, and the port number.
P4:54:07 <JTE> The IP address is automatically gathered by the server as part of the HTTP request, and put together with the port number to get the proper connect URL, which heartbeat.jsp returns to the server.

P4:55:12 <JTE> If for some reason you cannot connect by that url, which is guaranteed to be correct, there is an issue of the port you're trying to host in being blocked by a firewall or router. This is especially true if you can connect to it by a local IP, be it the loopback ip 127.0.0.1 or your LAN ip (192.168.*.*)

P5:13:59 <JTE> My server is the one that died while I was away

P5:16:00 <DarkCybrid> ?
P5:16:29 <fydo> non-sensical. you just need to back up every time a block is added or destroyed :)
P5:16:34 <JTE> Ah there we go.
P5:17:22 <JTE> I figured it out: One place where I call map_save() didn't pass an argument to it, normally if it's given a 1 it makes a backup, if it's a 0 it doesn't, but this one had neither..
P5:17:40 <DarkCybrid> that's WIERD
P5:17:43 <DarkCybrid> weird?
P5:17:44 <DarkCybrid> weird.
P5:17:57 <JTE> Hopefully the lack of a 0 there is what was causing the endless loop of backup-making ... hopefully.

P5:34:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> when that comes i'm gonna kick some ass
P5:34:15 <JTE> Then I'll have it closed-source and can give it out to everyone.
P5:34:17 <JTE> ... With Lua support.
P5:34:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Lua support will kick tons of ass.
P5:34:19 <DarkCybrid> C:/Program Files?

P6:21:19 <Animator> I have ideas that are brewing that need to be expressed.
P6:21:32 <Animator> Most are platforming games, but of the action kind.
P6:22:00 <Animator> And not just action, I mean ACTION SHIT YEAH *BULLETS* action.
P6:22:17 <Animator> Others are more passive but may be more fun and more comical.
P6:22:24 <Animator> JTE, your server died.
P6:22:29 <JTE> I restarted it.
P6:22:34 <JTE> Which is why you got disconnected.
P6:22:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> i saw 2 animators on your server

P6:26:31 <Animator> Tell me the dimensions and the colors.
P6:26:57 <liq3> Grrr, my program hates me. Won't draw anything. :(
P6:27:41 <JTE> Which dimensions would you prefer? 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, or dare I ask 128x128?
P6:28:02 <Animator> Judging from the game I'd go for 16 by 16.

P8:08:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> he lemme quote him
P8:08:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> <Animator> I have ideas that are brewing that need to be expressed.
P8:08:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> <Animator> Most are platforming games, but of the action kind.
P8:08:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> <Animator> And not just action, I mean ACTION SHIT YEAH *BULLETS* action.
P8:08:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> <Animator> Others are more passive but may be more fun and more comical.
P8:09:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> this irc client is odd

10P8:09:13 * thedude (bsmick042@67.170.188.13) has joined #minecraft
P8:09:24 <Animator> That should point it out.
P8:09:42 <Animator> But the rest of the details are secret.
P8:09:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> so what are you thinking of making it out of
P8:09:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> gamemaker?
P8:09:52 <Animator> Ick, no.
P8:09:58 <Animator> I tried Game Maker once.
P8:10:04 <Animator> And I failed. Horribly.
P8:10:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> you just have to keep working with it until you get it
P8:10:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> or you could try construct, pretty much a free alternative
P8:11:07 <DarkCybrid> i hate game maker
P8:11:10 <liq3> There's another one that was used to make Noitu Love 2, I just forgot it's name. :(
P8:11:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> people managed to make pretty amazing games out of gamemaker
P8:11:41 <Animator> I know.
P8:11:42 <AnnihilatorBeta> but that isn't the case here i guess
P8:11:44 <potato> i remember using gamemaker when i was 12
P8:11:46 <Animator> Like Mondo Medicals.
P8:11:50 <liq3> AnnihilatorBeta: Eh. Show me one good GM game?

P8:12:19 <Animator> And then the previously said Iji.
P8:12:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> lol catcus
P8:12:34 <liq3> Iji is gamemaker?
P8:12:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> game maker 5
P8:12:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> to be more exact
P8:12:44 <Animator> I KNOW THE CURE TO CANCER *BANG* *BANG* etc.
P8:12:45 <liq3> lies. D:
P8:12:51 <Animator> It's true.
P8:12:56 <liq3> No awesome games are allowed to be made by game maker. :P
P8:13:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> obviously the best way is to make your own engien but you know how time consuming it can be for an unexperienced person
P8:14:09 <Animator> *cough*
