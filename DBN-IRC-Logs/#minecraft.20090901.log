A12:20:21 <liq3> and have to set up camp.
A12:20:28 <Foe> THAT WHAT SHE SAID ERIC
A12:20:29 <asiekierka> POF59: And a link to my movie
A12:20:30 <liq3> The home players could simply need to kill the attackers.
A12:20:31 <asiekierka> also
A12:20:37 <Eric> i already said that gdi
A12:20:37 <asiekierka> Will Surwival mode be Released?
A12:20:39 <asiekierka> that won't work
A12:20:42 <liq3> Respawn times for attackers would be extremely high.
A12:20:42 <Foe> YES
A12:20:43 <Grey> liq3: I'm imagining a cannonball being shot from some block cannon, hitting the skybox, then sending the stuff for the cannonball to the other server, which you can see a basic render of.
A12:20:48 <Grey> Lol
A12:20:54 <liq3> Grey: Nah not like that. :P
A12:21:00 <Grey> Well
A12:21:01 <Foe> Grey, it'd be a cannon mob
A12:21:06 <Foe> not block
A12:21:12 <asiekierka> Yes
A12:21:13 <asiekierka> Yes!
A12:21:15 <Grey> Lol
A12:21:17 <asiekierka> YES!
A12:21:20 <Grey> I love it.
A12:21:21 <asiekierka> or a cannon user
A12:21:24 <Foe> THAT"S WHAT SHE SAID
A12:21:25 <liq3> Basically, you have attackers join the enemy server (wich is in Server war mode - basicaly survival). No respawning, last team stadning wins.
A12:21:26 <Foe> Asie
A12:21:27 <Eric> how about people who want to kill each other just go on the same server
A12:21:32 <Grey> That's what Notch needs to make now.
A12:21:33 <asiekierka> so I could shoot Foe into a griefed server
A12:21:40 <Grey> Cannons or turrets of some sort

A12:22:01 <Foe> asie, highly unlikely

A12:39:46 <Foe> Guys
A12:39:47 <Xeros> where is this number coming from?
A12:39:48 <asiekierka> I sense a pattern
A12:39:54 <mail2345> you cannot predict waveform collapse
A12:39:54 <asiekierka> 72
A12:39:56 <PrinceOfFire59> 50
A12:39:59 <Foe> I'll explain to you how the universe was formed
A12:40:04 <asiekierka> Using a random seed
A12:40:06 <PrinceOfFire59> 77 
A12:40:08 <Foe> NO
A12:40:11 <Foe> asie NO
A12:40:15 <asiekierka> A random seed was pre-big bang
A12:40:17 <PrinceOfFire59> 97

A12:41:29 <PrinceOfFire59> 72

A1:06:39 <Droqen> and makes sure he STAYS dead
A1:06:47 <Skintkingle> he's going on holiday dangerously close to september 11th.
A1:06:51 <Skintkingle> *rings FBI*
A1:06:58 <setveen> so will free users get the render fixes and the new animations
A1:07:03 <Droqen> I assume.
A1:07:07 <potato> probably
A1:07:11 <Warrr> no
A1:07:15 <liq3> You know what I'm gonna do when survival comes out? I'm going to trap ever mob on the map, that's what! :]
A1:07:19 <Droqen> Wait, what animations?
A1:07:21 <Warrr> if you dont buy then fuck you
A1:07:24 <Droqen> :o What new animations
A1:07:28 <Evil-Ville> The arm
A1:07:30 <Evil-Ville> I think
A1:07:32 <Droqen> Ah okay
A1:07:33 <Skintkingle> copypaste Warrr
A1:07:35 <setveen> the block holding
A1:07:41 <setveen> and the running wobble
A1:07:47 <Skintkingle> i think he means wielding blocks, player bobbing, and 3d
A1:07:49 <Droqen> mm
A1:07:50 <Droqen> right
A1:07:54 <Xeros> if mobs stay in one spot too long they get angered and do a super jump of block breaking capabilities.
A1:07:58 <Skintkingle> although i dno why i said that, setveen was inb4 me
A1:08:23 <setveen> 3d is buy only, i know that
A1:08:44 <Evil-Ville> Has he actually said that?
A1:08:46 <Droqen> I need some red/green glasses.
A1:08:58 <Skintkingle> is it red and green?
A1:09:05 <Foe> The MC currency is Beafs
A1:09:05 <FNugget> red blue
A1:09:05 <Droqen> maybe it's red/blue
A1:09:07 <Droqen> sorry
A1:09:12 <Skintkingle> i swear it was red/cyan
A1:09:13 <FNugget> i have two pair
A1:09:19 <Droqen> Maybe I'm silly
A1:09:20 <Skintkingle> god i nearly had a heart attack, bought the wrong pair D:
A1:09:20 <Grey> What was red/cyan?
A1:09:25 <Droqen> Magenta/Cyan maybe
A1:09:27 <Foe> Look at the wiki's blocks
A1:09:29 <Droqen> -- 3d anaglyph
A1:09:39 <Evil-Ville> the glasses are red/blue and the way it looks on the screen is red/cyan
A1:09:52 <Foe> anaglyph uses the colors magenta, cyan and grey
A1:09:57 <Grey> 3d anaglyph is red/cyan, I've never seen glasses that are actually blue.
A1:09:58 <liq3> anaglyph is terribad. You lose basically all colour. :P
A1:10:14 <Foe> You don't
A1:10:28 <Grey> It tints it though.
A1:10:35 <Foe> yeah
A1:10:39 <Skintkingle> yea, i remember watching Spy Kids 3D. that was anaglyph, works fine
A1:10:46 <Evil-Ville> I've never seen cyan glasses honestly
A1:10:47 <Grey> Depends on the person, really
A1:10:48 <Foe> same here
A1:10:58 <Grey> Evil-Ville: It's cyan because that's a mix of blue/green.
A1:11:00 <Foe> I have only eye sight in one eye
A1:11:06 <Evil-Ville> All of the ones on google image search are red/blue
A1:11:09 <Grey> Evil-Ville: If it was just blue, the image would be tinted green in any case.
13A1:11:11 * Foe can't use anaglyph
A1:11:18 <Grey> Foe: Colorblindness?
A1:11:21 <Foe> no
A1:11:22 <Droqen> DO YOU HAVE AN EYEPATCH
A1:11:27 <Skintkingle> blind in 1 eye
A1:11:27 <Droqen> TELL ME YOU HAVE AN EYEPATCH
A1:11:31 <Foe> 	<Foe>	I have only eye sight in one eye
A1:11:32 <setveen> HE IS A PIRATE
A1:11:35 <Grey> Ah
A1:11:37 <Foe> ]	<Foe>	 <Foe> I have only eye sight in one eye
A1:11:37 <Grey> That sucks.
A1:11:40 <FNugget> yar har fiddle dee dee
A1:11:42 <Droqen> Yeah :(
A1:11:45 <FNugget> do what you want cuz a pirate is free
A1:11:50 <Foe> I don't have an eyepatch
A1:11:57 <Foe> 	<Foe>	I don't have an eyepatch
A1:11:58 <Droqen> Although I hear even people with just one eye still get depth perception by simple movement.
A1:12:01 <Evil-Ville> Grey look at these glasses and tell me they're cyan http://www.berezin.com/3D/images/anaglass2.jpg
A1:12:01 <Droqen> Why not
A1:12:02 <Droqen> Let us
A1:12:09 <Grey> Anaglyph rarely works for me, because I have an astigmatism, so I either sacrafice detail or little 3D effects.
A1:12:11 <Droqen> Demand you get one D:
A1:12:17 <Foe> Dro, I have excellent depth perception
A1:12:30 <Grey> Those red/cyan glasses rarely fit over my glasses.
A1:12:33 <Droqen> Yeah
A1:12:38 <Foe> And dro, how was it being raped by that guy

A1:13:13 <Grey> Evil-Ville: The frame is blue.
A1:13:19 <Droqen> xD
A1:13:25 <Grey> Evil-Ville: But the lens is obviously cyan.
A1:13:32 <Grey> Evil-Ville: Factor in lighting changes, as well.

A1:14:02 <Evil-Ville> If they look blue they're blue
A1:14:03 <Foe> Law of Talos
A1:14:12 <Grey> Evil-Ville: If you say so.
A1:14:13 <Droqen> Cyan does look blue
A1:14:14 <Droqen> silly
A1:14:28 <Evil-Ville> No cyan looks cyan
13A1:14:30 * setveen moo
A1:14:31 <Grey> Cyan is blue and green. >>;
A1:14:34 <Droqen> Cyan (pronounced /sa?'æn/; from Greek ??a?o?? / kyanous, meaning "blue")
A1:14:37 <Droqen> >:o
A1:14:39 <Foe> Evil-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville-Ville: how are you?
A1:14:43 <Grey> Think of this in a logical manner:
A1:14:53 <Grey> If one lens was red, and the other was blue.
A1:15:03 <Grey> Then obviously, the image would be tinted green all the time.
A1:15:04 <Foe> it'd look purple
A1:15:04 <Droqen> Although the lens in that pair of glasses does look a little too blue and not enough green.
A1:15:21 <Grey> Actually, no, Foe is right.
A1:15:22 <Evil-Ville> It's like all the 3D glasses I've ever seen
A1:15:25 <Foe> lol
A1:15:34 <Grey> I was thinking of eliminating the colors.
A1:15:50 <Skintkingle> bloody hell
A1:15:51 <Foe> the screen is given a green tint then
A1:16:02 <Skintkingle> i got watch a few youtube videos and ya'll still on Anaglyph glasses
A1:16:03 <Grey> Foe: Possibly.
A1:16:09 <Foe> cyan + magenta + green = whit
A1:16:27 <FNugget> IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE
A1:16:30 <FNugget> what color it is
A1:16:30 <Droqen> Grey: Eliminating the colours is done (currently) via polarized light.
A1:16:33 <FNugget> THIS IS THE COLOR
A1:16:34 <Foe> Hi FuckNuggets
A1:16:34 <FNugget> http://www.triplespark.net/render/stereo/anaglyph/glasses/
A1:16:40 <liq3> Foe: Cyan + Red = black.
A1:16:48 <Foe> oh
A1:16:49 <Droqen> And there is a terrifying polarized monitor meant for 3d stuff and holy crap.
A1:16:55 <Grey> Droqen: Polarized light is how they do the newer 3D cinema stuff, right?
A1:16:57 <liq3> Foe: At least as far as lenses go.

A1:17:05 <Foe> lol
A1:17:09 <Droqen> Grey: Yep.
A1:17:19 <Grey> Thought so.
A1:17:27 <Droqen> But currently it's...
A1:17:34 <Droqen> inefficient for home use ;p
A1:17:40 <FNugget> it's cyan, but to be specific, you have to give the lenses transmission spectrum
A1:18:00 <liq3> Droqen: What do you mean?
A1:18:09 <Evil-Ville> Nvidia has some special 3D shit you can use if you buy some special glasses and have a 120hz monitor
A1:18:10 <Foe> I am enjoying this
A1:18:21 <Grey> 3D cinema is inefficient as-is.
A1:18:26 <liq3> Evil-Ville: So it basically works for no one? :P

A1:18:48 <Grey> What a waste.
A1:18:52 <Grey> Seriously.
A1:18:53 <Droqen> They have monitors meant for polarized 3D display, but the problem is it's lower-res, really goddamn expensive, only works for a select few games, and is kind of fuzzy without the glasses.
A1:18:57 <Grey> People see at about 60Hz.

A1:19:06 <Droqen> Notch disagrees with you Grey
A1:19:13 <Evil-Ville> That's a myth Grey
A1:19:14 <liq3> Droqen: iz3d moniters work for most games (albeit with varying degrees of quality).
A1:19:17 <FNugget> the double is to give the 3D effect
A1:19:17 <Droqen> He will slap you in the face except not really
A1:19:26 <Grey> Evil-Ville: Really?
A1:19:28 <Evil-Ville> Look at a fucking 60hz CRT
A1:19:31 <Evil-Ville> It's flickery as hell
A1:19:36 <liq3> Droqen: It's also a 22" at like 1600x1050, so. :/
A1:19:41 <Droqen> liq3: Really? I know there are a bunch that support it, but I thought they needed actual SUPPORT of it so the list is still somewhat limited.
A1:19:41 <Grey> Evil-Ville: It varies from person to person, obviously.
A1:19:51 <Evil-Ville> Yeah probably
A1:19:57 <Grey> Evil-Ville: Some people see <60 Hz, some people see >60 Hz.
A1:20:02 <liq3> Droqen: Works most games that use DirectX 8 or 9 (and maybe 10).
A1:20:13 <chaos95> I find anything under 85hz pretty uncomfortable on a CRT
A1:20:13 <Grey> Evil-Ville: Presumptions to support: Some people can look at 60Hz CRTs and be just fine.
A1:20:14 <Droqen> I've read some reviews of them saying that non-3d stuff is still kind of fuzzy. Or something. I dunno. And okay, that's good.
A1:20:16 <chaos95> LCD it's not really an issue
A1:20:36 <Foe> Blarg
A1:20:40 <Evil-Ville> Some people have just gotten used to 60hz CRTs
A1:20:40 <Grey> LCD could work at any refresh rate and not flicker, to my knowledge.
A1:20:51 <liq3> Droqen: I'm tempted to buy one myself, but the lack of properly made games for it is puttingg me off. Main reason is that's it's full colour 3d, which stuff like anaglyph can't do.
A1:20:56 <Evil-Ville> That's true
A1:21:13 <Grey> When I was a child (<10 years old), I used an old CRT monitor at 60 Hz.
A1:21:18 <Grey> I didn't notice any flickering.

A1:21:31 <Grey> My dad usually complained about it flickering though, so he upped it.
A1:21:34 <Droqen> liq3: I think I'd like to try one (and try it a good deal) before even considering purchasing one.
A1:21:49 <Grey> Nowadays, when I work in computer labs and such at school, I hate using those old CRTs that are at 60Hz.
A1:21:56 <Grey> Especially if you can't change them due to lack of drivers.
A1:22:12 <asiekierka> I could code yer drivers
A1:22:20 <Grey> Good for you.
A1:22:24 <Grey> You could work in the monitor industry.
A1:22:26 <Grey> :D
A1:22:27 <asiekierka> No
A1:22:31 <liq3> Droqen: same pretty much.
A1:22:34 <asiekierka> I need to write a driver for my Chips&Tech chip

A1:24:25 <Grey> Skintkingle: Who?
A1:24:29 <Evil-Ville> The battery just died
A1:24:41 <Evil-Ville> Can't be bothered changing it
A1:24:42 <Grey> Evil-Ville: Why not break it open and replace the battery then?
A1:24:56 <asiekierka> I have a 96 laptop, the CMOS battery is dead
A1:24:58 <asiekierka> but it works anyway
A1:25:07 <Evil-Ville> I only used it for bunch of dos games
A1:25:10 <asiekierka> So did I

A1:31:10 <Grey> I can't remember if it's being worked on anymore or not.
A1:31:25 <Grey> I know the Edge gets firmware updates released from time to time.
A1:31:30 <Evil-Ville> Seemed pretty nice compared to R4 back when he got it
A1:31:44 <Marach> i like my r4
A1:31:55 <Grey> CycloDS just makes it so you can support up to 32GB of space
A1:31:55 <Marach> because of custom YSmenu firmware
A1:32:05 <Grey> As well as a few other small features
A1:32:09 <Marach> it adds things like autopatcher

A1:32:17 <Marach> its like "install and forget"

A1:33:10 <Xeros> craap... finished chapter 2 of C++ game programming...it wants me to make a version of a number guessing game except where the computer picks the number and the computer guesses.....oh man this'll be quite a project for me
A1:33:12 <Grey> Powder?
A1:33:12 <Marach> you mean roguelike?
A1:33:16 <Evil-Ville> Yes
A1:33:21 <Grey> You mean that game that has graphics made out of ASCII characters?
A1:33:24 <Xeros> where the user picks*
A1:33:25 <PrinceOfFire59> Not that anyone cares, but I have the iT DS for my freeware. I toploads microSDs. <.< >.> *runs*
A1:33:28 <Marach> not ascii
A1:33:34 <Evil-Ville> powder has tiles
A1:33:34 <Marach> there are some tilesets
A1:33:38 <Grey> Ah
A1:33:44 <Marach> great game
A1:33:44 <liq3> Xeros: for extra challenge make it guess perfectly. :P
A1:33:49 <Grey> I remember seeing a screenshot where it was just ASCII characters for the tiles.
A1:33:51 <Evil-Ville> I tried the nethack port but it was pretty bad
A1:33:54 <Marach> "Don't go there! You will break the backlight!"
A1:33:55 <Grey> Perhaps someone just made their tileset like that.
A1:33:57 <Droqen> play Spelunky, anyone? D:
A1:34:07 <PrinceOfFire59> Marach: Powder
A1:34:14 <Xeros> oh mann my brain...fbnjng

A1:35:12 <Skintkingle> Jafoooli

A1:35:40 <Grey> I don't like that sort of stuff, ASCII characters for graphics.

A1:36:10 <Evil-Ville> But the ASCII in POWDER blows
A1:36:12 <Grey> It's a TI-83+ emulator.

A1:36:30 <PrinceOfFire59> XD
A1:36:32 <Grey> So I used that near the end of the year, since I had no other options.
A1:36:39 <PrinceOfFire59> hehe
A1:36:42 <Grey> It's more handy to use my DS. D:
A1:36:47 <PrinceOfFire59> cool
A1:36:51 <Grey> It's faster, smaller, and I can do other things with it.

A1:39:10 <PrinceOfFire59> ONCE

A1:39:35 <Droqen> What kind of multiplayer?
A1:39:35 <PrinceOfFire59> And said: this is morrowind but not 3d
A1:39:41 <Grey> Not sure, droqen.
A1:39:51 <Evil-Ville> But daggerfall is 3d

A2:11:07 <Xeros> well I dunno if I want the "perfect" method lol
A2:11:32 <liq3> perfect just means it gets it in the least goes, always. :P 
A2:11:41 <liq3> well, on average anyway.
A2:11:45 <Xeros> like if it guessed like... "85 too high..... 27 too low... then I'd like it to just make a new random number between 85 and 27
A2:11:56 <liq3> ah.
A2:12:12 <liq3> then you use rand and make it pick a number from 0-something + something.
A2:12:13 <liq3> :P
A2:12:45 <Xeros> but what do I use to refer to the computer's last picked number?

A4:07:39 <Colain> I divided by zero in class today.
13A4:07:45 * liq3 nukes smashing, then drops large trout on his atomished remains.
A4:07:52 <Colain> I'm surprised at the lack of wormholes.
A4:07:56 <Smashing> there are 10 kinds of people in the world, those who undersand binary and those who dont
A4:07:56 <smn> what was the outcome of said incident, Colain?
A4:08:13 <liq3> Smashing, let me guess, you learned binary after you failed to get that jokE? :P
A4:08:19 <smn> there are 10 kinds of people in the world, those who understand ternary, those who don't and those who mistake this for a binary joke
A4:08:27 <Smashing> haha 
A4:08:29 <Smashing> lmfao
A4:08:39 <Super-Dot> smn: That's three
A4:08:45 <liq3> lol.
A4:08:46 <smn> du-DUH
A4:08:46 <Super-Dot> It's supposed to be just two options
A4:08:46 <Colain> Acutally, nothing smn
A4:08:51 <Smashing> Colain, dont make the mistake i did, never ask a college math professor how to divide by zero...
A4:08:56 <Smashing> i thought i was being witty and clever
A4:09:02 <smn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system <-- .
A4:09:04 <smn> :D
A4:09:05 <Smashing> she spent the entire class explaining some really advanced math shit
A4:09:09 <Smashing> i wanted to shoot myself
A4:09:10 <Colain> There are two people in this world, people who believe it and people who are smart enough to work out there isn't.
A4:09:22 <liq3> Smashing: Why?
A4:09:29 <liq3> Also divide by 0 is just "undefined"
A4:09:38 <Smashing> cause i wasnt able to do what i usually do
A4:09:45 <Smashing> i usually slept in her class
A4:09:46 <Xeros> I keep hearing noises from mIrc.. and seeing nothing...ftw
A4:09:49 <Smashing> but she kept asking me shit
A4:10:00 <Smashing> my favorite time from that class though was when i walked in late
A4:10:04 <Smashing> it was a 50 minute class
A4:10:07 <Smashing> started at 10am
A4:10:11 <Smashing> ended at 1040am
A4:10:17 <Smashing> i walked in at 1049am

A4:10:37 <Colain> I'm in High school... got caught doing work not even once for a whole lesson. I just got out of trouble. I'm that awesome (I'm not usually full of it :( )

A4:14:05 <Smashing> oh god
A4:14:08 <Colain> Hehe. Everyone loves lesbiens.
A4:14:08 <Smashing> cheap ketchup is awful
A4:14:15 <Smashing> who would honestly be willing to save a quarter
A4:14:16 <smn> "got your tortoise. make that reward a 800 and it's yours again."
A4:14:19 <Smashing> and sacrifice so much!

P2:28:11 <Marach> im trying a huge map!
P2:28:15 <Xzalander> 1x1x2 they can still reach out
P2:28:19 <Marach> wonder how much points i will get
P2:28:21 <Snowman> anyway, a 1x1x2 hole with 3 skeletons and a creeper in it :D

P4:12:20 <blaster> Glitched up the photo
P4:12:29 <Visiiri> aint that the dummy calling the genius moronic.
P4:12:32 <blaster> :P
P4:12:35 <Snowman> No I mean, how did you get it that big?
P4:12:39 <Nalok> Lol, I just stupidly fell on a skeleton when I tried to box it in, and it brought me down to 1/2 a heart
P4:12:45 <Rydia> people are very attached to the $16 they spent to ply notch to code this game
P4:12:50 <blaster> my capture thing is realy glitched up
P4:12:51 <Xzalander> Im *still* waiting for this dumb tree to grow
P4:12:51 <Nalok> Thankfully I found a shroom nearby :D
P4:12:58 <Xzalander> did I get the retarded generator?
P4:13:06 <Ausfriend> Damn
P4:13:07 <Snowman> Xzalander, it has to be on grass, not dirt
P4:13:15 <Xzalander> Im not that dumb :D
P4:13:15 <Dummy> I know, irony hurst
P4:13:18 <Ausfriend> I need an 0.3 ratio to save my account on bitgamer
P4:13:18 <Dummy> hurts*
P4:13:22 <Ausfriend> but now i'm stuck on 0.299
P4:13:40 <Dummy> I was calling Morons to the people Rydia mencioned
P4:13:47 <Xzalander> Also snowman Im trying to make a sky tree, Ive made a stairway of grass
P4:14:02 <Nalok> Woot, shroomcave!
P4:14:04 <Xzalander> So theortically the tree should grow as it is connected to terra AND on grass
P4:14:13 <Xzalander> Woot finally
P4:14:17 <Xzalander> it treed it up
P4:14:35 <Snowman> yay
P4:14:40 <Xzalander> IVE built the first Sky tree on survival! 
P4:14:41 <Nalok> Woot, lava!

P4:16:33 <Nalok> lol
P4:16:35 <Visiiri> ok
P4:16:36 <Shotz> Snowman
P4:16:36 <vede> I found a cave with five creepers.
P4:16:38 <King_Lem> That sounds like a band anme to me.
P4:16:40 <vede> And a few pigs.
P4:16:42 <King_Lem> *name
P4:16:44 <Shotz> Should i open single player through the website?
P4:16:44 <Visiiri> Where are skeletons and zombies?
P4:16:51 <Nalok> Everywhere
P4:16:53 <Snowman> No, go to the site
P4:16:57 <Snowman> and press the sneak preview
P4:17:03 <Garreett> 5 pigs, one hole, eh
P4:17:06 <Garreett> wink wink, nudge nudge.
P4:17:11 <Garreett> say no more.
P4:17:14 <Nalok> I found a zombie swimming with some pigs and rained arrow-y death upon it
P4:17:17 <King_Lem> know what I mean
P4:17:18 <Wonk> Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.
P4:17:19 <Rydia> when i kill pigs they don't drop bacon this game sucks notch
P4:17:22 <Shotz> Oh
P4:17:26 <Nalok> lol
P4:17:28 <Shotz> Lmao
P4:17:29 <Shotz> Thanks
P4:17:29 <vede> I think that the bow/arrow thing kinda sucks right now.
P4:17:30 <Shotz> .-.
P4:17:31 <Wonk> Hahaha
P4:17:32 <Nalok> Seriously
P4:17:38 <Nalok> I want me some bacon
P4:17:53 <vede> You can basically go crazy-machine-gun-but-with-arrows on everything.
P4:18:03 <Dilt> everyone was expecting quite too much
P4:18:08 <Garreett> it's just a proof of concept right now
P4:18:10 <Wonk> Someone make a gameplay video, and put it on Youtubne.
P4:18:11 <Nalok> Oh god, zombie, pig, and creeper next to my spawn in a lake
P4:18:12 <Garreett> still fun though
P4:18:13 <Nalok> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
P4:18:16 <vede> I didn't even think we had a bow this early in, Dilt.
P4:18:24 <Dilt> anyway, when notch gets back, he needs to add in JUST ONE thing to make it work
P4:18:28 <Rydia> i spent two bigmacs on this game and what do i get? survival isn't even finished notch. you've thrown away our $16. thrown it away
P4:18:44 <blaster> lol...
P4:18:45 <Dilt> and that is a button to make all the mobs on the map go immediately hostile towards you
P4:18:47 <Dilt> and head at you
P4:18:55 <Dilt> THAT is survival.
P4:18:56 <blaster> hmm
P4:18:58 <vede> Hehe.
P4:19:00 <vede> That would be fun.
P4:19:07 <Dilt> and uhh
P4:19:08 <Snowman> Rydia, it's a survival TEST
P4:19:11 <Dilt> actually wouldn't be that hard to implement
P4:19:16 <Dilt> and would be a fun thing to add in the test
P4:19:16 <Snowman> Not the full version
P4:19:17 <blaster> I have a house, a lookout tower which is max hight, what else do i need?
P4:19:20 <Rydia> I think there should be another meter on the right made up of drumsticks that shows hunger
P4:19:28 <Rydia> snowman i'm making fun of people who complain about it
P4:19:31 <AlexVMiner> i just realized 99 is max
P4:19:31 <Dilt> Pigs don't respawn apparently
P4:19:33 <AlexVMiner> -_-
P4:19:36 <Dilt> and yeah.
P4:19:36 <Snowman> oh
P4:19:38 <Dilt> 99 max is uhh
P4:19:44 <AlexVMiner> i am doin g great!
P4:19:44 <Dilt> well it's reasonable but
P4:19:50 <Dilt> god i hate having to make dirt dumps
P4:19:52 <AlexVMiner> killed about 7 crawlers so far
P4:19:53 <blaster> Hey guys what should i add to my city
P4:19:54 <vede> I think we need an enemy that explodes when it touches you.
P4:19:56 <blaster> to help me win?
P4:20:06 <AlexVMiner> i made a small fort
P4:20:10 <AlexVMiner> all i needed
P4:20:11 <Nalok> I'd much rather have like, 110 being max
P4:20:13 <Dummy> Make creepers more dangerous...
P4:20:18 <blaster> I made a tower which is max size

P4:22:01 <Visiiri> lol
P4:22:09 <Visiiri> maybe we can rip maps?
P4:22:15 <Visiiri> but then we loose animals
P4:22:17 <Nalok> That is my current problem with enemies
P4:22:22 <Garreett> If we had LUA implemented, then Notch'd pretty much never have to update MC again
P4:22:31 <Garreett> we could just make everything ourselves :P

P4:25:08 <Garreett> seeing as the mobs don't actually hunt you, you can just hole yourself up otherwise, blaster.
P4:25:08 <AlexVMiner> ugh
P4:25:18 <AlexVMiner> lol
P4:25:18 <Rydia> it isn't like they spent $50 on hellgate london

P4:25:39 <blaster> AlexVMiner your going to need a city, tree farm anf a mine
P4:25:44 <vede> I also don't think that the red-shrooms were implemented well.

P5:45:12 <PrinceOfFire59> The wiki picture of a creeper may be enough
P5:45:22 <Snowman> citric, I found a vein of like 60 gold
P5:45:51 <citricsquid> This one has about 50 so far, not ended yet.
P5:45:54 <vede> I mean, you start out, traverse the landscape in search of a cave, plunder said cave, killing its inhabitants and stealing all their shrooms, then you're basically done, and can go build whatever you like.
P5:46:10 <Visiiri> I caught eight creepers.
P5:46:16 <Visiiri> I failed to pin one, and killed him.
P5:46:20 <Visiiri> I forgot that he exploded.
P5:46:22 <vede> The first two steps are really fun, but after that, you're just farming.
P5:46:26 <Foe> Lol
P5:46:27 <Visiiri> That explosion realeased three others
P5:46:32 <Foe> LOL

P5:51:57 <Snowman> squid, I have 99 gold, iron, coal, stone, shrooms, dirt, water, sand, wood
P5:52:04 <AlexVMiner> lol
P5:52:04 <Azjherben> I don't just change the name
P5:52:06 <Foe> Does hitting things with stone better than with your hand?
P5:52:08 <AlexVMiner> it is that easy?
P5:52:08 <Nalok> And then a skeleton runs up and trys to kill me
P5:52:10 <citricsquid> only just started playing >:(
P5:52:12 <Eagle> 99 gold from this vein and there's still more
P5:52:13 <vede> They put it on the line saying that people will defend themselves from zombies.
P5:52:14 <Quatroking> alexvminer: it is.
P5:52:15 <Azjherben> It's a completly new file type
P5:52:30 <Azjherben> It's really small too. :)
P5:52:34 <AlexVMiner> but that doesn't make a totally new file
P5:52:35 <Quatroking> but if you want something that only works in one particular program, then you'll have to program shit
P5:52:38 <AlexVMiner> like, with settings
P5:52:52 <AlexVMiner> like .txt is text, and .fla is flash document

P6:41:22 <ZomBuster> increase damage for a period of time
P6:41:36 <Nalok> And the water would turn in to glass or something XD
P6:41:37 <ZomBuster> yeh citricsquid but that doesnt work in caves

P8:57:42 <kalanosh> i got a question i hope someone knows the answer.  Notch updated the render to be faster....i got 80fps before now in survival i only get max 20
P8:57:56 <Evil-Ville> Yeah I get worse fps now too
P8:58:03 <kalanosh> ATI card?
P8:58:06 <Evil-Ville> no
P8:58:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> probably because there are more things to render in survival
P8:58:20 <Evil-Ville> Yeah could be
P8:58:22 <PrinceOfFire59> ja...
10P8:58:35 * marky (M_Coxy@5ac2b3bf.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
P8:58:55 <kalanosh> ....no, i can run sims 3 at 30+fps...im positive minecraft doesn't render more things more complicated then that
P8:59:15 <JRTalkin> sims 3 lol
P8:59:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> and i can get merely 20 fps when playing wurm online
P8:59:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> i guess it's how rendering in java works
P9:00:55 <kalanosh> ....the point is that system uses more polygons more lighting and alot mroe objects. Im guessing he switched renders entirely. Cause wurm online uses lgwl thing and its not very compatible  
P9:00:56 <PuyoDead> the massive amount of mobs is making it slower overall

P9:58:18 <Dilt> 'it's stupid'
P9:58:26 <PrinceOfFire59> IMO=In My Opinion
P9:58:26 <vede> Pretty much everyone here thinks that Notch's decision is a good one.
P9:58:27 <Dilt> eventually enough people will knock notch back to his senses :P
P9:58:39 <Dilt> but anyway
P9:58:41 <Evil-Ville> Well atleast you'll be able to make mods when he releases the source code in 20 years
P9:58:48 <Dilt> i think the issue with it right now is that it's hard to implement custom textures
P9:58:56 <vede> So I doubt anyone will "knock him back to his senses"
P9:58:57 <Dilt> at least, for blocks
P9:59:05 <vede> It's actually very, very easy.
P9:59:11 <Dilt> since the block textures are highly specialized
P9:59:19 <chaos95> well doesn't the texture relate to the properties of the block?

P10:06:39 <vede> Actually, a tactical, long-range, realistic-type shooter could really work with Minecraft. That would be awesome.
P10:07:00 <Hunter2458> ...it sure would be...
P10:07:29 <Hunter2458> I could...blow up creepers...from far away.
13P10:07:36 * Hunter2458 mindblown.
P10:07:37 <Evil-Ville> You can already
P10:07:39 <Evil-Ville> Press tab
P10:07:49 <Hunter2458> Well, that's only like 10-15 blocks though.
P10:07:58 <Hunter2458> I wanna do it almost across the map.
P10:08:16 <Hunter2458> I can see shooting them near flag carriers now 0-0
P10:08:40 <PuyoDead> this could become an interesting FPS with "dynamic" maps. destroyable environment, maybe even the ability to build new areas
P10:09:02 <Hunter2458> Yeah, and with simple yet gorgeous graphics.
P10:09:18 <Dilt> Your inventory would be limited, like maybe you could only grab 1-3 blocks
P10:09:27 <Dilt> but what you could do with those blocks might be amazing
P10:09:31 <Dilt> instant cover!
P10:09:34 <Hunter2458> Yeah, weapons could fill inventory spots
P10:10:03 <Hunter2458> "Red Team has the flag" INSTANT SNIPING TOWER GOO!!!!
P10:10:26 <vede> A Battlefield-like game, but in Minecraft.
P10:10:38 <LG_Legacy> I made a small tower in survival..
P10:10:55 <Hunter2458> I made a huge fort in survival...then I died D: and it all went away.
P10:11:17 <vede> Yeah, no game-saving in Survival. :(
P10:11:19 <Hunter2458> Then I trapped some creepers in a heart shaped pit...
P10:11:21 <Dilt> I made a huge fort of stone with wood floorings
P10:11:31 <vede> It'd be nice if Notch would implement roguelike-style game-saving in Survival.
P10:11:35 <Hunter2458> They jumped 4 blocks high and killed me D:
P10:11:44 <vede> Where you can save the game, but if you die your save is deleted.
P10:11:52 <Evil-Ville> yes
P10:12:01 <Dilt> actually uhh
P10:12:06 <Dilt> did notch add in the arrows to survival?
P10:12:11 <vede> Yep.
P10:12:11 <Hunter2458> Dying should just clear your inventory, not your work.
P10:12:13 <Azjherben> Who's on?
P10:12:15 <Dilt> what button was it?
P10:12:16 <vede> You can press tab to fire.
P10:12:19 <Dilt> tab, that was it
P10:12:23 <Dilt> thank you
P10:12:23 <Evil-Ville> I disagree Hunter2458
P10:12:28 <Azjherben> Dilt, vede, Evil, hunter, me.
P10:12:44 <vede> And LG.
P10:12:49 <LG_Legacy> Wut?
P10:12:51 <Dilt> on what?
P10:12:52 <Azjherben> o rly?
P10:13:00 <Hunter2458> At least something other than clearing everything you did, or at least make it easier to get mushrooms, maybe harvest them.
P10:13:10 <Azjherben> ...I really wish I could play mc.
P10:13:27 <Hunter2458> The current random map generator has way too many cliffs that mobs love to knock you off...
P10:13:28 <Evil-Ville> It's already really easy
P10:13:37 <Dilt> honestly, i'd like some tweaks on the generator
P10:13:40 <Dilt> like jungles
P10:13:41 <Dilt> i hate jungles
P10:13:47 <Dilt> and they lag too
P10:13:49 <Hunter2458> It's not easy when you're luring mobs into a pit.
P10:13:52 <Dilt> i'd rather have occasional trees
P10:13:56 <Dilt> or heck, mountains of stone
P10:14:08 <Hunter2458> Since you have to walk backwards to avoid leaving the ADD monsters behind.
P10:14:31 <Dilt> that's why i kept asking notch for third person
P10:14:33 <Evil-Ville> Well luring mobs into a pit isn't exactly a normal thing to do
P10:14:40 <vede> I'd like to see some deserts.
P10:14:55 <Hunter2458> It is when you got exploding splash damage :D
P10:15:09 <Evil-Ville> Why are you so afraid of the splash damage
P10:15:13 <Evil-Ville> It's really easy to avoid
P10:15:25 <vede> And it's actually pretty fun to get hit with. >.>
P10:15:28 <Evil-Ville> Yeah
P10:15:42 <Hunter2458> I'm not afraid of it.
P10:15:46 <Azjherben> If 
P10:15:55 <Azjherben> If you could choose 16 colors in the world to use...
P10:16:01 <Hunter2458> I like using it in an enclosed environment, thus gathering mobs.
P10:16:02 <Azjherben> Would you choose these:
P10:16:02 <Azjherben> http://www.awitness.org/delphi_pascal_tutorial/source3/graphics/16_color_palette.gif
P10:16:32 <Hunter2458> Naw, the dark yellow would have to be orange.

P10:20:03 <Azjherben> If your wondering why I asked, it's because I found out that I can upgrade .iazh files to 16 colors from 5 and still keep files just as small. :)

P10:38:10 <PrinceOfFire59> Evil: YES

P10:38:31 <rey> evil, I like it
P10:38:41 <PrinceOfFire59> THAT would be awesome
P10:38:55 <vede> I think that enemies destroying blocks should happen pretty often.

P10:41:45 <setveen> im lonely by myself at the archives
P10:41:45 <vede> Yup.
P10:42:02 <setveen> survival has multiplayer right now, right?
P10:42:05 <Hunter2458> Nope
P10:42:07 <vede> That's YOUR FAULT, mi amigo, and no.
P10:42:16 <gordenfreechmen> setveen: no
P10:42:39 <setveen> well i played survival, and it still feels like there is no point to the game
P10:42:47 <vede>  :/
P10:42:49 <vede> Dude.
P10:42:52 <vede> So?
P10:43:05 <Hunter2458> Why does a game need a point?
P10:43:06 <setveen> i just dont like the limited blocks thing
P10:43:19 <vede> It's just like normal Minecraft, but you can kill stuff, and you have to mine for stuffs.
P10:43:20 <setveen> i like to not be limited to my creativity
P10:43:34 <vede> That's what Sandbox is for.
P10:43:43 <Hunter2458> And nothing is better than blowing up creepers in chains.
P10:43:48 <setveen> sandbox will always be free right?
P10:43:52 <vede> But Survival will prolly be pretty much ALL THE RAGE for a few weeks.
P10:43:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes probably
P10:44:00 <vede> And yeah, probably will be, to some extent.
P10:44:11 <gordenfreechmen> setveen: until the game becomes buy-only

P10:44:31 <gordenfreechmen> unless notch becomes less trigger-happy and makes sandbox free for everybody
P10:44:34 <setveen> ill just hax it if that happens
P10:44:58 <setveen> should i make a forum account?
P10:45:02 <vede> Notch has said that a basic sandbox-type game mode will be free forever.
P10:45:30 <setveen> what modes did he say there would be? CFT and survival i know that

P10:50:27 <Azjherben> Notch changed how stuff is rendered for survival
P10:50:36 <setveen> to make it worse?
P10:50:41 <Evil-Ville> Actually the lag is because of the enemies
P10:51:11 <setveen> well i get like 0.5 FPS on medium and 30 FPS on small
P10:51:18 <Azjherben> http://azjherben.org/untitled.png
P10:51:32 <Azjherben> from 5 colors, (red,blue,green,white,black) to 10

P10:54:27 <Azjherben> The difference is

P11:13:01 <Hunter2458> So, you'd just be compressing and encoding video with 16 colors? What will you compress the audio with?

P11:13:42 <Azjherben> Wait wait.
P11:13:47 <Hunter2458> It's streaming for dial-up!
P11:13:56 <Azjherben> I'll find a good example
P11:14:23 <Hunter2458> I can understand the prospects of maybe...using it to show Snes and Genesis game videos...
P11:14:30 <Azjherben> Most animators that are good don;t feel like spending most of their time on color diversity
P11:14:40 <Azjherben> they spend it on makeing a funny movie/animation
P11:14:59 <Hunter2458> Yeah, so they just draw simple things in flash
P11:15:40 <Azjherben> Do you think a png animation would be smaller than a flash thing?
P11:16:03 <Hunter2458> Depends on the audio properties required and the needs of the storytelling.
P11:16:59 <Azjherben> I'm not sure about audio atm, but I do know that an .iazj file is 11 times smaller than a .png file, and pngs are the best (smallest) out there so far.

P11:18:26 <PrinceOfFire59> lol mibbit
P11:19:01 <Azjherben> I suppose I could work in as many as 32 colors
P11:19:15 <Azjherben> Witch is as many as you could need for animations.
P11:19:20 <Hunter2458> Actually...didn't they put videos on GBA? 
P11:19:27 <potato> yeah
P11:19:29 <Hunter2458> And had animations on Snes and Genesis...
P11:19:31 <potato> shitty kids shows
P11:19:53 <Hunter2458> I think they'd had already done it during the 16 color consoles...
P11:20:02 <Hunter2458> and beyond
P11:20:41 <Azjherben> I'm not making this because I think that 16 (soon to be 32) colors is good, I just want to make the smallest high quality (I don't mean color) image possible.
P11:20:54 <Hunter2458> 32 is more plausible
P11:21:01 <Hunter2458> I'd agree with 32 colors.
P11:21:04 <Foe> Lol, I'm reading about this master theif that purposely leaves behind enough evidence to be punished but is never correctly convicted
P11:21:12 <Hunter2458> XD

P11:22:42 <vede> I don't think any 16-color console ever existed...
P11:22:48 <Hunter2458> C64 ;D
P11:22:50 <Azjherben> Commadore 64
