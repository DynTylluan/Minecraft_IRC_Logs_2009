A12:08:38 <asdf> hi
A12:08:53 <asdf> how do i make myself an admin? i made a server and my friends can join but i'm not an admin in game
A12:09:05 <asdf> probably some command in the console or game but not sure what
A12:09:22 <Daedal> there is an admins.txt
A12:09:30 <Daedal> I believe you add yourself there
A12:09:55 <asdf> yeah i did that
A12:09:55 <laCour|TheOffice> One name per line on the file.
A12:10:01 <laCour|TheOffice> It should work then
A12:10:04 <asdf> but still when i join i'm not made an admin
A12:10:04 <MonkeyDKS> asdf: Daedal is correct, add it to admins.txt
A12:10:04 <asdf> hm
A12:10:09 <MonkeyDKS> No caps though
A12:10:11 <asdf> is it case sensitive?
A12:10:12 <asdf> oh
A12:10:15 <asdf> that's probably why
A12:10:19 <laCour|TheOffice> Its not. :P
A12:10:19 <MonkeyDKS> Got me too
A12:10:26 <Visiiri> You can go into the console
A12:10:31 <Visiiri> and type "/op <name>"
A12:10:34 <Visiiri> because it's interactive
A12:10:41 <Visiiri> I used it to fight off rouge OP's
A12:11:00 <Visiiri> Anyways, ladies, I have this brilliant hack program
10A12:11:17 * Archanos is now known as Archanos|SleepMode
A12:11:31 <asdf> is there a list of admin commands?
A12:11:31 <Visiiri> I do not plan to release it.
A12:11:51 <Visiiri> asdf: /op, /deop, /tp, /kick, /ban, /banip, /unban.
A12:11:54 <Visiiri> I think that's it.

13A12:13:03 * Daedal kicks jonny in the teeth
A12:13:05 <Roadcrosser> http://img704.imageshack.us/img704/5990/visviphacks.png
A12:13:08 <Roadcrosser> ...
A12:13:18 <asdf> yo

A12:13:30 <asdf> i'm oped
A12:13:32 <jonnyabc> theres a greifer mode?
A12:13:35 <laCour|TheOffice> thats hot. >_>
A12:13:35 <Visiiri> Oh sorry

A12:13:42 <Visiiri> Yes, greifer mode
A12:13:43 <asdf> ty
A12:13:44 <Visiiri> but that's a PoC
A12:13:46 <laCour|TheOffice> Greifer mode? >_>
A12:13:46 <MonkeyDKS> just type /solid and place stone
A12:13:55 <Visiiri> and will not be added into the VIP version even
A12:14:14 <Visiiri> In simple terms, it scrambles your location so you cannot be traced
A12:14:15 <Daedal> nick changer aye?
A12:14:18 <Visiiri> Yeah
A12:14:20 <jonnyabc> wow even an autoclicker
A12:14:20 <Visiiri> but it is buggy
A12:14:26 <jonnyabc> im impressed
A12:14:30 <Visiiri> fukkah MCPASS
A12:14:31 <VurtualRuler98> Quick, what'd make a good dark re?
A12:14:34 <VurtualRuler98> dark red*
A12:14:36 <Daedal> so like, spoofing your name?
A12:14:36 <laCour|TheOffice> I'll buy it. >_>
A12:14:40 <Visiiri> Yeah
A12:14:47 <Visiiri> So I could change my nick into Daedal
A12:14:49 <Visiiri> and have your skin
A12:14:53 <laCour|TheOffice> 0.0
A12:14:54 <VurtualRuler98> DUDE THIS GUY CAN MAKE AN AUTOCLICKER
A12:14:55 <jonnyabc> ....O.O
A12:14:56 <Visiiri> but I don't know how to fake an MCPASS
A12:14:58 <VurtualRuler98> WE'RE DOOMED
A12:15:01 <laCour|TheOffice> lol
A12:15:05 <Daedal> sounds highly dangerous
A12:15:07 <VurtualRuler98> everyone hide
A12:15:08 <Visiiri> it is
A12:15:15 <Visiiri> This is the owner's version, remember
A12:15:15 <Daedal> is it in ACTIONSCRIPT?
A12:15:16 <jonnyabc> i haz idea
A12:15:21 <VurtualRuler98> Visiiri, you're only making this for trouble.
A12:15:21 <Visiiri> I don't think it is.
A12:15:30 <jonnyabc> if ppl grief w/ it make it set computer on fire
A12:15:32 <Visiiri> VurtualRuler98, I am the only one with access to these hacks
A12:15:42 <Visiiri> Or people that pay me, ofc
A12:15:45 <VurtualRuler98> Except nobody can trust your computer security.
A12:15:45 <Visiiri> they can get vip version
A12:15:48 <Visiiri> hehehe
A12:15:50 <Visiiri> HACK MEH
A12:15:54 <VurtualRuler98> They'll give it away.
A12:15:57 <Visiiri> UCID
A12:16:02 <VurtualRuler98> Infact, anyone could buy it, and then give it away.
A12:16:07 <Visiiri> Is that what it's called?
13A12:16:09 * PuyoDead predicts a ban in Visiiri's future.
A12:16:15 <Visiiri> PuyoDead, why?
13A12:16:18 * jonnyabc gasps
A12:16:20 <PuyoDead> Just sayin'.
A12:16:21 <Daedal> this looks like trouble
A12:16:25 <Daedal> it also looks a bit shooped
A12:16:29 <Daedal> but mostly like trouble
A12:16:31 <Visiiri> hehe
A12:16:38 <Visiiri> I will not release it then.
A12:16:38 <Visiiri> :<
A12:16:41 <PuyoDead> It's why FontPeg is banned on the forums.
A12:16:50 <Visiiri> ...What?
A12:16:52 <PuyoDead> Same with lailai.
A12:16:54 <Visiiri> You get banned for hacks?
A12:17:02 <jonnyabc> ........lmao look at tabs
A12:17:09 <PuyoDead> No, they "threatened" to release them.
A12:17:12 <Visiiri> Oh
A12:17:14 <Visiiri> hah.
10A12:17:19 * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
A12:17:34 <Visiiri> Well, I am not going to release these.
A12:17:37 <PuyoDead> But no worries, it'll just make everyone hate you, is all.
A12:17:48 <Visiiri> It's just an image, as of now.
A12:18:29 <Visiiri> I might release fly/jump/speed/autoclicker/wallhack public though
A12:18:35 <Visiiri> because then it's just a multi-tool
A12:18:45 <Roadcrosser> hey vis
A12:18:49 <Visiiri> Yes?
A12:18:53 <PuyoDead> Why, when WoM already has a perfectly functional one?
A12:19:02 <Roadcrosser> can you send notification mails to people on archive forums
A12:19:12 <Visiiri> PuyoDead, I'm not sure.
A12:19:22 <Roadcrosser> my comp starts on monday
A12:19:53 <Visiiri> Anyways
A12:19:57 <Visiiri> These are my hack programs
A12:20:03 <Visiiri> Most of it is 100%functional
A12:20:10 <Visiiri> some of it is ~30%functional
A12:20:47 <Visiiri> But, would you guys pay $3 for a month with these?
A12:20:49 <PuyoDead> Make some of it 5% functional, so people complain about it not working, but one or two people will say "yea it does, idiots!".
A12:20:59 <Visiiri> hehehe
A12:21:04 <PuyoDead> Are you retarded?
A12:21:12 <Visiiri> I hope not.
A12:21:16 <PuyoDead> That's a joke, right?
A12:21:19 <Visiiri> It was.
A12:21:21 <PuyoDead> It's not a very good joke.
A12:21:27 <Visiiri> I'm not a comedian.
A12:21:40 <PuyoDead> Remember when asie tried to sell map backup slots?
A12:21:47 <Visiiri> Your words have made me decide to keep these to myself :<
A12:21:54 <Visiiri> I don't, puyo.
A12:22:05 <Visiiri> I wont share these
A12:22:12 <Visiiri> and I'll even compress them into a .x file >:D
A12:22:21 <Visiiri> That's a map of winding extractors
A12:22:47 <PuyoDead> He was offering some map back up service, where he went through everyone's name, and saved their SP maps. Then he said he'd be willing to share them with you (after saving for free was dropped) for a price.

A12:23:45 <Visiiri> Anyways, I am not trying to stir up trouble
A12:23:49 <Visiiri> or go against notch's will
A12:23:55 <Visiiri> I'm just showin off my skills.

A12:53:25 <Daedal> I bit misused on WoM sometimes =P

A6:50:19 <Foe> Hello
A6:52:45 <VurtualRuler98> Minecraft Survival could have EXP for max HP, blocks, and arrows. That uses a formula where you have to do 20x what you just did for the last level.

A6:59:15 <Quatroking> "From now on, if minecraft.net detects someone trying to connect to a server from the same ip as the server, it will direct the player to 127.0.0.1 instead of to the server ip."
A6:59:33 <Quatroking> If an other pc than the server on the same ip tries to connect to that server, they'll break.
A6:59:34 <Foe> and that means
A6:59:49 <Foe> oh
A6:59:53 <Quatroking> They can't connect because they get redirected to 127.0.0.1 which doesn't host anything then

A8:40:38 <AlexVMiner> I canz teach you

A8:40:59 <AlexVMiner> so
A8:41:04 <AlexVMiner> um....
A8:41:19 <AlexVMiner> first, to start the button
A8:41:31 <AlexVMiner> decide what should be the sand and the water
A8:41:42 <AlexVMiner> like a white block for sand and a green block for water
A8:41:51 <FakeSky> Okay.
A8:41:59 <Wolfram> Yes, AlexVMiner.

A8:42:42 <FakeSky> ...
A8:43:06 <AlexVMiner> good idea
A8:43:44 <FakeSky> Just tell me where.
A8:43:44 <AlexVMiner> um...
A8:44:09 <AlexVMiner> pick a server
A8:44:33 <AlexVMiner> S    S
A8:44:33 <AlexVMiner> S    C
A8:44:33 <AlexVMiner> S    X

A8:44:37 <AlexVMiner> there

A8:44:47 <AlexVMiner> S   C
A8:44:47 <AlexVMiner> S   X
A8:44:47 <AlexVMiner> XWX
A8:44:47 <AlexVMiner> X
A8:44:52 <AlexVMiner> maybe that is better
A8:45:01 <FakeSky> That explains everything
A8:45:05 <AlexVMiner> S = whatever block you used for sand
A8:45:05 <FakeSky> What's the C?
A8:45:10 <AlexVMiner> C is stone
A8:45:17 <AlexVMiner> W is whatever block for water
A8:45:19 <AlexVMiner> X is air
A8:45:28 <AlexVMiner> do that, then save the map
A8:45:59 <AlexVMiner> Then go into omen, and replace all the S blocks with sand and the W blocks with still water.  The button should work
A8:46:13 <FakeSky> Okay.
A8:46:17 <FakeSky> :D
A8:46:18 <AlexVMiner> the ground level should be 2 S's down
A8:46:24 <AlexVMiner> so
A8:46:40 <AlexVMiner> S   S
A8:46:40 <AlexVMiner> S   C
A8:46:40 <AlexVMiner> ____
A8:46:47 <AlexVMiner> get it?
A8:46:49 <FakeSky> Got it.
A8:46:52 <FakeSky> Thanks. :D
A8:46:53 <AlexVMiner> good
A8:47:16 <AlexVMiner> now you can do more intricate things, like a button that opens a door 5 miles away
A8:47:29 <AlexVMiner> or floods something
A8:47:34 <AlexVMiner> anything you want!
A8:47:42 <FakeSky> :O
A8:48:01 <FakeSky> Can lava be replaced with water?

A11:59:32 <Aeomin> debugging is "fun"
A11:59:52 <Aeomin> I don't get bored, but I get frustrated
P12:00:38 <bildramer> I laugh my ass off when I fix an obvious bug
P12:00:47 <bildramer> like > instead of >= or <
P12:00:52 <bildramer> or a-- instead of --a
P12:01:15 <Ten_Tacles> i have a quote from a game here 
P12:01:17 <Ten_Tacles> who knows which game it is?
P12:01:19 <Ten_Tacles> QUOTE:
P12:01:20 <Ten_Tacles> "Get in the box!
P12:01:22 <Ten_Tacles> GET IN THE DAMN BOX!"
P12:01:43 <bildramer> no idea
P12:01:45 <vede> I hate making platformers. All my physics end up seeming so damn hackish.
P12:01:59 <bildramer> Mine too, but I love it :D
P12:02:12 <Ten_Tacles> XD
P12:02:14 <vede> And I never actually make the physics work perfectly.
P12:02:23 <Ten_Tacles> i tried to make a plattformer
P12:02:31 <Ten_Tacles> but i ended pretty fast ^^
P12:02:36 <bildramer> player.fallspeed++;
P12:02:36 <bildramer> for (a=1;a<=player.fallspeed;a++) {
P12:02:36 <bildramer>     if (map[player.ypos+a][player.xpos] != ' ') {
P12:02:36 <bildramer>         player.ypos += --a; flagA = true; break;
P12:02:36 <bildramer>     }
P12:02:37 <bildramer> }
P12:02:37 <bildramer> if (!flagA) { player.ypos += player.fallspeed; }
P12:02:41 <vede> Whoa there.
P12:02:46 <Ten_Tacles> LOL
P12:02:46 <bildramer> :P
P12:02:50 <vede> PM or pastebin that shit, man.
P12:03:00 <bildramer> oh, that's only 7 lines

P12:03:39 <PuyoDead> Don't care, pastbin it.

P12:06:34 <vede> Just doesn't seem like you should have to check for EVERY SINGLE PIXEL of fall distance for collisions. Just now I tried to devise a system by which it just moved the player the full distance, then corrected itself.
P12:06:43 <vede> But it didn't work out that well.

P6:41:52 <Visiiri{AFK}> This one has a microphone that actually works! omg!
P6:42:17 <Drakkar> I feel like I've honestly progressed
P6:42:23 <Drakkar> its a lovely feeling
P6:42:32 <Eagle> Drakkar, LD game? :O
P6:42:37 <Eagle> lemme see lemme see
P6:42:37 <Drakkar> yeah
P6:42:39 <Drakkar> fake though
P6:42:43 <Visiiri{AFK}> omfg.
P6:42:43 <Eagle> fake game?
P6:42:45 <Eagle> O_o
P6:42:46 <Drakkar> fake LD
P6:42:50 <Animator> LD Game?
P6:42:50 <Visiiri{AFK}> I was playing with my phone
P6:42:52 <Visiiri{AFK}> and now I'm pissed.
P6:42:56 <Eagle> Oh you're not actually in the contest
P6:42:58 <AndrewPH> Anybody want a Wuala invite?
P6:43:03 <Eagle> I would
P6:43:05 <Eagle> if uh
P6:43:08 <Visiiri{AFK}> It just asked0 "Do you want to call, modify, or create new?"
P6:43:08 <Eagle> I knew what Wuala is
P6:43:11 <Visiiri{AFK}> I said "No."
P6:43:12 <Drakkar> since NDA prevents me from sharing my game in any fashion beyond screenshots or video
P6:43:22 <Visiiri{AFK}> it says "Sorry, that is not a recognisable answer."
P6:43:31 <Drakkar> and it is REALLY UGLY RIGHT NOW
P6:43:55 <AndrewPH> Wuala is pretty much a rules-free filehost that is accessible using their client
P6:44:10 <Drakkar> but basically I took the theme of exploration and decided to make a sidescrolling game where you control a little pod exploring the interior of a crazy alien planet and collecting data
P6:44:14 <AndrewPH> also it has groups
P6:44:20 <AndrewPH> so you can have a bunch of people allowed to access files
P6:44:28 <Drakkar> you'd see stuff like the creatures of the planet interacting and stuff
P6:44:30 <Eagle> Sounds pretty cool but also sounds pretty not-entirely-real
P6:44:43 <Drakkar> I've actually got quite a bit of it done
P6:44:50 <Drakkar> mainly engine stuff though
P6:44:52 <Eagle> I was talking to Andrew, btw
P6:44:53 <Eagle> :P
P6:44:54 <Drakkar> oh
P6:44:55 <Drakkar> ok
P6:44:55 <Drakkar> xD
P6:44:58 <Eagle> XD
P6:45:11 <AndrewPH> Eagle, actually it's really pretty awesome
P6:45:16 <AndrewPH> I thought it was going to be shit
P6:45:22 <AndrewPH> but I was not dissapointed.
P6:45:38 <Drakkar> basically I've only given the player weapons sheerly as a deterrant
P6:45:46 <Drakkar> if you're shooting you're probably in trouble generally
P6:45:48 <AndrewPH> (It's like sex with a female god)
P6:45:49 <Visiiri{AFK}> Psh.
P6:45:56 <Visiiri{AFK}> I can't say "please"
P6:45:58 <Visiiri{AFK}> it kills my phone
P6:46:36 <Drakkar> the best thing though is I totally jacked the concept of an alphabet displayed on the walls and integrated it into part of the game
P6:46:47 <Joey-Jo0> How does having sex with a female god feel?
P6:46:50 <Drakkar> so you can't really finish the game until you've translated the alphabet 100% by scanning the letters
P6:46:53 <Joey-Jo0> And how do you know that?
P6:47:00 <AndrewPH> Because I've done it and it feels GODLY
P6:47:10 <Animator> I'm still looking for that coder.

P7:05:13 <Eagle> illegal immigration is when they skip the entire 'get registrated into the system' process
P7:05:17 <Eagle> and just jump the border
P7:05:33 <vede> Why would you do that?
P7:05:51 <Eagle> because they can't get in otherwise?

P7:06:08 <Eagle> not enough money, can't qualify, etc

P7:16:04 <Jat> also isnt it allowed in utah?
P7:16:13 <Lmaoboat> Unless you're royalty.
P7:16:27 <Jat> since utah is that crazy mormon state
P7:16:39 <EmpiresBane> i don't think it is
P7:16:44 <chariot> polygamy has never been legal in the US
P7:16:45 <Jat> oh
P7:16:46 <Jat> ok
P7:16:47 <EmpiresBane> they just let it slide though
P7:16:59 <chariot> that was a condition for letting Utah into the Union
P7:17:03 <Jat> and thats where all the creepy polygamy stfuf happens
P7:17:39 <vede> Polygamy: The condition or practice of having more than one spouse at one time.
P7:17:54 <vede> What about that is bad?
P7:18:06 <Jat> the ideologies that often go along with it
P7:18:16 <vede> I mean, if it can lead to bad things, that does not mean it should be illegal.

P7:19:19 <EmpiresBane> it's just something left over from our ancestors
P7:19:20 <Jat> im not saying polygamy should be illegal

P7:20:20 <Jat> like with religion or something
P7:20:33 <vede> Well, so?
P7:20:53 <EmpiresBane> did you really say that?
P7:20:55 <VurtualRuler98> Religious people in the country just wouldn't let it happen.
P7:21:14 <Jat> did i just say what?
P7:21:15 <vede> EmpiresBane, I was saying "so?" at the fact that polygame can LEAD to it, not it itself.
P7:21:19 <vede> >.>
P7:21:19 <Jat> oh
P7:21:24 <EmpiresBane> ok
P7:21:25 <vede> *polygamy
P7:21:42 <EmpiresBane> i was like, "wow, what a douche"
P7:21:45 <vede> Subjugation of women is a Bad Thing, but just because polygamy can lead to it does not make polygamy bad.
P7:21:57 <Jat> i didnt say polygamy was bad
P7:21:59 <vede> I mean, religion can lead to huge wars.
P7:22:15 <vede> Which is demonstrably worse than the subjugation of women.

P8:06:02 <mail2345|SMACX> jat has a point
P8:06:13 <EmpiresBane> not really
P8:06:15 <mail2345|SMACX> but the server gender ratio is unbalanced

P8:06:26 <mail2345|SMACX> 1:infinity
P8:06:32 <EmpiresBane> just run the server long enough and you'll find good people to op
P8:06:32 <mail2345|SMACX> err wait
P8:06:34 <mail2345|SMACX> 1:0
P8:06:36 <mail2345|SMACX> there
P8:06:40 <Aeomin> the character ingame doesn't have..gender
P8:06:44 <mail2345|SMACX> no
P8:06:50 <Jat> thats how it usually is on the internet except for in second life and other games that dont require work but allow women to show off their virtual bling shit
P8:06:51 <mail2345|SMACX> we know that they don't have gender
P8:06:55 <mail2345|SMACX> i'm talking about servers
P8:07:02 <mail2345|SMACX> there are no female servers
P8:07:09 <Aeomin> rare
P8:07:13 <mail2345|SMACX> some of them are transexual servers, but those don't count
P8:07:27 <Aeomin> ok then.. probably none
P8:07:32 <EmpiresBane> and how do you get a female server?
P8:07:58 <mail2345|SMACX> umm
P8:07:58 <VurtualRuler98> You find a female server, then breed servers constantly?
P8:08:02 <mail2345|SMACX> yea
P8:08:11 <Aeomin> lol
P8:08:14 <EmpiresBane> where could i find one?
P8:08:22 <mail2345|SMACX> well you could genetically splice out the Y chromosome
P8:08:33 <Aeomin> and gain /createserver command
P8:08:34 <Jat> go into a server room and find the loudest one
P8:08:35 <mail2345|SMACX> but you don't have anything to impregnate with
P8:08:36 <Jat> thats the female
P8:09:42 <Jat> a usb stick
P8:09:42 <mail2345|SMACX> Jat, that's a transsexual server
P8:09:43 <VurtualRuler98> No, find one with a nice, shiny, but pointless frame, and having some wires showing for no good reason.
P8:09:47 <VurtualRuler98> THAT is the female server.
P8:09:51 <mail2345|SMACX> the only female server is private
P8:10:16 <VurtualRuler98> Also, lots of ports, generally with other servers plugged into it.
P8:11:54 <EmpiresBane> hmm...
P8:12:02 <EmpiresBane> is tha possible?
P8:12:11 <EmpiresBane> breeding servers by connecting them?
P8:12:26 <EmpiresBane> then exciting them with users
P8:12:40 <VurtualRuler98> Well, a male server has lots of users on it.
P8:13:01 <VurtualRuler98> Then, it plugs into the female one, they both start doing work, and the male one sends the users to the fmelae.
P8:13:06 <VurtualRuler98> female*
P8:13:15 <VurtualRuler98> Then, they make a new computer appear somehow.
P8:13:28 <EmpiresBane> do you realize what this means?

P8:35:44 <Kratospie> if I ever move the mouse while moving around i hit 0fps
