A4:49:15 <Quatroking> I've got an idea
A4:49:24 <Quatroking> make a read-only subforum

A4:50:56 <citricsquid> death
A4:50:58 <Quatroking> why are dvd's so goddamn slow with burning
A4:51:49 <Akai> No... really. I think a friend of mine is lacking Java, because he says the applet doesn't even show up
A4:51:56 <Akai> there's just nothing there
A4:52:01 <Quatroking> Well
A4:52:04 <Quatroking> there you got your answer
A4:52:16 <Akai> so that means he doesn't have Java?
13A4:52:34 * Akai was expecting there to be some kind of message on the page saying "go get Java"

A5:04:36 <Super-Dot> The spawn prison in Redshift's Ocean Build is really classy, I think
A5:05:11 <Super-Dot> (normally, there wouldn't be a spawn prison, but there are no more ops online)

A5:19:53 <citricsquid> what's classy about it?
A5:21:01 <Super-Dot> It tells you why the prison is there, it defaults to showing you something cool, and it gives you a good view of the whole map
A5:21:55 <Super-Dot> I think these are failings in other spawn prisons

A5:22:09 <citricsquid> all spawn prisons that don't have active ops are fail
A5:22:29 <Super-Dot> The problem is that all the ops have gone to bed
A5:23:03 <Super-Dot> Hmm
A5:23:29 <Super-Dot> Since there's a backup script, maybe it would be better to just omit the spawn prison

A7:11:52 <Malcovent> would take some check
A7:11:57 <Malcovent> checking* but
A7:12:24 <peerkoel> how would you distinguish between someone clearing an area for a new building and someone destroying a building?
A7:13:26 <Malcovent> well im guessing, if something was destroyed, you just look at the blocks that were destroyed/etc.
A7:13:35 <Malcovent> hell you could even count blocks destroyed if you need to double check xDD

A7:18:37 <doohan> in 30 seconds!

A10:40:49 <SteGriff> LKA, expand on method?
A10:41:33 <LKA> in single player if you drop a sand block above a fluid, it'll fall to the bottom, but the fluid block it fell into replaces it so you have a block of water/lava floating in the sky
A10:42:08 <LKA> if it's left alone and you drop another block on it nothing bad will happen but if it spawns at like, ground level it can instantly flood, same if you build near it
A10:42:48 <citricsquid> aye, it was posted on the forum right after latest build was released :D

A11:59:45 <Angrybanana> Go to Control Panel > System > Environment Variables and edit the one named "PATH" to include the location of java.exe

P12:56:22 <peerkoel> you can also start the server with empty admins.txt, then op yourself from the server terminal

P12:58:51 <peerkoel> and you generate a new one if there is no server_level.dat file
P12:58:58 <peerkoel> when starting the server
P12:58:59 <Set> Oh okay. Cool.
P12:59:06 <citricsquid> To make a new map, delete server_level.dat and restart server.
P12:59:15 <peerkoel> correct

P1:03:48 <Angrybanana> there's a guide about that in the forum isnt there?

P10:02:11 <Jat> is the server really a complete server or is it sort of a middleman between the server and the client?
P10:02:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://redditpublic.com/ .... Right above the IRC, server stat monitor
P10:02:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jat, complete server apparently
P10:02:34 <Jat> oh ok cool
P10:02:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> he says he doesn't use the .dat format either :O
P10:02:53 <Jat> does that mean a converter is necessary to move maps from the official server to that server
P10:02:53 <Jat> ?
P10:02:58 <Jat> and back
P10:03:42 <Adura> Oh Al, just wait for the Lua API.
P10:03:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> probably... not that there is a converter
P10:03:56 <AlLnAtuRalX> Damn it Adura, I wanted a *java* API :(
P10:04:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> So I can actually use it while being lazy
P10:04:13 <Jat> a converter would probably be easy to write though :o
P10:04:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> Probably
P10:04:45 <Adura> I don't even know Lua.
P10:04:50 <Jat> although its not like most minecraft maps are so precious that you would absolutely HAVE to have an old one on your new server
P10:04:52 <Adura> Perhaps I should try to learn.
P10:05:12 <Jat> lua is meant to be easy to learn i think
P10:05:50 <Jat> so that would be a good thing for a scripting api

P10:11:24 <JTE> Hi Adura
P10:11:30 <Adura> Yop Jetty.
P10:11:36 <JTE> You already know Lua: It's a Perl wannabe.
P10:11:40 <Adura> Hah.
P10:11:54 <Adura> Hope it has a good regex syntax, then.
P10:12:06 <JTE> Its regex is pretty shitty. :(
P10:12:13 <Adura> Crap.
P10:12:26 <Adura> Can you add PCRE to it?
P10:12:42 <JTE> They like to use "%d" or whatever, instead of "\d"
P10:12:59 <Jat> wtf
P10:13:01 <Jat> why?
P10:13:05 <JTE> and then they still get it wrong in many matching situations.
P10:13:10 <Jat> why change stuff?
P10:13:21 <Adura> Crap...
P10:13:35 <JTE> Like you know how Perl will let you get away with /param="(.+)"/ and stuff like that most of the time?
P10:14:02 <JTE> Lua's version will see the . and match EVERYTHING OR NOTHING. So it will NEVER find anything because it can't find the trailing " because the . ate it.
P10:14:21 <Akai> Night all!

P10:15:20 <JTE> Heh.
P10:15:30 <Adura> Guess I'll have to hope there are PCRE implementations in Lua.
P10:15:38 <Animator> I'm serious. Instead of numbers, blocks.
P10:15:45 <Jat> is regex really that important for minecraft scripting?
P10:15:50 <Animator> It's the perfect Minecraft game, incredible.
P10:15:57 <JTE> With the Lua API, Adura, you'd probably be limited to what Notch allows you.
P10:15:59 <Adura> Well, there's chat in the game. So yeah.
P10:16:10 <Adura> Indeed Jetty.
P10:16:14 <JTE> But that doesn't stop me. :3
P10:16:22 <Animator> What is a jetty?
P10:16:26 <JTE> If I can so much as read and write to a txt file, I can interface with it.
P10:16:30 <Animator> Someone explain to me what is a jetty?
P10:16:44 <Jat> most things youll want to get out of chat will probably be fairly simple... unless lua really really fucked it up bad
P10:16:46 <Animator> Because I first found it in the wiki forum and it's bothering e.

P10:17:32 <Adura> Use of the Lua API would be the standard though.
P10:17:34 <Animator> I'm going to regret this. *googles*

P10:35:50 <Jat> i think it would be cool to have dynamic landscapes

P10:37:54 <liq3> :P
P10:38:00 <Jat> but you could also actually implement your own finite water with the lua scripting maybe...
P10:38:10 <liq3> you could...maybe...
P10:38:28 <liq3> ohhh that'd be fun!
P10:38:30 <Jat> but yeah dynamic environments would be cool

P10:38:35 <Jat> just trees that grow
P10:38:39 <liq3> ok i changed my mind. instead of spleef.
P10:38:41 <Adura> Initial release of the Lua API would likely cause much client lagging.
P10:38:43 <liq3> I'm going to make a CTF mod. :D
P10:38:49 <Jat> and being able to plant trees or watch a field of flowers or mushrooms spread
P10:39:06 <Prime_2> Hey, you know what would be cool?
P10:39:19 <Jat> and watching erosion actually happen gradually... especially as the players do things like rerouting water
P10:39:19 <liq3> CTF

P10:40:14 <liq3> Jat
P10:40:15 <Jat> since people can actually build and stuff
P10:40:21 <liq3> I'm mainly just thinking slightly mod Survival.
P10:40:22 <Jat> build your own fort
P10:40:28 <Jat> oh
P10:40:29 <liq3> Basically you'd have a single cloth block per team.
P10:40:40 <liq3> maybe give it to the owning team at the start.
P10:40:42 <liq3> they can put it anywhere.
P10:40:51 <liq3> give them like maybe 1 minute setup time.
P10:40:59 <liq3> and using Lua I could record when people have it. :P
P10:41:03 <liq3> and who has it.
P10:41:07 <liq3> and if they die make them 'drop' it.
P10:41:13 <liq3> you'd destroy the block to pick it up. :D
P10:41:47 <Kaidane> Does anyone know of any publicly released tile replacing tools?  I wrote one a few weeks ago but I'm not sure if I should release it or not.
P10:42:06 <Jat> aw free players wont be able to play server mods :(
P10:43:37 <liq3> they will in beta, I think.
P10:43:55 <liq3> Imo good thing they won't, stops griefers.
P10:43:58 <Jat> yeah but not when the game is released
P10:44:04 <liq3> Once the game is out I expect griefing to more or less die out completely.
P10:44:35 <Jat> and most likely every server will be using mods even if its just a sandbox so no more good free sandbox servers even :(
P10:44:48 <liq3> haha. :P
P10:46:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jat, Reddit Public?  We have a chance of welcoming free users :D

P10:49:22 <JTE> Silly Prime_2.
P10:49:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> Jat, probably maybe not
P10:49:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> :D
P10:49:35 <AlLnAtuRalX> probably not, unless they're far too useful to resist
P10:49:40 <AlLnAtuRalX> Which I doubt, especially at first
P10:49:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> But I don't want to commit here :P
P10:49:58 <Jat> you could still use stuff like aduras scripts instead though of course
P10:50:14 <Jat> or if jte releases his server then it doesnt matter
P10:50:19 <JTE> I like JTE's scripts more than adura's, no offense. :>
13P10:50:26 * JTE giggles
P10:50:28 <Jat> not that i would want to write mods in perl...
P10:50:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> JTE, AFAIC, that's vaporware :p
P10:50:52 <Jat> haha
P10:50:53 <AlLnAtuRalX> Adura's script is running our IRC bot as we speak :P
P10:51:16 <JTE> I has IRC bots too, but I don't see much point in having one for a server
P10:51:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> Come in #redditpublic and you'll see
P10:51:40 <JTE> My server already eats up way too much CPU as it is, Perl is terrible for such calculations required in block changing.
10P10:51:51 * Kaidane_ is now known as Kaidane
P10:52:05 <Jat> rewrite it in asm for maximum speed and readability

P10:52:13 <Adura> Jetty intends to.
P10:52:17 <JTE> Would you terribly mind if I use /demolish on your favorite servers, Jat? :3
P10:52:25 <Jat> whats demolish?...
P10:52:31 <JTE> Exactly what it sounds like.
P10:52:38 <Jat> i would prefer you not use it D:
P10:53:01 <AlLnAtuRalX> Luckily, we have /load... oh, wait
P10:53:58 <JTE> Heh. :3
P10:54:23 <Adura> Backups good.
P10:54:27 <Jat> release your server in an easily modable form jte
P10:54:36 <Jat> i would like to mod it :(
P10:55:11 <JTE> Notch still doesn't like the idea of me releasing my server at all, though I legally can.
P10:55:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> Backups good, bind errors bad
P10:55:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> JTE, accidentally back it up somewhere and accidentally paste the link.  Woops!
P10:55:49 <Jat> well of course he doesnt it allows you to basically take control of minecraft and make it so people dont have to pay him to play it :o
P10:55:58 <JTE> Besides, part of the reason I need to rewrite it in C is because Perl has no threading support and very little in the way of error catching,
P10:56:04 <JTE> so the server DIES on connection errors.
P10:56:45 <Jat> well whatever we will see if i buy the game when it is released
P10:57:16 <JTE> If I release it as Perl, I won't bother with any kind of plugin mechanism in the first place
P10:57:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just dedicate alll your time to Reddit Public
P10:57:18 <AlLnAtuRalX> lulz

P10:57:39 <Jat> lol not if its the only public server so it gets about 100 grifers per day
P10:57:40 <JTE> If I release it as a C program, it'll likely have major Lua scripting hooks everywhere.
P10:58:01 <Jat> what makes lua so good as a scripting language jte?
P10:58:08 <AlLnAtuRalX> Just open-source it so we can modify it directly?
P10:58:17 <Adura> Perl has threading support via Module, and Error catching.

P11:00:31 <JTE> Lua is terrible as a scripting language.
P11:00:39 <JTE> But it lets me limit what you can do with it easily enough.
P11:01:03 <JTE> I can't open source it, as much as I want to let you all at my beautifully crafted code.
