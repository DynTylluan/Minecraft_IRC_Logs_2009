A12:34:36 <Colain> It's what happens when two industries join together..
A12:35:01 <Colain> Acutally, It's Roadcrosser and Gdude.
A12:35:08 <asiekierka> THAT i knew about
A12:35:17 <mail2345> really arn't any good custom servers on right now :(
13A12:35:20 * asiekierka kills Colain for being a fricken LIAR
A12:35:23 <mail2345> JTE is hiding somewhere
A12:35:33 <asiekierka> And wanting me to pay $10 for his server
A12:35:38 <mail2345> WoM is still controlled by trolls
A12:35:43 <Colain> Two people are joining their idustries, I swear.
A12:35:48 <Colain> I'm not lying.
A12:35:51 <asiekierka> but not SECRET and GDUDE
A12:35:57 <mail2345> and the archives are broken
A12:36:04 <Colain> I'm sorry :/
13A12:36:05 * asiekierka kills mail for SAYING THE TRUTH
13A12:36:06 * Rodifan 's earphones fell into the soup.
A12:36:14 <asiekierka> Actually
A12:36:14 <Colain> I know the archives is broken, it's making me :(
A12:36:15 <mail2345> so yea, i wait
A12:36:16 <asiekierka> I should animate it
A12:36:18 <Rodifan> FAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
A12:36:26 <mail2345> for jte to make his server free
A12:36:33 <mail2345> for wom to be not controlled by trolls
A12:36:33 <Colain> JTE won't.
A12:36:39 <asiekierka> She will
A12:36:39 <asiekierka> for $10
A12:36:41 <mail2345> for aera to fix the archives
A12:36:42 <Colain> If JTE does, JTE's in for a surprise.
A12:36:46 <asiekierka> Told meh in the email
A12:37:11 <Colain> JTE said to me only for $10
A12:37:49 <mail2345> so uhh which is more likely
A12:38:09 <mail2345> JTE making his server freeware, or WoM ditching the troll admins.
A12:38:32 <asiekierka> I think the former needs an Infinite Improbability Device to happen
13A12:38:38 * asiekierka goes to build one
A12:38:45 <asiekierka> also
A12:38:47 <asiekierka> JTE IS A FEMALE
A12:38:58 <TrueWolves> also
A12:38:59 <asiekierka> THE TRUTH MUST GO OUT
A12:39:02 <TrueWolves> it's the internet
A12:39:04 <Colain> Oh no you didn't.
A12:39:07 <TrueWolves> gender don't even matter.
A12:39:12 <asiekierka> I know
A12:39:15 <asiekierka> But THE TRUTH MUST GO OUT
A12:39:17 <Colain> Fuck you asie.
A12:39:19 <TrueWolves> So it's a mute point.
A12:39:23 <asiekierka> INTERNET IS NOT COMMUNISM
A12:39:24 <liq3> TrueWolves: Unfortunately we need it to refer to people properly.
A12:39:36 <TrueWolves> oh, that part is not a problem
A12:39:37 <asiekierka> Oh wait... 42 is double red (2*21 (21 is code for red cloth))
A12:39:43 <mail2345> but wom ditching the trolls is also not likely
A12:39:45 <asiekierka> and red=socialism so 42 is DOUBLE SOCIALISM
A12:40:02 <TrueWolves> but how you refer to people shouldn't matter as much as people make it seem, for one, your not getting any on the internet for realz

A2:23:01 <Griskard> So
A2:23:06 <Griskard> Who here is excited?
A2:23:25 <Colain> AaaaAAAAaaaAAA is a great game.
A2:23:50 <Colain> Interesting fact: Griskard and My model have the same hair.
A2:24:13 <Griskard> Yeah :D
A2:24:24 <Griskard> Idenitcal actually
A2:24:27 <Griskard> To the pixel
A2:24:37 <Colain> I wouldn't say to the pixel..
A2:24:57 <Colain> It took me like 20 mins and 10 failed attempts to get that thing right.
A2:25:23 <Griskard> Ahh
A2:25:28 <Griskard> I thought you used your hair
A2:25:31 <Griskard> And added the crown
A2:25:32 <Colain> So, probably some difference there
A2:25:51 <Colain> I did use my hair, but failed attempts mean I had to recover some of the blocks.
A2:25:56 <Griskard> Wont be seeing me on any servers for a week or two :p
A2:26:13 <Griskard> Ill be trying survival over and over in different modes
A2:26:16 <Colain> :o
A2:26:18 <Colain> Ah.
A2:26:21 <Griskard> I might even try a pacifist one. 
A2:26:31 <Griskard> Not allowed to use weapons, only traps
A2:26:41 <Griskard> Non lethal traps :D
A2:26:59 <Colain> I don't think it'll be as good as sandbox, people fell in love with Sandbox, others quite liked the idea of survival, but the more I think about it, the more I want more things for sandbox.
A2:27:28 <Griskard> Im all for survival. To me its not so much about building anything, its overcoming challenges in uniqe wayes
A2:27:37 <Colain> Touche.
A2:27:46 <liq3> Colain: I hate sandbox. It's boring as fuck.
A2:27:52 <Colain> Haha Liq.
A2:27:56 <Griskard> Because I take the view that I can build anything given enough time. But if you add damage and enemys, and drowning
A2:28:01 <Griskard> It becomes so much harder
A2:28:10 <liq3> Yes, what Griskard is saying.
A2:28:17 <Griskard> Like building underwater citys too
A2:28:23 <Colain> Minecraft forever should be the sandbox game, survival should've been more an addon.
A2:28:23 <liq3> ! :D
A2:28:35 <liq3> Colain: Imagine sandbox, but with survival settings.
A2:28:36 <Griskard> Lately Ive been trying without using sponges and limiting myself to 15 seconds without air
A2:28:44 <liq3> You can no longer just build a massive tower, you need to mine first.
A2:28:52 <Colain> Touche.
A2:28:54 <liq3> Underwater cities become dangerous.
A2:28:58 <Griskard> And if you fall OFF the tower....
A2:29:04 <liq3> Lavacielings are REALLY dangerous.
A2:29:12 <Colain> I want sandbox with survival mode (Like, survival with instant build and delete etc)
A2:29:15 <liq3> YEs! No more chutes that are 200 tiles high. :P
A2:29:20 <Griskard> Colain
A2:29:24 <Colain> Yes?
A2:29:26 <Griskard> Would probably be possible
A2:29:32 <Griskard> With either settings or Lua
A2:29:37 <liq3> Oh...
A2:29:40 <Colain> Yeah, we should mention to Mr Selfish, I mean Notch.
A2:29:43 <liq3> You know what, it's possible to make an infinite amount stone!
A2:29:53 <Griskard> Hows that?
A2:29:57 <liq3> At least while water and lava is infinite is. :]
A2:30:01 <Griskard> Ahh
A2:30:03 <Griskard> Your right
A2:30:06 <Griskard> Haha
A2:30:11 <Griskard> I didnt think of that
A2:30:13 <Colain> The thing I love about survival is that we can build anything even if only one of each block was added.
A2:30:14 <liq3> :D
A2:30:28 <liq3> Colain: Glass should be made, by 'melting' sand.
A2:30:28 <liq3> ;]
A2:30:38 <liq3> So you basically put lava next t sand, and it turns to glass.
A2:30:44 <Griskard> Somehow I don't imagine I will run a singleplayer map out of stone to the point that I will need to make a stone farm
A2:30:48 <liq3> Bit unrealstic, but itd' work.
A2:31:00 <liq3> Griskard: Haha yeh. 
A2:31:05 <liq3> just you get maps like ocean build.
A2:31:11 <liq3> Where a stone farm near the bottom would be useful.
A2:31:18 <Griskard> On my RP server, the underwater city I am building will be the worlds main source of sand, at least early on
A2:31:39 <Griskard> Most maps lack it, and if you need it for glass, youll either have to get somone to bring it to where you want it, or go fetch it
A2:31:54 <Colain> Sounds dangerous

A2:31:59 <liq3> yeh.
A2:32:06 <liq3> Sand could be made by eroding rock with water.
A2:32:20 <Colain> I love how it's possible to create a submarine under water, but one slip up, you'll drown.
A2:32:26 <liq3> haha.
A2:32:51 <Xeros> you guys talking about survival?
A2:32:52 <Griskard> In an underwater city to, watertraps are needed everywhere
A2:33:00 <Griskard> So that when one guy accidently mines out a panel
A2:33:04 <Griskard> It wont kill everyone
A2:33:08 <Xeros> is survival out now?
A2:33:08 <Colain> Aye Xeros, we want a survival Sandbox mode, a mix of the both.
A2:33:20 <Colain> No...
A2:33:23 <Colain> Read the dev blog.
A2:33:36 <Colain> we were talking future tense.
A2:34:03 <Griskard> I tried it on one of my earlier ones. It was so funny. I backed up my map, Set my respawn in the main compound, traveled the 400 odd tiles away  (Multiple leveled and everything) and opened it
A2:34:11 <Xeros> oh I read that
A2:34:19 <Griskard> I tried finding a safe spot after pressing R, I almost made it before water got me
10A2:34:34 * TheOne is now known as TheOne-afk
A2:34:45 <Xeros> I wonder how fast drowning happens
A2:34:49 <Griskard> 15 seconds
A2:34:57 <Colain> What I think we should do is to create maps set for survival but before survival
A2:35:07 <Xeros> does your health go down or is it just instant after running out of breath?
A2:35:08 <Griskard> Multiplayer ones?
A2:35:13 <Griskard> HP goes down
10A2:35:16 * TheOne-afk (a@138.210.218.98) has left #minecraft
A2:35:20 <Griskard> 3 hearts at a time I think
A2:35:20 <Colain> Seeing as most monsters won't breathe underwater, that could also be a problem, underwater maps that is.
A2:35:33 <Griskard> Sharks, Squid, Turtle and whale
A2:35:43 <Xeros> aww that's strange... there should be at least a "breath" bar or something before health goes down...to at least swim
A2:35:48 <Griskard> It does
A2:35:53 <Colain> It'll be fun, but lack of monsters underwater will make it less fun (then just trying to survive with water)
A2:35:57 <Griskard> Have you watched the latest vid?
A2:36:03 <Xeros> nope
A2:36:11 <Colain> and if we have unlimited everything and instantbuild and destroy, it'll be fun still.
A2:36:26 <Griskard> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-0CF6mPBSE
A2:36:26 <Colain> There is a breath thing...
A2:36:36 <Griskard> Im more of a hardcore guy
A2:36:38 <Colain> I read the dev blog every day... same with Quatroking's blog.
A2:37:05 <Colain> Griskard, might you have a server of your own with Archive's powers?
A2:37:13 <Colain> That is, portal powers (not really any others)
A2:37:15 <Griskard> I will
A2:37:25 <Colain> Hmm...
A2:37:28 <Colain> I dislike that idea.
A2:37:32 <Griskard> Eventually. Once I find someone capable of modding. I dont really have the time

A2:38:05 <Griskard> Well you simply cant get an actual RPG world without them
A2:38:12 <Colain> Oh well, but, main server, you could have a village with big fences and can only delete into.
A2:38:13 <Griskard> Not the size needed
A2:38:41 <Griskard> Building/destroying will be limited based on the rights given to the person
A2:38:46 <Colain> Really, all you need is portal powers and the non-deleting in locked world (hunting)
A2:39:19 <Colain> If you have your two worlds, one locked, you can pre-build a village (not finished)
A2:39:47 <Griskard> Like, on clan servers noone other than clan members will be allowed to place/delete, unless your planning an attack, which you will have to inform me about beforehand so I can give you those rights
A2:39:59 <Colain> Just have a giant fence so it's hard for monsters to come in...
A2:40:30 <Griskard> Well the idea is I let players do it themselves. Give it a bit of a feel of having to work to overcome things
A2:40:42 <Griskard> All the basic maps will start with something
A2:40:43 <Colain> Or Griskard, you could make people spawn in hunters place.
A2:40:49 <Griskard> They do
A2:41:08 <Colain> Griskard, think multiplayer, there will probably be non-stop spawning monsters.
A2:41:30 <Griskard> Thats the idea, you spawn in the lodge or whatever its called, and there there will be somewhere (An NPC or something) to talk to, a basic shop, and a fenced walkway out
A2:41:33 <Colain> You at least need a small pre-built village.
A2:41:44 <Colain> You wanna go all out?
A2:41:56 <Griskard> And certain players will be given rights in that place to build and destroy
A2:42:01 <Colain> NPC's might be too hard...
A2:42:16 <Griskard> As members of the hunters guild (or whatever it gets called
A2:42:18 <Colain> You could probably use real guys, I'd gladly stand around and run a stop for multiplayer.
A2:42:18 <Griskard> )
A2:42:49 <Griskard> NPCs shouldnt be too hard assuming Notch has some basic interaction in there already
A2:42:57 <Griskard> Real guys will "Run" places
A2:43:17 <Griskard> For example, lets assume I start as the "Ruler" of the start kingdom
A2:43:20 <Colain> I don't think that's what Notch is going for...
A2:43:31 <Griskard> And in my jurisdiction is a hunting area, a mining area and something
A2:44:10 <Colain> Hmm.
A2:44:18 <Griskard> Well I would delegate people to run those areas. Ultimately players would make their own. After "paying" for the map (A set fee for map sizes and such, like 200 stone, this that or whatever)
A2:44:34 <Colain> Think of what is possible, if you can get hold of the archive's system and stuff...
A2:44:51 <Griskard> I have (Thought of what is possible, that is)

A2:46:50 <Griskard> Once I get a taste of survival I will get a forums up
A2:47:03 <Griskard> Where I will post ideas, current starting map files and so forth
A2:47:29 <Colain> Can you run a server?
A2:47:53 <Griskard> I will be paying for a proper server
A2:48:20 <Colain> Haha.
A2:48:32 <Colain> Thats going to cost a bit.
A2:48:48 <Griskard> For a server twice the archives power its about 50 bucks a month
A2:49:45 <liq3> You know what'd be really, really fun?
A2:49:45 <Xeros> how much do servers cost if you just buy one with the same power?
A2:49:53 <Colain> Wiw,
A2:49:56 <Colain> *Wow
A2:50:00 <liq3> Lava Survival. Basically, mass flooding lava combined with Survival mode settings.
A2:50:14 <Colain> That would be fun Liq3. Real lava survival map.
A2:50:15 <liq3> Last Man standing wins. ;]
A2:50:20 <Griskard> Buying one? Not alot, maybe 800 bucks
A2:50:37 <Griskard> But the bandwidth would cost as much as renting a server :p
A2:50:39 <Xeros> Guess it depends on how long you plan on having teh server!
A2:50:48 <Xeros> ohh
A2:51:34 <liq3> Colain: Oh, must not forget perma death. :]
A2:51:35 <Xeros> in other news, I have a feeling "typedef" is a useful thing..
A2:51:43 <liq3> No respawning in this! :D
A2:52:01 <Xeros> I wouldn't mind an option for even.. 1 extra life
A2:52:40 <Colain> I think in Multiplayer, it won't be perma death unless stated.
A2:52:40 <Xeros> or how about just... a really long respawn time? Like... "wait till tomorrow" lol
A2:52:56 <liq3> Colain: Well that's what I mean. You have like a single 
A2:53:00 <Griskard> In multiplayer there will probably be ressurection
A2:53:09 <liq3> "map". And when everyone dies (except one), it restarts, loading the map.
A2:53:16 <Xeros> there should be little gravestones :P
A2:53:17 <liq3> For Lava Survival. :P
A2:53:27 <Griskard> For lava survival it would be a no respawn
A2:53:28 <liq3> The other option might be to make dead people "lava monsters".
A2:53:31 <Colain> Hard to see them for lava survival..
A2:53:33 <Griskard> But hopefully you could spectate
A2:53:43 <liq3> Make them unable to dig.
A2:53:47 <Colain> Yeah, lava monsters, can delete stuff and see through lava :D
A2:53:48 <Xeros> spectate sounds fun...
A2:53:51 <Griskard> Haha
A2:53:52 <liq3> But they can chat, move full speed, see properly in lava, and attack.
A2:54:02 <Griskard> But if they cant dig
A2:54:05 <Griskard> It wouldnt matter
A2:54:07 <liq3> Nah, no digging!
A2:54:15 <Griskard> Because if someones in the lava, they are dead anyway
A2:54:27 <liq3> Griskard: what?
A2:54:37 <Colain> Lava survival doesn't work without lava having no way to get in.
A2:54:47 <Xeros> maybe lava monsters can jump out of the lava.. but being out of the lava is like drowning :O
A2:55:01 <liq3> That's kinda what I was thinking.
A2:55:08 <Griskard> Well think about it, if they cant break stuff
A2:55:15 <Griskard> They arent gonna hurt the normal people
A2:55:23 <liq3> Give them an attack. :P
A2:55:25 <liq3> possible a fireball. :D
A2:55:29 <Xeros> maybe it should take them a good length of time to destroy blocks
A2:55:31 <Griskard> Because they cant get inside, and the others cant come out into the lava
A2:55:43 <Colain> No way for the lava to get in then... gay.
A2:55:46 <liq3> Griskard: Yes, but you just let them tell the living players, where each other are. :P
A2:56:00 <liq3> ohhhh.
A2:56:03 <liq3> hrm.
A2:56:06 <Colain> Lava monsters could have a slower attack rate.
A2:56:19 <liq3> Colain: i'd expect they'd win in a fight.
A2:56:35 <liq3> I'm thinking they just have a fireball.
A2:56:41 <Xeros> lava should rise up one layer every 2 minutes... and you can build a "lava tight" fort if you wanted.. but if lava monsters could slowly break away blocks ooh
A2:56:41 <liq3> Not very powerful, slow, but it's ranged. :]
A2:56:51 <Colain> Nah, but they can dig with the slower attack rate, so they try get the players to become lava monsters
A2:56:53 <liq3> Xeros: THAT'S PERFECT.
A2:56:59 <liq3> Make lava monsters break blocks more slowly!
A2:57:06 <Colain> THATS WHAT I SAID
A2:57:10 <liq3> Colain: You did?
A2:57:11 <Colain> Attack = DIGGING
A2:57:16 <liq3> Colain: Slowly... :P

A2:57:33 <Xeros> NotchIsNotTwittering
A2:57:42 <asiekierka> YesHeIsDammit
A2:57:45 <Xeros> hehe
A2:57:51 <Colain> I said that earlier
A2:58:19 <liq3> Ohhhh. I want this lava survival mode now. :D

A2:59:01 <liq3> Colain: Drop it? :P
A2:59:23 <liq3> Man, lava survival would be AWESOME. :]
A2:59:29 <Xeros> For some reason I thought of a new version of Spleef.... 3 levels, each floor is made of glass so you can see above and below... you can also destroy glass blocks above you.... the lowest level would be water of course still
A3:00:02 <liq3> You know what'd be truly awesome (and mindbending)?
A3:00:05 <liq3> 3d spleef.
A3:00:11 <Xeros> so if you fall down 1 floor.. you can continue to try and get people above you
A3:00:30 <liq3> Played on an inverted cube. :]
A3:00:36 <liq3> And if you go near the edge, you switch gravity.

A3:01:11 <Colain> I thought of that before too.
A3:01:16 <Xeros> 3d? hmm.. ooh or how about... gravity spleef... the floor, all the walls, and the ceiling are all able to be walked on.. but each one acts like a floor and you'll fall... the center of the arena is the "up" area
A3:01:17 <Colain> It's quite a common thought
A3:01:18 <Griskard> Its interesting, but it gets boring fast
A3:01:19 <Genida> Anyone here have access to Moep's Server's whitelist?
A3:01:21 <Colain> I made water spleef.

A3:02:10 <Xeros> lolz
A3:02:26 <liq3> and if you go near the edge, so, a different 'face', gravity changes.
A3:02:31 <liq3> So it's always pointing OUT of the cube. :]
A3:02:36 <Xeros> indeed
A3:02:45 <Colain> Yay, lets all steal what other people are saying and make it easier to understand!
A3:02:50 <liq3> Honestly, I want a minecraft level like that! :P
A3:03:10 <Xeros> or the other way around too(which might be easier) where the center of the cube is down... I'd call it "black hole spleef"
A3:03:18 <liq3> lol.
A3:03:20 <liq3> XD
A3:03:25 <aeiowu> that's gross

A3:04:06 <Xeros> omg you know that video where the people recreated EARTH in minecraft???
A3:04:11 <liq3> no.
A3:04:21 <Xeros> you could actually make the earth have realistic gravity because it'd be in the middle of it! haha

A3:05:36 <Colain> You realise, theres a 3-d conversion program, right?
A3:06:09 <liq3> yes.
A3:06:18 <Xeros> I kinda wish minecraft blocks had more realistic blocks sometimes... like they can't actually "float" in mid-air... and would fall down
A3:06:33 <Xeros> maybe make it mario-ish.. you jump on it.. it shakes for a bit and then falls :P
A3:06:42 <liq3> lol...
A3:06:49 <Griskard> Yeah, I got my penis cat scanned, then I imported it to minecraft. Unfortunately Minecraft cannot handle map sizes that big....
A3:06:58 <liq3> Xeros: There's 2 ways to do that. One is DF way, other is realistic physics.

A3:08:23 <liq3> Wow, biggest BS story ever.
A3:08:47 <liq3> It was made by Redshift using his Sphere script. :/
A3:09:34 <Colain> I believe the Earth and Notre Dame wern't actually created all by hand.
A3:09:59 <Colain> I believe that they use programs and edit a little bit.
A3:11:26 <Xeros> I was wondering how someone could possible create a sphere lol
A3:11:39 <Xeros> it was too good of a sphere too lol
A3:11:54 <Xeros> score += 100;
A3:12:08 <liq3> Xeros: Done with a python script.

A6:10:17 <ZomBuster> true
A6:10:25 <citricsquid> http://twitter.com/citricsquid I'm awesome.
A6:10:31 <Enigma> Suggestion: "Prop protection". Each built block contains an ID of the player who built it. Each player has a list of trustees (which includes themselves). If you are NOT on a player's list, you are not allowed to remove or build next to any block made by that player.
A6:10:38 <Enigma> I'll post it in the forums, too.
A6:10:40 <Quatroking> citricsquid god your background aargh
A6:10:44 <Enigma> Strange, it isn't coming up in search
A6:10:45 <citricsquid> Enigma: been suggested many times
A6:10:49 <citricsquid> will NEVER be implemented.
A6:10:49 <ZomBuster> but some of those celeb people are all like "omg twitter" and don't know what a fucking blog is so they spam 20 tweets in a row
A6:11:05 <Enigma> Never be implemented?
A6:11:14 <citricsquid> well, I don't expect it to happen
A6:11:18 <citricsquid> and hope it doesn't.
A6:11:20 <Quatroking> zombuster: adults these days don't know shit about internet
A6:11:28 <citricsquid> It's a horrible idea, removes ALL freedom from minecraft.
A6:11:34 <Enigma> Hm. What about "Query an open space or block to show who last removed from, or built in, this spot"
A6:11:42 <Enigma> That should work for identifying griefers.

A6:13:39 <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmjJ_aN3sCg (dutch vid starts with 4chan)
A6:13:41 <Enigma> All you'd have to do is store the "Last interacted with" playerID in the box. Are PlayerIDs really that long?
A6:13:42 <citricsquid> Each block would have to have the name of the person attached in the map file, it's not viable.
A6:14:01 <Roadcrosser> ...
A6:14:07 <Enigma> So griefing is merely a technical limitation!
A6:14:11 <Enigma> Good to know.
A6:14:25 <citricsquid> Enigma: a good OP can stop griefing :)
A6:14:25 <liq3> No, it's a limitation of human intelligence :P
A6:14:38 <Quatroking> citricsquid, that vid is the news covering it
A6:14:41 <liq3> Enigma: You bought the game?
A6:14:53 <ZomBuster> maybe someone here knows a simple GUI lib for c++
A6:15:03 <Enigma> Nope. I'm not buying a game whose design policies differ markedly to mine. (permissive vs. restrictive)
A6:15:05 <citricsquid> There is no viable technical way to stop griefing. The only way would be to stop all player interaction; you can't trust humans.
A6:15:26 <citricsquid> Enigma: Play on the premium only server :)
A6:15:26 <liq3> Enigma: Oh, I was gonna link to you premium only server. There's like, no griefing at all.
A6:15:34 <Enigma> But if it's just a tech limitation, and this is just an alpha, it'll be fixed some time.

A6:27:13 <Marach> thats really no difference if you dont use your own namespaces
A6:27:32 <Marach> usingnamespace std; uses WHOLE std namespace

A6:27:51 <Marach> there are plaenty of them you will know
A6:27:54 <Xeros> ohh 'your own namespaces' huh? Maybe that's to prevent it from using a different namespace that has the same word for using it?
A6:28:08 <Marach> youre right
A6:28:14 <Marach> thats why are namespaces for
A6:28:15 <Xeros> finally I'm right on a guess haha

A7:53:53 <Xeros> for anyone who knows C++, just wondering. I know you can do some sort of 'typedef' thing... but is it possible to turn a section of code into one word? like could I turn 'cout << "Hello World"' into the word 'heyWorld' or something? lol

A7:55:40 <Xeros> Actually now that I think of it... isn't that kind of what higher level languages do sort of? Or any language? They take a big long line of code and have it used with one word?

A8:01:09 <Xeros> ?
A8:01:38 <ChJees> Ausfriend, more specific?
A8:02:20 <Ausfriend> everyone i know uses 'Hello World' when talking about an example of code or whatever
A8:02:27 <Ausfriend> i see it literally everywhere
A8:02:34 <ChJees> Simple program
A8:02:38 <Ausfriend> textbooks, webpages, colleagues,
A8:02:57 <Xeros> Well the Hello World thing is usually the first program someone learns to write... I think. At least it's usually at the beginning of a lot of books and tutorials I see
A8:02:59 <ChJees> A nice way to start off your programming career :3
A8:03:00 <citricsquid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program
A8:03:39 <ChJees> You don't start right away with Entity systems :P
A8:03:55 <Ausfriend> Yeah, hello world was my first program too, but i never really understood how it was hard to create an interface with a button that produces a popup
A8:04:18 <ChJees> ?
A8:04:25 <ChJees> In C\C++ it is :3
A8:04:54 <ChJees> Way easier to print out stuff into Console
A8:05:07 <Xeros> Hey I didn't understand a THING about programming until I learned some of the lingo, even Hello world confused me I was like "wtf is cout? wtf is int?"
A8:05:16 <ChJees> :P
A8:05:40 <Xeros> "wtf is ftw?"

A10:28:54 <Darkebrz> Niggy: We can help you
A10:28:54 <Marach> its not a big game
A10:28:59 <Niggy> I cant go in my server 
A10:29:02 <Marach> look at wikipedia page
A10:29:10 <Darkebrz> Explain?
A10:29:12 <Niggy> if i start it it says connecting
A10:29:22 <Darkebrz> Link to your server?
A10:29:24 <Marach> verify-names=false
A10:29:28 <Niggy> and then it says too long to wait
A10:29:32 <Niggy> ok
A10:29:32 <Darkebrz> Marach: No no no
A10:29:36 <Niggy> i try

A10:29:58 <Darkebrz> Its a bad idea
A10:30:04 <Marach> trying
A10:30:07 <Niggy> what is verify names
A10:30:21 <Darkebrz> Your problem isn't verify names
A10:30:27 <Darkebrz> You need to forward your ports...
A10:30:30 <aera> Niggy: with it turned off, anyone can connect to your server as anyone else
A10:30:34 <Zuriki> Dark, why did you say my name?
A10:30:40 <Marach> i cant connect too
A10:30:49 <Darkebrz> Because, SP survival is only for premium members
A10:30:56 <Zuriki> Yes...
A10:30:59 <Zuriki> What about it>
A10:31:00 <Niggy> I were able to go on my computer 4days ago
A10:31:10 <Niggy> but not the last 3 days
A10:31:13 <Darkebrz> MP survival will be premium only, this one is pretty much a fact.

A11:51:28 <ZamBuster> never heard of that
A11:51:33 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking, old news
A11:51:35 <citricsquid> Quatroking: The deal is done already
A11:51:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> this morning old
A11:51:38 <citricsquid> you're about 5 hours late
A11:51:46 <Quatroking> I've been downstairs all day
A11:51:50 <citricsquid> just need share holder approval, which will obviously go through.
A11:51:53 <Quatroking> due to new bathroom

A11:52:06 <Quatroking> Well, that sucks a lot.
A11:52:13 <Quatroking> Considering disney makes shit movies
A11:52:32 <Quatroking> except for wall-e
A11:52:43 <PuyoDead> did you read the lovely "statement"?
A11:52:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Wall-E was Pixar, of course it was good
A11:52:51 <PuyoDead> "It presents Disney a unique opportunity to strengthen its strategic position as a leading global provider of high-quality branded content. It also represents a meaningful growth opportunity across Disney's many complementary businesses and we believe Marvel can help us build significant long-term shareholder value." 
A11:52:52 <Quatroking> puyodead: nope
A11:53:02 <Quatroking> so
A11:53:07 <PuyoDead> I'm convinced CEOSpeak = Newspeak
A11:53:15 <Quatroking> "we're buying marvel so we have at least SOMETHING good"
A11:53:28 <Quatroking> is what they're saying
A11:53:33 <offset> Disney does fine alone
A11:53:34 <liq3> Puyodead: High quality branded content? hahahahaha

A11:53:47 <citricsquid> they're saying "marvel has lots of money making things, if we combine it with ours we can make more lol"
A11:54:06 <citricsquid> they're not going to ruin any comics, they'll just use spiderman etc. in their games/films, probably.
A11:54:08 <offset> Why fight the competition when you can buy them :)
A11:54:18 <Quatroking> I love to think of paying actualling lolling at those things
A11:54:34 <PuyoDead> it's like their own secret language, and you're only seen as "upper management material" if you speak said language
A11:54:42 <Quatroking> "so basically, we from blizzard bought activision because they're pretty awesome lol"
A11:55:09 <Quatroking> the news would be 500% better with internet slang
A11:55:20 <ZamBuster> not really..

P12:08:35 <PuyoDead> mame?
P12:08:40 <Xeros> actually it is a scary game.. idk.. despite it being some.. spacey shooterish thing it's...scary.. probably the noises and constant pitch rising of "boo boop...boo boop"

P4:17:26 <AlexVMiner> you can't get it, sorry

P4:17:49 <vede> Whoa...
P4:17:50 <Bndit> They will only buy from trusted sites
P4:17:57 <Real> find a friend or some other adult and give them the money to do it

P4:18:01 <vede> Minecraft=definitely trusted
P4:18:02 <Real> paypal isn't trusted?

P4:18:10 <Dilt> Bndit: have you considered uhh
P4:18:11 <Bndit> thats the problem 
P4:18:11 <AlexVMiner> then when it is all complete
P4:18:12 <Bndit> they had paypal
P4:18:16 <Bndit> someone hacked there account
P4:18:17 <Dilt> a visa gift card?
P4:18:17 <AlexVMiner> the numbers are gone
P4:18:25 <Real> someone hacked their account haha
P4:18:34 <Real> they probably gave information out

P4:18:38 <AlexVMiner> real, stop being rude
P4:18:43 <AlexVMiner> :D
P4:18:44 <Real> phishing sites and the like
P4:18:44 <Bndit> not really
P4:18:49 <Bndit> all they need is an email
P4:18:54 <Bndit> and then to find out the password
P4:19:01 <Bndit> phising or password recovery featuers
P4:19:03 <Real> what, middle-aged people are not known to be technologically savvy
P4:19:05 <AlexVMiner> wait
P4:19:11 <AlexVMiner> how did they see their email?
P4:19:21 <Bndit> you use your email for many websites
P4:19:30 <AlexVMiner> yeah
P4:19:37 <AlexVMiner> but they don't get the password for it...
P4:19:42 <Bndit> again
P4:19:42 <Dilt> example, take a quiz on facebook, it instantly has your e-mail, your personal info, all of your friend's personal info...
P4:19:45 <Bndit> password recovery features
P4:19:53 <Dilt> and AlexVMiner, consider that most passwords are simple things
P4:19:54 <Real> anyway bndit if they are paranoid just find someone else you know with paypal (older friend, friend's parents, other relative) and give them money to do it
P4:19:56 <Dilt> like apple23
P4:20:05 <Bndit> I was thinking a pre-paid credit card
P4:20:09 <AlexVMiner> well
P4:20:11 <Dilt> additionally
P4:20:15 <AlexVMiner> that is dumb to do
P4:20:17 <Bndit> just have my parents buy the pre-paid and use that
P4:20:19 <AlexVMiner> have a password like:
P4:20:22 <greenslimy> guys, off topic question, i'm in Central time, when will the Survival thing be for me?
P4:20:22 <Dilt> some people tend to actually write in their mother's maiden name for password recovery features
P4:20:25 <AlexVMiner> digimon3875
P4:20:25 <greenslimy> About an hour?
P4:20:27 <Dilt> (it's easier to guess than a real password)
P4:20:35 <Bndit> lol
P4:20:35 <Dilt> greenslimy: we don't know
P4:20:35 <Real> greenslimy: go to the dev blog..

P4:20:41 <Dilt> he might release at 11:59 PM his time
P4:20:42 <Bndit> anyway
P4:20:43 <Bndit> guys
P4:20:49 <Bndit> would a pre-paid credit card work?
P4:20:57 <Real> it could
P4:21:01 <Real> if set up correctly

P4:57:19 <Clamps> tru
P4:57:33 <Azjherben> It's an image file I made, and use
P4:57:38 <Clamps> no one cares about azjherben images this is fartchat2009
P4:57:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> any major differences between the preexisting ones?
P4:57:50 <Azjherben> No, this is SPARTA. I mean #minecraft
P4:57:54 <Azjherben> Yup
P4:57:56 <Marach> hmm it has some compression?
P4:58:03 <Marach> format
P4:58:09 <Azjherben> I'm going to make the compression very good
P4:58:12 <Clamps> its prob a .bmp renamed
P4:58:19 <Azjherben> wrong
P4:58:22 <Marach> ...!
13P4:58:24 * ChJees raeps Clamps
P4:58:25 <Azjherben> it's the oppisite of a bmp
P4:58:33 <Clamps> so a pmb
P4:58:35 <Marach> gif
P4:58:50 <Azjherben> a bmp stores a color value between 0 and 255, three for each tiny pixel
P4:58:54 <Marach> its like flac for wav?
P4:58:56 <Azjherben> So bmp files are huge!
P4:59:17 <Azjherben> Mine has 5 base colors, white black red blue and green.
P4:59:20 <ChJees> Use png lol
P4:59:29 <ChJees> If files are hueg!11
P4:59:49 <AnnihilatorBeta> i prefer png myself
P4:59:57 <Marach> me too

P5:00:09 <Azjherben> Yeah.
P5:00:14 <LG_Legacy> You must die
P5:00:23 <Marach> supports everything i would want
P5:00:34 <Azjherben> Although, I did get a 400 * 400 image, to olny a few hundred bytes.
P5:00:53 <Marach> with no quality loss?
P5:01:02 <Azjherben> That's the thing.
P5:01:04 <AnnihilatorBeta> any insurance coverage?
P5:01:14 <Azjherben> It's with each pixel preserved.
P5:01:20 <Clamps> so i wanted to make a .fart image file what would i do
P5:01:25 <Azjherben> But, it olny has five defined colors.
P5:01:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> 1. fart
P5:01:42 <Marach> 2. fart?
P5:01:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> 2. receive image?
P5:01:53 <Azjherben> 0x00 being black 0x01 white 0x02 red 0x03 green and 0x04 blue
P5:01:56 <Marach> 3. fart
P5:02:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> tarf
P5:02:09 <Clamps> why say 0x03 instead of 0x3
P5:02:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> because it sounds cooler that way

P5:02:40 <Visiiri> lmao
P5:02:48 <Azjherben> Wait, what if I made .azji files animatable!
P5:02:53 <Marach> i dont understand, you use whole 4 bytes anyway
P5:02:59 <ZomBuster> I just like water so much
P5:03:14 <Azjherben> A hex byte can be from 0x00 to 0xFF
P5:03:26 <Azjherben> and still olny take one byte of space
P5:03:28 <Clamps> so your image files have 5 colors and thats it?

P5:03:56 <Azjherben> and technically yes clamps, however blue pixel+red pixel = purple

P5:04:23 <ZomBuster> I bet a 5 colors PNG is still smaller
P5:04:28 <Azjherben> But combining colors works very well
P5:04:46 <Azjherben> besides, there arn't 5 color pngs

P5:10:22 <Marach-afk> well, if i knew its all red, i would not store it in image
P5:10:51 <Marach-afk> but created it dynamically
P5:10:56 <Azjherben> okay
P5:10:59 <Marach-afk> see .kkrieger
P5:11:01 <Azjherben> it's actually 400 bytes
P5:11:05 <vede> If I had to store an all-red image, I could prolly do it in less than 10 bytes.
P5:11:18 <Azjherben> I got an all red 500*500 image in less than 400 bytes
P5:11:21 <Azjherben> UNcompressed

P5:12:32 <yoshibot> just the R value
P5:12:35 <Azjherben> Compressed, it's 11 bytes vs 282 for png.
P5:12:41 <ZomBuster> 11 bytes is good

P7:02:23 <greenslimy> And stuff right
P7:02:28 <Darkebrz> Its either 1 AM or 12 AM
P7:02:54 <Darkebrz> Its 12AM for him
P7:03:06 <Darkebrz> GMT
P7:03:17 <liq3> 11:45pm sweden is like 10am for me, WEDNESDAY.
P7:03:48 <Darkebrz> Yep
P7:03:52 <Darkebrz> ITs like 8 PM for me
P7:04:02 <vede> Hrm.
P7:04:09 <Darkebrz> But I CANT WAIT FOR SURVIVAL
P7:04:20 <Darkebrz> About half of that is the faster processing :3
P7:04:23 <vede> So Notch has gone and used the tall, thin, hard-to-edit texture image.
P7:04:35 <liq3> vede: eh/
P7:04:36 <liq3> ?

P7:04:41 <vede> On the blog.
P7:04:49 <liq3> He's talling the same old textures we have now...
P7:04:52 <vede> Normally he uses the 16x16 block texture image.
P7:04:53 <liq3> tiling*
P7:05:10 <vede> But now, he's using the one that's 1x256 block image.
P7:05:21 <david21> meaning
P7:05:26 <vede> So the terrain.png we'll have to edit will be REALLY tall.
P7:05:32 <vede> Not of a normal, square size.
P7:05:50 <vede> (If you want to make custom texture packs.)
P7:05:59 <liq3> Vede: No, I think he made some overly large 256x256 texture, that's tiled.
P7:06:12 <Zachariasmith> do u think it will still read the old ones?
P7:06:13 <liq3> And he can use sections of it.
P7:06:15 <vede> He already has a 1x256 texture.
P7:06:33 <vede> So when he "moves" over on the x axis, it just reiterates to the same image.
P7:07:12 <Darkebrz> TBut by turning the atlas from a 16x16 grid to a 1x256 grid
P7:07:33 <Azjherben> I'm back
P7:07:45 <Darkebrz> THIS SHOW I AM WATCHING IS NOW FUNNY
P7:08:05 <vede> tallterrain.png is already in minecraft.jar, it's just not used.

P7:08:59 <Darkebrz> Oh great -_-

P7:09:41 <liq3> he has a griefer list?
P7:09:53 <Evil-Ville> That's exactly the kind of person who would make a griefer list to begin with

P10:16:21 <Fonzi_254> us aussies
P10:16:21 <geekahedron> it was all in caps
P10:16:28 <geekahedron> it looked like "US Aussies"

P10:58:55 <Zachariasmith> you have to keep track of so much manually
P10:59:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> minecraft would be good for lots of other things as well
P10:59:17 <vede> Yeah, that's kind of a drag, but if you don't use so many rules or numbers, it's a lot better.

P11:03:51 <PrinceOfFire59> Coming from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesnt return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (its a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print:
P11:03:52 <PrinceOfFire59> >>> fib(0)
P11:03:52 <PrinceOfFire59> >>> print fib(0)
P11:03:52 <PrinceOfFire59> None

P11:05:59 <PrinceOfFire59>         if ok in ('y', 'ye', 'yes'): return True
P11:05:59 <PrinceOfFire59>         if ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'): return False
P11:05:59 <PrinceOfFire59>         retries = retries - 1
P11:06:01 <PrinceOfFire59>         if retries < 0: raise IOError, 'refusenik user'

P11:44:24 <liq3> Darkebrz: I'm mainly just thinhking Versus MP Survival.
P11:44:34 <Darkebrz> Yeah...
P11:44:37 <liq3> and people like start a mining operation for stone, and start using it to make a defensive fort.
P11:44:40 <Darkebrz> Castle would have to be a pretty small map though
P11:44:53 <liq3> I mean, ore takes the longest to dig.
P11:45:00 <liq3> So ore would be the BEST for walls and stuff.
P11:45:00 <Darkebrz> actually, a small and long map would be good
P11:45:04 <Darkebrz> Yeah :D

P11:45:23 <liq3> and you have guys ontop of the wall pelting them with arrows. :D
P11:45:35 <gordenfreechmen> ya know what would be cool
P11:45:56 <liq3> and then assaults... Like digging right into the enemy fort.
P11:45:59 <liq3> Mining under it. :D
P11:46:09 <Darkebrz> This sounds awesome
P11:46:12 <Darkebrz> Channeling lava

P11:46:17 <liq3> You dig like 3 under their fort.
P11:46:23 <liq3> Then start digging the floor otu. XD
P11:46:31 <liq3> and they end up stuck, getting owned by 4-5 guys.
P11:46:44 <Darkebrz> Or have most of the people attack the direct front of the castle
P11:46:46 <liq3> yeh, it'll be awesome> :]
P11:46:51 <Darkebrz> While the rest sneak underground
P11:46:54 <liq3> haha, and a few... yeh.
P11:46:55 <liq3> :D
P11:46:58 <liq3> WHat' you'll need is ilke.
P11:46:59 <liq3> A moat.
P11:47:03 <liq3> not water...
P11:47:05 <liq3> of LAVA.
P11:47:06 <Darkebrz> Of LAVA
P11:47:06 <PrinceOfFire59> hah
P11:47:09 <liq3> but.
P11:47:12 <liq3> you also make it go UNDER your fort.
P11:47:16 <liq3> so they can't mine up.
P11:47:17 <Darkebrz> >:D
P11:47:19 <liq3> :D
P11:47:19 <PrinceOfFire59> so no sneaky
P11:47:26 <Foe> We need dragons
P11:47:29 <liq3> the one problem is then getting OUT of your own fort. xD
P11:47:33 <Foe> LOL
P11:47:35 <liq3> they could siege you lol.
P11:47:45 <liq3> build their own wall around your moat lol.
P11:47:48 <PrinceOfFire59> WE NEED FISH SO WE CAN FISHING FOR CRAFING
P11:47:49 <Foe> Oh no, I trapped myself with a moat of burninate
P11:47:54 <Foe> I KNOW
P11:48:04 <Foe> Fish bone crossbows
P11:48:08 <liq3> lol DF...
P11:48:11 <Foe> Fish bone bolt
P11:48:16 <PrinceOfFire59> coo'
13P11:48:23 * Foe SHIII-THUNK
P11:48:30 <Darkebrz> Or the enemy could channel your lava out
P11:48:38 <liq3> Yeh, once it's finite.
P11:48:44 <liq3> God, I so want pumps.
P11:48:47 <Foe> I have an awesome idea
P11:48:54 <liq3> Imagine if you had to get gold pumps to pump lava, and anything else burend. haha.
P11:48:54 <Foe> tlava proof skelies
P11:49:01 <liq3> It'd be so epic...
P11:49:08 <liq3> Like making this lava channel right OVER the enemys fort.
P11:49:15 <liq3> and channel the enemy's moat lava back into their own fort rofl.
P11:49:21 <Foe> liq3, lava proof skelies and a lava moat
P11:49:32 <liq3> Foe: I'm talkin Versus MP Survival.
P11:49:40 <liq3> Oh...
P11:49:46 <liq3> I just realised the best way to do MP survival.
P11:49:46 <Foe> Yeah
P11:49:47 <liq3> TICKETS.
P11:49:50 <Foe> lol
P11:49:53 <Foe> twahat?
P11:50:00 <liq3> Each team has a number of tickets, they lose one everytime someone dies.
P11:50:01 <liq3> :]
P11:50:07 <PrinceOfFire59> :D
P11:50:12 <Foe> Oh, like a lives pool
P11:50:12 <Darkebrz> I dont like that
P11:50:15 <liq3> First to run out loses.
P11:50:16 <Darkebrz> MC isnt about second chances
P11:50:24 <liq3> Darkebrz: It'll be boring for the dead ppl.
P11:50:27 <liq3> That's the #1 problem.
P11:50:30 <Foe> liq3, thta would suck
P11:50:38 <Darkebrz> Or...
P11:50:41 <liq3> It's like "oh, I died..." *50 minutes later game ends and restarts*
P11:50:45 <Darkebrz> When you die, you join the enemy team 8D
P11:50:52 <mail2345> O_o
P11:50:54 <liq3> Nah, that causes one team to quickly win.
P11:50:55 <mail2345> balance issues
P11:50:56 <Foe> if one person dies like every second, and it is the same guy, wouldn't he be a double sider?
P11:51:04 <liq3> Cause they end up killing the newbies, and quick zerg.
P11:51:08 <Darkebrz> Yeah
P11:51:10 <Darkebrz> Well
P11:51:12 <liq3> Not to mention people HATE being team swapped.
P11:51:15 <Darkebrz> That still sounds awesome :D
P11:51:27 <mail2345> wait i have an idea
P11:51:34 <mail2345> larger teams lose heath quicker
P11:51:35 <liq3> Foe: You have vote kick, team only.
P11:51:37 <Foe> We need ctf
P11:51:45 <mail2345> smaller teams lose health slower
P11:51:50 <mail2345> ctf is possible
P11:51:54 <mail2345> even now it is possible
P11:51:57 <liq3> not CTF, CTB. ;]
P11:52:00 <Foe> ctf with classes
P11:52:01 <liq3> Capture the Block.
P11:52:07 <Darkebrz> THIS ^^^
P11:52:09 <mail2345> oh right, ctb
P11:52:17 <liq3> FYI: I got that idea off someone else.
P11:52:18 <liq3> o.O
P11:52:22 <Foe> Maybe Capture the Orb
P11:52:28 <liq3> Think it was Zuriki.
P11:52:29 <liq3> hang on.
P11:52:45 <Foe> liq3, escort the pig?
P11:52:48 <liq3> lol?

P11:54:06 <Foe> tand the pig can't be pushed
P11:54:15 <liq3> Foe: Missed the reference. :P
P11:54:20 <Foe> but you can ride the pig
P11:54:28 <liq3> TF2 has a mode called "Payload", where you push the cart... thus, PUSH THE PIG.
P11:54:46 <liq3> Foe: The pig needs a giant rocket strapped to its' back. ;]
P11:54:49 <Foe> PigRush?
P11:54:56 <PrinceOfFire59> XD
P11:54:57 <Foe> No
P11:54:59 <liq3> And everytime it dies it blows up. :D
P11:55:09 <Foe> You push, a giant, block
P11:55:15 <liq3> ...

P11:55:32 <liq3> lol, isn't Notch ggonna add minecarts and stuff later?
P11:55:34 <Foe> Druid soccer, you try to push the giant block into the other goal
P11:55:38 <liq3> We could totally copy Payload. :D
P11:55:43 <Foe> I know
P11:55:47 <liq3> minecraft style. hahahah.
P11:55:51 <Foe> No wait
