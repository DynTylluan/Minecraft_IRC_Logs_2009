A12:00:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's hard to look for mature teens these days
A12:00:36 <potato> i'm 15 and not a dick, i think i qualify
A12:01:19 <g1real> well sorry, it's not that I care but I find comparing blockland to facepunch a bit insulting :>
A12:01:53 <Dilt> i'm actually not familiar with the facepunch community
A12:02:01 <g1real> That and we had some guy coincedentally IP ban all ops on a server named annihilator.
A12:02:10 <potato> i'm taking a look at facepunch right now
A12:02:26 <g1real> Avoid general discussion at all costs
A12:02:29 <g1real> and fast threads
A12:02:51 <PuyoDead> facepunch does some good stuff... but their MC servers are terrible
A12:03:19 <Dilt> but right
A12:03:26 <Dilt> tons of trolls from blockland will hit up minecraft prolly
A12:03:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> well, if you find an annihilator who isn't beta, he's probably a bad bad person
A12:04:11 <potato> this looks like SA for 13 year olds
A12:04:24 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> ur mom iz sa
A12:04:28 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> 4 everyone
A12:04:32 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> lololollol
A12:04:35 <OrangeJuice_Seempson> :smuggggg:
A12:04:51 <PuyoDead> yea, they're not the sharpest community
A12:06:25 <Dilt> anyway, right
A12:06:37 <Dilt> blockland has issues with griefers/etc... and it's a $20 game
A12:06:42 <Dilt> people buy it and troll with it
A12:07:05 <potato> dicks will be dicks
A12:07:15 <Dilt> indeed
A12:07:25 <Dilt> thus the importance of proper moderation controls is freaking underlined here :P
A12:08:23 <g1real> hey hey hey
A12:08:30 <g1real> facepunch has 1 decent server :E

A12:08:47 <potato> server? i was looking at the site
A12:08:48 <g1real> and dilt
A12:08:54 <g1real> you dont have to buy to play right now...
A12:09:03 <Dilt> g1real: for blockland multiplayer you do
A12:09:17 <g1real> uhm
A12:09:19 <g1real> no
A12:09:30 <Dilt> what are you smoking
A12:09:43 <g1real> I logged in
A12:09:46 <g1real> on an alt account
A12:09:47 <g1real> right now
A12:09:59 <g1real> I just joined a random server
A12:10:05 <g1real> what are YOU smoking
A12:10:09 <PuyoDead> they have 1 good server? where?
A12:10:19 <potato> im smocking pot, crack, meth, lsd...
A12:10:19 <Dilt> considering that you can't get an account in blockland without paying money for a key
A12:10:21 <g1real> Yeah thats the problem
A12:10:26 <potato> and sum stuf i dont no! lel
A12:10:27 <g1real> its not in the list
A12:10:28 <Dilt> i'd have to question that
A12:10:33 <g1real> venn's server is pretty decent though.
A12:10:35 <Dilt> also, LAN games don't count
A12:10:43 <g1real> oh you mean blockland
A12:10:44 <g1real> my bad
A12:10:47 <Dilt> yeah.
A12:10:47 <g1real> ¬¬
A12:10:56 <PuyoDead> oh, the nazi regime? that says niggers aren't welcome? yea, great place. :P
A12:11:00 <g1real> yeah okay
A12:11:02 <g1real> let me tell you
A12:11:05 <g1real> you dont want blockland
A12:11:21 <Eagle> Blockland looks so unprofessional.
A12:11:30 <Eagle> Not saying that minecraft doesn't
A12:11:30 <Eagle> But
A12:11:32 <Eagle> :/
A12:11:35 <g1real> wait wiat
A12:11:36 <PuyoDead> it feels like a bad tech demo to me
A12:11:38 <g1real> Im mixing up again
A12:11:40 <Drakkar> blockland is unprofessional
A12:11:40 <g1real> You do want blockland
A12:11:41 <Drakkar> ask dilt
A12:11:47 <g1real> you dont want the alternative kiddie version of it
A12:11:53 <Dilt> badspot, the maker of blockland... sort of just fails at life
A12:11:55 <PuyoDead> MC feels leaps and bounds more professional than blockland
A12:12:07 <Eagle> And it's in alpha.
A12:12:08 <Eagle> :P
A12:12:15 <Dilt> honestly, i'm disagreeing
A12:12:30 <g1real> No blockland is pretty decent
A12:12:41 <g1real> scriptable blocks <3
A12:12:47 <PuyoDead> I think it's the funky physics
A12:12:57 <Dilt> 'professional' stuff often is broken, unreliable, and makes you wonder what sort of 'professional' made it
A12:13:03 <Dilt> :P
A12:13:16 <PuyoDead> it feels very... cumbersome

A12:13:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> blockland is not bad
A12:13:56 <Dilt> i think its biggest fault is the torque game engine
A12:13:56 <AnnihilatorBeta> i liked it... when it used to be free
A12:13:57 <potato> never played blockland
A12:14:24 <g1real> torque is indeed its biggest fail
A12:14:28 <g1real> but its still nice for what it is
A12:14:32 <g1real> especially if you get some addons
12A12:14:44 * fleshBasedProcessor (chatzilla@75-121-5-33.dyn.centurytel.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:14:48 <g1real> just wished minecraft would get scriptable blocks and more detailed blocks
A12:14:51 <Dilt> blockland's biggest feature is the damn addons
A12:14:55 <g1real> I want to craft a damned chair :(
A12:15:01 <Dilt> i wrote myself a whole RPG script from scratch
A12:15:25 <potato> i don't want minecraft to turn into a pixelated Second Life
A12:15:28 <Dilt> including shops, purchasable land, HP, stats, all that drama
A12:15:38 <g1real> uhm
A12:15:47 <g1real> potato that's a terrible comparison
A12:15:51 <potato> hm?
A12:15:56 <g1real> you cant make anything besides buildings right now with these blocks
A12:16:03 <Dilt> uh
A12:16:03 <g1real> some options for detail would be nice
12A12:16:06 * bjzaba (brendanzab@CPE-124-187-20-149.qld.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:16:10 <g1real> buildings and sprites*
A12:16:11 <Dilt> i see
A12:16:21 <Dilt> i was going to bop you if you said make vehicles out of blocks
A12:16:27 <g1real> a block thats 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5 instead of the normal size
A12:16:33 <g1real> 1/8th of a normal block etc.
A12:16:48 <potato> "including shops, purchasable land, HP, stats, all that drama" add some flying dicks and that's SL right there
A12:17:00 <g1real> too bad
A12:17:02 <g1real> none of that
A12:17:04 <Dilt> can't add flying dicks
A12:17:05 <g1real> besides hp and stats
A12:17:07 <g1real> will happen
A12:17:10 <potato> good!
A12:17:12 <Dilt> if you put it in the server?

A12:17:16 <Dilt> everyone tries to download it
A12:17:19 <Dilt> but torque can't handle it
A12:17:22 <Dilt> CRASH EXPLODE
A12:17:25 <g1real> oh and flying dicks of course since any player made content has that one day
A12:17:49 <g1real> fact
A12:17:58 <g1real> minecraft will never be SL
A12:18:09 <potato> i certainly hope not
A12:18:38 <g1real> If you ever compare this potentially good game with something from the depths of hell again.
A12:18:54 <potato> yo. minecraft is a lot like demons dont u think
A12:19:19 <AnnihilatorBeta> minecraft is the demons?
A12:19:37 <bjzaba_> minecraft is demonic
A12:21:11 <g1real> java is acting up...

A12:36:39 <g1real> minecraft doesnt use a lot of data

A12:41:56 <g1real> holy crap, it is
A12:42:02 <potato> lol
A12:42:04 <potato> wow
A12:42:10 <g1real> my monitor says
A12:42:32 <g1real> 12000 bits/min sending (as a client)
A12:42:36 <potato> what if there are a lot of chunk updates
A12:42:41 <g1real> tand 36000 bits/min receiving (as a client)
A12:42:45 <g1real> no idea
A12:43:05 <g1real> cba to test it further really
A12:43:33 <g1real> but all minecraft does is send an XYZ coordinate of block removed I presume.
A12:43:38 <g1real> so that wouldnt be much data
A12:45:22 <g1real> congrats for notch on 1111 purchases :E

A1:00:16 <Bbzx> other than my site redirecting to the server URL, how would i be able to host a server straight from my site

A1:14:51 <Eagle> I demand discussion.
A1:15:10 <LG_Legacy> And i demand a new computer so i can stop crashing.
A1:15:13 <LG_Legacy> Aint going to happen now is it?
A1:15:20 <Eagle> See like
A1:15:25 <Eagle> My demand is plausable
A1:15:39 <Eagle> Yours might take more work and is less of a demand and more of a plea to God.
A1:15:52 <LG_Legacy> Not really, any computer would work.
A1:16:05 <Eagle> Nope.
A1:16:07 <Eagle> Wrong.
A1:16:34 <LG_Legacy> How can i be wrong about my keyboard addiction?
A1:16:40 <Eagle> Wrong.
A1:16:52 <Eagle> I'm sorry, it's just that way.
A1:17:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I got a terrible bunch of bugs in my room once, and at night, they would all huddle around on my screen.
A1:17:31 <Eagle> Totally should have loaded up a fullscreen screamer video, and see what they would do when the scary face popped up.
A1:17:37 <vdgmprgrmr> So I got bored once, and wrote a program that generated a grid of squares that would suddenly switch every 30-60 seconds.
A1:17:47 <vdgmprgrmr> (The grid was black/white)
A1:18:05 <Eagle> And they didn't pay attention to it, did they?
A1:18:07 <vdgmprgrmr> So ever 30-60 seconds, after they settled back down on my screen, it would switch, and they'd all freak.
A1:18:20 <vdgmprgrmr> They really did notice it.
A1:18:38 <Eagle> If you want results, you should have done the screamer thing.
A1:18:51 <vdgmprgrmr> No, see, I was trying to sleep at the same time.
A1:19:14 <Eagle> Oh, then you should have also put the speaker volume to max, and put on headphones.
A1:19:21 <Eagle> To wake you up.
A1:19:34 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A1:19:36 <vdgmprgrmr> NO
A1:19:40 <Eagle> Also the flys.
A1:19:41 <Eagle> *flies
A1:19:49 <vdgmprgrmr> They weren't flies.
A1:19:54 <Eagle> *bugs
A1:20:00 <Eagle> Totally a typo.
A1:20:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, I can see that.
A1:20:21 <Eagle> The keys are all like right next to each other.
A1:20:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Man you suck dick.
A1:20:40 <vdgmprgrmr> *totally rock

A6:16:07 <citricsquid> what the fuck. Built some huge building last night, from skyline to bottom and then just logged in and it's disappeared. Not like, griefed, but not a single thing is there, the hole is gone etc. weird
A6:16:24 <UnknownX> lol
A6:16:57 <UnknownX> the time griefers are here
A6:17:11 <citricsquid> maybe i imagined building it
A6:17:35 <vdgmprgrmr> People have learned to simply ERASE things from history.
A6:17:59 <UnknownX> i usually dream doing school work only to wake up thinking i really did it then not knowing i didnt do it :(

A6:18:11 <spadge> truewolves: does it double if it goes up?
A6:18:12 <spadge> :P
A6:18:28 <spadge> or + half
A6:18:33 <tortele> Anyone want to play?
A6:18:38 <TrueWolves> you know you play to much minecraft on the yggdrasil server when in the darkness all the walls have the same wood pattren look
A6:19:01 <citricsquid> wtf, some op in my server "closed" it by kicking every active player and prisoning it, twat.
A6:19:12 <spadge> ...
A6:19:13 <TrueWolves> Spadge, you set any number 2 numbers from 1 to 3billion, pick 1 in your head
A6:19:14 <UnknownX> oh sorry that was me
A6:19:16 <spadge> assmuncher
A6:19:30 <spadge> ok i picked
A6:19:40 <TrueWolves> and you tell the computer what 2 numbers are the range
A6:19:51 <spadge> 1 - 3billion
A6:19:57 <spadge> lol
A6:20:05 <TrueWolves> it then try's to guess but guessing the number in the middle of it's range
A6:20:24 <spadge> ok cool
A6:20:24 <spadge> :D
A6:20:26 <TrueWolves> by logic, that is the fastest way to find out the number with out a lucky guess
A6:20:42 <TrueWolves> which is true if the number is truely random (which is in reality, not the case)
A6:21:06 <spadge> yeah
A6:21:12 <TrueWolves> but it's the simplest way to program something that will get to a number logicaly fast
A6:22:21 <UnknownX> citric you glass ant farm server is mega griefed
A6:22:35 <TrueWolves> ... how do you greif that server?
13A6:23:42 * TrueWolves personaly thought that an ant farm level would be a 2x4096x256 level (smaller then normal!) filled mostly of dirt and some stone
A6:23:56 <TrueWolves> or even 4x4096x256
A6:24:08 <citricsquid> TrueWolves: I was about to say that :D
A6:24:26 <citricsquid> the point is to tunnel everywhere
A6:25:01 <TrueWolves> becuase 4x4096x256 is as big as a 256/256/256 level
A6:25:17 <TrueWolves> which is a smart max size to make a level
A6:25:24 <TrueWolves> heheh
A6:25:37 <spadge> would be cool if you had a window pane that people could look at it from
A6:25:45 <spadge> from a fair distance
A6:25:52 <spadge> so you could see people in the tunnels all the way
A6:26:08 <UnknownX> its all flooded with water and lava
A6:26:52 <TrueWolves> that would be cool, but the current glass is to squary in looks when stacked togeather in a thin sheet
A6:27:07 <TrueWolves> youe'd need Zuriki's proxy server marscraft glass that looks... cleaner

A8:05:05 <KatamariManatee> Sorry. I was.
A8:05:21 <citricsquid> He'll probably be around later today :)
A8:05:36 <KatamariManatee> I was just wondering about importing levels
A8:06:11 <LG_Legacy> Oh
A8:06:13 <LG_Legacy> Wicked katamari
A8:06:24 <LG_Legacy> It's soon to come i can tell you that
A8:06:43 <LG_Legacy> Cause as far as the 'and more/coming soon' it mentioned importing doom levels
A8:07:00 <LG_Legacy> And as Quake = Same creators of Doom, plus my main knowledge on how to make doom maps, it won't be that hard i bed.
A8:08:19 <Azjherben> Can't we make an importer ourselves
A8:09:53 <KatamariManatee> Probably, But I'm no good at programming :(
A8:10:03 <Azjherben> i might be
A8:10:13 <TrueWolves> one day
A8:10:17 <Azjherben> ?
A8:10:19 <TrueWolves> someone with far far far to much time on there hands
A8:10:25 <Azjherben> ...
A8:10:29 <Azjherben> Will make a.........
A8:10:35 <TrueWolves> will make a DF fort to minecraft level converter
A8:10:42 <KatamariManatee> I want one that could actually import the model and make it into blocks
A8:10:52 <KatamariManatee> Kind of like ModelGen

A9:23:08 <Azjherben> It's my own 
A9:23:18 <Azjherben> I'm woking on letting people make functions
A9:23:23 <Azjherben> And adding the for operator
A9:23:50 <Azjherben> Download it, make a file named script.azj in the same folder.
A9:24:00 <Azjherben> Put some addbrick lines in the script.azj
A9:24:04 <Azjherben> And run the application
A9:24:08 <Azjherben> And bam!
A9:24:14 <Azjherben> You have a sever_level.dat ready to go
A9:24:25 <ZomBuster> ill test
A9:25:12 <Azjherben> Okay, btw, it starts with an all air 256*256*64 map
A9:25:23 <Azjherben> So if you olny have a script that makes one brick
A9:25:29 <Azjherben> Then you'll have to do some looking for it
A9:25:43 <madMonkey> birdhouse1 is grieving on Hell i believe

A9:31:56 <Azjherben> What would addcuboid do?
A9:32:31 <ZomBuster> you put in 2 coordinates and it fills everything between them with a chosen material

A10:39:18 <Flyboy> Lol
A10:39:19 <Droqen> Ah, okay
A10:39:33 <Flyboy> The Khergit Khanate
A10:39:38 <Droqen> I don't recall exactly which faction I joined directly, however
A10:40:07 <Ausfriend> The Khergits are asians
A10:40:11 <Ausfriend> l2 nord
A10:40:16 <Droqen> :0
A10:40:20 <Flyboy> Vaegir Ftw
A10:40:22 <Droqen> I am half asian
A10:40:28 <Flyboy> Cool.
A10:40:39 <Flyboy> I'm half scottish
A10:40:51 <Ausfriend> then you are half khergit, which my army of vaegir and nord will happily tear you to shreds
A10:40:54 <Droqen> Flyboy; do you have much latency connecting to servers?

A10:40:59 <PuyoDead> hey Droq! haven't seen you in a while
A10:41:05 <Droqen> Hey, Puyo :D
A10:41:15 <Flyboy> Depends wich server
A10:41:19 <Droqen> Puyo go here >:0 http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?pid=10955
A10:41:22 <Flyboy> usually no
A10:41:25 <Flyboy> about 50
A10:41:30 <Droqen> Ah, alright. That's great.
A10:42:02 <Droqen> Also other people click on/copy that shiny link. I'll attempt to snatch up a few more people in the next hour.
A10:44:44 <Flyboy> Looks chaotic.
A10:44:50 <Flyboy> And bad.
A10:44:53 <Flyboy> Sorry.
A10:44:55 <Droqen> xD
A10:45:06 <Droqen> ( there's actually another rule that's not in the main post which I should add )
A10:45:12 <Droqen> I don't expect it'll work out great ;p
A10:45:27 <Flyboy> If the builders just built high enough the destroyers couldnt touch them
A10:45:30 <Droqen> But I'll get some responses and figure out, at worst, what I could expect from a lua mod.
A10:45:56 <Droqen> Yeah, I know :<
A10:45:59 <Flyboy> and who would make a natural block when unnatural are so much cheaper
A10:46:05 <Droqen> You can't make natural blocks at all
A10:46:08 <Droqen> it costs to DESTROY them
A10:46:11 <Flyboy> ok
A10:46:47 <Droqen> I was trying to think of some concrete rule that would allow me to prevent builders from just making a tower.
A10:47:04 <Droqen> I think I'll just try to say 'you are not allowed to build in mid-air' or something

P1:33:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh i get it

P1:33:13 <Azjherben> Would destroy all blocks at 10,10
P1:33:13 <ZomBuster> I don't get it
P1:33:17 <ZomBuster> ooh
P1:33:28 <Azjherben> If I had a map of solid stone
P1:33:30 <Azjherben> and I did
P1:33:36 <Azjherben> lazer(z,10,10);
P1:33:47 <Azjherben> There would be a vertical tunnel of air at 10,10
P1:33:58 <ZomBuster> why not just use the same functions to place blocks and remove them
P1:34:05 <ZomBuster> air is a block too after all
P1:34:10 <Azjherben> Lazer is easier
P1:34:16 <Azjherben> Quick is what this is about
P1:34:22 <Azjherben> To make a tunnel

P2:39:32 <Snowman> wait
P2:39:42 <Snowman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framerate
P2:40:03 <Quatroking> Yeah yeah, but who ever calls it Frame rate
P2:40:09 <Snowman> I do :D
P2:40:12 <Quatroking> I'm used to just saying framerate
P2:40:27 <Snowman> just say fps :D
P2:40:30 <Quatroking> Plus I've seen several games saying framerate in the options
P2:40:32 <Quatroking> True dat.
P2:43:35 <Snowman> Fun fact: Theoretically, the maximum amount of RAM in a 64-bit OS is 18446744.1 Terrabytes

P3:13:25 <Quatroking> because apparantly you english people call paprika's red peppers
P3:13:35 <Wolfram> Red pepper is different from paprika.
P3:13:37 <PuyoDead> which english people?
P3:13:40 <PuyoDead> certainly not the US

P3:13:49 <Quatroking> Stupid britfags
P3:13:51 <PuyoDead> oh
P3:14:10 <PuyoDead> I was gonna say, I've certainly never referred to a spice as a pepper
P3:14:19 <Snowman> Paprika in America = Bell pepper
P3:14:33 <Quatroking> lolwut
P3:14:33 <PuyoDead> now you're just being silly
P3:14:46 <Quatroking> Well anyways, the Habanero chips I mentioned earlier contain two red peppers per 100 grams
P3:14:52 <Snowman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_pepper
P3:14:53 <PuyoDead> awesome
P3:14:56 <Quatroking> I like spicy stuff.
P3:15:10 <PuyoDead> likewise, I was just enjoying some jalapeno rings from the jar
P3:15:38 <Quatroking> what the hell english language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika
P3:16:01 <Snowman> :D
P3:16:04 <Quatroking> here in holland we call paprika, peppers and we call peppers paprika
P3:16:12 <Quatroking> the fuck is wrong with the rest of the world
P3:16:27 <Wolfram> I think the world is the majority
P3:16:41 <Wolfram> So I pose: "What the hell is wrong with Holland?"
P3:16:53 <Quatroking> you forget one thing
P3:17:06 <Quatroking> We got kroketten, frikandellen and oliebollen

P3:18:15 <Snowman> Nuclear power > Wind power

P3:18:42 <Quatroking> oliebollen > every other snack besides dorito's
P3:19:07 <Quatroking> and the best thing is, its mainly OIL.
P3:19:18 <PuyoDead> yum?

P3:21:25 <Quatroking> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliebol
P3:21:26 <PuyoDead> I don't think they would be as frightening, if it wasn't for the fact that it looks like they have little blacks eyes all over

P3:21:33 <Quatroking> zombuster: true

P4:17:51 <Levinous> AKGVBSL
P4:18:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Levinous, in the server program folder, there's a text file called "admin.txt" (or something) and the names in that are the people that are ops.
P4:18:47 <Levinous> yeah
P4:19:01 <Levinous> is it for the host or the server only?
P4:19:09 <vdgmprgrmr> So if a person takes their server down, but doesn't clear admin.txt, and they start a new server, it will still use all the names in admin.txt

Typically, the milk is acidified and addition of the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are then separated and pressed into final form.[1] Some cheeses also contain molds, either on the outer rind or throughout.

P6:48:50 <stickzanimator> Saturnino asked you to re-op Smash?
P6:49:31 <citricsquid> no himself
P6:49:36 <stickzanimator> oooh
P6:49:38 <stickzanimator> ok
P6:49:47 <stickzanimator> I have a question too since i just figured out how to make a server
P6:50:07 <stickzanimator> I figured out how to port foward. I just needed to get my password for the router
P6:50:19 <Snowman> try admin
P6:50:27 <Snowman> or password
P6:50:29 <stickzanimator> I already found out the server
P6:50:30 <Glacial> So I Tped to a person and now im outside of the server
P6:50:33 <stickzanimator> router*
P6:50:49 <Snowman> I mean try those as passwords
P6:50:53 <stickzanimator> Anyway, do i need to do anything special to make my server dedicated?
P6:51:05 <Snowman> Is it a server or a computer?
P6:51:16 <stickzanimator> I'm running it off my computer
P6:51:20 <stickzanimator> the server
P6:51:22 <Snowman> Then it's not dedicated
P6:51:26 <citricsquid> A dedicated server is a computer dedicated to running processes open to the internet (basically)
P6:51:38 <stickzanimator> meaning i need to keep the computer on always?
P6:51:40 <citricsquid> so if you have a dedicated minecraft server, it's running from a server not a computer.
P6:51:53 <stickzanimator> So how do i do that
P6:51:56 <Snowman> A dedicated server is a computer that does nothing but be a server
P6:52:00 <citricsquid> get your wallet out
P6:52:02 <stickzanimator> Oh
P6:52:05 <Snowman> so you dont use it, like you would with a normal computer
P6:52:11 <stickzanimator> oooh
P6:52:23 <stickzanimator> alright well screw it then
P6:52:23 <Bbzx> rent one >_>
P6:53:12 <stickzanimator> Citric the server dosn't work now... unless ur fixing it 
P6:53:21 <citricsquid> doesn't it?
P6:53:22 <citricsquid> hm
P6:53:30 <stickzanimator> Randomly generates
P6:53:43 <stickzanimator> BTW we need the map saved
P6:53:49 <stickzanimator> if u need to reboot it
P6:54:35 <Bbzx> server auto saves maps, amirite?
P6:54:47 <stickzanimator> Idk D:
