A12:52:15 <gordenfreechmen> Notch has weird stuff
A12:52:23 <gordenfreechmen> http://www.mojang.com/notch/
A12:52:37 <Not_Famous> l4kdead is pretty cool though
A12:54:28 <Lmaoboat> Apparently notch did that game where the you had to shoot blocks that moved twoard you in  spiral
A12:55:18 <gordenfreechmen> Not_Famous: its hard
A12:55:22 <gordenfreechmen> but some zombies stands till
A12:55:27 <gordenfreechmen> and you can kill them before they come
A12:57:12 <Not_Famous> I know, but it's fun since I can't afford the real game @_@

A1:01:22 <gordenfreechmen> how to win at Left 4k Dead: sit in a corner.
A1:02:00 <gordenfreechmen> that could be a mini-game that comes with Minecraft

A1:03:17 <gordenfreechmen> mail2345: I never see anybody on there :(
A1:03:43 <Lmaoboat> I hated how the devs thought moving zombies around made it repayable, and bragged about it in the commentary
A1:03:47 <mail2345> primarily due to ratio of prenium users vs free users
A1:04:30 <mail2345> i can see griefing is at an extreme low
A1:04:33 <Lmaoboat> It's like brushing your hair and calling it a makover

A3:45:40 <Drakim> seriously, <3
A3:45:45 <Genida> Welcome, then :)
A3:46:26 <Drakim> hm, it's also nice that it's updated so often
A3:46:37 <Genida> Wait a week, you'll want to buy it.
A3:46:43 <Drakim> I already have
A3:46:43 <Genida> Survival mode!
A3:46:56 <Drakim> I bought this after playing for ten minutes
A3:47:08 <Genida> That's faster than me. Now make a skin.
A3:47:20 <Drakim> I'm already in the middle of doing so
A3:47:22 <Drakim> ^^
A3:47:34 <Drakim> it's note remotely done yet hough
A3:47:35 <Drakim> *though
A3:47:53 <Genida> Is a little tricky.
A3:48:15 <Drakim> yeah, since the resolution is so low
A3:48:22 <Drakim> it's hard to avoid making the face look too much like a smiley
A3:48:28 <Drakim> but I think I have something good going on

A3:49:53 <Drakim> hah
A3:50:01 <Genida> Since I recognize you from the devblog :)
A3:50:23 <Morgranth> ah! from the uss
A3:50:31 <Genida> Most impressive.
A3:50:44 <Morgranth> took us a while
A3:50:56 <Drakim> anyway, I can't wait until Lua is supported, I'm going to make so many modifications
A3:51:00 <Morgranth> seen it on the server yet?
A3:51:08 <Genida> No, never been there.
A3:51:41 <Morgranth> its even impressive then :P esp since ppl are still adding stuff to it
A3:51:58 <Genida> Really? Looked sort of finished.
A3:52:08 <Morgranth> lots of space in the inside left
A3:53:57 <Morgranth> and the vid doenst show all the other projects + the size of the map (wich is over 700x700)
A3:54:10 <Genida> That's pretty huge.
A3:54:29 <Genida> But does it have a generated underground?
A3:54:31 <Morgranth> cant build out huge projects witouth that space:P
A3:54:36 <Morgranth> nop
A3:54:44 <Morgranth> but there are fucklaods of caves dug
A3:54:51 <Morgranth> think we have a metro system
A3:54:56 <Genida> That does sound promising.
A3:55:26 <Genida> Then again, with my new hacks I'm going with pixel art for a while.
A3:55:36 <Morgranth> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqrzTlYNF64 link is in there, only downside is that the server can get pretty lonely
A3:55:41 <Morgranth> dause we havent made it public
A3:55:55 <Genida> If Xzalander could just get his server up, or if I could find it somewhere, I could get on with that again...
A3:56:54 <Genida> Unless you're looking for a fledgling pixel artist? :)
A3:57:05 <Morgranth> Sure, plenty of space
A3:57:28 <Morgranth> we have some pixelart , mostly done by me  wich u might like
A3:58:01 <Genida> My work so far is very basic, since I had to do it old school style.
A3:58:14 <Genida> Jumping and sand towers and scaffolding :)
A3:58:25 <Morgranth> come have a look id say
A3:59:00 <Morgranth> that was fast:P
A3:59:25 <Genida> Was on my way, you had the link on youtube.
A4:00:10 <Morgranth> i would suggest putting  fog on btw, there are to many blocks in the uss, lags teh fuck out of the server witouth fog

A7:43:54 <Magnulus> I know this would never happen for the same reasons that custom items won't happen, but wouldn't it be awesome if you could shape the weapons yourself?! ^_^
A7:44:17 <Magnulus> So you could take iron ore to a forge and then shape it into a monster-sword. ^_^
A7:44:38 <doohan> citricsquid, 
A7:44:45 <Marach> like Spore, but blockier
A7:44:53 <Marach> attaching
A7:44:53 <Magnulus> Heheh, yeah.
A7:45:16 <Marach> well player looks like that
A7:45:19 <citricsquid> doohan: You know your IRC bot, would it be possible to make it alert on forum reports? Like, if I send info to it through PHP it says "New report on forums." in IRC, or is that not possible?
A7:45:25 <Magnulus> Well, rather than attaching things, you would have a subdivided block of iron that you could chip away from and add on to.
A7:45:25 <Marach> so i wouldnt be out of style
A7:45:32 <doohan> citricsquid, should be
A7:45:44 <doohan> I can make a url that you can send stuff to
A7:45:59 <citricsquid> doohan: That'd be awesome if you could :D
A7:46:08 <Magnulus> so removing half of it would let you add that half to other parts.
A7:46:20 <doohan> We'll need a way of making sure only your site can use it though
A7:46:55 <doohan> Don't need any fool with a browser being able to spam the chan
A7:46:59 <citricsquid> doohan: Just make it require a password, like &pw=sgdmlgklhgfklf :)

A7:47:22 <doohan> citricsquid, between that and not telling anythin the url
A7:47:27 <doohan> It'll be server side for you right?
A7:47:58 <doohan> anyone*
A7:48:02 <citricsquid> doohan: Yeah, I'd integrate it with the forum report thing, so it'd only be access by the same IP. You could just IP block it :)
A7:48:07 <doohan> hmmm
A7:48:17 <doohan> Cool looks like theres plenty of options then
A7:48:39 <doohan> I'll need to pull some more code from my irc client to add it to the bot
A7:48:47 <doohan> Maybe start later tonight
A7:49:08 <doohan> What sort of forum updates would it be announcing?
A7:49:21 <LG_Legacy> Anything in the news or announcements?
A7:49:35 <citricsquid> doohan: Just for reports, so if someone reports a post for spam etc. it'd post here, could make it PM all forum mods...
A7:49:41 <doohan> I mean would it being chatty annoy anyone
A7:49:47 <doohan> Ahh

A7:53:25 <doohan> Go look up the nehe tutorials
A7:53:35 <doohan> And the lwjgl ones too.
A7:54:01 <doohan> It'll be a whole lot easier than trying to work out which a or b is the method or class that might or might not be doing something
A7:54:22 <Ritave> oh well

A10:05:59 <Magnulus> I like the visual style of the comic, Quatro.
A10:06:12 <Quatroking> To be honest I've always drawn like that
A10:06:31 <Magnulus> Does that matter? I'm just saying I like it.
A10:06:39 <Quatroking> heh
A10:06:49 <Quatroking> Its nothing special imo
A10:07:28 <Magnulus> But as an intro-comic, it doesn't really do it for me. Other than "we are in hell now", it doesn't say anything about the comic, which is called "hell" anyway, so it didn't need a whole strip just to say that.
A10:07:39 <Snowman> Quatro, why do you have a square head?
A10:07:42 <Quatroking> Meh
A10:07:49 <Quatroking> snowman my name is not alex is it

A10:08:11 <Snowman> Will I be in it? :D
A10:08:46 <Quatroking> i dunno
A10:08:50 <Magnulus> Also, dialogue placement. The right-to-left-and-down placement doesn't work for me. I read the left one first.

P3:16:53 <Drakim> I'm pretty sure nobody in my family plays minecraft ><

P3:16:59 <citricsquid> minceraft
P3:17:15 <Niggy> lol
P3:17:21 <citricsquid> Drakim: forums broken again, I'll fix it.
P3:17:25 <PuyoDead> meatboat?
P3:17:26 <Drakim> ty
P3:17:42 <Drakim> anyways, I just spent a few hours making a new map
P3:17:52 <Niggy> cool
P3:17:53 <PuyoDead> oh wait, I was going to draw something from a song I was listening to on the way home
P3:17:53 <Drakim> it's a puzzle map, zelda dungeon style
P3:18:14 <Drakim> using water and some clever blocks I made several cool puzzles
P3:18:15 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: friend typoed minecraft into minceraft. It's mince on a raft, minceraft!
P3:18:17 <Drakim> anybody wanna try?
P3:18:24 <PuyoDead> hah
P3:18:47 <Drakim> obviously, sandbox mode ruins it
P3:18:57 <Drakim> so you'll have to play with self imposed rules
P3:19:26 <Eagle> Citric, but what about mimecraft?
P3:19:28 <Eagle> :O
P3:19:30 <PuyoDead> sounds neat
P3:19:31 <Drakim> the only rule, actually, would be, the only action you can do except move is destory sponge blocks
P3:19:33 <Drakim> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=Drakim&id=0
P3:19:43 <citricsquid> Drakim: Try registering now :)
P3:19:49 <Drakim> the goal is a bunch of gold bricks
P3:19:50 <Drakim> okay
P3:19:59 <Drakim> it worked!
P3:20:32 <citricsquid> yay, enjoy the forums :D

P3:25:02 <Drakim> let's see
P3:25:04 <Drakim> it's a singleplayer map
P3:25:07 <Drakim> but I'll give you the url
P3:25:11 <AlexVMiner> ok
P3:25:11 <AlexVMiner> :D
P3:25:16 <Drakim> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=Drakim&id=0
P3:25:27 <Drakim> the rule is, you may only move around and delete spunge blocks
P3:25:38 <Drakim> goal is a bunch of gold bricks
P3:25:57 <PuyoDead> I think there's a problem here, though
P3:26:00 <Drakim> if you see glass, it's almost always something important on the other side you need to see
P3:26:02 <Drakim> oh?
P3:26:15 <PuyoDead> after jumping across the wooden single pillars
P3:26:19 <Drakim> yeah?
P3:26:38 <PuyoDead> there's a sponge on the other side of a glass block, and an area to the right that seems to need flooding
P3:26:38 <Morgranth> there is a sponge behind glass:P
P3:26:39 <AlexVMiner> cool map
P3:26:45 <ZomBuster> drakim your are only supposed to break sponge block right?
P3:26:46 <Drakim> heheh
P3:26:49 <Drakim> it's ment to be that
P3:26:49 <Drakim> yeah
P3:26:56 <Drakim> the glass is to tell you that there is a sponge there
P3:26:58 <PuyoDead> there's no way to get to it
P3:26:59 <Drakim> that you need to find a way to
P3:27:01 <Drakim> there is
P3:27:03 <Drakim> it's a puzzle
P3:27:06 <Drakim> :o
P3:27:10 <Drakim> trust me
P3:27:17 <Drakim> I tested the map 3 times before giving it out
P3:27:25 <Drakim> there is simply a place you have missed
P3:27:29 <Drakim> backtrack a little
P3:27:43 <Drakim> ZomBuster, yeah, only spunge
P3:27:47 <Drakim> anything else is cheating
P3:27:56 <Drakim> and no creating blocks either ><

P3:29:27 <Niggy> cya
P3:29:34 <ZomBuster> not that hard :P
P3:29:34 <Drakim> the lava was random
P3:29:38 <Drakim> I didn't know it was there
P3:29:39 <Drakim> ><
P3:29:44 <PuyoDead> for whatever reason, that map was playing at about 6 FPS
P3:29:48 <Drakim> I built this without any editor or hacks
P3:29:51 <AlexVMiner> that map is confusing
P3:29:56 <ZomBuster> you could have made some puzzle with water and lava :P
P3:29:57 <Drakim> it was?
P3:29:58 <Drakim> strange
P3:30:03 <Drakim> no, ><
P3:30:05 <Drakim> lava is bad
P3:30:07 <ZomBuster> dunno how that would work tough
P3:30:14 <Drakim> I can't reset it like water
P3:30:15 <Drakim> with a spunge

P3:30:33 <Drakim> yeah

P3:30:35 <Morgranth> its to obvius at some point drakim :P
P3:30:41 <Drakim> yeah
P3:30:42 <Eagle> I wonnnn
P3:30:47 <Drakim> doing a map like this was hard
P3:30:51 <Eagle> Drakim: http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5452/14534426.png
P3:30:52 <Drakim> but, I plan to expand it
P3:30:54 <Drakim> to a second floor
P3:31:20 <AlexVMiner> i think i get it
P3:31:25 <Morgranth> its a  very cool concept tho
P3:31:25 <ZomBuster> maybe make a complex one in OMEN
P3:31:28 <AlexVMiner> can you delete only sponges?
P3:31:30 <Morgranth> esp with survival mode coming up
P3:31:32 <PuyoDead> well, guess I get to start over
P3:31:32 <Drakim> yeah
P3:31:32 <Drakim> only sponges

P3:31:45 <Drakim> XD
P3:31:58 <Eagle> What's with all of the sponges outside? O.o
P3:32:03 <Drakim> there is?
P3:32:08 <Drakim> problaby left over from my draining the lake
P3:32:10 <Drakim> sorry about that
P3:32:23 <Drakim> working without a map editor was...troublesome
P3:32:36 <Drakim> buuut, it also gave me better insight in how things would look instantly
P3:32:59 <ZomBuster> true
P3:33:09 <Drakim> hm, I can think of some new clever ways to use blocks though, so the second floor won't just be the same puzzels
P3:33:26 <Drakim> and there should be a maze!
P3:33:35 <Drakim> <3 minecraft
P3:33:37 <ZomBuster> you could use sand blocks
P3:33:42 <ZomBuster> supported by sponge
P3:33:45 <Drakim> yeah
P3:33:47 <ZomBuster> so you would drop them
P3:33:49 <Drakim> heheh
P3:34:07 <Drakim> also, I could use hidden spounges which holds water in the air like a tunnel
P3:34:11 <Drakim> you have to swim without falling out
P3:34:13 <Drakim> or drop far

P3:41:16 <AlexVMiner> and the first exposed sponges
P3:41:24 <Drakim> all of the gameplay is inside the castle

P3:41:28 <AlexVMiner> and i am at the glass thing
P3:41:36 <Drakim> the glass with the sponge behind?
P3:41:39 <Eagle> Alex the puzzle is only inside the dungeon thing
P3:41:39 <AlexVMiner> where the sponge is behind it
P3:41:42 <Drakim> yeah
P3:41:42 <PuyoDead> F5 that action
P3:41:44 <AlexVMiner> i know
P3:41:48 <Drakim> you have to get around
P3:41:52 <Drakim> there is a secret path to that sponge

P3:41:59 <AlexVMiner> can i build?

P6:46:16 <LG_Legacy> -shrugs- I want a run and gun, kind of like Unreal Championship and SOF2. Sof2 had limb removal, and that had me in.
P6:46:17 <PuyoDead> I have no interest in the PvP aspect of WoW, which is what pretty much 90% of the game's population wants to do
P6:46:34 <PuyoDead> so once I hit level 40-50, the game kind of fizzles out for me

P11:11:09 <Griskard> On my RP server, when I get it going (Post-Lua), I plan to offer challenges and special prizes for those who win
P11:11:15 <Griskard> Like one off armour pieces/sets
P11:11:49 <Griskard> If Notch puts in bows it should be easy to to that, just make a massive bow trajectory

P11:35:04 <vede> All the older peeps are coming back to the IRC, it seems.
P11:35:05 <Griskard> We need to pressure notch in allowing us to upload level files to singleplayer
P11:35:18 <Griskard> So we can play the survival beta on our own maps
P11:35:37 <vede> Also, I gotta sleep.

P11:38:04 <mail2345|homework> also @tommerry11 to hack
P11:38:32 <mail2345|homework> (it's more of a cheat) type in alt-f4
P11:38:34 <mail2345|homework> :P
P11:39:35 <tommerry11> yea
P11:39:45 <vede> Actually, MOST programs have some kind of easter egg regarding that key combo.
P11:39:52 <vede>  :D
P11:39:55 <vede> Augh! Sleep!
P11:40:04 <tommerry11> u do that, then load it in singleplayer then save
13P11:40:26 * TestDummy does see that it says "IRC: #minecraft on irc.esper.net" on the website.
P11:40:30 <tommerry11> and thats how u upload maps
P11:40:32 <TestDummy> I suppose those are typical directions.
P11:40:37 <TestDummy> There's just atypical users. :<
P11:40:44 <TestDummy> No offense.
P11:40:54 <tommerry11> what???
