A12:03:54 <Crusty> Greenslimy
A12:03:58 <Crusty> Is the lava that neat
A12:10:56 <greenslimy> yes :p
A12:11:02 <Cameron_Pease> What about rosseta?
10A12:13:57 * Super-Dot (Super-Dot@adsl-76-231-44-106.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:18:26 <Parthon> what about rosetta?
A12:21:45 <Cameron_Pease> see, we both want to know.
12A12:24:45 * Syndlig (synd@cpe-66-68-16-104.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:25:07 <Parthon> I'm wondering who rosetta is actually
A12:25:49 <paul|not> mapmaker
A12:25:53 <paul|not> waterclimb, parthon?
A12:26:09 <Parthon> did she make that?
A12:26:18 <paul|not> I do not know what gender rosetta is
A12:26:18 <paul|not> but yes
A12:26:36 <Tiralmo> Rosetta is male.
A12:26:43 <Parthon> really? why the name rosetta?
A12:27:00 <paul|not> it's a tablet
A12:27:04 <paul|not> doesn't seem gender specific to me
A12:27:10 <fydo> minecraft makes me happy inside
A12:27:15 <liq3> It has the word rose in it. :/
A12:27:18 <paul|not> I mean "rose" yeah I could understand
A12:27:23 <liq3> Roses are usually associated with females.
A12:27:24 <paul|not> but rosetta eh it's pretty generic to me
A12:28:10 <Parthon> I thought rosetta was also a type of flower arangement, I could be wrong
A12:28:26 <liq3> It just sounds like a female name.
10A12:28:43 * laazala (honka@202-21-136-59.cable4.acsdata.co.nz) has joined #minecraft
A12:28:55 <Crusty> Any name that ends with etta or a sounds like a female name
A12:29:06 <Crusty> Parthonetta, Crustyetta
A12:29:29 <liq3> Yeh.
A12:29:30 <Crusty> Shaniquetta
A12:29:37 <liq3> Guys never have "etta" on the end.
12A12:30:16 * Kaidane (Kaidane@adsl-065-005-218-152.sip.cae.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
A12:31:01 <Parthon> liqetta :P
A12:31:23 <liq3> lol.
A12:31:36 <liq3> Parthonetta. :p
10A12:31:56 * Redshift (chatzilla@c-98-232-237-235.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:32:08 <Cameron_Pease> How the bugger did a question about a perons map making tool start a conversation about the gender of names.
A12:32:29 <liq3> Parthon refered to Rosetta as female, when he happens to be male. :/
A12:32:40 <liq3> It spawned from that.
A12:32:53 <Cameron_Pease> True, but that spawned from my initial asking.
A12:32:59 <Cameron_Pease> Which spawned this.
A12:33:02 <Cameron_Pease> Which spawned that.
A12:33:20 <Parthon> that would be why .. in lattin:
A12:33:24 <Parthon> latin*:
A12:33:25 <Parthon> 2 A suffix denoting either a diminutive or a feminine association (and often both) is -elle, with the related -ella, -etta and -ette.
A12:33:25 <Cameron_Pease> Which. . .fuck, I'm dizzy.
A12:33:56 <Parthon> when in fact I knew who rosetta was all along :P
A12:34:00 <Cameron_Pease> Yawn, chat is slow tonight.
A12:34:14 <liq3> So, update soon.
A12:34:20 <Parthon> how soon?
A12:34:27 <liq3> 24 hours.
A12:34:29 <liq3> or less.
A12:34:30 <Crusty> Valve time
A12:34:39 <Skeep> notch time
A12:34:43 <liq3> Notch isn't Valve
A12:34:54 <paul|not> lol
A12:35:06 <paul|not> notch made this game in less time than it takes valve to make a design document
A12:35:13 <liq3> lol yeh pretty much.
A12:35:17 <paul|not> valve probably spends more time on BOX ART than notch did on this game
A12:35:32 <Crusty> We'll see about that when l4d2 rolls around, if it comes out when they say it will
A12:35:38 <liq3> lol.
A12:35:46 <liq3> They did give a release date...
A12:35:53 <paul|not> well--we want a vivid color. We've narrowed it down to uh, red, azure, crimson, maroon, and, uh, orange.
A12:35:55 <liq3> I doubt they'll push it back.
A12:35:56 <Gauphastus> That boycott might muck things up a bit.
A12:35:56 <Crusty> I'm shooting for 2012, right before HL2 E3, or HL3
A12:35:56 <Cameron_Pease> I think notch should work on optimizing water/lava, so we can play bigger games of 'Run away from the giant wall of doom lava'
A12:36:11 <paul|not> spoilers hl2e3 will be hl3
A12:36:18 <paul|not> AND IT WILL BE THE BEST GAME EVER
A12:36:25 <paul|not> (twice)
A12:36:32 <Crusty> Gaup, only .003% of valve's customers are boycotting, or something like that.
A12:36:47 <paul|not> hahaha
A12:36:49 <liq3> Cameron: Right after he makes lava inflict pain.
A12:36:51 <paul|not> internet petitions
A12:36:58 <Gauphastus> Wow, those guys are doing a bang up job.
A12:36:58 <Cameron_Pease> It'd go great
A12:37:01 <Cameron_Pease> With survival mode
A12:37:01 <greenslimy> only in survival mode
A12:37:07 <liq3> Yeh.
A12:37:07 <Parthon> I'm waiting for l4d2 preorder so I can give them more money :D
A12:37:10 <Cameron_Pease> Harder to build structures to keep safe/
A12:37:11 <liq3> having to dig to build would be epic. :]
A12:37:14 <Cameron_Pease> And lava makes you buuuurn.
A12:37:19 <paul|not> liq3: *will
A12:37:24 <Cameron_Pease> Very epic.
A12:37:26 <liq3> I do hope lava burns wood/plants.
A12:37:28 <Crusty> This game can go a million different ways, it's interesting to see how it will be in the end
A12:37:37 <Cameron_Pease> Mhm.
A12:37:39 <liq3> Only sand, gravel, dirt, and stone should stop lava. :]
A12:37:44 <liq3> Well, and glass.
A12:37:45 <Parthon> so .. anyways
A12:37:46 <Crusty> Sand should make glass
A12:37:51 <Cameron_Pease> I still think its a bit overpriced for the current stuff we get.
A12:37:55 <liq3> yeh, sand stops it by turning into glass. xD
A12:38:02 <paul|not> Cameron_Pease: "all future updates"
A12:38:04 <paul|not> etc etc
A12:38:08 <Parthon> I combined the underground maze complex with my city generator, so I have a map that does both
A12:38:09 <Cameron_Pease> I get that.
A12:38:11 <Cameron_Pease> But still.
A12:38:19 <Crusty> Parthon
A12:38:27 <Crusty> When are you releasing the city generator
A12:38:37 <Parthon> how does tuesday sound?
A12:38:42 <Cameron_Pease> Pfft.
A12:38:46 <Crusty> Like a tuesday
A12:38:51 <liq3> Lol.
A12:38:58 <liq3> "Tuesday... 3 years later."
A12:39:04 <Cameron_Pease> Exactly.
A12:39:09 <Cameron_Pease> Tuesday doesn't specify when.
A12:39:17 <Crusty> Some tuesday
A12:39:18 <Crusty> After today
A12:39:20 <Parthon> some tuesday in the near future
A12:39:21 <Crusty> and before the end of the world
A12:39:32 <Parthon> if today was tuesday it could be today
A12:39:41 <Crusty> But it's not
A12:39:42 <Cameron_Pease> Today is tuesday.
A12:39:44 <Cameron_Pease> Release it.
A12:39:46 <Cameron_Pease> Do it.
A12:40:02 <Crusty> He has to make a prettyful UI
A12:40:07 <Parthon> I'll give out the code, but not the program, only because there's no UI
A12:40:15 <Parthon> and no configuration options outside of code
A12:40:25 <Crusty> That's why we must wait
A12:40:34 <Crusty> for tuesday
A12:40:43 <Cameron_Pease> Just give a small explanation of how it works, if they can't figure it out beyond that, they don't deserve to use it.
A12:41:20 <Crusty> It's kind of funny clicking over and seeing "Sending heartbeat" "Load 1/18" repeated a million times
A12:41:21 <liq3> No one without a C++ compiler will be able to use it anyway lol.
A12:41:42 <Crusty> Someone, green I think, is just sitting in my server
A12:41:47 <liq3> Or C. Dunna what Parthon used.
A12:41:55 <Crusty> He said C++, I think
A12:42:00 <Crusty> Or I might be thinking of something else
A12:42:17 <Cameron_Pease> Is it 12 AM yet?
A12:42:23 <Parthon> actually, it could be either
A12:42:28 <Cameron_Pease> True.
A12:42:33 <Cameron_Pease> But is it 12 AM where notch lives?
A12:42:36 <Parthon> oh wait .. it's c++
A12:42:39 <Parthon> I use the std
A12:42:41 <Crusty> It's 12:43 here in Missouraa
A12:42:43 <Parthon> the stl
A12:43:05 <liq3> Why does 12am matter+
A12:43:06 <liq3> L?
A12:43:15 <Cameron_Pease> Because 12 am will be 'tommorow'

10A12:43:27 * Rydia (Haruhi@68.186.97.143) has joined #minecraft
A12:43:30 <liq3> he has till 2359 tomorrow to release it. :P
A12:44:13 <Cameron_Pease> Pfft.
A12:44:20 <liq3> I wonder if we're getting surrvival tomorrow...
A12:44:27 <Cameron_Pease> I HIGHLY doubt that.
A12:44:32 <liq3> Lol.
A12:44:34 <liq3> Yeh me too.
A12:44:44 <paul|not> notch will just release the finished game
A12:44:46 <paul|not> no bugs
A12:44:58 <paul|not> survival + zombie survival plus DF map importer (with dwarves)
A12:45:03 <paul|not> pretty much 3d dwarf fortress actually
A12:45:11 <Cameron_Pease> Basically.
A12:45:43 <Cameron_Pease> What do you guys think the best kind of map would be for a 'run away from the lava wall of doom' map would be?
A12:45:45 <paul|not> also, planet sized maps.
A12:45:53 <paul|not> Cameron_Pease: long and thin
A12:46:00 <Cameron_Pease> Thats what she said.
A12:46:00 <Crusty> Cameron
A12:46:02 <Crusty> a subway
A12:46:02 <paul|not> source of lava at one end and lots of running
A12:46:12 <Cameron_Pease> How thin, though?
10A12:46:18 * Foe_ (chatzilla@c-98-248-47-122.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:46:19 <Crusty> 4 wide
10A12:46:20 * Foe_ is now known as Foe
A12:46:22 <Crusty> 4 tall
A12:46:26 <Cameron_Pease> Nah.
A12:46:28 <Foe> Hey boys
A12:46:32 <Parthon> Cameron_Pease: 8 wide and 32 tall
A12:46:36 <Parthon> I made one
A12:46:40 <Foe> ?
A12:46:54 <Crusty> The ceiling could be however tall
A12:46:58 <Crusty> The lava can't be too tall
A12:47:06 <Cameron_Pease> Curse you and your knowledge of editing maps beyond their normal specifications!
A12:47:20 <liq3> Cameron: Just an ordinary genned map.
A12:47:29 <liq3> Of course, you make the rules "winner = last man standing" ;].
A12:47:43 <Cameron_Pease> Wouldn't work with sandbox.
A12:47:48 <Cameron_Pease> Which is all we have for now D:
A12:47:49 <Crusty> Would not indeed
A12:47:51 <liq3> Yeh, lava needs to hurt for that to work.
A12:47:58 <Crusty> And people could just block it
A12:48:00 <Crusty> Or build their way out of it
A12:48:03 <Cameron_Pease> So are there any map editors besides Sny's?
A12:48:03 <liq3> Crusty: No.
A12:48:08 <liq3> Because it's FFA.
A12:48:14 <liq3> So people will sabotage each other.
A12:48:37 <Crusty> Lava doesn't move fast enough to be fully sabotage-able
A12:48:44 <liq3> It would if.
A12:48:53 <liq3> We had that destroy then build thing.
A12:48:54 <liq3> bricks.
A12:48:57 <liq3> Yes I'll call them bricks.
A12:49:08 <liq3> Once we have bricks + hurty lava, the "run from lava game" should be fun. :]
A12:49:26 <Crusty> What I'm saying is, you could destroy a wall, take two steps inside, and then just hide the wall
A12:49:50 <Parthon> Cameron_Pease: I'm still designing a map editor
A12:50:08 <Crusty> Cameron, is Sny's "Minecrap"?
A12:50:08 <Cameron_Pease> What we really need, is a map editor that has 3d support.
A12:50:12 <Cameron_Pease> Yeah.
A12:50:19 <Cameron_Pease> I forgot how to spell his name >>
A12:50:39 <Parthon> depends what you mean by "3d"
A12:50:43 <Crusty> A bigger tool would be helpful in his is all, maybe an easier way to go back and forth in Z
A12:50:49 <Crusty> But you can do everything in minecrap right now
A12:51:23 <Parthon> such as?
A12:51:42 <Cameron_Pease> Semi-Transparent blocks.
A12:51:50 <Cameron_Pease> And shows the map as one big cube (or whatever shape it is)
A12:52:00 <Cameron_Pease> With little blocks you can zoom in through the layers.
A12:52:02 <Cameron_Pease> And such.
A12:52:12 <Cameron_Pease> Hard to explain, really.
A12:52:20 <Crusty> I get what you're saying
A12:52:32 <Cameron_Pease> Yeah.
A12:52:41 <Crusty> A better, faster, easier to use editor basically
A12:52:43 <Cameron_Pease> Would be easier to see what your editing, and such.
A12:53:02 <Cameron_Pease> But I doubt this won't come for a while, considering it would require alot of coding knowledge.
A12:53:08 <Crusty> I'm sure notch will come out with easier ways to modify the map
A12:53:49 <Cameron_Pease> Yeah.
A12:54:01 <Cameron_Pease> That would be the ideal map editor.
A12:55:32 <Parthon> I mean, what does minecrap have that's considered 'everything'
A12:56:01 <Crusty> If you spend enough time
A12:56:14 <Crusty> You can edit every square of the map into any block you want
A12:56:23 <Parthon> lol
A12:56:36 <Parthon> but I can do that with a hex editor .. the idea is that a map editor makes it "easier" :P
A12:56:39 <Crusty> Any be able to visibly see it, for the most part
A12:57:09 <Parthon> so, minecrap does the basics, there just needs to be more extra functionality
A12:57:23 <Parthon> I don't want to just make a map editor though, I want to make a map functioner
A12:57:26 <Crusty> He's working on a bigger brush and more zoom
A12:57:35 <Parthon> like, be able to stamp 3d objects into it
A12:57:39 <Crusty> but it's highly unfinished, which is why it's called "minecrap"
A12:57:46 <Crusty> Someone made a thing like that, I think
A12:57:48 <Parthon> true
A12:58:05 <Crusty> He's iffy on releasing it, since people my stamp...unpleasant things, if I recall
A12:58:06 <Parthon> and be able to select a 3d region to copy/paste
A12:58:13 <Crusty> might*
A12:58:33 <Parthon> yeah, but they do that any way
A12:58:52 <Crusty> But I agree
A12:59:01 <Crusty> What you're talking about would be very helpful and useful
A12:59:16 <Crusty> 'Copy one wall, paste it over and over
A12:59:24 <Crusty> copy giant wall, paste it
A1:00:15 <Parthon> yeah
10A1:00:18 * smn (netSMN@92.116.13.19) has joined #minecraft
A1:00:28 <Parthon> or like make a building, copy paste it all over the place to make houses
A1:00:31 <Cameron_Pease> What I'm really curious on, is how rosetta made the map's height much larger than it should be, couldn't that be done to make it smaller, for good 'lava wall of doom' kind of maps?
A1:00:45 <Parthon> oh, that's easy
A1:00:56 <Parthon> you just change the file size and height value in the map with a hex editor
A1:01:05 <Parthon> well .. not impossible
A1:01:21 <Parthon> you've seen my city haven't you Cameron_Pease?
A1:01:27 <Cameron_Pease> Problem is, which byte(s) and what number range is stable?
A1:01:34 <Cameron_Pease> The generated one?
A1:01:36 <Crusty> I assume there's a nice little spot you change the max X and Y to a certain point
A1:01:41 <Parthon> yes
A1:01:44 <Cameron_Pease> Yes.
A1:01:49 <Cameron_Pease> Although just a picture of it.
A1:01:53 <Parthon> aaah
A1:01:54 <Cameron_Pease> On the minecraft thread.
A1:01:56 <Parthon> it's a double height map
A1:02:08 <paul|not> orly
A1:02:14 <paul|not> I don't think I've seen it
A1:02:19 <paul|not> so you can do taller buildings?
A1:02:32 <Parthon> yeah, it's been like that for a few days now
A1:02:34 <Crusty> I would just assume you trial and error for the size:stability 
A1:02:40 <Cameron_Pease> Would it be possible, to make it only 3 blocks deep below sea level, but 60 above it?
A1:03:03 <Cameron_Pease> Or does it have to be equal on both sides?
A1:03:09 <paul|not> sea level is half the map heigth
A1:03:12 <paul|not> height
A1:03:16 <Cameron_Pease> Ghey.
A1:03:22 <paul|not> done by the game
A1:03:31 <Cameron_Pease> We need less of that.
A1:03:37 <Cameron_Pease> Would allow more creative map styles.
A1:03:51 <Crusty> We need alot of things
A1:03:57 <Crusty> Well, want
A1:04:02 <paul|not> Cameron_Pease: you can have terrain below ocean level
A1:04:04 <paul|not> and it won't flood
A1:04:08 <paul|not> so long as you don't build up to it
A1:04:22 <Cameron_Pease> I know that, but it presents problems.
A1:04:37 <Cameron_Pease> Some random person, can tower up to it ASAP, and cause massive floods.
12A1:04:49 * aeiowu (aeiowu@173-28-112-98.client.mchsi.com) Quit (Quit: aeiowu)
A1:04:49 <paul|not> map needs placeable edge tiles that can't be built on
A1:05:02 <Cameron_Pease> Which would be a cool sight, until the server crashes.
A1:05:19 <Crusty> The generator could do with about ten more options
A1:05:41 <Crusty> The ingame one I mean
A1:05:47 <Cameron_Pease> Mhm.
A1:06:03 <paul|not> we need terrain styles
A1:06:08 <Parthon> I've love ocean height to be in the map
A1:06:09 <paul|not> desert - flatlands, lotsa sand
A1:06:17 <paul|not> mountains - lotsa big stones
A1:06:27 <Crusty> Instead of an ocean around the island, alot of sand would be cool
A1:06:31 <Crusty> or alot of jungle
A1:06:43 <Cameron_Pease> Yup.
A1:06:51 <Cameron_Pease> What I just thought of right now.
A1:07:03 <Cameron_Pease> About connecting servers together, for an over-all, larger map, so to speak.
A1:07:13 <Cameron_Pease> It generates a large map, splits it into 2-4 parts
A1:07:21 <Cameron_Pease> You put each part on a server.
A1:07:25 <Crusty> Step past a point and 'connect' to another server, step back and connect to the other?
A1:07:32 <Cameron_Pease> Correct.
A1:07:38 <Crusty> Connected chat lines
A1:07:39 <Cameron_Pease> But it makes a small render
A1:07:53 <Cameron_Pease> For seeing into what the map beside you is
A1:07:55 <Cameron_Pease> And such.
A1:08:08 <Crusty> Nice idea
A1:08:17 <Cameron_Pease> And since it generates the map fully together, then splits it, they connect -almost- seamlessly.
A1:08:20 <Crusty> Would work great for team based fighting mats
A1:08:25 <Crusty> maps*
A1:08:27 <Cameron_Pease> And the current map loading times are reasonably low.
A1:08:28 <Cameron_Pease> So it could work.
A1:08:41 <paul|not> maaaaaaan we need like siege engines and shit
A1:08:41 <Crusty> Give one side of the map to each team, let them build up, then have them fight eachother
A1:08:50 <Cameron_Pease> Yup.
A1:09:38 <Crusty> Any one of a millon ideas would better the gameplay, notch needs to get some people to help in on the development
10A1:09:53 * ez (ez@h-77-240.A165.priv.bahnhof.se) has joined #minecraft
A1:10:08 <Cameron_Pease> If its possible to run multiple instances minecraft servers on one machine, I believe the idea would work.
A1:10:17 <paul|not> it's quite possible
A1:10:22 <Cameron_Pease> It could work to make 'planet' maps
A1:10:29 <Cameron_Pease> Just make a really large map split into 10 parts
A1:10:36 <paul|not> it'd really suck if you were building along an edge and you accidentally got booted over
A1:10:37 <Crusty> Those would be ungodly large
A1:10:44 <Cameron_Pease> That circles into eachother
A1:10:55 <Cameron_Pease> I think it should bring up a confirmation screen
A1:10:57 <Cameron_Pease> Or some sort./
A1:11:09 <Cameron_Pease> And prevent people building say, 10 blocks from the edge
A1:11:30 <Crusty> The wall between the two servers could flash with some words when you got close
A1:11:41 <Cameron_Pease> Would work well with survival mode.
A1:11:59 <Cameron_Pease> In theory, it would work.
A1:12:17 <Cameron_Pease> Problem is, getting the connecting to other server automatically, generating a large map and splitting it evenly.
A1:12:27 <Cameron_Pease> And which side connects to which server
A1:12:29 <Crusty> Seems pretty good though, you should make a thread, since Notch isn't around
A1:12:34 <Cameron_Pease> Bleh.
A1:12:39 <Cameron_Pease> I'll explain it once he gets on.
A1:12:49 <Cameron_Pease> Be happy to post the thread for me.
A1:12:54 <Crusty> Nahh
A1:13:01 <Cameron_Pease> You lazy too?
A1:13:03 <Cameron_Pease> :D
A1:13:04 <Crusty> Yeah...
A1:13:13 <Crusty> I was gunna make one about map generaton options
A1:14:09 <Cameron_Pease> I doubt my idea will come to pass, but its a nice idea. :D
A1:14:26 <Crusty> Like I said
A1:14:30 <Crusty> A million things

A1:15:01 <Cameron_Pease> How big do you think survival maps will be?
A1:15:07 <Cameron_Pease> Huge, larger, smaller?
A1:15:18 <Cameron_Pease> I'd say larger.
A1:15:22 <Crusty> Will probably be an option to choose
A1:15:24 <paul|not> I'd say big
A1:15:26 <paul|not> hopefully
A1:15:31 <paul|not> needs exploration
A1:15:37 <Crusty> large would have more monsters, smaller would have less, etc
A1:15:46 <Cameron_Pease> Yeah.
A1:15:52 <Cameron_Pease> Large as possible.
A1:16:06 <Crusty> I assume survival will place you onto a map
A1:16:16 <Crusty> and then add the survival stuff to the map
A1:17:19 <Crusty> Like, another little loading bar during map generation that says "Adding monsters"
A1:17:31 <Cameron_Pease> 1) Generate Map 2) Place NPC's 3) Generate roaming areas for NPC's 4) Generate start location(s) 5) Generate Ore/Whatever
A1:17:48 <Cameron_Pease> Etc.
A1:17:51 <Crusty> Something like that
A1:18:04 <Crusty> Although I wouldn't mind being able to load up my own maps for survival mode
A1:18:10 <Cameron_Pease> Yeah.
A1:18:12 <Crusty> Or our own maps into multiplayer form
A1:18:23 <Cameron_Pease> You could be able to create your own with a map editor someone/notch makes.
A1:18:36 <Cameron_Pease> That would have survival options
A1:18:44 <Cameron_Pease> Such as roaming area for NPC's.
A1:18:49 <Cameron_Pease> And what npc's go where
A1:18:51 <Cameron_Pease> etc
A1:19:12 <Crusty> An editor that rivals the editor in several RTS would basically be all you needed for any game mode
A1:19:22 <Cameron_Pease> Yup.

A2:07:10 <paul|not> nope
A2:10:13 <Vahue> has he said how sponges are going to work?
A2:11:51 <Tiralmo> I've heard that they remove water in a 3x3x3 cube
A2:12:13 <Parthon> hahaha
A2:12:18 <Vahue> so they arent an infinite water sink?
A2:12:32 <paul|not> well
A2:12:38 <Parthon> they empty all water in a 3x3 area, so it allows you to quickly mop up water
A2:12:40 <paul|not> I don't see how they will work w/out finite water
A2:12:44 <Parthon> but they don't stop new water
A2:12:54 <Vahue> that might be why they arent out yet
A2:12:58 <Vahue> cos glass is just a new texture
A2:13:09 <paul|not> I asked notch about it
A2:13:11 <paul|not> he said no finite water
A2:13:17 <Vahue> ever or just now
A2:13:22 <LKA> sponge should flow through water the way water invades things then disappear after like 15-20 seconds
A2:13:26 <paul|not> with the sponge
A2:13:55 <Vahue> im thinking it might be easy to crash a server by spawning like 10 sponges at the edge of the map where there is ininity water

A5:58:50 <Spadge> yeah that annoys me sometimes
A5:59:00 <Spadge> you see you delete then block comes back, then it disappears
A5:59:12 <Deiz> That's because the server sends packets back to you
A5:59:15 <zid> the server, instead of just sendinig the resting position
A5:59:16 <Deiz> To make sure you're in sync
A5:59:24 <zid> sends the original position, the deletion of the original, and the creation of the new
A5:59:37 <Deiz> zid: Three for one special
A5:59:46 <Deiz> Thrice the DDoS
A5:59:50 <zid> yep
A6:00:02 <zid> 16 clients * 3 packets = 48:1 DoS ratio!
A6:00:03 <zid> gogo!
A6:00:31 <zid> 2k/s is enough to cripple every residential server using sand :d
A6:00:32 <Notch> so you're saying it would just send one packet to all 16 clients? :-O
A6:00:37 <Deiz> No
A6:00:42 <Deiz> One packet per client
A6:00:53 <zid> Notch: making say, dirt, uses 1 packet, making sand, uses 3
A6:00:55 <Notch> yes, but why did zid multiply it by 16?
A6:01:03 <zid> 16 people connected
A6:01:04 <Notch> yes.. but how is it 48:1 and not 3:1?
A6:01:19 <zid> I send one packet, server broadcasts 3 each to 16 people
A6:01:20 <Deiz> You send out three, server gets it, sends three to each client
A6:01:31 <Deiz> $players:you ratio is inevitable
A6:01:35 <zid> all I send is a sand create packet
A6:01:37 <Deiz> But $players*3:you is bad
A6:01:46 <Notch> heh
A6:02:02 <Notch> it's still just 3:1 compared to other blocks
A6:02:06 <zid> just reply with the final position when someone sends sand
A6:02:11 <Quatroking> wtf where is my update :(

A7:20:42 <asnoehu> anyone know the movie of this: http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/6008/1245244909798.jpg
A7:21:44 <Quatroking> I have no idea but it looks awesome
A7:22:29 <Notch> sorry, I'm having a weird day =)
A7:24:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch do you have an ETA for the updates?  Nice new server by the way
A7:24:37 <Notch> I don't, sorry. My weird day is throwing me off schedule
A7:24:44 <Zuriki> rosetta just released her tool for the water climb level
A7:24:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> No problem
A7:24:48 <Quatroking> Notch, I want the specs D:
A7:24:50 <Notch> when I get back home tonight, I'll try  to get it out as soon as possible. =)
A7:24:55 <Notch> They're on the blog!
A7:24:58 <citricsquid> quat: blog
A7:25:01 <Rosetta> his
A7:25:04 <Quatroking> fuck yes
A7:25:21 <Notch> you've got a deceptive nick!
A7:25:36 <Quatroking> Hey, I have the same CPU :D
A7:25:48 <Rosetta> yas but its also a name of a metal hardcore band :D
A7:25:52 <modx> what did you do with mc ?
A7:26:01 <modx> my fps is around 15 now
A7:26:17 <Quatroking> Why does it take so long to transfer the level data tho?
A7:26:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking: I assume he has to do it over the net
A7:26:42 <Quatroking> Oh, yeah, didn't consider that
A7:26:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> And it would be restricted by the speed of the unused up bandwidth on the old server
A7:26:51 <Zuriki> I'm still calling you her.
A7:27:03 <modx> nwm on me
A7:27:03 <Quatroking> if he had physical access I'd just throw in a pendrive
A7:27:04 <Rosetta> How much of that 10,000GB bandwidth are you currently using ? :O
A7:27:13 <Zuriki> OVER 9000!
A7:27:43 <Evil-Ville> Shut the fuck up Zuriki
A7:27:53 <Evil-Ville> I am sorry
A7:27:54 <Zuriki> o.o
A7:28:09 <Zuriki> Apology not accepted.
A7:28:30 <Quatroking> I'm going to fucking rape all of you guys while you sleep
A7:28:31 <Quatroking> whahah
A7:29:08 <Quatroking> hey notch, I've got a suggestion
A7:29:23 <Evil-Ville> dohoho internet memes xD fucking hilarious over 9000 longcat is long LOOOOOOL
A7:29:23 <Quatroking> Java apps can save data on someone's PC right?
A7:29:41 <AlLnAtuRalX> Quatroking: of course
A7:29:45 <Quatroking> then why not save the levels on people's computer.
A7:29:54 <Rosetta> Its the CLOUD idea
A7:30:06 <Rosetta> ie log in anywhere for your levels
A7:30:31 <Quatroking> :/
A7:31:03 <citricsquid> quatro: How do we play others levels then?
A7:31:23 <Zuriki> Downloads!
A7:31:25 <Quatroking> send each other the level files?
A7:31:46 <Quatroking> is it even possible to play someone else's maps right now in singleplayer
A7:31:54 <Rosetta> yes very easily
A7:31:55 <Zuriki> Yes
A7:31:57 <Wingboy> ye send them the link
A7:32:06 <citricsquid> ...saving clientside would remove that
A7:32:14 <Quatroking> Hmm
A7:32:15 <peerkoel> you can save each others levels as your own
A7:32:18 <Quatroking> You got a point
A7:32:26 <peerkoel> and thus work on a level together
A7:32:33 <Empty> You can guess the link if you know that persons Username

A7:42:21 <Quatroking> :/
A7:43:22 <Quatroking> hex editor?
A7:43:39 <Awol10> hex editor would work
A7:45:03 <Wingboy> use hxd if you want a simple free one
A7:45:14 <Quatroking> I just got XVI32
A7:45:17 <Quatroking> looks pretty basic
A7:45:36 <Quatroking> I need to keep the first 319 values intact right

A7:49:29 <citricsquid> What's new in the server update? :D
A7:49:30 <Quatroking> :(
A7:49:33 <Notch> there's a changelist on the blog
A7:49:50 <Quatroking> What is stdin
A7:50:04 <Notch> you can type directly in the game console
A7:50:08 <Quatroking> FUCK YES
A7:50:09 <Notch> like "ban kalle" or "say boom"
A7:50:12 <citricsquid> Excellent, I'll update now :D
A7:50:14 <Quatroking> awesome
A7:50:17 <Notch> don't use "/" from the console
A7:50:26 <Notch> that's only needed by the clients
A7:50:44 <Quatroking> alrighty
A7:50:56 <Quatroking> so basically
A7:51:27 <Empty> Hmm. Notch wont it help if you make a function that works the same as wurms /stuck function for cathing up with lag?
A7:51:29 <Quatroking> uh
A7:51:31 <Quatroking> nevermind
A7:51:39 <Notch> just stand still. =)
A7:51:43 <Bobo> new blocks out yet?
A7:51:44 <Bobo> :D
A7:51:48 <Notch> standing still and looking around also works
A7:51:50 <Empty> Bobo no
A7:52:01 <Empty> read the title.
A7:52:10 <Notch> most people don't run constantly, so it should catch up fine. =)
A7:52:38 <Notch> if people have problems with it, I can make the server run 5 or 10% faster just to eat up lag
A7:52:56 <Notch> but then people can speedcheat themselves 5 or 10% faster when I've fixed movement verification
A7:53:05 <Notch> but it might be worth it to get a nice experience
A7:54:46 <Empty> Anyone hosting a private server I can join?
A7:54:52 <ZomBuster> argh
A7:55:08 <Mikesword221> Oh, Notch, you have made 2,964 Dollars from Minecraft.
A7:55:13 <ZomBuster> when I load a 256^3 level it takes 1 GB of memory D:
A7:55:18 <citricsquid> it's way more mike
A7:55:25 <Quatroking> haha
A7:55:32 <Quatroking> I just replaced all the water in a map with lava
A7:55:34 <ZomBuster> its the win7 java
A7:55:34 <Mikesword221> US dollars.
A7:55:35 <Quatroking> fuckin' awesome
A7:55:40 <Notch> more like 5700 euro
A7:55:47 <Notch> I mean dollars
A7:55:52 <Notch> 4150 euro
A7:55:53 <Awol10> 256^3 level should only be 16MB
A7:56:02 <ZomBuster> I know
A7:56:03 <Empty> I paid Notch 10 euro. And I'm proud of it.
A7:56:06 <ZomBuster> I dont know what it is
A7:56:08 <Empty> More people should buy it.
A7:56:12 <ZomBuster> its just java being weird
A7:56:21 <Panza> If I install the new server.zip, do I just copy my .dat and run it?
A7:56:34 <Notch> I've made enough money on pre-orders to comfortably pay for all development up until release. =)
A7:56:39 <Notch> not full time, but free time
A7:56:48 <Notch> yes, panza
A7:56:49 <Quatroking> Notch, what exactly did you do with the 4150 euro's so far?
A7:56:55 <Quatroking> hookers?
A7:57:00 <Empty> Quatroking Hookers and booze I guess.
A7:57:06 <Quatroking> lol
A7:57:09 <Notch> So far I've gotten the new server, bought dinner for ez and me, and.. well.. not much more
A7:57:10 <ZomBuster> like al game develepoers
A7:57:21 <Notch> I'm setting up a company so I can do all the taxes right and so
A7:57:22 <Empty> Ez?
A7:57:24 <citricsquid> I'm just deleting minecraft-server.jar then download minecraft-server.jar again + adding connections line to config, hopefully that's enough for new servers.
A7:57:27 <Notch> elin, my gf
A7:57:32 <Haggle> BUY A LIMO AND FILL IT WITH ORANGE JUICE THEN SWIM IN IT
A7:57:40 <Quatroking> So Mojang is going to be Mojang Inc. soon?

A7:58:15 <ZomBuster> gonna try update 
A7:58:19 <Empty> Meh. Time's relative :P
A7:58:23 <ZomBuster> altough I thought I already did that
A7:58:39 <Notch> 1gb ram?
A7:58:42 <Notch> the client or the server?
A7:58:43 <Wingboy> notch when im on my server and talk through the server box i cant see the message
A7:58:51 <ZomBuster> client
A7:58:59 <Notch> ah, well
A7:58:59 <Quatroking> Notch i spotted a bug
A7:59:11 <Notch> the client needs to use MUCH more than 1 byte per tile
A7:59:15 <Quatroking> Notch
A7:59:17 <Quatroking> halp
A7:59:17 <ZomBuster> true
A7:59:18 <Quatroking> bugz
A7:59:32 <Notch> it's (worst case) three quads per tile, each corner contains both x, y, z coords and u, v coords
A7:59:39 <Notch> what Quatroking?
A7:59:44 <Wingboy> i foundsa bug to
A7:59:45 <Quatroking> doing "say boobs" in the console doesn't work good in-game
A7:59:51 <Notch> what happens?
A7:59:54 <Quatroking> in-game it says "oobs"
A7:59:57 <Notch> lol
A7:59:58 <Wingboy>  using /say cuts out the first letter
A7:59:59 <Quatroking> misses the first letters
A8:00:03 <Quatroking> Yep
A8:00:05 <ZomBuster> mhh Firefox is eating away 500 MB too, gonna try it in chrome
A8:00:11 <Quatroking> so /say penis becomes enis
A8:00:15 <Empty> chrome is very unstable with minecraft
A8:00:23 <Empty> Well. It depends actually.
A8:00:30 <Empty> Either it works great. Or your chrome chrashes.
A8:00:36 <Empty> Just have to be lucky I guess.
A8:00:40 <Wingboy> and talking through server box when your on your on your own server shows no message
A8:01:01 <citricsquid> notch: Did you modify how it uses ports? I can kill and restart on the same port now without it failing :=D
A8:01:08 <ZomBuster> uuh whats the command to connect to my own server again?
A8:01:24 <Wingboy> the link?
A8:01:31 <ZomBuster> yeh thats what I mena
A8:01:38 <Wingboy> its in externalurl.text
A8:01:39 <Notch> found the chat bug

A8:01:52 <citricsquid> >:(
A8:01:54 <Notch> Not the local chat not working one, though
A8:01:54 <Wingboy> lol :D

A8:02:08 <Quatroking> k
A8:02:14 <Wingboy> people are gonna be angry at 2 restarts
A8:02:27 <Notch> You don't HAVE to restart for that bug
A8:02:29 <Notch> it's very tiny
A8:02:35 <Notch> it just cuts off the first letter when chatting from the console
A8:02:49 <Notch> citricsquid: I don't remember fixing it..
A8:02:56 <ZomBuster> found it http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=127.0.0.1&port=25565

A8:42:01 <Wingboy> notch has to transfer 1.5 gb
A8:42:06 <MANIA> yeah heard it
A8:42:14 <Wingboy> must be alot of people saving maps
A8:42:26 <citricsquid> How big are maps compressed?
A8:42:30 <MANIA> yeah I was making a secret of mana pixel art gallery
A8:42:34 <Wingboy> maps are generally 100kb and under
A8:42:42 <postlogic> Should perhaps be some way to delete old maps which has been inactive for a certain number of days.
A8:42:48 <MANIA> nope
A8:42:53 <Wingboy> wouldnt work
A8:42:56 <citricsquid> about 150kb I think, seems to be what I have

A8:45:27 <modx> weird one though
A8:45:43 <citricsquid> my calculator said 55,000 150KB maps in 1.5GB, correct?
A8:45:54 <Wingboy> likely
A8:46:09 <ZomBuster> eh
A8:46:16 <Wingboy> i would say average was 100kb or under though
A8:46:38 <Wingboy> single player maps tend to not have lots of things in them
A8:46:39 <ZomBuster> no
A8:46:43 <citricsquid> That can't be right though, we're limited to 5 saves aren't we? That'd mean almost every player had to sae 5 maps.
A8:46:49 <citricsquid> save*
A8:46:50 <doohan> It's about right
A8:46:55 <ZomBuster> 55000*150KB = ~8 GB
A8:47:00 <doohan> Assuming that each of the 13678 have saved one map
A8:47:42 <doohan> And if each saved a map it'd be closer to 2 gig, so there probably a lot of registered users that have never saved anything
A8:47:44 <C418> assuming that bla bla bla bla bla bla bla :P

A11:41:08 <Droqen> I'd rather go oops I'd better change this 1 to a 0 after an hour of looking

A11:41:19 <Droqen> than oops I'd better change everything after an hour of looking
A11:41:25 <Droqen> ZomBuster that's terrible xD
A11:41:30 <ZomBuster> it is
A11:41:40 <Droqen> Get it working eventually though?
A11:41:44 <ZomBuster> yes
A11:41:51 <Parthon> Droqen: I suppose
A11:42:02 <ZomBuster> see my sponge
A11:42:04 <Parthon> but like the core code is fine, there's just tiny runtime errors all over :P
A11:42:09 <Parthon> no syntax, no design problems

A11:43:13 <PuyoDead> really? odd
A11:43:21 <vdgmprgrmr> This is the second time today...
A11:43:43 <vdgmprgrmr> It's really fun, though! Especially with god mode and all-weapons and such.
A11:43:53 <vdgmprgrmr> And bodies-stay and decals-stay.
A11:44:06 <PuyoDead> ooo! do the slo-mo cheat
A11:44:13 <vdgmprgrmr> I couldn't get it to work...
A11:44:16 <PuyoDead> aww
A11:44:21 <vdgmprgrmr> That was the first thing I went for, though.
A11:45:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I tried "bullettime 1" but that didn't work, and "pkhaste" was temprorary and slowed ME down as well, which made reloading the stake-gun WAY too slow...

P1:19:16 <Syniphas> don't try
P1:19:19 <paul|not> so has anyone got a decent map generator that just does normal terrain but different sizes?
P1:19:19 <wingboy> otherwise its pretty good
P1:19:32 <Syniphas> paul|not
P1:19:39 <Syndlig> paul|not:  The problem is making an algorithm for that.
P1:19:40 <Syniphas> i'm trying! i'm trying! :|
P1:19:48 <Syndlig> What I really think needs doing is better caves.
P1:19:48 <Syniphas> not really
P1:19:52 <wingboy> lol
P1:19:52 <paul|not> yeah
P1:19:53 <Syndlig> Notch's caves are nice, but...
P1:20:00 <Syndlig> They're not really caves.
P1:20:04 <Syndlig> They're all lava vents.
P1:20:07 <paul|not> long holes in the ground
P1:20:09 <Lmaoboat> I like really big caves
P1:20:10 <Syndlig> Every single cave is just a round hole.
P1:20:16 <Syndlig> Look at Infiniminer's caves.
P1:20:19 <Syndlig> THOSE are awesome caves.
P1:20:24 <paul|not> hah
P1:20:25 <Lmaoboat> Juels vern style
P1:20:39 <Syndlig> We modded the map to be 128^3 and genned some maps and holy crap those caves got impressive.
P1:20:41 <paul|not> y'know infiniminer is open source
P1:20:55 <vdgmprgrmr> You know what could be done to make Minecraft's caves better?
P1:20:55 <paul|not> "borrow" the algo?
P1:21:00 <Syndlig> Had one cave that part of it was actually exposed.
P1:21:03 <Syndlig> Looked down into it?
P1:21:09 <Syndlig> Went down 80 zlevels.
P1:21:15 <Syndlig> Was massive.
P1:21:36 <Syndlig> Problem with Minecraft is we can't really have big caves.
P1:21:43 <Syndlig> It's only 32 zlevels deep at most.
P1:21:46 <postlogic> I still wanna make Winecraft
P1:21:47 <postlogic> ...
P1:21:58 <Syndlig> You'd have to modify the terrain to be deeper.
P1:21:58 <Awol10> unless you make custom maps
P1:22:01 <Syndlig> Right.
P1:22:04 <Syndlig> Only custom maps work.

P1:22:16 <vdgmprgrmr> How basically, MC's caves are (or seem to be) made by having a sphere that just goes through the ground and deletes all the blocks in it...
P1:22:17 <Syndlig> So any algorithm we make for better/more realistic caves isn't gonna work in vanilla Minecraft.
P1:22:36 <Syndlig> vdgmprgrmr:  Pretty much, with a bit of static around the edges for roughness.
P1:22:45 <vdgmprgrmr> So what if every now and then the sphere thing jumps forward a few steps?
P1:23:01 <vdgmprgrmr> It would make the tunnel get a little narrower in the spot it jumps over.
P1:23:10 <Syndlig> Honestly, the best way would be to simulate realistic water erosion.
P1:23:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I think it would add a lot to it for how simple it is.
P1:23:16 <Syndlig> Well, if it were possible.
12P1:23:17 * MANIA (MANIA@dslb-084-057-087-160.pools.arcor-ip.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P1:23:41 <Syndlig> You'd end up with tunnels, yes, but you'd also get lots of larger open areas and stuff.
P1:23:51 <Syndlig> I forget what they're called.  Anterooms or something like that?
P1:24:07 <PuyoDead> or possibly make the sphere change size by a pixel or 3 every now and then
P1:24:22 <Syndlig> That still doesn't vary the terrain.
P1:24:23 <vdgmprgrmr> You could do both the jumping and the changing!
P1:24:31 <Syndlig> It just makes it a hole through the ground
P1:24:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Syndlig, it would still make it better.
P1:24:42 <Syndlig> That minorly changes size every once in a while.
P1:24:47 <PuyoDead> it would make some "rooms" larger than others
P1:24:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm perfectly fine with the way caves are generated.
P1:25:19 <Syndlig> Zlevel needs to be increased for 64 tiles underground and the algorithm needs to be modified to allow for irregularly shaped areas and rooms that break the sphere convention.
10P1:25:37 * LKA (noise@adsl-70-110-167.tys.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
P1:25:54 <Syndlig> Most caves are formed by water erosion from water soaking through the stone, from rivers and from wind.

P1:27:58 <vdgmprgrmr> Although I do think the area that deletes the blocks around it could be made to change shape or jump every now and then. Would add a lot of variety.
P1:28:16 <Syndlig> Yeah
P1:28:46 <Syndlig> Would also be neat if the floor was a little more flat and had a bit of an area in the middle where a river would've run :)

P2:48:22 <Lmaoboat> Caves similar to the screenshot would be planes with a gentle slope, with features shuich as shafts, water/lava, and pillars added in
P2:48:49 <Notch> yeah, I'd love to build a nicer cave algorithm. =)
P2:49:07 <Notch> the one I've got now is just a kludged placeholder
P2:49:10 <Syndlig> Well.
P2:49:15 <Notch> it CAN generate nice looking caverns, but they're rare.
P2:49:18 <Syndlig> You could peek at the Infiniminer one.
P2:49:26 <Syndlig> It's open source
P2:49:32 <Notch> it works great for lava pits and ore
P2:49:42 <Notch> I'd rather write my own.
P2:49:44 <sppt> notch, have you seen rolf's latest though? D:
P2:49:48 <Notch> using open source means I have to open source as well
P2:49:52 <Notch> no, sppt, I haven't
P2:50:06 <Syndlig> Rolf is insane and we should leave it at that.
P2:50:32 <Notch> he isn't. =)

P2:51:15 <Syndlig> Every time I ever talked to him I left feeling he was less than all there.
P2:51:29 <Notch> hehe, yeah, I know the feeling
P2:51:36 <citricsquid> The best people in life are mad
P2:51:44 <Notch> but I worked with him for many years (both on and off wurm), and he's a talented guy
P2:51:52 <Notch> stubborn and silent, but talented
P2:52:09 <Lmaoboat> He's a loose cannon, but he's a damn good cop
P2:52:16 <Lmaoboat> wait, what are we talking about?
P2:52:20 <citricsquid> lmao
P2:52:22 <Notch> i think us two working together meant great creativity since we're both similar and different
P2:52:32 <PrinceOfFire59> I'm talking about ZORBEES
P2:52:39 <Notch> lava zorbees?
P2:53:44 <Zuriki> Notch, can you explain HOW sponge soaks water?
P2:53:54 <Zuriki> Does it like... reverse flood
P2:53:59 <Lmaoboat> An idea I've had for a while is having the randomly gnerated cave pssages, but adding in semi-random "rooms" onto them
P2:54:03 <Zuriki> So the furthest go inward.
P2:54:45 <Notch> Zuriki: Right now, it crashes both client and server with infinite loops
P2:54:50 <Zuriki> XD
P2:54:57 <Notch> I forgot the case where water could flow around a block and hit the sponge from two directions
P2:55:02 <Notch> so I'm rethinking it
P2:55:03 <Zuriki> Sounds awefully helpful.
P2:55:04 <Droqen> xD
P2:55:04 <Syndlig> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qZELaK0zEs&feature=related  Minus the lava flood from hell it would be awesome to see a cave like this in Minecraft.
P2:55:12 <Syndlig> Though it's much deeper than the 32 allowed in Minecraft.
P2:55:56 <Lmaoboat> Maybe sponge just deletes water around it? Like a holy aura of dryness
10P2:55:59 * Bubbbles100 (bubbles100@4503ds1-hh.0.fullrate.dk) has joined #minecraft
P2:56:08 <Notch> yes, that's the solution I'm considering now, Lmaoboat 
P2:56:16 <Syndlig> Well that wouldn't really soak up anything though, would it?
P2:56:25 <Syndlig> The water would just keep flooding back in due to being infinite.
P2:56:25 <citricsquid> wouldn't that delete an entire ocean?
P2:56:25 <Notch> no, you'd have to place several sponge blocks
P2:56:39 <Notch> no, a sponge block would soak up, say, a 5^3 area
P2:56:45 <citricsquid> I thought sponge would have a capacity, when it reaches no more can be soaked. Isn't that possible?
P2:56:46 <Notch> and no water would be able to enter that area
P2:56:48 <LKA> Notch: I had an idea about sponge
P2:56:53 <Notch> oh?
P2:56:58 <LKA> basically,
P2:57:09 <LKA> it would "flood" into water the way that water floods into empty space
P2:57:13 <LKA> from top to bottom
P2:57:17 <Lmaoboat> Only problem I had with infiniminer caves is that they overlapped to much, and often ended up has just giant holes
P2:57:20 <LKA> and after maybe 30-45 seconds, it would disappear
P2:57:32 <Notch> so the sponge would spread?
P2:57:34 <LKA> Yes
P2:57:37 <LKA> Across all the water
P2:57:38 <Syndlig> Ah, neat.
P2:57:40 <LKA> I know, it's silly
P2:57:42 <Notch> that's some creepy sponge. :D
P2:57:46 <Syndlig> Notch, found an early video of Minecraft :P
P2:57:48 <Zuriki> SPONGEMONSTER
P2:57:48 <LKA> But it's probably the best way to "nuke" water
P2:57:49 <citricsquid> but then when the sponge goes
P2:57:52 <citricsquid> the water would flow back?
P2:57:52 <Lmaoboat> Sponge9 D:
P2:57:52 <Zuriki> That was the discussion.
P2:57:54 <Syndlig> Early meaning "last month"
P2:57:56 <Notch> haha Lmaoboat
P2:58:05 <Notch> cave game tech demo? =D
P2:58:08 <LKA> citricsquid: that's why it has such a long timer on disappearing
P2:58:12 <Notch> there are quite a few old vids on youtube
P2:58:12 <Syndlig> Cave game tech test
P2:58:21 <LKA> Maybe 2 minutes for a "ensurance" thing
P2:58:32 <citricsquid> lka: hmm, so we put a sponge block down and it spreads in all watr it can touch and removes it?
P2:58:38 <Droqen> If a sponge could keep track of its 'parent sponge'
P2:58:47 <LKA> yeah, it basically "floods" the water the way the water flooded the cave
P2:58:49 <Droqen> Then you could just have the sponge die if its parent dies
P2:58:51 <Syndlig> Have to say I'm not sad we lack those caves because that's even more hellish to navigate than the looping tunnels we have now
P2:58:53 <LilRobot> Notch, how lawng until sponge and glass? :D
P2:58:53 <LKA> and after some time, it would disapppear
P2:58:59 <Droqen> so you could activate it yourself quickly
P2:59:03 <Notch> LilRobot: I don't know yet. =)
P2:59:13 <Lmaoboat> A simple "anti water zone" would be more effective
P2:59:14 <Notch> I'd expect at least four hours
P2:59:23 <Notch> I think I'll go with the anti water zone for now
P2:59:27 <LKA> Well
P2:59:28 <Syndlig> More if we keep harassing him :x
P2:59:29 <Lmaoboat> you just seal the leak and spam sponges
P2:59:30 <Droqen> It would be nice to be able to build anti-water walls :D
P2:59:38 <Syndlig> Anti-water zone as in the game simply disallows water to flood into there?
P2:59:45 <Lmaoboat> yeah
P2:59:45 <LKA> Perhaps make the water-nuking sponge idea into another block?
P2:59:46 <Notch> yes, Syndlig
P2:59:50 <Syndlig> Would it work for lava?
P2:59:52 <LKA> Like.. a green sponge or something
P2:59:54 <Notch> no, not lava
P2:59:57 <Syndlig> :(
P2:59:58 <Zuriki> I don't see how the Area method is at all helpful...
P3:00:00 <Notch> I decided to allow lava flooding. ;D
P3:00:03 <LKA> <3
P3:00:16 <LKA> but uh.. I guess an anti-water zone could work, for the smaller leaks
P3:00:17 <Notch> lava spreads slow enough to be possible to deal with
P3:00:26 <LKA> but larger flooded caves would need a more "extreme" solution
P3:00:27 <Droqen> Notch, I have one question; does a sponge block off a cube, or just those axis-aligned?
P3:00:28 <Awol10> flooded again
P3:00:33 <Lmaoboat> Off-topic, but it would be nice to have a blocik that displays text when moused over in the same manner as user names

P3:00:43 <paul|not> woooow
P3:00:50 <Notch> like signs, Lmaoboat?
P3:00:52 <Droqen> Does it block off a perfect 3x3x3 cube of water?
P3:00:55 <Droqen> <3 signs
P3:00:55 <Lmaoboat> A dialog box like chat would open when you spawn one
P3:00:56 <Syndlig> The sponge'll soak up 5^3
P3:00:58 <Lmaoboat> yeah
P3:00:58 <Notch> yes, that was the plan, Droqen
P3:01:00 <Droqen> alright
P3:01:03 <Syndlig> Or 3^3
P3:01:03 <Droqen> 5^3?!
P3:01:04 <Syndlig> Or whatever
P3:01:09 <Droqen> madness
P3:01:13 <Notch> 5*5*5, with the sponge in the center
P3:01:13 <Syndlig> 5^3 means you can hide it behind walls
P3:01:16 <Syndlig> :D
P3:01:16 <Notch> so two tiles out in each dir
P3:01:18 <Droqen> I look forward to seeing it in action :3
P3:01:22 <Zuriki> Heh, I can just see how people would build "force field" zones from sponges in large floods
P3:01:23 <Droqen> Ooh, hiding behind walls you say
P3:01:29 <Notch> nice idea
P3:01:29 <Syndlig> Yes
P3:01:37 <Syndlig> I plan on making a cascading river out of it.
P3:01:42 <Syndlig> That will actually be possible now :D
P3:01:44 <Droqen> :3  awesome
P3:01:47 <LKA> Well, could the "extending parasite sponge" be considered at some point though?
P3:01:48 <Syndlig> Sort of
P3:01:50 <paul|not> waterwalls!
P3:01:51 <Lmaoboat> So I create it, type "Lmaoboat's House of Deboatchury" and put it next to my house
P3:02:02 <Droqen> Lava doesn't cascade like, uh... in infiniminer, right?
P3:02:13 <Notch> LKA: Probably not..
P3:02:15 <Zuriki> Lava EXPLODES
P3:02:16 <paul|not> nothing cascades. it fills
P3:02:17 <paul|not> atm
P3:02:18 <LKA> awww
P3:02:25 <LKA> Ah well >:
P3:02:30 <Droqen> I think a 5^3 is actually going to be really easy to deflood areas with o_o
P3:02:31 <Zuriki> It seriously does explode.
P3:02:35 <Droqen> xD
P3:02:43 <Droqen> Lava flows really slowly you liar >:[
P3:02:48 <LKA> idk I'm just being lazy lol
P3:02:50 <Syndlig> Droq:  Yep
P3:02:58 <Syndlig> 2 sponge blocks unfloods 10^3
P3:03:00 <Syndlig> Err
P3:03:01 <Droqen> xD
P3:03:02 <LKA> there's this hilariously large flooded cave under the map me and my friends are working on
P3:03:03 <Syndlig> 10x10x5
P3:03:04 <Zuriki> I have a picture of it exploding!
P3:03:05 <Droqen> Need some math :3
P3:03:10 <Syndlig> No wait 10x5x5 i'm stupid.
P3:03:12 <Droqen> xDD
P3:03:15 <Droqen> It's okay
P3:03:16 <Syndlig> 8 of them is 10^3
P3:03:17 <Notch> :D
P3:03:17 <LKA> and we need to un-flood the cave so we can spread our lava network
P3:03:24 <Droqen> 9 of them?
P3:03:25 <LKA> and have like, lava moats everywhere
P3:03:35 <Droqen> no, 8, I'm silly
P3:03:38 <LKA> (we're pyromaniacs)
P3:03:51 <Droqen> D: but nothing burns
P3:04:06 <LKA> It's still glowy
P3:04:07 <Syndlig> 9 would be 15^2x5
P3:04:10 <Droqen> true
P3:04:17 <Syndlig> 27 = 15^3
P3:04:18 <LilRobot> my gosh.
P3:04:25 <Syndlig> It's actually going to be obscenely easy to unflood now.

P3:43:02 <Droqen> Somehow saying 'caves/liquids' makes me think like you're saying they're the same thing
P3:43:17 <Droqen> [ and no I can't ._. ]
P3:43:46 <Haruhi> Droqen i wanna see misery
P3:44:16 <Droqen> Okay
P3:44:50 <Lmaoboat> I think you should ajust release simple antiwater zone sponges and save more complex ones for later
P3:45:05 <liq3> Boat: I think that's what he is doing.
P3:45:10 <Maulrus> I hope we get squeezable sponges sometime
P3:45:13 <Maulrus> that are toggleable
P3:45:19 <Maulrus> so you can make a little airlock room
P3:45:22 <Maulrus> :D
P3:45:22 <Haruhi> What's up Notch
P3:45:23 <Haruhi> whats new
P3:46:08 <Droqen> Haruhi: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Droqen Also, are you someone I know with a name changed (I think this is the case but I forget who said Haruhi was going to be made)
P3:46:23 <Droqen> I may have figured out a better hair :D I need to mess with it some more
P3:46:25 <Haruhi> also I think sponges should take only a certain amount of water before they stop soaking
P3:46:34 <Haruhi> so you can't crash the game by putting them in oceans
P3:46:35 <Maulrus> yeah
10P3:46:42 * wingboy (wingfag@cpc1-ashf1-0-0-cust236.asfd.cable.ntl.com) has joined #minecraft
P3:46:54 <Maulrus> but I can't imagine they'd take up less than a 3x3x3 square
P3:46:57 <Maulrus> er
P3:46:58 <Maulrus> cube
P3:46:58 <liq3> Haruhi: I don't think we're getting finite water.
P3:47:06 <Droqen> xD Currently I think they are just going to be actual anti-water zones, so a 5x5x5 square will just act like it's filled with blocks to water
P3:47:14 <Haruhi> Droqen you should add her red pendant thing
P3:47:16 <Droqen> (you can thus make floaty water cubes)
P3:47:17 <liq3> Maulrus: They're gonna suck up a 5x5x5 area.
P3:47:21 <Droqen> Does she have a red pendant?
P3:47:21 <Maulrus> ah
P3:47:23 <Maulrus> that's good
P3:47:24 <Haruhi> it's part of the offical art yes
P3:47:36 <Maulrus> wait no finite water?
P3:47:36 <Maulrus> wat
P3:47:40 <liq3> Yeh lol.
P3:47:49 <Droqen> I was just a bit iffy on it since it isn't even on the updated sprite x3
P3:47:54 <liq3> Sponges are just going to be anti-water zones.
P3:47:56 <Maulrus> wai :c
P3:48:01 <Droqen> It's not easy 3:
P3:48:04 <Haruhi> her pose just never shows it off
P3:48:09 <Droqen> nod
P3:48:48 <Maulrus> well sponges are good enough then
P3:48:50 <Haruhi> the pendant balances out the colors
P3:48:59 <Maulrus> infinite water pisses me off only very occasionally
P3:49:05 <liq3> Yeh.
P3:49:06 <Maulrus> rest of the time it doesn't matter
P3:49:18 <Maulrus> and I mean very
P3:49:19 <liq3> It's cool, you'll be able to make halls that are unfloodable, but without seeing the sponges :]
P3:49:21 <Maulrus> like once or twice
P3:49:34 <Droqen> Haruhi, refresh if you have it? I'm testing some new hair
P3:49:39 <Maulrus> I guess I could make an airlock without toggling
P3:49:45 <liq3> Yeh.
P3:49:46 <Maulrus> will walls stop the anti-water zone?
P3:49:54 <Maulrus> if not, I can work around it
P3:49:57 <liq3> Dunno. Hopefully not.
P3:50:05 <Haruhi> i recall seeing her pendant in the little vertical art things in the credits etc
P3:50:09 <paul|not> it'd be much easier for it to be just general area
P3:50:09 <Maulrus> but making everything at least 5x5x5 might be inconvenient
P3:50:09 <paul|not> so
P3:50:15 <Maulrus> unless I'm making a bubble city
P3:50:19 <Maulrus> in which case that'd be awesome
P3:50:22 <liq3> Yeh, and Notch said it's justa  anti-grief hack so.
P3:50:34 <Maulrus> yeah it doesn't really matter
P3:50:35 <liq3> I doubt he'd go to the trouble to make walls block it.
P3:50:37 <Syndlig> You guys are gonna make me use MineCrap?  :(
P3:50:42 <Haruhi> looks a lot better Droqen 
P3:50:44 <Maulrus> as long as it gets rid of water, then I'm super happy
P3:50:48 <Haruhi> it's cool
P3:50:49 <liq3> Yeh.
P3:50:54 <liq3> It'll be a good way to deflood. :D
P3:50:56 <wingboy> we can make waterfalls to
P3:50:59 <liq3> Just place them every so often.
P3:51:01 <Syndlig> Sorta can
P3:51:03 <wingboy> and floating water
P3:51:05 <Syndlig> They'll look funky
P3:51:06 <liq3> lol.
P3:51:11 <liq3> flooting water will be lulzy.
P3:51:16 <Syndlig> Since they'll have sponges floating near them.
P3:51:26 <Syndlig> Would be cool if it was a "sponge block tool"
P3:51:31 <Droqen> Alright :) I'm glad I figured out how to make the hair a bit better ^^

P5:41:10 <Haruhi> which disintegrates them
P5:41:11 <Quatroking> sooo
P5:41:13 <Evil-Ville> Notch any reason you haven't added mipmapping yet?

P5:41:53 <Quatroking> I liked cobblestone :/
P5:41:55 <Droqen> Whoa, water animation o_o
P5:41:55 <Evil-Ville> You should atleast add mipmapping as an option because I know I am not the only person
P5:42:07 <C418> if I would make glass, I guess I would try to make it reflect and then call it a day

P5:44:03 <Droqen> Water can fall into a sponged area if you remove a block from where it would fall into
P5:44:16 <C418> you can make underwater tunnels

P5:57:25 <PuyoDead> one of my sponges isn't vanishing... I'm confused
P5:57:25 <liq3> Then delete that block.
P5:57:25 <Droqen> Er, stops it from flowing sideways.
P5:57:26 <wingboy> look at the image
P5:57:29 <liq3> The water floods down.
P5:57:33 <Snowman> i love how you can make tunnels in the water :D
P5:57:44 <Notch> even in sp? :-O
P5:57:45 <PuyoDead> why do some sponges stay, while others vanish?
P5:57:48 <UBOA> they really don't work well

P5:57:54 <Notch> it's random, PuyoDead

P5:58:01 <PuyoDead> weird
P5:58:02 <wingboy> glad we have them to stop griefing
P5:58:10 <Tiralmo> Random like grass spreading :P
P5:58:11 <ZomBuster> he I got a cool idea
P5:58:21 <ZomBuster> a level completely made of sponge
P5:58:26 <UBOA> won't help much with griefing unless it's a really small chamber
P5:58:29 <ZomBuster> which slowly dissapears
P5:58:30 <vdgmprgrmr> It seems your engine does not support two layers of transparent surfaces...
P5:58:40 <ZomBuster> so you need to build fast
P5:58:51 <ZomBuster> or a wall keeping away the lava flood
P5:58:54 <Evil-Ville> glass isn't transparent enough
P5:58:56 <Kapow> crazy sponge
P5:58:56 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: Correct. Not even two would help since people will build glass / water /glass
P5:58:56 <ZomBuster> made out of sponge
P5:59:00 <Snowman> anyone got a map with lava?
P5:59:04 <Snowman> none of my maps work
P5:59:09 <Haruhi> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8d8c236a882fe1420ed8e382b7f4801b this is cool
P5:59:13 <vdgmprgrmr> Do you plan to fix it?
P5:59:14 <Notch> I might just revert the glass to the horrible non-transparent texture from the screenshot
P5:59:15 <Haruhi> the map is making itself out of lava and water
P5:59:23 <UBOA> actually...
P5:59:25 <liq3> Notch: Oh also, if you create 2 sponges next to each other, then delete one, it floods the remaining sponge.
P5:59:29 <UBOA> now they're using sponges to grief
P5:59:33 <UBOA> GJ
P5:59:40 <Notch> it doesn't for me, liq3..
P5:59:44 <liq3> IT does for me D:
P5:59:47 <vdgmprgrmr> The problem also occurs when you look through a ghost block at water or glass. You can't see it.
P5:59:48 <wingboy> is there a sponge limit?
P5:59:49 <Evil-Ville> I actually liked the old glass more Notch
P6:00:05 <liq3> oh nvm it didn't happen when i tried again... hrm.
P6:00:09 <Snowman> this looks more like ice
P6:00:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Am I missing something?
P6:00:19 <C418> complaints
P6:00:20 <UBOA> remove the pixel lines and windows would be perfect
P6:00:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> the server software on the website is the old one
P6:00:27 <Droqen> liq3, I've seen it happen and not happen both, there are some strange sponge region things going on
P6:00:28 <citricsquid> no it isn't?
P6:00:30 <Kapow> do sponges only disappear if they're repelling water?
P6:00:33 <Droqen> Try sponge + lava
P6:00:40 <liq3> OH I see. Make sure thehre's a level of water above both sponges and it'll flood the remaining one.
P6:00:41 <Snowman> wtf? i keep getting: cheat detected, ditsance
P6:00:45 <wingboy> its happening to me liq
P6:00:48 <Notch> yep, I just reproduced the sponge bug
P6:00:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes it is
P6:00:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> server software on website is 1.5
P6:00:58 <AlLnAtuRalX> WTF
P6:01:03 <Daidoji> notch could you tweak the repeat speed to match the movement
P6:01:04 <Snowman> anyone got a map with lava in it?
P6:01:09 <Daidoji> it's kind of a subtle thing
P6:01:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> I just tested this on 3 boxes
P6:01:14 <Droqen> Try building a sponge then destroying a block within the sponge area where water would normally flow down to (.. if that makes sense)

P6:01:57 <ZomBuster> I want to build underwater now

P6:02:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch: Any comments on that?
P6:02:20 <Notch> on what?
P6:02:21 <C418> this is war, my lad
P6:02:22 <vdgmprgrmr> Whoa...
P6:02:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch: the server on teh website I am seeing as the old one
P6:02:24 <Snowman> sponge doesnt work on laval?
P6:02:24 <liq3> do sponges disappear?
P6:02:25 <Kapow> sponges are preventing lava flow
P6:02:26 <Snowman> lava
P6:02:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> According to both README.txt and file size
P6:02:29 <C418> AAH
P6:02:30 <Kapow> it doesn't make lava disappear but it won't flow
P6:02:33 <Notch> i didn't update the version number in it
P6:02:36 <C418> CLIPPING ON MY MUSIC
P6:02:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> or the filesize?
P6:02:45 <greenslimy> mob's heads are backwards! XDD
P6:02:47 <Daidoji> softclip dat bitch
P6:03:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Water just flooded an entire sponge's area, except for a single side of the area (just along the edge), which is still dry.
P6:03:42 <Fishlips> The block bar gets in the way of text
P6:03:44 <Fishlips> :(
P6:04:04 <Fishlips> maybe have it on the side?
P6:04:05 <Tiralmo> I'm assuming there was a sponge touching the far side of the remaining sponge, vdg?
P6:04:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Nope, another sponge was touching the current sponge.
P6:04:25 <PuyoDead> I do like the new UI, but I have a suggestion: change the Y key to make mouse wheel scrolling left/right
P6:04:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> working now.. Spong is awesome
P6:04:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, mah spongez iz disaperign! :(
P6:04:57 <C418> yes. to prevent savannahs
P6:04:58 <PuyoDead> yea, I don't quite like the vanishing sponges, myself
P6:05:06 <UBOA> yeah
P6:05:23 <UBOA> they're way too weak for what we need them for
P6:05:24 <PuyoDead> I DO however, like the 5x5x5 area
P6:05:32 <AlLnAtuRalX> The area is awesome
P6:05:33 <PuyoDead> so that's at least a little tradeoff
P6:05:53 <liq3> sponges are mostly fine, except for the flood from above bug.
P6:06:03 <PuyoDead> yea
P6:06:05 <liq3> if you have proper anti-flood, it'll be trivial to deflood areas.
P6:06:17 <Droqen> I think the sponges are fine - they don't disappear very quickly at all
P6:06:23 <UBOA> clearing out a 15x15 pit that goes to the bedrock would be next to impossible
P6:06:37 <vdgmprgrmr> They do occasionally, and I don't think they should disappear at all.
P6:06:37 <wingboy> awww i cant even middle click copy sand anymore :(
P6:06:38 <liq3> I'm wondering why you DUG a 15x15 pit to bedrock.
P6:06:39 <Droqen> UBOA: start at the top, it'd be easy
P6:06:47 <PuyoDead> it's an odd random timer, I'll give it that. some stay for great lengths of time... while others vanish after 20 seconds
P6:06:48 <UBOA> it'd take forever
P6:06:56 <Quatroking> we do have one new griefing problem now tho
P6:06:59 <Droqen> Better than impossible :3
P6:06:59 <Quatroking> sponge spam D:
P6:07:01 <Kapow> hmm
P6:07:08 <liq3> sponge spam = grief how? o.O
P6:07:11 <PuyoDead> how would sponge spam be bad?
P6:07:12 <UBOA> then you'd have to clean up afterwards, if the griefers don't bother you along the way
P6:07:20 <Quatroking> ruins my freakin ocean
P6:07:21 <PuyoDead> I mean, how's that much different than any other block?
P6:07:24 <Kapow> so sponges stop horizontal flow but not vertical
P6:07:35 <Kapow> and they stop lava flow as well as water, but they only erase water
P6:07:37 <Droqen> Sponges would be one of the best blocks to spam since it goes away after a while
P6:07:40 <Kapow> 2 bugs
P6:07:47 <Droqen> The best would of course be plant xD
P6:07:48 <ZomBuster> and flooding is much easier
P6:07:49 <Droqen> Shrub*
P6:07:55 <PuyoDead> everyone's hating on the new lava :P I like it
P6:08:02 <wingboy> i like it
P6:08:04 <PuyoDead> old lava was blinding
P6:08:09 <Tiralmo> New lava is wonderful
P6:08:11 <wingboy> scroll direction should be canged though
P6:08:15 <Lukeybatman> I kinda like it
P6:08:25 <PuyoDead> yea, I keep scrolling the wrong way

P6:09:07 <Kapow> yeah I agree with that
P6:09:09 <LKA> *just looking at it can't check
P6:09:12 <Kapow> put it on the right side
P6:09:13 <LKA> *if this has been asked before
P6:09:17 <wingboy> we need an option for scroll direction
P6:09:31 <Evil-Ville> Or maybe you just need to play for more than 5 minutes so you get used to it
P6:09:32 <Kapow> even better: only show the scroll box while scrolling and for a second or two after
P6:09:51 <Kapow> once you have a block selected, just show that block in the corner

P6:11:48 <wingboy> im gonna make a giant bath and put in my sponge of doom

P6:11:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yes, 12
P6:12:15 <citricsquid> quick, someone update the wiki with sponge! =D
P6:12:30 <Snowman> the sponges are really bugged
P6:12:35 <Kapow> transparency is odd
P6:12:39 <Kinhoshi> They are?
P6:12:45 <Snowman> yeah sometimes they flood
P6:12:51 <Snowman> and why do they decay?
P6:12:52 <vdgmprgrmr> tan sand?
P6:12:52 <Kinhoshi> Ah
P6:12:59 <vdgmprgrmr> There are different kinds of sand?
P6:13:03 <Kapow> glass disappears if you look at it through a transparent block, like before creating it
P6:13:09 <wingboy> its sand that has been in the sun to long
P6:13:12 <Kapow> showing where the block will be
P6:13:23 <Kapow> glass is completely invisible behind that
P6:13:41 <Haruhi> server got megaflooded by lava lol
P6:13:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Sponges work on lava?
P6:13:48 <UBOA> ahahaa
P6:13:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> awesome...
P6:13:57 <Kapow> especially strange with the grass block
P6:14:21 <PuyoDead> they sorta do
P6:14:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Kapow, it happens when you look at one transparent surface through another.
P6:14:32 <vdgmprgrmr> It's already been noted.
P6:14:48 <PuyoDead> place a sponge in lava, place blocks in surrounded lava, delete said blocks, sponge keeps lava at bay
P6:14:49 <Zuriki> Do sponges *run out*?
P6:14:59 <paul|not> they time out 
P6:15:00 <paul|not> randomly
P6:15:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Sponges randomly die...
P6:15:05 <vdgmprgrmr> It's annoying.
P6:15:07 <PuyoDead> they randomly vanish... is what seems to be the strangest random timer ever
P6:15:09 <Zuriki> >:[
P6:15:10 <wingboy> my flood servers are both full lol
P6:15:13 <Zuriki> Thats annoying
P6:15:15 <wingboy> everyone wants some sponge
P6:15:15 <Kapow> it is pretty weird
P6:15:17 <Snowman> yay for underwater sponge tunnels :D
P6:15:21 <Droqen> I love sponges :D
P6:15:23 <Kapow> why would they disappear?
P6:15:33 <Fishlips> dry up
P6:15:34 <wingboy> cause they r being abused
P6:15:41 <Kapow> so is water
P6:15:44 <wingboy> people just place them and expect them to drain up water
P6:15:54 <wingboy> no one thinks about the sponge
P6:15:56 <PuyoDead> well duh, they're sponges
P6:15:56 <Kapow> ...what's wrong with that
P6:16:11 <wingboy> im starting a sponge carehome
P6:16:15 <Kinhoshi> lol
P6:16:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Although I think the sponge would be more appropriate if they were called "magical keeper-away of water" because that's what they are more than sponges...
P6:16:31 <Snowman> a sponge decaying can mean complete flooding of a building
P6:16:36 <Zuriki> Random airbuble glitch
P6:16:39 <Zuriki> :S
P6:16:39 <wingboy> notch you should put your face on the block
P6:16:44 <wingboy> it would be awesome
P6:16:49 <vdgmprgrmr> They'll work differently when we get finite water, right?
P6:17:04 <UBOA> they better
P6:17:07 <paul|not> IF we get finite water
P6:17:11 <paul|not> no one knows
P6:17:13 <paul|not> it is a mystery
P6:17:14 <UBOA> too easily abused and too difficult to use right now
P6:17:25 <Notch> i can take them out if everyone hates them
P6:17:33 <wingboy> >:(
P6:17:35 <UBOA> I like the concept
P6:17:38 <Kapow> it's a little early to judge
P6:17:47 <Kapow> the random disappearance is strange
P6:17:47 <paul|not> it's a good idea mos def
P6:17:57 <UBOA> they seem to have been nerfed before they even got put into the game though
P6:17:58 <wingboy> we need sponges for griefer deterents
P6:17:59 <paul|not> though I haven't used them yet
P6:18:11 <Notch> should I take out the random vanish?
P6:18:14 <Kapow> yeah
P6:18:16 <paul|not> yeah personally constant sponges would be nice
P6:18:16 <UBOA> yes
P6:18:16 <wingboy> yes
P6:18:18 <Notch> ok
P6:18:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Pretty sure sponges are grief-deterrents and griefer-tools at the same time.
P6:18:20 <Kapow> if you don't want them around you can just destroy them
P6:18:21 <UBOA> VERY YES
P6:18:25 <Notch> consider it done
P6:18:26 <Kapow> no reason to have to keep remaking them
P6:18:42 <wingboy> and deflooding stuff with dissapearing sponges is weird :P
P6:18:50 <PuyoDead> I just see the usual form of griefing being far more dominant than sponge use
P6:18:52 <LKA> Yeah, disappearing sponges is hilariously awkward
P6:19:02 <PuyoDead> those people aren't quite creative enough for utilize sponges that way
P6:19:05 <LKA> some of them have been there since I've placed them, others have disappeared within mere seconds
P6:19:11 <paul|not> yeah man I want my sponge castles
P6:19:19 <Fishlips> oh dear :P
P6:19:29 <UBOA> Puyo don't underestimate the griefers
P6:19:30 <Snowman> yay for easy underwater domes
P6:19:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, Notch, I had an idea regarding caves, and I'd like to know what you think.
P6:19:32 <Notch> I'm switching glass to a non-semi-trasparent texture
P6:19:33 <paul|not> my UNDERWATER sponge castles
P6:19:36 <PuyoDead> oh, I know
P6:19:37 <Fishlips> :O
P6:19:42 <Kapow> I like the range
P6:19:46 <Kapow> you can hide them in walls
P6:19:48 <Kapow> or floors
P6:19:52 <LKA> Sponge is really powerful though so thats nice
P6:19:53 <Snowman> notch make it a tiny bit semi transparant though
P6:19:54 <liq3> Notch: will the new texture stop z-fighting with water on the sides?
P6:19:54 <vdgmprgrmr> You can?
P6:19:57 <paul|not> glass should be completely transparent but it gives a blue tint when you view through it
P6:19:58 <vdgmprgrmr> THAT IS AWESOME.
P6:20:01 <Snowman> floating pixels dont look good
P6:20:01 <paul|not> basically lighter colored water
P6:20:02 <Notch> no, snowman, it doesn't work with water.
P6:20:03 <Kapow> because they have 2 block reach
P6:20:04 <PuyoDead> yup
P6:20:06 <Kapow> in any direction
P6:20:12 <Redshift> the glass looks crappy D:
P6:20:18 <PuyoDead> you can technically hide them entirely

P6:21:42 <vdgmprgrmr> My cave suggestion: Assuming your caves are generated by a sphere that runs through the ground deleting blocks, I think it would be a nice addition for the sphere to occasionally jump forward a few steps, causing the tunnel to become slightly narrower in certain areas, or maybe even making small walls or tiny holes to peer through, instead of the current continuous tube.

P6:27:59 <obnub> Sponges are.. intresting
P6:27:59 <Snowman> yeah Notch why is the timer on it?
P6:28:00 <Conic> No
P6:28:05 <Conic> Sponges soak up water
P6:28:05 <Notch> i'm taking it out. =)
P6:28:11 <Snowman> good
P6:28:12 <Fishlips> sponges will be permanent
P6:28:13 <Conic> and they stop clearing it
P6:28:13 <LKA> hooray <3
P6:28:17 <Panza> Hmm... new server.jar won't load. Says java.net.BindException: Address already in use
P6:28:33 <C418> monday monday monday monday monday
P6:28:37 <Leyart> you should stop other java processes
P6:28:40 <Conic> yeah
P6:28:41 <Snowman> Notch, dont forget to change the version number :D
P6:28:44 <obnub> Panza: sounds like you'res till running the old one
P6:28:44 <Conic> Sponges need to be permanent
P6:28:47 <Conic> Badly.

P6:29:13 <Droqen> water is 4 times faster than lava
P6:29:21 <Leyart> Notch what does better avatars means?
P6:29:23 <Haruhi> also lava and water take turns flooding
P6:29:27 <ThisIsALurker> I.e. It keeps flowing and overcomes the sponge
P6:29:30 <Flink> droqen, I dissagree, I think it's between 0 and 900 times faster than lava

P6:30:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> We can't fixed griefed things now
P6:30:21 <Droqen> wasteful
P6:30:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, babies can crawl away from flowing lava in REAL LIFE, but water floods are pretty fast and destructive.
P6:30:25 <Snowman> yeah ok
P6:30:28 <Snowman> whats the cap now?
P6:30:32 <Snowman> 250?
P6:30:32 <Droqen> vdg: XD really

P6:50:39 <Notch> the avatars have a more natural neutral stance, and they're not mirrored, plus I fixed a rotation interpolation bug
P6:50:41 <Snowman> Notch are the mirrored skins fixed yet?
P6:50:43 <Snowman> ok
P6:50:53 <PuyoDead> woohoo!
P6:51:37 <Kapow> are the lava flow and vertical flow bugs fixed?
P6:51:39 <AlLnAtuRalX> restarting the server for like the 8th time today
P6:51:39 <Haruhi> the glass blocks look so much more like glass now

P6:51:51 <Daidoji> notch how do you feel about subtle texture clue for water on the other side
P6:51:55 <Daidoji> like maybe a tiny drip
P6:52:00 <Daidoji> or something of that sort

P6:52:03 <Evil-Ville> Yeah it does Haruhi
P6:52:22 <Prime_2> That would be nice to have
P6:52:29 <Prime_2> but it would also have to be on the side
P6:52:30 <No21383013543330> What does it mean when Connection Lost, Wrong Protocol Version?
P6:52:37 <Daidoji> well yeah
P6:52:40 <Kapow> it means the server hasn't updated
P6:52:42 <Notch> I tried making tiles with water on the other side darker, but that was very confusing
P6:52:51 <Kapow> .18 doesn't work anymore
P6:53:17 <Prime_2> and wow, this channel sure is populus
P6:53:28 <Droqen> What happened to lava survival?
P6:53:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch did you fix the z-fighting that occurs between the character's leg and body when the legs are up at an angle?
P6:53:31 <Daidoji> how about a few small translucent pixels that pour down it
P6:53:40 <Daidoji> like make it almost invisible but still noticible
P6:53:42 <Daidoji> hell
P6:53:49 <Droqen> Notch - the glass is nice :)
P6:53:53 <Daidoji> take the water texture and overlay it on the side of the block
P6:53:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> love the new glass also
P6:54:00 <Daidoji> so it has that sheen or something
P6:54:07 <Kapow> sheen would be too much
P6:54:41 <No21383013543330> How do you make a screenshot like the other people?
P6:54:43 <Daidoji> have you seen water running on a wall
P6:54:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch: New bug... When I try to move my mouse to the right to turn my FoV, it escapes the window to the menu (Generate new level, etc)... This is Fedora 11 JRE 6
P6:54:46 <Daidoji> I mean like that
P6:54:52 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: No, not yet
P6:54:57 <Kapow> water shouldn't run down every wall with water behind it
P6:55:00 <Kapow> that would look odd
P6:55:05 <Haruhi> how about just make new blocks for damp sand, mud, and damp rock
P6:55:12 <Haruhi> and damp wood i guess
P6:55:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Why not just make the blocks darker?
P6:55:27 <C418> how about a new block for 65535 colors
P6:55:29 <Notch> I tried that
P6:55:33 <Notch> it was horribly confusing
P6:55:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Tried what?
P6:55:40 <No21383013543330> Notch
P6:55:43 <Notch> making tiles next to water darker
P6:55:44 <No21383013543330> What time is it over there?
P6:55:48 <Notch> 1:56 am
P6:55:51 <C418> uh, 2 am...
P6:55:51 <No21383013543330> Go to sleep

P6:56:03 <Quatroking> Is Akuryo a good or a bad player
P6:56:03 <C418> I would refuse
P6:56:08 <Daidoji> how about just random water particles then
P6:56:15 <Syniphas> hmm
P6:56:16 <wingboy> is that all the updates that require a restart now notch? :3
P6:56:25 <Syniphas> i've had no planning on this

P6:57:02 <Notch> it's coming back tomorrow
P6:57:11 <Syniphas> so uh
P6:57:13 <Notch> I took it out temporarily since it didn't fit in the 9 slot inventory. =)
P6:57:21 <Syniphas> minecrap isn't really coming along very well
P6:57:21 <Conic> Sponges still die after a while
P6:57:27 <Testvan> but im building something huge out of that style block I DEMAND A REFUND THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
P6:57:31 <Daidoji> notch why don't you steal from city of heroes
P6:57:45 <Notch> never played it!
P6:57:45 <Daidoji> then just have a bar you can drag stuff to
P6:58:00 <Daidoji> okay well it's technically every mmo ever
P6:58:02 <vdgmprgrmr> That wouldn't be stealing from CoH I think...
P6:58:05 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah...
P6:58:07 <Notch> because it won't work like that in survival
P6:58:07 <Daidoji> just a bar you can put the tiles on.
P6:58:09 <Testvan> enjoy the complaint to the BBB
P6:58:11 <Daidoji> from a master list
P6:58:11 <obnub> How do you drag sutff, when you don't have a mouse?
P6:58:17 <Notch> and I want the same system in all game modes
P6:58:23 <Daidoji> how do you play minecraft without a mouse
P6:58:35 <Notch> there's no mouse cursor
P6:58:36 <obnub> But your mouse is captured, ergo no dragging
P6:58:41 <LilRobot> LAVA FALLING FROM THE SKY? WWTF?? http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8d8c236a882fe1420ed8e382b7f4801b
P6:58:50 <Syniphas> wait
P6:58:50 <Kapow> notch: you should hide the inventory bar except when you're changing blocks
P6:58:51 <Daidoji> inventory mode obviously
P6:58:51 <Syniphas> Notch
P6:59:09 <Kapow> and just show the active block in the corner like it used to be
P6:59:10 <Notch> yes?
P6:59:16 <Syniphas> please tell me you're not going to drastically change the entire level file structure
P6:59:18 <Kapow> there's no reason to have the bar there all the time
P6:59:24 <Notch> I probably will
P6:59:38 <Snowman> make it stay visible for like 5 seconds after you change blocks
P6:59:44 <liq3> Kapow: There wi ll be for survival.
P6:59:58 <PuyoDead> I still like the idea of having the block bar vertically along the right side
P7:00:00 <Kapow> why?  it's going to change?
P7:00:02 <liq3> You'll need to know what armour you have, amount of food, how many and what blocks.
P7:00:02 <peerkoel> is Party_cat the admin of the water world?
P7:00:04 <PuyoDead> scrolling would make more sense, too
P7:00:06 <liq3> etc etc
P7:00:18 <peerkoel> the one that is offline now... :(
P7:00:20 <Kapow> well if it's actually an inventory then that's different
P7:00:25 <Kapow> but the way it is now, there's no reason
P7:00:26 <peerkoel> while I was building a mighty ship :(
P7:00:31 <liq3> Kapow: You can't create  infinite blocks in survival according to the blog. :p
P7:00:31 <Kapow> hide it for build mode maybe?
P7:00:39 <Snowman> Oh and Notch why are you coding at 2am? :D

11P7:01:21 <DBN> plz
P7:01:21 <C418> does that count?
P7:01:22 <Syniphas> Notch :<
P7:01:23 <liq3> Nah better to code from 5am to 12pm imo.
P7:01:34 <Syniphas> I'll hold developent on minecrap then
P7:01:43 <liq3> Then at 12pm your brain shuts down and you do other stuff. :D
P7:01:54 <C418> a speedhack is something I prefer not to be optional

P7:21:26 <Syniphas> I guess, even without touching the map code
P7:21:34 <Syniphas> I could still finish minecrap's GUI
P7:21:49 <Syniphas> any idea of when you're changing the structure, Notch/
P7:22:10 <Notch> no. It'll be at random at any time. Sorry, I can't commit to the file format yet
P7:22:33 <Syniphas> Okay...
P7:23:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, it appears that when a character's BODY isn't in view, the whole model disappears.
P7:23:06 <PuyoDead> quick rough skin attempt: http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=PuyoDead
P7:23:08 <Notch> oh yeah!!
13P7:23:11 * Notch adds to bug list
P7:23:16 <Notch> I keep forgetting that one, now I won't!
P7:23:52 <Syniphas> Well, I'll either rush and make a shitty editor for current maps, or delay minecrap 2 to the point people lose interest
P7:23:54 <PuyoDead> oh yea, head shading

P7:32:36 <Lmaoboat> Hey notch, have you thought about making the hud msaller, but enlarge your selection like on a mac?
P7:32:49 <PuyoDead> seems a little over fancy
P7:33:00 <PuyoDead> tweaked it a bit http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=PuyoDead
P7:33:01 <peerkoel> I want the yellow sand back
P7:33:13 <Droqen> Ooh. I was just reminded of... the hud from some of the metal gear solid games
P7:33:23 <Prime_2> so, why is it that sponge is all of a sudden killed by lava
P7:33:23 <Droqen> except in the top right hand corner as it was before
P7:33:36 <PuyoDead> Prime_2, it probably just faded
10P7:33:37 * Conic is now known as ConicAway

P7:37:12 <Erki> hey guys
P7:37:21 <MANIA> nothing worth fighting for, though
P7:37:42 <Lmaoboat>  sponge tunnels are aesome
P7:37:52 <MANIA> sound awesome too
P7:38:03 <Senku> I just made an underwater glass cube
P7:38:20 <Senku> With me inside with no water cept around the glass
P7:38:52 <Erki> Whats up with my Minecraft? I am running incredibly fast and I am disconnected because of too much lagß
P7:38:52 <UBOA> they've built glass dams in our server :3
P7:39:08 <MANIA> glass really adds to the experience
P7:39:15 <UBOA> leading to huge canyons
P7:39:15 <MANIA> now houses will have nice windows too
P7:39:16 <MANIA> :)
P7:39:24 <UBOA> so tempted to grief
P7:39:30 <PuyoDead> glass skybridges are awesome
P7:39:33 <Senku> This glass texture still seems like it has too many lines on it
P7:39:40 <UBOA> yes
P7:39:45 <MANIA> i like it that way
P7:39:45 <Notch> I'm very happy with how the glass texture ended up
P7:39:47 <Zuriki> http://i40.tinypic.com/2jedc86.png
P7:39:49 <Senku> Seems more like ice this way
P7:39:58 <MANIA> they it was before was like ice
P7:40:00 <dropshock> I just bought minecraft :D
P7:40:02 <Lmaoboat> The sponge will save us fron unwanted mistakes
P7:40:02 <MANIA> *way
P7:40:07 <Lmaoboat> wait...
P7:40:12 <UBOA> the sponge needs less random delete
P7:40:15 <Notch> lol Zuriki
P7:40:18 <Zuriki> XD
P7:40:21 <Notch> what the heckbuckets? =D
P7:40:30 <peerkoel> Notch: could the glass texture be a little transparent?
P7:40:36 <peerkoel> like the water
P7:40:37 <Droqen> Look at my wonderful Curly Brace skin
P7:40:38 <Droqen> http://minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Droqen
P7:40:39 <UBOA> oh that'd work
P7:40:39 <Zuriki> I was like.. what is wrong with this Mob.. I can't quiet.. OMG
P7:40:59 <Senku> Looks broken
P7:41:11 <Notch> peerkoel: Unfortunately not because of how I do the rendering
P7:41:16 <Senku> I see a default skin with a } on the face
P7:41:17 <UBOA> the one thing that put me off is how opaque the lines are
P7:41:19 <peerkoel> ah, ok
P7:41:21 <Droqen> xD
P7:41:25 <Zuriki> :P
P7:41:27 <Zuriki> Nice pun
P7:41:29 <UBOA> ah damn
P7:41:34 <Notch> update your server to get no random sponge delete
P7:41:34 <MANIA> i like the glass art

P7:42:25 <Zuriki> Notch, I think you should add /
P7:42:26 <Lmaoboat> The sponge adds a deceptive amount of depth
P7:42:27 <Zuriki> XD
P7:42:34 <Notch> I'll make it work both with and without /
P7:42:48 <Senku> Is there a way I can make a custom skin but not be able to use it? :<
P7:43:01 <Drakkar> hey notch
P7:43:05 <Droqen> Zuriki- :D
P7:43:06 <Drakkar> will there be catapaults eventually
P7:43:13 <Notch> ooh. Maybe. =D
P7:43:15 <Drakkar> because I can imagine catapaults being hilarious
P7:43:20 <Droqen> Senku, do you mean make one without buying the game?
P7:43:24 <Notch> it's a bit more advanced than what I've got planned
P7:43:30 <Senku> Currently yes
P7:43:31 <Quatroking> Notch, is it possible to make chat coming from the console colored blue/red so it's disguisable from normal in-game /say ?
P7:43:32 <Drakkar> just curious
P7:43:34 <Notch> but it'd make for a pretty cool expansion in the future. =D

P7:45:18 <Notch> i don't think you can say & from the client
P7:45:23 <Droqen> oh okay
P7:45:25 <Droqen> xD
P7:45:27 <C418> in irc /say made to say things
P7:45:29 <Senku> Is there any pallete limits to skins?
P7:45:32 <C418> plus is
P7:45:39 <Droqen> Senku - I doubt it
P7:45:39 <Quatroking> so its just &g for green and stuff?
P7:45:42 <Droqen> just look at the default skin
P7:45:45 <Notch> no, it's 0-f
P7:45:46 <Senku> So I can use any colors?
P7:45:52 <Notch> it's the ega palette, almost
P7:45:59 <Notch> 0 = black, 1 = blue
P7:46:02 <Notch> f = white
P7:46:03 <Notch> e = yellow
P7:46:15 <Droqen> [ I haven't run into any problems of that sort, Senku ]

P7:49:51 <Notch> if you're running too fast, it SHOULD kick you. But the client really should throttle it better
P7:50:03 <Syniphas> Yeah, I noticed
P7:50:04 <Notch> I tried to fix it in _03, but I guess it didn't work
P7:50:05 <obnub> Syniphas: You should add hair to the back of the "bottom of the head" area
P7:50:06 <Droqen> It kinda makes it link up better
P7:50:06 <Erki> It does kick me...
13P7:50:15 * obnub must be slow tonight
P7:50:25 <Notch> the next server version will contain a less strict check
P7:50:26 <obnub> Or just not paying attention
P7:50:32 <Droqen> Personally I gave up completely on the hair on the back of the torso method x3
P7:50:44 <Syniphas> Heh
P7:50:52 <Syniphas> I'm just trying to picture myself here
P7:50:57 <Syniphas> I have a really long hair
P7:51:03 <obnub> Hmm, the black neck-meets-body area is kind of disturbing
P7:51:16 <Droqen> Oh! Rydia, are you still around since changing your name?
P7:51:23 <Droqen> [ back from Haruhi ]
P7:52:07 <Notch> oh!
P7:52:15 <Notch> the client sends movement data while downloading the level
P7:52:18 <Syniphas> Which of the 4 sides of the head bottom is the back?
P7:52:25 <Notch> that could DEFINITELY cause the too much lag thing
P7:52:43 <Droqen> Syniphas: bottom edge
P7:52:49 <Syniphas> Ok, thanks
P7:52:52 <Droqen> nod

P8:07:37 <Notch> the next server update will change the time from 20 seconds lag to 60 seconds
P8:07:38 <vdgmprgrmr> Absorbs lava?
P8:07:43 <Notch> 60 seconds is A FLIPPING LOT
P8:08:00 <Deiz> Notch: Glass graphic is baaaaad
P8:08:07 <Notch> no, it's awesome =D
P8:08:10 <Water-Marine> Hm...haven't crashed anymore notch :D
P8:08:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I like the glass graphic!
P8:08:11 <Deiz> Due to it being 0/100% alpha it looks like sticks at range
P8:08:15 <Deiz> And it moires horribly
P8:08:22 <Notch> :D
P8:08:28 <Evil-Ville> Old one was worse
P8:08:28 <Notch> I likes it, mister!
P8:08:30 <vdgmprgrmr> When do you plan on implementing mipmapping, eh, Notch?
P8:08:35 <Notch> I don't think I will!
P8:08:36 <ZomBuster> yay it works now
P8:08:38 <ZomBuster> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cfe8b64d8aeca7fb61c20060840bb0b5
P8:08:40 <vdgmprgrmr> You should!
P8:08:43 <vdgmprgrmr> It's annoying!
P8:08:44 <Notch> Well, if people threaten to kill me, I will
P8:08:49 <Notch> but I like this
P8:08:53 <Lmaoboat> I'm gladd it's 0/100% alpha so it can render properly with water
P8:08:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch, gosh darnit, I will slaughter your family.
P8:09:09 <Notch> :-O
P8:09:11 <Notch> OW KNOWS
P8:09:13 <Evil-Ville> Not implementing mipmapping is just stupid though
P8:09:17 <vdgmprgrmr>  >:(
P8:09:27 <Notch> is not! It's pixely!
P8:09:30 <Syniphas> i will too if you don't donate me a free copy of minecraft :<
P8:09:34 <PuyoDead> pixely is good
P8:09:35 <vdgmprgrmr> It's nasty!
P8:09:39 <Syniphas> R$30 is just too much for a webgame, notch..
P8:09:41 <PuyoDead> it's beautiful!
P8:09:44 <Evil-Ville> It makes annoying shitty wavy artifacts when you look at things from distance
P8:09:58 <Notch> Syniphas: Don't buy it. =)
P8:10:08 <Water-Marine> BAWWWWW GLASS LOOK LIKE WHITE BIRD POOP BAWWWWW
P8:10:23 <Syniphas> THEN WHY TORTURE ME WITH "wanna skin?? buy me lolololol"
P8:10:29 <Syniphas> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
P8:10:33 <Evil-Ville> Stop whining already Syniphas
P8:10:37 <Notch> I've got a 3% conversion rate. I don't think I'd get much higher if I lowered the price
P8:10:37 <Syniphas> no.
P8:10:47 <Syniphas> fine, whatever
P8:10:47 <Senku> Is this arm I'm texturing a right arm or left?
P8:10:53 <Evil-Ville> Both
P8:11:04 <Senku> So it has no true thumb side?
P8:11:08 <Evil-Ville> Yes
P8:11:09 <Syniphas> nope
P8:11:12 <Senku> Ok
P8:11:16 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P8:11:21 <Syniphas> it's mirrored
P8:11:22 <Notch> oh, I could mirror the texture on one arm!
P8:11:27 <Syniphas> mirroring sucks
P8:11:41 <Evil-Ville> Actually it isn't even mirrored right now
P8:11:50 <Notch> could someone check my math?
P8:11:51 <Syniphas> i thought it was
P8:11:51 <vdgmprgrmr> I think they should be mirrored.
P8:12:04 <Syniphas> i think there should be separate textures
P8:12:06 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, like real arms.
P8:12:13 <Notch> I've got realTime and gameTime
P8:12:18 <Notch> realTime SHOULD be correct
P8:12:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, separate textures would ve ideal, but...
P8:12:31 <Syniphas> but?
P8:12:33 <Notch> gameTime will be the same as realTime if the game clock runs at the right speed
P8:12:35 <Syniphas> but notch is too lazy?
P8:12:35 <vdgmprgrmr> but...
P8:12:46 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, it's the "but".
P8:12:46 <Notch> (realtime updates too rarely to use as a game timer)
P8:12:52 <Syniphas> but that would invalidate many skins?
P8:12:56 <vdgmprgrmr> It just stops the sentence...
P8:12:56 <Syniphas> bleh
P8:12:59 <Notch> so once per second I go "adjustTime = realTime/gameTime"
P8:13:16 <Syniphas> and minecraft freezes firefox again!
P8:13:16 <Notch> then when I advance the timer, I advance it by gameTime*adjustTime
P8:13:30 <Syniphas> that's minecraft 9 x 0 other sources
P8:13:38 <Syniphas> one more freeze and mc scores a ten
P8:13:40 <Syniphas> go mc
P8:13:53 <Rroff> its happening on my other PC too
P8:13:56 <Notch> does that math seem off?
P8:14:00 <Rroff> and seems to depend on the framerate
P8:14:04 <C418> I bought a wiimote plus
P8:14:09 <C418> and now I have this useless condom
P8:14:10 <C418> hm
P8:14:19 <Rroff> higher framerate the rubber band feeling is less noticeable
P8:14:33 <ZomBuster> you know you want to
P8:14:38 <vdgmprgrmr>  rubber band feeling?
P8:14:54 <Rroff> slight warpy motion
P8:14:58 <C418> you know
P8:15:04 <ZomBuster> weird
P8:15:05 <C418> if they stop moving and suddenly go hyperspeed
P8:15:05 <Rroff> like you get pulled about slightly as you move
P8:15:12 <ZomBuster> the server got flooded
P8:15:15 <Water-Marine> Wups, there goes the crash
P8:15:21 <ZomBuster> server crashes
P8:15:25 <ZomBuster> I restart server
P8:15:27 <Water-Marine> Cheat Detected: Too much lag
P8:15:28 <ZomBuster> no water!
P8:15:28 <Senku> Is there a way to preview this skin?
P8:15:34 <Rroff> <Water-Marine> Cheat Detected: Too much lag
P8:15:36 <ZomBuster> the sponge sucked it all up!
P8:15:38 <Rroff> I'm getting that constantly
P8:15:43 <Rroff> (and I'm not cheating :P)
P8:15:52 <C418> your internet connection may be too slow
P8:15:56 <Water-Marine> No, dude
P8:15:57 <Rroff> and I ping 15ms to the server
P8:16:05 <Notch> Rroff: new client up now, try it
P8:16:06 <Water-Marine> Minecraft worked fine before 19a went up
P8:16:07 <Rroff> no lag, decent bandwidth
P8:16:08 <Rroff> kk
P8:16:20 <Notch> Water-Marine: actually, it just let people cheat. ;)
P8:16:31 <Water-Marine> ooooh.
P8:16:41 <Notch> it still does, but in less ways
P8:16:48 <Notch> I'll tighten up more holes closer to beta
P8:16:57 <Notch> when I tighten the holes, I sometimes overtighten
P8:17:11 <Notch> like in this case. So i have to spend some time fixing it. =)
P8:17:16 <Deiz> Notch: I hate the new lava
P8:17:21 <ZomBuster> notch it up
P8:17:22 <Deiz> The old one was livelier
P8:17:25 <Notch> bad day today, deiz?
P8:17:35 <Deiz> I'm a hateful person
P8:17:39 <Deiz> The old one had a glow to it
P8:17:40 <Notch> :-O
P8:17:42 <Testvan> so tomorrow the new version with all the blocks comes out?
P8:17:45 <Rroff> still getting the same
P8:17:45 <Evil-Ville> I'd like old lava with animation better than new lava
P8:17:48 <Rroff> but
P8:17:49 <Notch> yes, testvan
P8:17:52 <Deiz> The new one looks like blood
P8:17:53 <Testvan> coo

P8:18:15 <Notch> try again, rrof
P8:18:22 <ZomBuster> holy damn
P8:18:24 <Evil-Ville> Looking like blood is kind of pushing it though
P8:18:35 <ZomBuster> menger sponge made of sponge + lotsa water = cool
P8:18:41 <Notch> Water-Marine: Beta is a few weeks away, probably
P8:18:48 <ZomBuster> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cfe8b64d8aeca7fb61c20060840bb0b5
P8:18:48 <Notch> release is longer away
P8:18:51 <Deiz> Notch: Also, ditch the anims, or at least make them flow from 0x -> 16x
P8:18:59 <Deiz> Making them pulsate looks weird IMO
P8:19:11 <Water-Marine> Deiz, who lit the fuse on your tampon today?
P8:19:14 <paul|not> huh
P8:19:15 <paul|not> uh
P8:19:15 <Rroff> the player anims are hilarious sometimes
P8:19:17 <paul|not> that's odd
P8:19:22 <Rroff> had 8-9 guys go past all in a row
P8:19:24 <paul|not> illegal argument exception NULL
P8:19:25 <Deiz> Water-Marine: They're opinions.
P8:19:28 <Rroff> was really funny to watch
P8:19:36 <Notch> lol
P8:19:48 <Water-Marine> You're spitting them out like the octo-mom's children, deiz.
P8:19:51 <Syniphas> notch, if I may,
P8:19:53 <Water-Marine> Slow it down.
P8:19:57 <Rroff> 19a_05 is the new one?
P8:20:00 <Notch> yes
P8:20:04 <Syniphas> And this is just my opinion, by the way
P8:20:11 <Notch> go ahead =)
P8:20:15 <Syniphas> feel free to disregard it if you want
P8:20:15 <Rroff> still the same for me
P8:20:24 <Notch> crud, ok
P8:20:25 <Syniphas> 2 things that shouldn't have been done
P8:21:05 <Syniphas> are the fact that minecraft should be paid, and this last update (or at least should've been done better, I'm not the only one complaining about lots of stuff that changed here)
P8:21:13 <Rroff> ah crap
P8:21:34 <Rroff> I think the clockgen on this PC is dying or something

P8:21:54 <Notch> Yeah, I'm going to ignore that, Syniphas. I want to do indie game dev full time, I'll never get there by not getting paid
P8:22:02 <Syniphas> sure
P8:22:06 <Notch> and you don't have to pay until it's done.
P8:22:07 <Rroff> might be why its doing it - tho not sure why my other PC had similiar symptoms
P8:22:09 <Syniphas> I see your point, but
P8:22:20 <Notch> this latest patch, people on here asked me to release it early, so I did.
P8:22:32 <Syniphas> Well, yeah but if I'm not willing to pay R$30 for it now
P8:22:38 <citricsquid> syn: Don't then.
P8:22:40 <Notch> That's fine, you don't have to
P8:22:45 <PuyoDead> it and helped, because a lot of bugs got squished just tonight
P8:22:46 <Syniphas> I'm damn sure I'm not paying R$60 for it later
P8:22:52 <citricsquid> syn: Nothing to do with notch if the exchange rate for your currency sucks balls
P8:22:54 <Syniphas> might as well as just stop here
P8:23:04 <Syniphas> citricsquid, YES, I GET IT ALREADY
P8:23:06 <Rroff> grr ignore what I said earlier
P8:23:09 <Notch> PuyoDead: I like to think so too. =)
P8:23:10 <Water-Marine> What if you went the way Wurm did, only paying money for premium features such as skins and special blocks and such?
P8:23:11 <Notch> Rroff?
P8:23:16 <Rroff> clockgen is deffinatly fried on this PC
P8:23:16 <Deiz> Notch: I think the 'pulsating' animations make the water/lava look very 'tiled' in large groups
P8:23:19 <Syniphas> look, it was fun while it lasted
P8:23:27 <PuyoDead> yes, it was, and still is
P8:23:28 <Notch> i agree, deiz
P8:23:30 <Deiz> Where the static faces looked contiguous, if placid
P8:23:36 <citricsquid> syn: but you can still play the game? eh?
P8:23:37 <Rroff> the system timer is gaining 1 second for every 3
P8:23:42 <Syniphas> but meh
P8:23:56 <Notch> the current version is mostly just a test of animated textures
P8:23:56 <Syniphas> it's getting old now, and knowing that soon I'll have to pay for it
P8:23:59 <Notch> they're self-updating. =D
P8:24:00 <Syniphas> Well, bye.

P8:25:12 <ZomBuster> if you have a mother in law
P8:25:15 <Spazz`> "That's ok" I said, and deleted the rest of the blocks of sand, only to accidentally delete one of those stone blocks.
P8:25:16 <Rroff> its only when I have Java running
P8:25:22 <PuyoDead> yes, I'm old
P8:25:23 <ZomBuster> you have other ways of aquiring money

P8:26:06 <Notch> there will be a liberal demo version
P8:26:07 <PuyoDead> ohio
P8:26:11 <Rroff> can anyone confirm this...
P8:26:11 <ZomBuster> he fixed that?
P8:26:16 <ZomBuster> oh oh let me try
P8:26:17 <Notch> and, I've hinted at this before, but:
P8:26:20 <Rroff> thats getting kicked for "lag hacks"
P8:26:21 <Redshift> lol
P8:26:33 <Rroff> has your system clock gone forward several minutes to what it should be?

P8:58:20 <Hanky> notch
P8:58:26 <Notch> yes? =)
P8:58:29 <Hanky> thank you for creating this game
P8:58:32 <Droqen> aww he didn't buy it
P8:58:38 <Hanky> playing it cured my brain cancer
P8:58:41 <Droqen> I should thank Notch too, but maybe I will wait for him to wake up
P8:58:43 <Notch> WOW
P8:58:44 <Water-Marine> Notch, we need a ventrilo server so damn bad
P8:58:47 <Hanky> and gave my classmates aids
P8:58:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Water-Marine: I can host a teamspeak for us probably
10P8:58:59 * Notch changes topic to 'http://www.minecraft.net/  |  Client 0.0.19a is up, a server update is required!  |  <Hanky> playing [minecraft] cured my brain cancer'
P8:59:03 <AlLnAtuRalX> Water-Marine: I'll look into it tomorrow
P8:59:07 <Water-Marine> sweet
P8:59:07 <Droqen> I want to hear sleepy Notch
P8:59:11 <Hanky> it also made my penis go up
P8:59:16 <Droqen> It looks like my dreams have been crushed
P8:59:17 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol...
P8:59:20 <Notch> it made me grow an extra one
P8:59:20 <ZomBuster> like on the wiki!
P8:59:20 <Hanky> thank you notch i will buy this game tomorrow
P8:59:28 <Notch> wow, thank you for the kind words!
P8:59:37 <Water-Marine> im going to buy this game twice
P8:59:43 <Hanky> notch can you send me a picture of you naked
P8:59:46 <AlLnAtuRalX> twice?  I will buy it 9x
P8:59:47 <Hanky> or in tight rubber clothes
P8:59:56 <citricsquid> I used to be single, lonely and overweight, since playing minecraft I've got laid 8 times and now I'm super fit!
P8:59:57 <Notch> No, I'm been ordered not to do that any more
P9:00:04 <Hanky> :(
P9:00:04 <Water-Marine> 9x? I'll just buy Notch then
P9:00:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> yeah, people are cheap in sweden
P9:00:18 <Notch> I've bought it eight times. =D
P9:00:18 <Quatroking> Lucky star music remixes for the win
P9:00:24 <Water-Marine> Notch, how much would it cost to have you as my personal manwhore?
P9:00:28 <Notch> of course, I get most of that money back, so it doesn't matter
P9:00:35 <Notch> Cost?
P9:00:35 <Hanky> notch
P9:00:43 <Notch> yes, hanky?
P9:00:44 <Hanky> how did you manage to cure my braincancer
P9:00:46 <Hanky> its amazing
P9:00:47 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch will do it for a pizzabagel and a beer.
P9:00:54 <Notch> actually, I've got bad news, hanky..
P9:00:58 <Water-Marine> pizza bagelllsssss
P9:00:58 <Notch> I probably didn't.
P9:01:05 <Hanky> no longer do i have to walk around with a giantic tumor next to my eye
P9:01:06 <Droqen> Don't tell him
P9:01:07 <AlLnAtuRalX> Yeah... The doctor messed up
P9:01:11 <citricsquid> notch: I tried registering my nick, irc is scary =D
P9:01:12 <AlLnAtuRalX> He was too busy playing Minecraft to do proper care
P9:01:13 <Droqen> the placebo effect will go away :<
P9:01:14 <Notch> perhaps it was a bear?
P9:01:19 <AlLnAtuRalX> citricsquid: /msg nickserv register password e-mail
P9:01:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> simple
P9:01:34 <Zuriki> They couldn't remove it so they moved it to somewhere you wouldn't notice.
P9:01:37 <Zuriki> You balls.
P9:01:40 <Zuriki> Your*
P9:01:47 <citricsquid> I did that, it just dinged, I need notification in text form!
P9:01:49 <Notch> http://www.angryflower.com/bravel.gif
P9:01:50 <Hanky> my balls actually contain more seed than usual
P9:02:05 <Hanky> yesterday
P9:02:09 <Hanky> i had sex with my gf
P9:02:10 <Hanky> and
P9:02:16 <Notch> backdraft?
P9:02:17 <Hanky> her butt blew up from all the sperm
P9:02:34 <Notch> that's very masculine!
P9:02:34 <Hanky> so now we can't do anal anymore until she's out of hospital
P9:02:42 <citricsquid> Hamky: I don't believe you, video evidence now!
P9:02:49 <Water-Marine> good thing she wasn't black
P9:02:49 <Hanky> ok hang on
P9:02:51 <Daidoji> ~MY GIRLFRIEND~
P9:02:55 <Water-Marine> you'd be dead with that much ass explosion
P9:03:00 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P9:03:14 <Hanky> me and my gf are from korea
10P9:03:18 * Notch sets mode: +o citricsquid
P9:03:25 <Lmaoboat> Real classy stuff going on in this chat
P9:03:37 <Notch> Lmaoboat: I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming all this
P9:03:46 <Daidoji> classy
P9:03:47 <liq3> Says the one with "l m o a" in his name.
P9:03:47 <Droqen> Something makes me doubt that a handkerchief could be involved in all that
P9:03:48 <Lmaoboat> I know hwo you feel
P9:03:49 <Rroff> hey Notch any plans to put in "landmarks"? so you can do \teleport landmark to get there?
P9:03:53 <Water-Marine> Anyone dreaming of chat rooms needs to get more sun
P9:03:54 <Redshift> notch, are you going to fix the lines that appear along the water texture?
P9:03:56 <ZomBuster> I dreamt I was on the internet once
P9:03:59 <ZomBuster> never again
P9:04:06 <citricsquid> notch <3
P9:04:08 <Hanky> here is a video
10P9:04:09 * Scaredsim (Mibbit@modemcable061.19-202-24.mc.videotron.ca) has joined #minecraft
P9:04:13 <Notch> Redshift: Yeah.. they're a result of me trying to fix the z fighting
P9:04:18 <Hanky> wait
P9:04:19 <Redshift> ah
P9:04:19 <Notch> it WORKED, but it added another bug, heh
P9:04:21 <Hanky> wait 4 it
P9:04:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> Notch: I have a feature request to convey to you.  Any chance of getting Quake 3-like spectate?  Admins can view the world through a players eyes, and click to cycle through players
P9:04:27 <Redshift> lol
P9:04:28 <Hanky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD4bn5pp32w
P9:04:29 <Daidoji> you mean y fighting
P9:04:29 <Lmaoboat> sponge work brilliantly
P9:04:30 <Notch> oooohhh
P9:04:33 <Notch> good idea, AlLnAtuRalX
P9:04:36 <Hanky> here
P9:04:40 <Notch> lol Daidoji
P9:04:40 <Droqen> Notch, you have good ideas in your dreams
P9:04:43 <Lmaoboat> Gotta have the sponge
P9:04:44 <AlLnAtuRalX> Thanks... It would help a lot for griefers
P9:04:45 <Rroff> you can use teleport to a limited extent to do that AlLnAtuRalX
P9:04:46 <Droqen> better not forget them
P9:04:47 <Hanky> i took my cam and cammed the blood on the walls
P9:04:49 <Hanky> and the poop
P9:04:51 <Hanky> and the sperm
P9:04:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> Rroff: They see me following them
P9:04:52 <Panza> i concur, re: flying admin mode
P9:04:56 <Rroff> true
P9:05:00 <Lmaoboat> I'm very perticlar about what kind of blocks I use
P9:05:07 <liq3> Allnatural: That'd be an epic way to stop griefers. So easy to catch em when they can't see you. :p
P9:05:09 <Scaredsim> Noclip would be great for admins
P9:05:15 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup it would
P9:05:18 <Lmaoboat> Cookie ot who gets the refrence
P9:05:32 <Water-Marine> I got it
P9:05:45 <Hanky> also playing minecraft killed all niggas in my town so now the king of town wants to give you a reward
P9:05:48 <Hanky> two nukes
P9:06:00 <Hanky> one filled with corn and one filled with cows
P9:06:02 <Daidoji> I don't mean to kick a dead horse etc but 99.99999% 3D engines use an overhead view of the world, so Z is elevation. JUST SAYING.
P9:06:15 <liq3> No it's not.
P9:06:16 <liq3> Z is depth.
10P9:06:21 * Hanky was kicked by Notch (I'm pretty liberal, but racism is less than hilarious!)
P9:06:23 <Water-Marine> No it's not
P9:06:25 <Water-Marine> Z is a letter.
P9:06:25 <liq3> Y is elevation.
P9:06:28 <liq3> Always will be.
P9:06:31 <Rroff> Z is usually eleveation in a 3D engine unless your using screenspace coordinates
P9:06:32 <Droqen> I think I have suffered enough Hanky for today oh he's suddenly gone
P9:06:34 <Rroff> when it becomes depth
P9:06:37 <Zuriki> I thank you Notch.
P9:06:47 <Daidoji> same thing
P9:06:53 <Quatroking> How the hell does video gaming cure cancer
P9:07:01 <Quatroking> :?
P9:07:04 <Droqen> minecraft is not a video game!
P9:07:04 <liq3> Rroff: In OpenGL Z is depth. That's all I need to convince me.
P9:07:09 <Droqen> minecraft is PURE MAGIC
P9:07:10 <Quatroking> Then what is it
P9:07:16 <Zuriki> Wasn't there some news artical(sp?) about that...
P9:07:17 <Lmaoboat> it's a murdur simulator!
P9:07:18 <ZomBuster> the awesome-rays kill all cancer cells
P9:07:28 <Droqen> article.
P9:07:28 <Quatroking> Wasn't it like god
P9:07:32 <Zuriki> Thank you.
P9:07:32 <Rroff> Z is only depth in screenspace
P9:07:41 <Rroff> in the world its elevation
P9:07:48 <ZomBuster> ^^^^^^^
P9:07:49 <Notch> y is up!
P9:07:51 <AlLnAtuRalX> Next person to have X Y or Z standalone gets kicked?  that sounds fun
P9:08:03 <Water-Marine> X Y Z ARE LETTERS
P9:08:05 <Water-Marine> FUCK
P9:08:07 <Rroff> :P
P9:08:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P9:08:15 <Rroff> even idsoftware mixes them up tho
P9:08:16 <Water-Marine> dumbasses, ffs
P9:08:22 <ZomBuster> it doesnt matter
P9:08:22 <Notch> AHA! I found proof!
P9:08:28 <Daidoji> every single 3D engine does it that way. all of them.
P9:08:31 <Notch> <Michelangelo> Hey, what's up?
P9:08:34 <Notch> <JohnC> Why?
P9:08:35 <Daidoji> I'd actually like to see one that isn't that way
P9:08:38 <AlLnAtuRalX> VARIABLES ARE CALLED VARIABLES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FIXED, NOW STFU!
P9:08:39 <Rroff> infact in Q2 they even manage to reverse the yaw windings sometimes which is annoying
P9:08:41 <ZomBuster> hahaha
P9:08:42 <Droqen> In mathematics-vectors zzz is up
P9:08:42 <ZomBuster> oooh
P9:08:46 <ZomBuster> wow
P9:08:47 <Droqen> Also that's good, Notch xD
P9:09:02 <MisterX> hey, ehm, I guess it's common that the performance is a lot worse now?
P9:09:05 <Rroff> lol Notch
P9:09:22 <Notch> MisterX: Yes, there's "some" fps limiting going on
P9:09:25 <Quatroking> Can someone provide me like, 50000 euro's real fast
P9:09:27 <Rroff> its not worse - theres a frame rate limit and or your hitting the timer bug
P9:09:28 <Zuriki> www.mrxswebpage.com
P9:09:31 <Zuriki> I found your site.
P9:09:33 <Notch> that too!
P9:09:33 <Zuriki> I think
P9:09:43 <MisterX> I mean that also the fps are lower than before, lower than 60
P9:09:43 <Rroff> which results in your fps being displayed as 2/3 times lower than it actually is
12P9:09:48 * Quatroking (Quatroking@86.90.159.252) Quit (Quit: I'm off, kthxbai)
P9:09:53 <Rroff> check your system clock MisterX
13P9:09:59 * liq3 gives Quatroking 1 internet, transferably to 50,000 Euros at your nearest Internet Bank.
P9:10:04 <MisterX> well, I think the 6 fps I get on huge maps pretty much feel like 6 fps
P9:10:05 <liq3> transferable*
P9:10:10 <MisterX> whereas before it used to be around 50 or so, I guess
P9:10:12 <ZomBuster> I got some pictures of spiders here
P9:10:15 <Notch> whoa
P9:10:18 <ZomBuster> Im sure they are worth a lot
P9:10:19 <Notch> that big of a difference?
P9:10:26 <Lmaoboat> How much you went to bet notch dreams of blocks and programing that he can't figure out
P9:10:32 <Water-Marine> is this the real life?
P9:10:38 <Senku> http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1458/senkux.png -- Should be the last one, then I give up till I buy the game, which is hopefully soon
P9:10:39 <MisterX> also it occasionally feels a bit laggy even when I have 50-60 fps
P9:10:40 <Droqen> is this just fantasy?
P9:10:40 <Water-Marine> or is this just fantasy?
P9:10:43 <Droqen> (sorry)
P9:10:46 <Daidoji> nope, real life is the 3rd door down the hall
P9:10:47 <Water-Marine> caught in a landslide
P9:10:51 <Water-Marine> no escape from reality
P9:10:51 <Droqen> no escape from reality
P9:10:53 <Notch> back when I had a cat..
P9:10:54 <Droqen> open your eyes
P9:10:57 <AlLnAtuRalX> Senku: Are you a good builder?  Don't forget the contest..
P9:10:58 <ZomBuster> and see
P9:11:00 <Water-Marine> look up to the skys and seeee
P9:11:01 <Notch> he woke me up one day by pawing at my hand
P9:11:04 <citricsquid> droqen: I used to run a forum called noescapefromreality =D
P9:11:05 <Droqen> skies* >:[
P9:11:09 <Water-Marine> I'm just a poooor boooy
P9:11:09 <ZomBuster> agh
P9:11:09 <Rroff> MisterX - leave the game running for 10 minutes or so and check your PC clock
P9:11:12 <Water-Marine> i need no sympathyyy
P9:11:12 <Droqen> citric: xD
P9:11:13 <Notch> and my first reaction was to try to figure out what class of objects the Cat interface accepted
P9:11:17 <Water-Marine> because I'm easy come
P9:11:19 <Water-Marine> easy go
P9:11:20 <Droqen> citric: was it a long url?
P9:11:21 <Senku> I'm an OK builder
P9:11:21 <Water-Marine> way too high
P9:11:21 <Rroff> if you've got the same problem I have the clock will have gained 3-5 minutes
P9:11:23 <Water-Marine> way too low
P9:11:26 <Daidoji> actually real life can be accessed by pressing windowskey+L assuming you have windows.
P9:11:27 <MisterX> what about my clock Rroff?
P9:11:27 <liq3> lol Notch
P9:11:28 <Water-Marine> anyway the wind blows
P9:11:31 <Water-Marine> doesn't really matter to meee
P9:11:33 <Daidoji> the l stands for LIFE
P9:11:33 <Water-Marine> tooo meeeee
P9:11:34 <ZomBuster> notch dont be fooled
P9:11:38 <Water-Marine> mommaaaaaa
P9:11:38 <ZomBuster> you are in the matrix
P9:11:40 <r121> Notch: I read that you plan on releasing the source to the game after some time, but in the meantime, would you consider releasing it to paid players, licensed for personal use? I wouldn't feel comfortable paying for closed-source software, but if I got a copy of the source with it to tinker with, I'd be all for it
P9:11:41 <Water-Marine> just killed  maaaann
P9:11:43 <ZomBuster> that cat is just a program
P9:11:46 <Water-Marine> put a gun against his head
P9:11:50 <Water-Marine> pulled my trigga now he's dead
P9:11:53 <Water-Marine> mommmaaaa
P9:11:53 <Droqen> I just locked my computer :3

P9:15:19 <Notch> "Hey this is a pretty cool game.. But I want to modify it.. Hmm.."
P9:15:23 <r121> No, and I haven't tried decompiling Minecraft yet, but looking at the .jar file contents, you removed all the names, so it will still be a pain to understand

P9:16:59 <Notch> (or do I?)
P9:17:02 <Notch> ((I don't))
P9:17:10 <r121> it's getting to the point that I may just try writing my own simplistic clone... dunno how well that will work out ;)
P9:17:12 <ZomBuster> oh no
P9:17:16 <Notch> go for it!

P9:17:29 <Droqen> here comes the wave of blocky digging clones :3
P9:17:34 <Notch> It's very fun, and I'd be happy to trade ideas
P9:17:35 <Rroff> lol
P9:17:39 <ZomBuster> lol ill make a directx version
P9:17:45 <citricsquid> droq: You can never have too much blocky diggy
P9:17:54 <Droqen> I would totally do it if I had any clue how to program 3d stuff :D
P9:18:04 <ZomBuster> I mean
P9:18:05 <Notch> make a 4d one!
P9:18:09 <Droqen> D:
P9:18:11 <Notch> (hmm..)
P9:18:11 <Droqen> that is awesome though
P9:18:13 <Droqen> xD
P9:18:15 <Droqen> I have to try
P9:18:18 <Daidoji> I'd be happy if survival mode even remoted resembled stranded
P9:18:20 <citricsquid> how about a text based minecraft?! ;D
P9:18:20 <ZomBuster> but 4D is uuh
P9:18:28 <Daidoji> remotely.
P9:18:30 <AlLnAtuRalX> I'm going to make a minecraft clone where you can rape people
P9:18:33 <Notch> "no, no, dig IN! I'm inside you!"
P9:18:41 <Fishlips> god no, not text base
P9:18:43 <liq3> rofl... A 4d one... hrm
P9:18:47 <Droqen> I am of the opinion that to reside in 4d space you would need to see in 3d
P9:18:48 <Daidoji> actually some guy made a digging mod for stranded. but it was hilariously hard work
P9:18:52 <AlLnAtuRalX> "You arrive at a block.
P9:18:54 <AlLnAtuRalX> ">
P9:18:54 <Daidoji> you could dig about 3 times
P9:18:57 <Daidoji> and then you'd have to sleep
P9:18:57 <MisterX> hey, Notch, scratch my earlier remark. As usual, rebooting magically solved the problem, even on huge maps it's all fine again
P9:19:00 <ZomBuster> but the 4th dimension is space

P9:19:11 <Droqen> xD Daidoji that sounds... like it would suck
P9:19:12 <PuyoDead> wouldn't Braid be a 4d game?

P9:19:26 <Droqen> liq3 I know Python and am attempting to not suck and learn C or something xD
P9:19:27 <Notch> it's a 2d platformer with time
P9:19:29 <liq3> PuyoDead: No, it's 2d with time travel.
P9:19:39 <ZomBuster> so its 3D!
P9:19:40 <Daidoji> you can script item making in some plain text files
P9:19:41 <PuyoDead> yea, but... the time aspect is there
P9:19:43 <liq3> Droqen: C++/C and Python are really similar.
P9:19:50 <PuyoDead> doesn't it just kinda skip the 3d part?
P9:19:56 <Notch> I'd stab my leg for a 4d blocky digger game
13P9:20:05 * AlLnAtuRalX gets to work.
P9:20:05 <Notch> well, or.. not stab my leg. That's just stupid.
P9:20:08 <ZomBuster> wait I got it
P9:20:08 <Droqen> liq3: I nod. Also, I realized that somehow playing this game might in the end help my programming attempts which is just weird
P9:20:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> aww :(
13P9:20:11 * AlLnAtuRalX stops working.
P9:20:13 <ZomBuster> I know how it would work
P9:20:21 <AlLnAtuRalX> I managed to open vim.
P9:20:23 <AlLnAtuRalX> lol
P9:20:25 <ZomBuster> it would be the same as minecraft

P9:21:08 <Crusty> Just got banned because some guy saw me move two blocks, then put them back
P9:21:08 <Droqen> liq3; I learned C# because it was really similar to java, and python because it was really similar to C#, and now C/C++ because they're similar to Python?!
P9:21:17 <Daidoji> misterx do you have anti-aliasing on
P9:21:21 <Crusty> he shouted omg crusty grief, and then instant ban without any question

P10:39:25 <FoxBlitzz> But input is a bit laggy
P10:39:32 <FoxBlitzz> I think Notch should try using gl_finish
P10:39:41 <FoxBlitzz> Prime_2: ...Huh?
P10:39:59 <Prime_2> For instance, using this game's fucked up concept of non-existant water-pressure, I created a water elevator
P10:40:11 <Prime_2> that is, a closed off shaft filled with water, that is open at the bottom with a rim
P10:40:16 <Roras> ?

P10:42:35 <Prime_2> sponges tend to dissapear. What this did is that it made it so that if/when the sponge dissapears, the tunnel would be immediatly sealed
P10:42:38 <Prime_2> preventing a flood.
P10:43:20 <Prime_2> I carved out a fortress down there, with artistic designs, multiple floors
P10:43:56 <FoxBlitzz> Man, Minecraft could really use some gl_finish toggling action
P10:44:08 <Prime_2> and a means to go straight up, by filling a shaft with water, and putting a small exit with a rim of blocks around it to prevent that from flooding the room
P10:44:24 <FoxBlitzz> Yeah, I'm not using V-Sync with Minecraft until it's V-Sync friendly
P10:44:31 <Prime_2> the result is that the player can enter the shaft of water from the bottom, by diving into a small entrance pool, and then swim up the shaft

P10:44:46 <Prime_2> no stairs.
P10:45:35 <Prime_2> If I had the file, I could continue to work on it
P10:45:47 <Prime_2> and maybe present it the next time the guys at the srb2.org server decide they want to start over
P10:46:09 <Prime_2> since all the work was underground, everyone else would be free to build their castles and stuff.

P10:47:12 <liq3> ?
P10:47:14 <Prime_2> no
P10:47:21 <liq3> Then what?
P10:47:22 <Prime_2> lilrobot just signed off before giving the file.
P10:47:27 <liq3> oh ok.
P10:47:41 <Prime_2> and though he says it autosaves, he didn't save manually before shutting it down
P10:47:52 <Prime_2> I even asked for the file, well in advance of the shutdown -_-
P10:47:59 <liq3> :(
P10:48:13 <liq3> So, you wanted to keep working on it I take it?
P10:48:15 <Evil-Ville> I saw one of those water shafts too
P10:48:20 <Evil-Ville> It was in some ocean build server
P10:48:34 <Prime_2> heh.
P10:48:39 <Prime_2> It's a world of independant innovation.
P10:48:39 <liq3> Evil-Ville: I don't think he means one of those...
P10:49:10 <Evil-Ville> That's what it sounds like though
P10:49:19 <liq3> Nah I think what he means is.
P10:49:28 <liq3> A shaft (i.e. digging straight down) filled with water.
P10:49:30 <Prime_2> a shaft. you know, a pile of blocks, 3x3 or larger, hollowed out on the inside
P10:49:32 <liq3> And a bottom 2 high stairs.
P10:49:35 <liq3> To stop the water flooding.
P10:49:38 <liq3> at*
P10:49:47 <Prime_2> by entering the pool at the bottom, you can then swim to the top of the shaft.
P10:49:52 <liq3> yep.
P10:49:55 <liq3> I made one of those.
P10:49:56 <Prime_2> stairless vertical transport.
P10:50:03 <liq3> :]
P10:50:12 <liq3> Now they're even easier with sponges.
P10:50:13 <liq3> xD
P10:50:15 <Prime_2> I came up with it myself, along with the fail-safe under-lake entrance
P10:50:32 <liq3> under-lake entrance? O.o
P10:50:32 <Evil-Ville> Well it still does the same thing as blocking the bottom with sponge
P10:50:54 <Prime_2> additionally, at the top of the shaft, I burrowed horizontally for a while, so that it couldn't be accidentally sponged off
P10:51:08 <Prime_2> the fail-safe under-lake entrance is thus
P10:51:18 <Prime_2> I build a room that extends a bit above the lake surface.
P10:51:22 <liq3> wouldn't really matter if it was.
P10:51:25 <Prime_2> there's a door, just a player wide and tall
P10:51:28 <liq3> just dig stairs and delete teh sponge lol.
P10:51:53 <Prime_2> this door is the only way out of the room, which otherwise goes down into the underground
P10:52:07 <Prime_2> the block at the top of the door is a sponge, and here's the genius part
P10:52:14 <Prime_2> I put 3 gravel blocks on top

P10:52:21 <liq3> Yeh.
P10:52:26 <Roras> damn kobolds always stealing my crap
P10:52:26 <Prime_2> so when the sponge dissapears, the room is immediatly sealed off from the water.
P10:52:27 <liq3> Don't need those anymore, sponges are perm now.
P10:52:27 <liq3> xD
P10:52:34 <Prime_2> no, they aren't.
P10:52:38 <liq3> Yes, they are.
P10:52:43 <Prime_2> I was just playing, they still dissapear.
P10:52:48 <Prime_2> and they still glitch up, too.
P10:52:49 <Droqen> Need updated server
P10:52:50 <liq3> You must not have updated then.
P10:52:52 <Roras> wait what
P10:52:53 <liq3> Oh yes.
P10:52:56 <Prime_2> he did update.
P10:52:56 <liq3> The server needs to update
P10:53:02 <liq3> Also...
P10:53:07 <Prime_2> He did update, Liq3
P10:53:14 <Prime_2> or were there multiple updates in the last 2 hours
P10:53:21 <liq3> "Sponges won't vanish randomly now,"
P10:53:21 <Kapow> anyone else's browser locking up when they try to connect to anything?
P10:53:27 <liq3> Part of the title of a dev blog post. :P
P10:53:33 <Prime_2> I don't care what the post said
P10:53:40 <Prime_2> I was there, and they were dissapearing.
P10:53:45 <liq3> Yeh he released a second update like 20 minutes after the sponge/glass one.
P10:53:58 <liq3> To fix sponges and change glass texture.

P10:54:10 <Prime_2> they were still dissapearing.
P10:54:13 <liq3> Hrm.
P10:54:15 <liq3> In that case...
P10:54:26 <Prime_2> I'm kinda happy for that, really
P10:54:32 <Roras> nyah haha
P10:54:35 <Prime_2> they should only be temporary
P10:54:40 <Roras> i ll have them starve to death in the magma chamber
11P10:54:41 <DBN> i'm going to miss sponges http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/1263/watert.png
P10:54:44 <Evil-Ville> In all the servers I've been to the sponge blocks haven't disappeared
P10:54:45 <liq3> Prime: How long you will to bet they stay around for?
P10:54:47 <Evil-Ville> Same for single player
P10:54:52 <Evil-Ville> So obviously the server version was old
P10:55:10 <Prime_2> It seems random, but I saw shit stay there for a long time
P10:55:20 <Prime_2> but there were still dissapearances
P10:55:46 <paul|not> ps
P10:55:47 <paul|not> http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/8844/fuckyes.png
P10:56:01 <Prime_2> how did you manage that
P10:56:02 <Droqen> xD. Awesome.
P10:56:11 <paul|not> Prime_2: talent
P10:56:15 <liq3> Gah.
P10:56:19 <Prime_2> ah
P10:56:21 <Prime_2> I know.
P10:56:21 <paul|not> 32x32
P10:56:28 <Prime_2> you put glass on the floor of the lava
P10:56:30 <paul|not> so much
P10:56:30 <paul|not> glass
P10:56:32 <Prime_2> then burrowed through one
P10:56:37 <Prime_2> and put glass above you before it flooded.
P10:56:40 <paul|not> nope
P10:56:42 <Prime_2> then you made that chamber
P10:56:44 <paul|not> enter + r
P10:56:55 <paul|not> actually I made the chamber first, carved out the top level, replaced the floor with glass
P10:57:03 <paul|not> then made a tube of lava which I then allowed to flood
P10:57:10 <Prime_2> heh.
P10:57:10 <paul|not> could have done water too but lava's much more badass
P10:57:14 <Prime_2> yep.
P10:57:21 <Roras> um
P10:57:21 <Prime_2> I need to do something like that.

P10:57:31 <Roras> so did notch release sponges
P10:57:34 <paul|not> yes
P10:57:36 <Droqen> Yes
P10:57:42 <Roras> how do theyw ork
P10:57:47 <liq3> paul|not: Little tip, make all floors at least 2 above the bottom.
P10:58:00 <Prime_2> preferably 3
P10:58:02 <Prime_2> so you can see names
P10:58:09 <paul|not> huh what
P10:58:10 <Prime_2> hmmm.
P10:58:12 <liq3> 3 won't help with names... -__
P10:58:18 <liq3> basically...
P10:58:19 <Prime_2> it did when I was down.
P10:58:21 <paul|not> oh map bottom
P10:58:24 <liq3> yes.
P10:58:27 <paul|not> works fine for me
P10:58:30 <Prime_2> anyways
P10:58:33 <Prime_2> here's an idea.
P10:58:35 <liq3> yeh...
P10:58:36 <paul|not> just makes construction more of a challenge
P10:58:41 <liq3> still a good idea to be 2 above tho.
P10:59:01 <Droqen> High ceilings are great
P10:59:01 <liq3> It looks nicer, and you can dig down if you must.
P10:59:01 <liq3> xD
P10:59:04 <Prime_2> I have a cool idea here.
P10:59:12 <liq3> I usually dig 3 high ceilings unless it's a tunnel.
P10:59:12 <Droqen> ?
P10:59:14 <Prime_2> if there really are permasponges now
P10:59:17 <Droqen> nod to liq3
P10:59:26 <Prime_2> since they block water at a 3x3
P10:59:31 <liq3> 5x5x5
P10:59:32 <Droqen> 5x5x5
P10:59:37 <Prime_2> oh
P10:59:39 <liq3> hahan ninja'd :p
P10:59:39 <Prime_2> I was thinking radius.
P10:59:47 <liq3> yeh.
P11:00:02 <Prime_2> well, since the water blockage goes 2 blocks out from a sponge
P11:00:18 <liq3> yes?
P11:00:29 <Prime_2> I say, make a crevace under the lake, 3 squares deep, 2 squares wide
P11:00:32 <Prime_2> a walkway, if you will
P11:00:42 <paul|not> sponges aren't perma
12P11:00:47 * Evil-Ville (hurfdurf@cs78249077.pp.htv.fi) Quit (Quit: yare yare daze)
P11:00:49 <paul|not> and you can do that without them anyways
P11:00:54 <Prime_2> and embedded into the walls, covered up by stone will be some sponges
P11:01:01 <Prime_2> on both sides
P11:01:07 <paul|not> or under the floor
P11:01:10 <paul|not> no walls/roof at all!
P11:01:18 <Prime_2> I tried that.
P11:01:24 <Maulrus> experiments with sponge + glass = good
P11:01:24 <Prime_2> only one block of water blockage.
P11:01:26 <Maulrus> so far
P11:01:46 <Prime_2> that's why you have to have them on either side of the walls, if you're going to cover them up
P11:02:19 <Prime_2> since the sponge on each side will drain 1 block of water outward, you need one on the other side to completely drain the horizontal space
P11:02:27 <Prime_2> and that's why it's 2 squares wide
P11:02:37 <Prime_2> that's the maximum of what can be drained when the sponges are hidden
P11:02:49 <Prime_2> anyways, so this would be under the lake
P11:03:02 <Prime_2> an inexplicably dry passage under water, with nothing above it
P11:03:17 <liq3> Prime: Already done.
P11:03:31 <Prime_2> 3 deep, 2 wide?
P11:03:36 <Prime_2> sponges not visable?
P11:03:41 <liq3> Ok, not that. ;P
P11:03:45 <liq3> Sponges were visable.
P11:03:54 <Prime_2> and that's what makes my vision superior.
P11:04:08 <liq3> Prime: Want me to help you work on it? XD
P11:04:15 <Prime_2> sure.
P11:04:18 <liq3> What server?
P11:04:27 <Droqen> Needs to be updated
P11:04:31 <Prime_2> umm
P11:04:33 <Prime_2> do you have one?
P11:04:34 <Prime_2> lol.
P11:04:39 <liq3> Yes, but it's down most of the time.
P11:05:51 <liq3> lol maybe I should buy a server...
P11:05:52 <Prime_2> how about...
P11:05:55 <Prime_2> minecraft.srb2.org
P11:05:56 <liq3> I wonder how much they cost...
P11:06:05 <Prime_2> 'tis a real server.
P11:06:22 <liq3> sure.
P11:06:32 <liq3> although it's rather dug out.
