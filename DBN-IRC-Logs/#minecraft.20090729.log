A12:00:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> watervator: static water blocks that don't move
A12:00:14 <spadge> rofl
A12:00:17 <spadge> that wont ever happen
A12:00:17 <Kirbycode> lol
A12:00:20 <Kirbycode> no no not that.
A12:00:31 <Kirbycode> But I did use a temporary watervator when cleaning out the mines.
A12:00:34 <AnnihilatorBeta> you're sayin' that cause you're jealous
A12:00:35 <AnnihilatorBeta> heheHEHE
A12:00:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> well
A12:00:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm tired
A12:00:55 <Kirbycode> Basically, as you know, water works like this:
A12:00:55 <spadge> no, i know JTE made a cool water, but it does defy all logic...
A12:01:05 <Eagle> How so?
A12:01:10 <Kirbycode> how?
A12:01:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> how what
A12:01:18 <kryptn> Watervator!
A12:01:19 <mail2345> water is server sided
A12:01:20 <AnnihilatorBeta> jte coded his own server
A12:01:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> or not his, her
A12:01:30 <kryptn> Very finite. Like, single blocks
A12:01:40 <AnnihilatorBeta> well whatever
A12:01:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm heading to bed
A12:01:47 <AnnihilatorBeta> and you should too

A12:02:11 <spadge> :P
A12:02:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> night
A12:02:13 <Kirbycode> hey, i wanna run by an infinite water suggestion by you guys before I write a suggestion.
A12:02:14 <Kirbycode> night :D
A12:02:21 <Kirbycode> *on the forums

A12:03:35 <Kirbycode> so yeah do you guys mind if I do that?
A12:03:41 <kryptn> Go for it
A12:03:44 <spadge> just do it
A12:03:44 <spadge> :P
A12:03:47 <Kirbycode> :P
A12:03:50 <Darkebrz> http://www.dynamicdiscord.com/BrianStuff/Episode_3/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html
A12:03:50 <Eagle> Go now.
A12:03:53 <Eagle> NOW.
A12:03:54 <Darkebrz> The Backstroke of the West
A12:03:54 <Kirbycode> Okay, so currently water works like this:
A12:03:55 <spadge> who cares what we think :D
A12:04:03 <Kirbycode> It'll expand horizontally then vertically if there's empty space.
A12:04:09 <Kirbycode> So you get this weird water-filling.
A12:04:54 <Kirbycode> Instead, make it that there's two types of water blocks: "horiztonal" and "vertical".
A12:05:12 <Kirbycode> They look exactly the same, except all water blocks start off as "vertical".
A12:05:34 <spadge> ...
A12:05:37 <Kirbycode> These blocks always head downwards until the block below them is a non-water block or if it's a "horizontal" block.
A12:06:08 <Kirbycode> When they hit the ground, they become a "horizontal" water block, spawning vertical water blocks to, you guessed it, the sides of them.
A12:06:49 <Kirbycode> This accomplishes two things:
A12:06:54 <kryptn> So.. Basically.. a block is horozontal until it can become vertical, then vertical until it can't be vertical anymore, then goes back to horozontal..
A12:07:03 <Kirbycode> no no.
A12:07:10 <Darkebrz> Best read ever: http://www.dynamicdiscord.com/BrianStuff/Episode_3/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html
A12:07:11 <Kirbycode> Let's start with the water source at the edge of the map.
A12:07:13 <kryptn> lol.
A12:07:29 <Kirbycode> So you dig out a ditch for the water to flow through.  1 square deep.
A12:07:33 <kryptn> k
A12:07:42 <Kirbycode> The source will spawn a "vertical" water block.
A12:07:59 <Kirbycode> The block will then realize "hey I'm on ground" and turn into a "horizontal" water block.
A12:08:25 <Kirbycode> It can then spawn vertical blocks to the sides of it and below it, if possible.
A12:08:43 <Kirbycode> which, in turn, can be promoted to horiziontal or regular water blocks.
A12:08:54 <spadge> wow
A12:08:56 <spadge> floods would lag
A12:08:57 <kryptn> Kirbycode, i see that as exactly what i just said
A12:08:57 <spadge> :D
A12:09:12 <Kirbycode> Really?
A12:09:13 <Kirbycode> huh.
A12:09:15 <kryptn> Yea..
A12:09:22 <spadge> imagine a large space being flooded
A12:09:25 <spadge> every time it moves
A12:09:29 <Kirbycode> I see it as saying "the water source spawns a horizontal water block, and then it gets promoted to vertical"
A12:09:31 <spadge> it has to calculate all of that
A12:09:37 <Kirbycode> Each block calculates it.
A12:09:39 <mail2345> seriosly translated back from chinese
A12:09:54 <mail2345> I find better stuff at the bottom of torrent listings
A12:10:02 <Kirbycode> Each block has to calculate filling space already though, doesn't it?
A12:10:12 <kryptn> spadge, it's just another if statement, not that bad
A12:10:32 <spadge> but people already complain about the lag of floods :P
A12:10:47 <Kirbycode> lol, you realize that this thing accomplishes 3 things.
A12:10:50 <Kirbycode> *this idea
A12:11:08 <kryptn> Would reduce massive floods.
A12:11:24 <Kirbycode> That's one.  It doesn't travel as far per tick compared to normal.
A12:11:36 <Kirbycode> because every tick a good deal of the blocks are being promoted.
A12:11:56 <Kirbycode> Second, it looks a bit more realistic, filling from bottom to top.
A12:12:14 <Kirbycode> And third, my favorite part.
A12:12:27 <Kirbycode> Notice that vertical blocks cannot spawn other blocks to the side of it.
A12:12:45 <Kirbycode> Meaning, if you sponge your cave floor, the water can't travel on it.
A12:12:54 <Kirbycode> *place sponges underneath your cave floor
A12:13:22 <kryptn> That last part is nice.
A12:13:26 <kryptn> Yea, go ahead and suggest it
10A12:13:40 * Super-Dot (Super-Dot@adsl-76-202-76-180.dsl.pltn13.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:13:46 <Kirbycode> Got any ideas on making it cleaner? (aka easier to understand?)
A12:14:05 <Kirbycode> I'm thinking replace "horizontal" block with regular water block, cuz that's basically what it is.
A12:14:29 <spadge> lost lost lost
A12:14:37 <Kirbycode> lol, you're lost?
A12:14:48 <spadge> i lost my marbles
A12:14:59 <spadge> :P
A12:15:02 <Kirbycode> :P
A12:15:08 <Kirbycode> So what don't you understand?
A12:15:23 <spadge> nah its an interesting idea
A12:15:38 <spadge> but i think you should just wait for finite water to come in, which will do exactly that
A12:15:58 <Kirbycode> What exactly is finite water?
A12:16:14 <spadge> water doesnt duplicate itself
A12:16:42 <Kirbycode> Okay, I pour all the water down onto the bottom floor.  Now what?
A12:17:01 <spadge> :P
A12:17:10 <spadge> im sure there will be something cool
A12:17:13 <Kirbycode> Yeah, finite water just gives another way to grief. D:
A12:17:20 <spadge> i hope for rain + persipitation
A12:17:24 <spadge> night and day
A12:17:29 <spadge> things like that

A12:17:59 <Kirbycode> I'm hoping to give admins the ability to ban people from destroying dirt.
A12:18:45 <Kirbycode> No more will I suffer going through uninspired tunnels to get at a dead end.
A12:19:52 <Eagle> spadge, I read that as rain and persperation
A12:20:16 <Eagle> And then I thought of people flooding a place with sweating
A12:20:21 <spadge> lol
A12:20:37 <spadge> nah it would be cool if rain came along which left a layer of water :D
A12:20:42 <Eagle> Like everybody runs around a bit and then they all gather in some guys house and floods it
A12:20:43 <spadge> then during the day it evaporated
A12:20:45 <Darkebrz> http://img354.imageshack.us/img354/7290/buldozerlf6.jpg
A12:20:46 <Darkebrz> Wow
A12:20:54 <Darkebrz> Construction workers are badass
A12:21:14 <spadge> lol
A12:21:18 <Eagle> How is he going to get down?
A12:21:18 <spadge> nice
A12:21:22 <Kirbycode> It's like a squirrel
A12:21:23 <spadge> same way
A12:21:28 <Darkebrz> By turning into a transformer
A12:21:29 <Darkebrz> Doh
A12:21:36 <Eagle> With him inside?
A12:21:37 <Eagle> D:
A12:21:40 <Eagle> That would crush him!
A12:21:56 <spadge> nah
A12:21:59 <spadge> didnt you watch the movie/
A12:22:10 <spadge> they can transform with you in it and you end up on their shoulder :D
A12:22:13 <Eagle> XD
A12:22:14 <Darkebrz> http://www.dynamicdiscord.com/BrianStuff/Episode_3/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html
A12:22:21 <Darkebrz> But that is the best thing Ive ever seen
A12:22:22 <spadge> stop spamming that
A12:22:27 <Darkebrz> NO I WONT
A12:22:33 <Darkebrz> Its so good
A12:22:40 <Darkebrz> And it requires 2 more posts of the link
A12:22:42 <Eagle> That is very very old.

A3:33:23 <JTE> heh.
A3:34:06 <mail2345> I wish /away was more obious.
A3:34:37 <mail2345> So I could passivly see who's afk. anyway, how would a mirror block work?
A3:35:55 <Parthon> it would .. reflect .. light ...
A3:36:00 <Super-Dot> It would do nothing
13A3:36:04 * Parthon looks at mail strangely
A3:36:12 <Super-Dot> Since in JTE's version, everyone's a VAMPIRE
A3:36:35 <Super-Dot> :3
A3:36:47 <mail2345> I don't think I understand what JTE means by mirror.
A3:38:28 <JTE> Heh
A3:39:11 <JTE> :3 It is what it sounds like. It would be a mirror on all sides, instead of a textured block.
A3:39:30 <JTE> Maybe have a glass texture over it so you know where the mirror ends and the world begins.
A3:40:38 <mail2345> but wouldn't that have to be from the client
13A3:40:55 * mail2345 is getting confused.
A3:41:07 <JTE> Technically I could add it to my server by sending replica blocks to the client and stuff, buuut that would just be silly. :3
A3:41:36 <Super-Dot> Haha, that would be awesome
A3:42:04 <JTE> Instead I'm probably just gonna add it to my own client, mew...

A3:43:49 <Super-Dot> That might make for a fun server
A3:44:10 <Super-Dot> One where people can only build on one side of the map, and everything on the other side is mirrored
A3:44:35 <mail2345> I expect some upset fourm admins :P
A3:44:36 <JTE> heh, I was thinking top and bottom, actually. :P
A3:44:40 <Super-Dot> With artificial players to boot
A3:44:48 <mail2345> fake players
A3:44:49 <mail2345> hmm
A3:44:57 <mail2345> that might actaully be an interesting anti-grief
A3:44:58 <JTE> Heh, yeah, fake players would work well for that,
A3:45:00 <JTE> if I do it that way
A3:45:23 <Parthon> jte: what's your server in?
A3:45:37 <Super-Dot> Top-to-bottom would have upside down players, but that's okay
A3:45:49 <JTE> my server is in Perl, but I'm going to write a new one in C ... eventually.
A3:46:05 <JTE> Super-Dot: I wasn't planning on including players at all, actually. o.o
A3:46:12 <JTE> since EVERYONE IS VAMPIRES.
A3:46:16 <Super-Dot> Haha
A3:46:19 <Parthon> coo
A3:46:22 <Parthon> cool*
A3:46:45 <JTE> I was just thinking maybe if you make a castle, below you is an upside-down version of it
A3:47:00 <mail2345> jte, what would happen if you set heartbeat to 0 and public to 1?
A3:47:04 <JTE> and I could even make it actually build one block closer than it needs to, so the glass seems paper-thin
A3:47:04 <Super-Dot> Oh, so the floor's in the middle
A3:47:14 <Super-Dot> I assumed the floors would be on the top and bottom
A3:47:39 <JTE> mail2345: On my server? Public and verify are only used by heartbeat, so if heartbeat is 0, they become null and void.
A3:47:40 <Super-Dot> Middle floor makes much more sense
A3:49:44 <JTE> and of course, the sides and bottom inside can be coated with blue cloth blocks so it tries to pretends to be sky. ... without clouds.

A10:44:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> have you heard about that rogue op that was on flatgrass 2 last night?
A10:44:49 <citricsquid> nope :( 
A10:44:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> well
A10:45:00 <citricsquid> I might just give up running pub servers, so much hassle >:(
A10:45:12 <peerkoel> it's true
A10:46:04 <peerkoel> I was thinking of getting a new VPS for a server earlier today
A10:46:05 <citricsquid> backing up my stuff is such a hassle also, taken 4 hours and I'm not done yet :'
A10:46:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> don't you give up!
A10:46:08 <peerkoel> what was I thinking????
A10:46:22 <citricsquid> I spend $100 on my dedi for minecraft servers, haha.
A10:46:29 <peerkoel> wow
A10:46:54 <AnnihilatorBeta> we can help you manage them :d
A10:46:58 <gear|work> is.. that monthly?
A10:47:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> monthly? that's ridiculous
A10:47:18 <citricsquid> $100 for my minecraft dedi monthly, $90 for my websites one =o
A10:47:39 <gear|work> :|
A10:47:42 <gear|work> you sir
A10:47:44 <gear|work> are a saint
A10:47:44 <AnnihilatorBeta> $190 in totall, then
A10:48:00 <gear|work> the patron saint of minecraft
A10:48:02 <peerkoel> better keep making them websaits
A10:48:11 <AnnihilatorBeta> websaints
A10:48:19 <citricsquid> not that much, instead of being normal and going out instead I spend my money on servers.
A10:48:30 <citricsquid> ...instead, instead >:( instead.
A10:48:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> instead
A10:48:55 <peerkoel> hm, well if you spend a lot of time in blocky worlds you won't go out
A10:48:59 <peerkoel> it all makes sense
A10:49:38 <peerkoel> or you can blame dragons
A10:50:30 <citricsquid> just got to backup my ~600 bookmarks then I can format.
A10:51:30 <peerkoel> shouldn't be too much data?
A10:51:38 <citricsquid> time for some formatting fun, good night my princes.

P12:59:18 <fydo> I've found that Windows 7 is a bit better for me than XP
P12:59:24 <mail2345> eh, depends on the situation(primarily the amount of ram in the pc)
P12:59:33 <Snowman> idc, got 4 gigs ram anyway
P12:59:41 <citricsquid> if your pc doesn't suck dick, vista ftw.

P1:03:40 <gear|work> i was thinking the same thing
P1:03:47 <gear|work> id prefer not to dual boot
P1:03:51 <Dave___> well.. you could buy it now and get the 7 upgrade free

P1:03:58 <gear|work> buy? pfft

P1:12:48 <Dave___> wtf why are you doing that?
P1:12:49 <Dave___> lol
13P1:13:08 * peerkoel uses adblock

P1:13:35 <citricsquid> peerkoel: I don't like you anymore.
P1:13:35 <Dave___> ...confused
P1:13:45 <peerkoel> if you're a litterer, same
P1:14:00 <gear|work> what format does minecraft store map data?
P1:14:08 <mail2345> gzipped something
P1:14:09 <Dave___> the your mom format :D
P1:14:09 <peerkoel> that's on the wiki
P1:14:11 <gear|work> ive yet to play with it
P1:14:13 <citricsquid> I'm not and I hate adverts all the same, but there are thousands of websites that need them to survive and by blocking them you're destroying the websites. Quite literally.
P1:14:26 <gear|work> what is it, a byte per block?
P1:14:32 <Dave___> yeah
P1:14:37 <peerkoel> in all the millions of sites, I don't care if few of them go
P1:14:49 <Dave___> i found that maps started at a different byte position than the wiki said...
P1:14:51 <mail2345> I disable adblock on my regular small sites.
P1:14:57 <gear|work> same
P1:15:13 <citricsquid> peerkoel: then you're a shitty internet person :(
P1:15:26 <peerkoel> I'm partially a webdev
P1:15:39 <Parthon> peerkoel: but what if one of the great sites die? like minecraft?
P1:15:50 <peerkoel> that happens only when Notch goes

P1:16:01 <gear|work> thankfully minecraft has an alternative source of monetary income
P1:16:03 <peerkoel> and Notch goes when people stop buying the game
P1:16:06 <peerkoel> so go buy
P1:16:19 <Parthon> I bought the game before you could buy the game :P
P1:16:26 <peerkoel> I don't think a website should generate income to support itself per se
P1:16:29 <citricsquid> I can understand with and I agree blocking intrusive adverts, but blocking others is unacceptable. I would personally block everyone that does it from all of my websites if it was possible.
P1:16:43 <Parthon> peerkoel: errr .. really?
P1:16:47 <mail2345> whyfirefoxshouldbebanned.com
P1:16:49 <mail2345> or something
P1:16:50 <peerkoel> but most people seem to think that if it's a website, it should have ads to be self supporting

P1:17:24 <peerkoel> I know you do fydo
P1:17:27 <peerkoel> you're a pal
P1:17:38 <Dave___> i hope to one day run a site for adrevenue so i let the other people who do it have the 1 cent :p
P1:17:49 <fydo> well, not because you're a friend, but because I agree on your stance on ad-blocking
P1:17:54 <fydo> :)
P1:17:57 <gear|work> zing.
P1:17:57 <peerkoel> ahw :(
P1:18:07 <fydo> you are still a pal though
P1:18:08 <citricsquid> So you're saying that it's k to steal from websites because you dislike a few lines of text?
P1:18:08 <gear|work> hmmm
P1:18:09 <Parthon> lol
P1:18:10 <peerkoel> well at least you're not biased then
P1:18:11 <citricsquid> yeah, totally fair.
P1:18:16 <fydo> citricsquid: who's stealing?
P1:18:27 <citricsquid> You disable adverts you block their revenue stream.
P1:18:29 <Dave___> wait... i just realized a funny hole in my morals
P1:18:30 <peerkoel> I don't follow citricsquid 
P1:18:32 <citricsquid> Therefore you take their content.
P1:18:35 <gear|work> how much will windows 7 cost?
P1:18:36 <citricsquid> and you don't give back.
P1:18:39 <citricsquid> ergo, stealing.
P1:18:44 <citricsquid> legally it isn't, but morally it is.
P1:18:46 <citricsquid> and it's undeniable.
P1:18:49 <Dave___> i have no problem with stealing programs, but i don't like adblocking
P1:18:51 <Dave___> lmaooo
P1:18:51 <peerkoel> those few lines of text are most often attention stealing flickering images
P1:18:59 <fydo> citricsquid: so, when I download content from the website, then after I'm done, the content is gone?
P1:19:03 <peerkoel> but how would I know that, I'm blocking them
P1:19:04 <mail2345> bandwith
P1:19:08 <mail2345> lmitiations
P1:19:09 <fydo> because that's what stealing is
P1:19:12 <JTE> o.o
P1:19:24 <citricsquid> fydo: Stop trying to claim I'm talking literally. I'm not.
P1:19:25 <peerkoel> you're assuming it's my obligation to view ads citricsquid 
P1:19:27 <peerkoel> it's not
P1:19:30 <citricsquid> yes it is
P1:19:34 <citricsquid> they provide you a service FOR FREE.
P1:19:36 <peerkoel> that's foolish
P1:19:40 <citricsquid> you should be giving back to then.
P1:19:41 <citricsquid> them*
P1:19:42 <peerkoel> and they shouldn't
P1:19:45 <fydo> citricsquid: you should learn about the words you are using
P1:19:54 <Snowman> ads are still annoying though
P1:20:08 <citricsquid> of course they're annoying.
P1:20:13 <Snowman> :D
P1:20:18 <fydo> anyways, if they are publishing information on the web, there's no way anyone can steal it
P1:20:22 <Parthon> it's only stealing in the fact that they are providing content on the proviso that you are going to look at the ads, and through that they will get revenue .. if you are adblocking then you are denying revenue, therefore costing the person money

P1:20:39 <gear|work> why is windows so damn expensive
P1:20:45 <mail2345> monopoly
P1:20:46 <Parthon> whether that's stealing or not depends on who you ask :P
P1:20:50 <mail2345> near monopoly
P1:20:51 <citricsquid> Parthon: Exactly. Not "stealing" but it is stealing in the sense that you take without giving.
P1:20:59 <citricsquid> I didn't mean stealing literally.
P1:21:14 <peerkoel> I can see a same type of logic here as in a boxing fighter or something like that, caught cheating with steroids or something, got disqualified, and the management claimed he shouldn't be punished because not winning was punishment enough
P1:21:17 <gear|work> they'd probably sell so many copies if they dropped prices
P1:21:25 <peerkoel> as if the fighter was entitled to victory
P1:21:28 <gear|work> to us lesser folk

P1:21:43 <mail2345> wiill not be getting off m icrsofot\
P1:21:46 <mail2345> anytime soon
P1:21:49 <Parthon> but that's not even the issue, it comes down to pure economics
P1:22:11 <Parthon> if someone has a website that you visit, and they can't afford to provide it, the website will shut down
P1:22:25 <Parthon> and the difference between affording or not, could be as little as adblocking
P1:22:25 <mail2345> keep the price high, and people like DoD lets go use an OS meant for PERSONAL use, for MILITARY SECURITY. Yea, that will work.
P1:22:29 <citricsquid> If I say to you "here is some content, in return you view my adverts" and you say "I'm taking your content and I'm not viewing your adverts!". That to me is low and "stealing".
P1:22:38 <mail2345> I'm sure the DoD has enough recorses to make their own OS.

P1:22:56 <citricsquid> hoow can you justify that?
P1:23:01 <Parthon> but, adblocking comes under the same category as piracy :P
P1:23:04 <fydo> citricsquid: I've never heard a website say to me "here is some content, in return you view my adverts"
P1:23:18 <citricsquid> fydo: So they put adverts there because they can?
P1:23:25 <peerkoel> if that were the deal I would be stealing, but there is no deal
P1:23:25 <fydo> there's no contract or obligation implied
P1:23:31 <citricsquid> Parthon: Nobody can justify privacy either.
P1:23:36 <mail2345> piraccy*
P1:23:37 <gear|work> its still retarded because businesses buy volume licenses
P1:23:45 <mail2345> eh.
P1:23:46 <gear|work> and computers come with OEM versions
P1:23:47 <Parthon> fydo: it's an implied social contract .. but not written
P1:23:50 <citricsquid> fydo: So you think it's right to block adverts and block a websites revenue stream?
P1:23:55 <citricsquid> legallity is irrelevant.
P1:24:03 <peerkoel> also, when I load a webpage I'm asking for it's content, not for ads
P1:24:05 <gear|work> retails windows is only about 5% of windows sold
P1:24:19 <Parthon> peerkoel: yeah, but the creator of the website says "with content, please view my ads"
P1:24:22 <peerkoel> so the ads forced down my intertube is not my request
P1:24:37 <Parthon> it's the request of the person who created the site
P1:24:42 <fydo> citricsquid: if a website really cared if their ads were being viewed or not, they can see if it's being loaded along with the page
P1:24:43 <Dave___> boring topic is boring
P1:24:48 <peerkoel> request denied
P1:24:52 <Parthon> lol
P1:24:53 <citricsquid> fydo: That's not possible.
P1:24:55 <fydo> and in that case, sure, block me from your content
P1:24:59 <peerkoel> they have every right of denying my request
P1:25:03 <Parthon> for sure
P1:25:04 <fydo> citricsquid: yes, it is
P1:25:10 <JTE> I think it's right to block adverts and block a website's revenue stream in the case of ebaum's world.
P1:25:12 <JTE> :3
P1:25:16 <mail2345> :P
P1:25:17 <JTE> Very right.
P1:25:18 <Parthon> and it's possible, but only if you don't go through current advertising channels :P
P1:25:18 <citricsquid> JTE haha
P1:25:37 <Dave___> adblocking is technically not piracy because the information given to the user is not a service(because the user doesn't pay for it directly)
P1:25:52 <citricsquid> whether or not it's piracy isn't relevant
P1:25:57 <citricsquid> is*
P1:26:00 <Dave___> bla bla bla
P1:26:02 <Parthon> but, when you strip it down, you either support websites through ads, or you don't, and the mentality that says that you are entitled to everything for free is just another nail in the coffin of this society
P1:26:18 <mail2345> everything has some sort of cost
P1:26:24 <peerkoel> You're also forgetting citricsquid, that I'm Dutch. And general rules of "what is right" does not apply to us.
P1:26:30 <citricsquid> By blocking adverts you're saying "I want your content and I don't want to help you out, because I'm a massive twat". How can you dispute that?
P1:26:53 <Parthon> heh, I didn't know right and wrong was based on nationality :P
P1:26:57 <peerkoel> you're saying I'm a twat, I'm not.
P1:26:59 <fydo> citricsquid: I don't think twats are involved at all
P1:27:06 <fydo> citricsquid: well, depending on the website, I guess
P1:27:06 <Dave___> lool
P1:27:09 <peerkoel> it's implied in culture, Parthon 
P1:27:15 <citricsquid> yes you are, you refuse to support a website because the adverts annoy you slightly. Yeah, that's justified.

P1:27:41 <JTE> X3
P1:27:42 <citricsquid> That's like trying to justify piracy. It's okay to steal because they're a big rich company!
P1:27:47 <peerkoel> it's an isseu to us, Dave___ 
P1:28:01 <Dave___> its not like people are going change their views and start or stop adblocking
P1:28:08 <gear|work> i like how windows disguises Genuine advantage
P1:28:15 <peerkoel> in our country it is legally ok to download any music and video you can lay your hands on over the internet
P1:28:15 <mail2345> so, uhh, what does this have to do with minecraft?
P1:28:19 <citricsquid> It's the only thing that makes me properly rage, besides my adsl being shit is people blocking adverts. It's the most infuriating thing ever.
P1:28:20 <JTE> It's okay to steal, because they want $600 for a fucking buggy old 3D modeling program big rich companies pay for en masse anyway. @.@;
P1:28:24 <AnnihilatorBeta> everything
P1:28:28 <peerkoel> because we cannot verify the source has rights to publish it

P1:38:14 <Parthon> in the same way that software creators ask for money to gain revenue, and piracy allows you to skip the creators wishes
P1:38:19 <peerkoel> I don't think it's wrong to load the content and not the ads
P1:38:19 <citricsquid> fydo: by putting up adverts they are doing that.
13P1:38:19 * Dave___ agrees with mail2345
P1:38:21 <peerkoel> that's right
P1:38:26 <citricsquid> they don't put them there for anything else, do they?

P1:39:07 <Parthon> and yeah, sites should put disclaimers on their pages .. wasting more bandwidth :P
P1:39:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> you were probably in a nk server

P1:39:20 <fydo> Parthon: I agree
P1:39:26 <Parthon> and adblockers would still ignore the disclaimer, and would still block the ad
13P1:39:33 * Dave___ thinks people are just spouting their views and are not going to come to a conclusion like debates normally do
P1:39:34 <fydo> enough of this implied stuff

P1:39:57 <AlexVMiner> bye
P1:39:57 <Parthon> lol
P1:40:07 <fydo> If it's a respectable site, and the content creator wished for all their viewers to see the ads, I would certainly comply
P1:40:16 <AlexVMiner> Anyone want to recommend a site?
P1:40:20 <AlexVMiner> i mean server
P1:40:21 <AlexVMiner> lol
P1:40:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> i dunno
P1:40:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> any recommendations?
P1:40:51 <Parthon> but adblocking is just a symptom of the ad problem on the internet anyways :P
P1:40:54 <AlexVMiner> i went to free minecraft server
P1:41:00 <citricsquid> fydo: So what are they doing when they put the adverts up?
P1:41:07 <citricsquid> by putting adverts up they're requesting you view them.
P1:41:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> collecting revenue
P1:41:09 <Parthon> being annoying ;)

P2:21:29 <PuyoDead> 'sok
P2:21:29 <AlexVMiner> then the irc formed again
P2:21:31 <gear|butts> irc started the big bang
P2:21:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Obviously IRC.
P2:21:35 <gear|butts>  /bigbang
P2:21:45 <gear|butts> or maybe it was a net split
P2:21:54 <AlexVMiner> um, /bigbang did nothing

P4:52:44 <crazyboy11> he was the first I IPbanned
P4:52:49 <Quatroking> Was it team Rocket

P4:53:18 <Rommel> electricsheep, crazyboy11, besides myself, Rikku is the only one who was in there with a name starting with R, besides myself
P4:53:34 <Rommel> Wait
P4:53:36 <Rommel> There was Rapture too
P4:53:38 <Rommel> http://i25.tinypic.com/541e8.jpg
P4:53:57 <electricsheep> might be Rapture
P4:53:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> so
P4:54:05 <Rommel> Rikku only came in after alot of bans
P4:54:05 <Quatroking> Hmm
P4:54:08 <Rommel> So I'm thinking it was Rapture then.
P4:54:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> ban him too
P4:54:15 <crazyboy11> rapture got kicked
P4:54:16 <Quatroking> Hey citricsquid

P4:54:19 <Quatroking> I have the best idea ever
P4:54:21 <electricsheep> btw, my IP address is 96.21.112.229 (for unban)
P4:54:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> rikku's a griefer?

P4:54:29 <AnnihilatorBeta> i should've known
P4:54:37 <crazyboy11> did you get banned AB?
P4:54:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> i never went on in the first place
P4:54:51 <Rommel> If you guys see Keoups, he's a griefer too

P4:57:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> so we need a new hideout
P4:58:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> hmm
P4:58:03 <electricsheep> yeah
P4:58:08 <electricsheep> citric servers were the best
P4:58:22 <peerkoel> are they down now?
P4:58:29 <electricsheep> i dont think so
P4:58:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> if they aren't now, in a day or so they will
P4:58:53 <crazyboy11> is there any chance someone else could take over running them?
P4:59:13 <electricsheep> crazyboy11: why not just make another 24/7 server?
P4:59:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> citric pays $100 per month for those servers apparently
P4:59:28 <peerkoel> so it seems that public servers are just not possible to maintain
P4:59:30 <electricsheep> anyway, for that, you'd need a seedbox with lots of monthly bandwidth
P4:59:52 <electricsheep> which would cost $$$, lots of it
P4:59:52 <peerkoel> maybe citricsquid should build some blocky ads
P4:59:58 <electricsheep> ahahah
P4:59:59 <crazyboy11> lol
P5:00:02 <AnnihilatorBeta> they are possible to maintain to a certain extent, if you have ops on at all times
P5:00:03 <electricsheep> griefed ads
P5:00:17 <peerkoel> but alas, he hates adblock
P5:00:19 <Rommel> AnnihilatorBeta: minecraft.brbfap.in ?
P5:00:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> what
P5:00:35 <Rommel> New hideout, idk
P5:00:39 <peerkoel> sorry citricsquid, couldn't let that one go to waste
P5:00:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> w
P5:00:59 <AnnihilatorBeta> well anyways
P5:01:03 <citricsquidoo> I pay $100/m to run the dedicated that runs my minecraft servers, yes. I would keep running them, but nobody can be trusted so I'll hold off until we have better op levels and stuff :)
P5:01:17 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm glad to hear that
P5:01:27 <AnnihilatorBeta> maybe lua will solve our problems after all

P5:42:47 <mail2345> err, ask JTE
P5:42:52 <stupinator> k, thanks
P5:43:22 <ZomBuster> you don't have to learn perl
P5:43:28 <ZomBuster> it can be in any language
P5:43:36 <Super-Dot> Notch wrote the server in Java, and JTE rewrote pretty much the entire thing in perl
P5:43:39 <mail2345> that has networking
P5:43:46 <Dave__> hai im back
P5:44:05 <Super-Dot> But I think you do need to write an entire server to do it
P5:44:18 <mail2345> hmm. I wonder if there is a networkable version of brain fuck.
P5:44:25 <Dave__> god dont send all the noobs to ask jte stuff
P5:44:40 <Dave__> thats mean
P5:44:55 <stupinator> lol
P5:45:03 <stupinator> if he doesn't want to help that's fine
P5:45:08 <Super-Dot> <God> Sorry
P5:45:17 <Dave__> oh lmap
P5:45:40 <Dave__> jte isn't going to help you write a server
P5:45:58 <stupinator> not really writing a full server, just editing in a command

P5:46:15 <Super-Dot> You'll need to learn Jasmin then
P5:46:17 <Dave__> i doubt you could do that
P5:46:20 <mail2345> go try editing some memory
P5:46:41 <Super-Dot> So that you can decompile Notch's server and modify it
P5:46:55 <Dave__> jasmin?
P5:46:58 <stupinator> well I decompiled the original server.jar
P5:47:11 <stupinator> but all I get are a bunch of .class files, which I have no idea how to read
P5:47:12 <Super-Dot> It's the most popular assembly language for the JVM
P5:47:49 <PuyoDead> well the hell did alex go, that jerk
P5:47:55 <Quatroking> How big are the chances that Ez got family in the Biotech industry?
P5:48:05 <Super-Dot> Java AsSeMblY laNguage
P5:48:17 <Dave__> or you could use the dj java decompiler
P5:48:24 <Dave__> and get all the code back
P5:48:42 <Dave__> then you could maybe go to *cough*com\mojang\minecraft\server\d.jad*cough*
P5:48:47 <Snowman> How do I import .mdl into the real world?
P5:48:53 <Snowman> :D
P5:48:53 <Dave__> mdl?
P5:48:58 <Dave__> wtf is mdl
P5:49:02 <Snowman> model file
P5:49:08 <stupinator> ...
P5:49:12 <Dave__> and realworld meaning what?
P5:49:13 <stupinator> go into the future
P5:49:18 <stupinator> or get a 3d printer
P5:49:26 <Dave__> 3d printers ftw
P5:49:34 <stupinator> there's a site that will print off your .mdl files (at a price)
P5:49:35 <Dave__> freakin awesome things
P5:49:37 <Dave__> xD
P5:49:49 <Dave__> someone here make a penis and have it printed
P5:50:01 <ZomBuster> convert to a more mainstream format and use one of those papercraft programs
P5:50:19 <JTE> nyaa... Everyone making their own servers.
P5:50:35 <aera> making servers is fun
P5:50:42 <Adura> Notch's lack of progress drives it.
P5:50:47 <aera> if not long and tricky
P5:51:00 <JTE> It's unfortunate.
P5:51:12 <Quatroking> hey guys, lets stalk citricsquid
P5:51:15 <JTE> >.> I think I'm the only one making my own client to go with my own server.
P5:51:19 <Quatroking> his name is Samuel Ryan, he lives in Stefford, UK

P5:51:55 <Quatroking> *stafford
P5:52:13 <Dave__> lol
P5:52:24 <Snowman> His name is Martijn van de Kerkhof, he lives in Rotterdam, NL
P5:52:28 <Super-Dot> He could make them stop being compatible with Minecraft
P5:52:39 <Super-Dot> Then poof, it's his own game
P5:52:54 <aera> JTE: I did consider one, albeit one with better graphics
P5:52:55 <gear> anyone ever play wurm?
P5:52:56 <Quatroking> No thats mine
P5:53:22 <Dave__> JTE: everyone is TRYING to make their own servers, but most of them will just suck or not get finished

P5:55:06 <Snowman> MDL is a programming language
P5:55:16 <JTE> Dave__: And of course, everyone sends them to ME for help. Because I'm the only one who actually posted anything. @.@;
P5:55:24 <Dave__> i know
P5:55:33 <Dave__> i was saying before not to send people to you
P5:55:36 <Snowman> JTE can you make me a server?
P5:55:38 <Snowman> :D
P5:55:41 <JTE> So I end up getting to meet every single person who wants to make a server. :3
P5:55:43 <Quatroking> If I could do three wishes
P5:56:10 <Quatroking> I would wish infinite money, super knowledge, and the ability to grant my own wishes
P5:56:12 <Dave__> i have an idea, tell them that they can make their own servers easily by deleting system32
P5:56:12 <JTE> Snowman: Sure. $15 and I'll make you a mod of my shitty ineffecient Perl script, $30 and I'll make you a new one from scratch. ;o
P5:56:22 <Snowman> I was kidding
P5:56:29 <JTE> :3 I wasn't.
P5:56:31 <Quatroking> then I'd create a global network where people's names and adresses wouldb e stored
P5:56:35 <Quatroking> boom baby
P5:56:41 <Quatroking> HELIOS YAY
P5:57:00 <JTE> I'm totally willing to make awesome custom servers for people, but I am sooo not doing it for free~ o.o
P5:57:05 <Dave__> i had a funny idea for a custom server feature, i definatly wouldn't be able to do it though lol
P5:57:13 <Snowman> But noone will pay :p
P5:57:35 <JTE> The last time I did it for free, the person couldn't even run the damn server and it was wasted effort. :(
P5:57:37 <ZomBuster> <Quatroking> then I'd create a global network where people's names and adresses wouldb e stored
P5:57:37 <peerkoel> they're not even paying for their OS, let alone their entertainment :P
P5:57:43 <Dave__> lmaoooo JTE
P5:57:54 <Quatroking> Zombuster: yesh
P5:57:56 <ZomBuster> then you pick out all jewish people and kill them D:?
P5:58:05 <Quatroking> Nah
P5:58:14 <JTE> Jews are SO last century.
P5:58:15 <Snowman> And then you'd name everyone Martijn van de Kerkhof?
P5:58:18 <Quatroking> I'd deliver osama
P5:58:25 <Quatroking> and be internet hero
P5:58:37 <Snowman> Internet hero Martijn
P5:58:42 <Quatroking> and be the ultimate troll
P5:58:45 <Dave__> how did we get to this topic
P5:58:55 <JTE> Something about slinkies.
P5:58:57 <Quatroking> by posting people's adresses and threatening rape and stuff
P5:58:57 <Snowman> This topic? Du sa "mnja" nÃ¤r vi dansa. Har aldrig trÃ¤ffat nÃ¥n som du.
P5:59:10 <Snowman> Quatro wants to stalk and rape Notch
P5:59:19 <Super-Dot> JTE, I still plan on running the server :O
P5:59:36 <Dave__> go suck a dick quat lol notch aint that interesting
P5:59:38 <Dave__> stalk me
P5:59:41 <Dave__> im awesome
P5:59:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah, I wanna know, what does "mnja" mean?
P5:59:48 <Super-Dot> But I need my dad to do the port forwarding, and he's extremely busy with work lately
P5:59:52 <Quatroking> What
P5:59:59 <Snowman> mnja is phonetic
P6:00:01 <Snowman> not a word
P6:00:04 <Quatroking> Baga
P6:00:10 <vdgmprgrmr> So... what's the significance of it?
P6:00:12 <Quatroking> baga baga baga baga baga

P6:00:39 <Dave__> NONSENSE I TELL YOU
P6:00:46 <Quatroking> Dave__: you don't have a sexy beard like Notch does
P6:00:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Now the whole meaning of the topic, I have lost.
P6:00:59 <Quatroking> Notch is the beardking of kings
P6:01:08 <Dave__> shut up
P6:01:18 <Dave__> can't grow a beard when your 15
P6:01:27 <Quatroking> uh
P6:01:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Originally I thought it said "You said mnja when we danced. I have never met anyone like you." (approximately) and figured mnja would be something very much not meh.
P6:01:29 <Snowman> Zing
P6:01:30 <PuyoDead> I challenge him to a bread off
P6:01:32 <ZomBuster> I had a beard 2 feet long when I was 15
P6:01:32 <PuyoDead> err
P6:01:36 <PuyoDead> lovely typo there
P6:01:36 <Quatroking> Dave__, get into puberty
P6:01:39 <Quatroking> honestly
P6:01:42 <PuyoDead> beard off
P6:01:45 <vdgmprgrmr> (Note that I'm using Google translate.)
P6:01:47 <Snowman> vdgm, Its just a guess, not sure
P6:01:49 <ZomBuster> beard off?
P6:01:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, Dave, you CAN grow a beard at 15.
P6:01:55 <Quatroking> WHO HERE HAS A BEARD
P6:01:57 <ZomBuster> is that a movie where 2 men switch beards
P6:01:57 <Quatroking> I DO
P6:01:59 <PuyoDead> I DOES
P6:02:07 <vdgmprgrmr> I've seen it happen!

P6:02:13 <Dave__> yeah i have to
P6:02:18 <ZomBuster> mhh I havent shaved for like a week
P6:02:18 <Dave__> but i don't use a razor
P6:02:21 <ZomBuster> counts as a beard
P6:02:23 <Quatroking> Drakkar, are you there
P6:02:24 <vdgmprgrmr> Do weak moustaches get into the bear party?
P6:02:28 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
P6:02:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Bear party.
P6:02:34 <Dave__> so it doesn't grow much
P6:02:47 <Quatroking> I shave twice a week
P6:02:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't want in the bear party, actually.
P6:02:53 <Dave__> same
P6:02:56 <Quatroking> Didn't do it lately tho
P6:03:07 <Dave__> but with the thingies that make a buzzing noice

P7:26:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Hatehatehate
P7:26:26 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: I'm glad, that's why we have "vdgmprgrmr is a massive gay" forum.
P7:26:34 <citricsquid> most active, as a matter of fact!
P7:26:44 <gear> i love that forum
P7:26:46 <gear> so funny
P7:27:05 <vdgmprgrmr> All those guys wishing they could have gay sex with me or something?
P7:27:12 <gear> we cant answer that
P7:27:20 <Wolfram> It's more of a preventative action brainstorming kind of thing.
P7:27:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Which just makes me hate it even more.
P7:27:47 <vdgmprgrmr> WHY IS IT SECRETZ?
P7:27:51 <Wolfram> BECAUSE
P7:27:53 <citricsquid> if that's what sex is, I hope I never have it.
P7:27:57 <Wolfram> IF WE SHARED OUR ANTI GAY PLANS WITH YOU
P7:27:59 <Wolfram> YOU WOULD DEFEAT THEM
P7:28:30 <vdgmprgrmr> No srsly why is it sercetz?
P7:28:55 <citricsquid> we also have a secret beard appreciation section, where we discuss users beards and have a leader board. That's how we choose new mods. (besides zuriki!)
P7:29:29 <potato> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a9ceb955a157feaf49d59e414476d78d map of the week
P7:29:31 <Wolfram> I'm not entirely convinced that Zuriki doesn't have a beard.
P7:29:34 <vdgmprgrmr>  -_- avoiding a real answer, I see.
P7:29:45 <Wolfram> In fact, I think I'm the only staffer with a beard.
P7:29:51 <Wolfram> Also, video game programmer
P7:29:53 <Dave__> ...
P7:30:02 <Wolfram> There are some things that do not need to be discussed out in the open
P7:30:10 <Dave__> your beard reminds me of guy fawkes
P7:30:14 <vdgmprgrmr> Like wut?
P7:30:22 <Wolfram> Say we have someone on the forum being obnoxious
P7:30:29 <Dave__> hmm?
P7:30:31 <Dave__> me?
P7:30:31 <Wolfram> And we want to discuss whether or not the person needs to be punished
P7:30:34 <PuyoDead> citric: woo! I'm next in line then, right? right?
P7:30:37 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: the secret forum is just where we discuss forum changes, nothing interesting. 
P7:30:40 <Snowman> Hmmm... haven't seen any griefers make this yet http://www.buzzfeed.com/eliot/lol-swastika-tattoo-26q
P7:30:53 <vdgmprgrmr> If you discuss forum changes, I think it should at least be readable.
P7:31:00 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: funilly enough, yes.
P7:31:28 <PuyoDead> oh man, I hope I don't have to shave, I'll lose all my chances
P7:31:28 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: It's stuff like how to deal with spam and how to improve mod tools, nothing that involves the "public".
P7:31:31 <Wolfram> Dave__, my beard isn't Guy Fawkesy, is it? o.o;
P7:31:45 <PuyoDead> wolf, I'm going to be honest, my first thought was Gary Oldman
P7:31:50 <Wolfram> There you go citricsquid
P7:31:54 <vdgmprgrmr> So... I still think it should be readable -_-
P7:31:54 <Wolfram> Good answer
P7:31:57 <Dave__> you have a moustanch and a goatee right?
P7:32:07 <Dave__> thats what i saw in the pic
P7:32:13 <Wolfram> Gary Oldman! What!
P7:32:33 <Wolfram> Okay, hold on. I need to do some image searching...-.-
P7:32:33 <Dave__> lmao
P7:33:09 <Wolfram> Well, Fawkes himself had a much fuller beard
P7:33:11 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: one topic is me suggesting rules, another is zuriki asking about disabling postcount in forum games, one is asking about spam bots and another about notifying notch of a game breaking bug. None of these need to be public...
P7:33:24 <Wolfram> But the masks are fairly similar, except for the curve on the stache
P7:33:38 <citricsquid> I watched v for vendetta earlier, awesome film.
P7:34:00 <Wolfram> As for Gary Oldman, PuyoDead
P7:34:02 <Wolfram> http://n2.nabble.com/file/n2553678/039_9741.jpg
P7:34:10 <PuyoDead> heh
P7:34:10 <Wolfram> I guess that's pretty similar in THAT CASE
P7:34:21 <Wolfram> But I'd never seen him like that prior!
P7:34:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Uh, actually, a few of those I think should be totally public. Like the SUGGESTION TOPICS.
P7:34:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Are only mods allowed to have any knowledge of forum suggestions or some-such?
P7:35:07 <Wolfram> What the crap are you talking about
P7:35:08 <Wolfram> Forum rules?
P7:35:15 <Wolfram> I'd definitely call that mod business
P7:35:20 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: so seeing mods disagree with each other in public makes for a better forum? There is nothing in private that would directly affect users. if we're changing something for users we discuss it publicly.
P7:36:08 <gear> any WoW nerds in here?
P7:36:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I know that's not true because both RULES and the forum games thing both DIRECTLY affect the public.
P7:36:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Both of those I think should be open for both reading AND posting.
P7:36:51 <Wolfram> If you want to make your own post somewhere about what rules you think should affect the forums, go ahead vdgmprgrmr
P7:37:12 <Wolfram> But when a moderator or administrator is considering action of some kind and wants the opinion of his fellow moderators/administrators
P7:37:19 <Wolfram> Those conversations need not be in a public forum
P7:37:23 <Wolfram> And in fact, if there were no private forum
P7:37:27 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: So we shouldn't be allowed to discuss anything privatley? For example, I asked the other mods opinions on bumping and how we should approach it, I don't see why that should be in public, if it was we'd end up with users saying "but this mod said here that he thinks it should be like this, you're a sucky mod!"
P7:37:30 <Wolfram> I would take it to private messages somewhere anyway
13P7:37:32 * citricsquid should never have mentioned private forum haha
P7:37:39 <Wolfram> And never post publicly
P7:38:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe something along the lines of, you know, the fact that more people than mods actually have any idea how they would like their forum to work?
P7:38:03 <PuyoDead> I would just assume there is one... y'know, like every other forum in existance
P7:38:16 <Wolfram> You are free to suggest whatever you like, vdgmprgrmr
P7:38:20 <Wolfram> So is everyone else
P7:38:51 <vdgmprgrmr> So maybe if you're going to debate how to handle bumping, the community you're dictating should have a say as well?
12P7:38:51 * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) Quit (Quit: Tata)
P7:39:16 <Dave__> .. bumping?
P7:39:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Why have a private thread for something like that?
P7:39:24 <Wolfram> Having that forum is no different from NOT having it, don't you see?
P7:39:29 <Wolfram> We would communicate privately nonetheless
P7:39:31 <Dave__> at most forums i frequent the rule is you have to wait 3 days to bump
P7:39:32 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: why? The moderators are the ones dealing with it, they should have the final say. IF we ended up with 2 viable options we'd ask the public.
P7:39:41 <Wolfram> We could totally fry the hidden forum
P7:39:43 <PuyoDead> is it such an odd idea that forum mods should be able to talk privately?
P7:39:44 <Wolfram> And you'd still never see a word of it
P7:39:53 <Wolfram> It's not, it really isnt
P7:39:54 <Dave__> wtf are you guys talking about
P7:39:55 <Wolfram> isn't, rather.
P7:40:01 <citricsquid> Wolfram: I wonder if he's worked it doesn't really exist yet! winkwink
P7:40:10 <PuyoDead> I don't see why it's so astoundingly bad
P7:40:11 <Wolfram> Har
P7:40:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not saying mods shouldn't be able to talk privately, I'm saying that you should at least let things like FORUM CHANGES be public.
P7:40:35 <Wolfram> They're public enough. Besides, do you have any ideas for the forum?
P7:40:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Hell, we should have a private message system, anyway.
P7:40:42 <Wolfram> Yes, we should
P7:40:46 <Wolfram> And it's been suggested everywhere
P7:40:48 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: if it's something that your input is valuable on, then yes. but why should you the user dictate how the rules work? The mods are the ones enforcing it.
P7:40:52 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: working on that.
P7:40:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm not saying I do, but that doesn't mean the whole point is moot.
P7:40:54 <PuyoDead> do you really think any big forum change wouldn't be public? they're not just going to swap everything around as a surprise
P7:41:04 <PuyoDead> besides, most of that stuff has been public
P7:41:22 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying that the users should have free say and be able to see what the moderators are planning to put on THEM.
P7:41:40 <PuyoDead> hence why changes are announced publicly before rolling out
P7:41:41 <Wolfram> You say that like we're a team of evil tyrants
P7:42:01 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm saying that you're keeping stuff private that really doesn't need to be private.
P7:42:08 <PuyoDead> or, if it's something minor, feedback is taken to see if it really worked or not
P7:42:19 <Wolfram> And I'm saying that's a matter of opinion
P7:42:33 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: so if you post porn and we want to discuss whether or not it deserves a ban it should be public? Or if we want to discuss if there should be a rule about postingg images, it should be public?
P7:42:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe THAT should be in a PRIVATE MESSAGE.
P7:42:55 <citricsquid> if user input would be valuable, it is public. it seems silly to expect everything to be public.
P7:43:21 <vdgmprgrmr> But discussing freaking potential forum changes is something that should be completely open.
P7:43:34 <PuyoDead> total forum democracy = dead forum
P7:43:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Seeing how it affects more users than it does mods.
P7:43:48 <Wolfram> This system works totally fine
P7:43:54 <vdgmprgrmr> And they probably care a hell of a lot more about how the forum works.
P7:43:56 <Wolfram> If we can't decide on something and need input
P7:43:57 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: so we should be asking users how the mods should handle the rules? wtf.
P7:43:58 <Wolfram> We can call a vote
P7:44:01 <Wolfram> Then, and only then
P7:44:16 <Wolfram> Generally, we're sensible enough to implement things that need implementation
P7:44:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, you should allow the users to suggest how to handle forum rules.
P7:44:42 <PuyoDead> that's... silly
P7:44:48 <Wolfram> I disagree, vdgmprgrmr
P7:44:52 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr I disagree also.
P7:44:56 <Wolfram> I pose that among forum users
P7:45:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Well I disagree vehemently with both of you.
P7:45:06 <PuyoDead> let's just ask the public how the cops should enforce laws
P7:45:07 <citricsquid> without structure or people overlooking, a community will fail.
P7:45:49 <vdgmprgrmr> I SAY THAT THE USERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A SAY IN FORUM CHANGES, ie rules.
P7:46:07 <citricsquid> we're not saying they shouldn't, but there are cases where it isn't appropriate.
P7:46:10 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P7:46:24 <vdgmprgrmr> And even if you don't allow them to have a say, at least let them SEE what you're saying.
12P7:46:27 * Sl1N0 (Nilsoinas@dsl-roibrasgw1-feb8dc00-106.dhcp.inet.fi) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
P7:46:38 <Wolfram> That's totally ridiculous
P7:46:44 <Wolfram> If they can't affect the discussion
P7:46:48 <Wolfram> Then they don't NEED to see it
P7:46:50 <Wolfram> And, in fact
P7:46:53 <Wolfram> They NEVER need to see it
P7:46:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I think having some sort of secret mod association is ridiculous.
P7:46:58 <Wolfram> Because they can suggest things elsewhere
P7:47:08 <Wolfram> Yeah, absurd for us to work as a team
P7:47:14 <Wolfram> How dare we even mention it
P7:47:18 <PuyoDead> err, every forum works that way
P7:47:20 <vdgmprgrmr> I never said it was absurd to work as a goddamn team.
P7:47:23 <citricsquid> furthermore they can use that to their advantage. If the moderators aren't seen as "unified" it doesn't work.
P7:47:28 <Wolfram> Calm yourself
P7:47:28 <vdgmprgrmr> I said it was ridiculous to have secret associations.

P7:47:50 <Wolfram> You know, this argument goes nowhere
P7:47:55 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: why is it unreasonable for the people administering the rules and regulations to have a private discussion about them?
P7:47:56 <Wolfram> We have our position and you have yours
P7:48:00 <PuyoDead> it goes over there
13P7:48:07 * PuyoDead points to left field
P7:48:47 <vdgmprgrmr> Any kinds of SUGGESTIONS should be public, regardless of who makes them.
P7:49:19 <vdgmprgrmr> "I suggest that post count is disabled in the forum games section" has no reason at all for being private.
P7:49:23 <Wolfram> I don't think allowing people who have no hand in the implementation or enforcement of rules or changes should have ANYTHING to do with the creative process
P7:49:33 <Wolfram> That's been suggested outside of that forum, vdgmprgrmr
P7:49:38 <citricsquid> we should be seen as a team, we work as a team. we shouldn't be seen as individuals, that allows people to "target" mods. For example if wolfram thinks porn is okay and every other mod doesn't, then we go with "porn is bad" but if users can see "I think porn should be allowed" by wolfram they're going to use that to their advantage.
P7:49:40 <Wolfram> We talked about it after it was suggested
P7:49:53 <Wolfram> I do think porn is okay, incidentally
P7:49:56 <citricsquid> :P
P7:50:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Then why is it even freaking there?
P7:50:15 <Wolfram> To determine whether or not we would implement it
P7:50:27 <Wolfram> The suggestion was taken in to consideration
P7:50:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Was there really much debate?
P7:50:42 <Wolfram> Why? Need to see the documentation?
P7:50:50 <Wolfram> Can we do it, should we do it, etc
P7:51:20 <citricsquid> It's like the government, if one of baracks administration says in public "global warming is a lie!" then it weakens the government as a whole, conflict within a group of people who are supposed to govern only causes problems. 
P7:51:26 <vdgmprgrmr> I would say, "Gee, maybe that should be in private messages." but alas, the forums suck too bad for that.
P7:51:46 <citricsquid> *citricsquid sucks for being too lazy to make it.
P7:52:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P7:52:02 <Wolfram> Pretty insulting, regardless that he shrugged it off
P7:52:06 <AnnihilatorBeta> you lazy bastard
P7:52:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't care.
P7:52:12 <Wolfram> I generally have a respect for you, vdgmprgrmr

P7:52:34 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: what's bad about them? besides crappy mark as read and no pms? :(
P7:52:45 <citricsquid> if you havea suggestion, feel free to post it!
P7:53:04 <citricsquid> however obviously we'll ignore it and only change what we want because we're super secret nazis!
P7:53:07 <citricsquid> ;)
P7:53:12 <AnnihilatorBeta> yeah
P7:53:17 <PuyoDead> hey, I do have one... oddity, coincidentally. often, "new" posts are marked as read, on their own
P7:53:21 <PuyoDead> just to interject
P7:53:32 <Wolfram> Happens to everyone, I believe
P7:53:35 <mail2345> the whole "new" post system is broken
P7:53:38 <Dave__> golly gee, that sounds like fun, can i be a super secret nazi mr. nazi sir?
P7:53:41 <AnnihilatorBeta> the forum's problem itself i suppose
P7:53:43 <vdgmprgrmr> (It is.)
P7:53:50 <Dave__> lol
P7:53:52 <AnnihilatorBeta> i think we should change forums
P7:53:55 <AnnihilatorBeta> that's my suggestion
P7:54:12 <citricsquid> PuyoDead: It seems to gay up, it has a 6 minute inactive time, so it only shows posts since last time you were active and resets them after another 6 mins of inactivity, gonna fix it.
P7:54:16 <citricsquid> AnnihilatorBeta: to what?
P7:54:16 <PuyoDead> they're better than the old ones, that's for sure
P7:54:30 <Wolfram> citricsquid is in charge of the forums, so it's his call; but I DO think he should be a little more active in the shaping of them
P7:54:40 <Wolfram> Not to talk about you as if you weren't here, citricsquid
P7:54:45 <Dave__> lol

P7:54:46 <citricsquid> Wolfram: I will not stand for that, banbanban!
P7:54:54 <Wolfram> Same principle as that index post I mentioned. Upkeep is essential
P7:54:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> phpbb?
P7:54:59 <Wolfram> Once charge is taken, in any case
P7:55:13 <Dave__> why is this one of those lesser know forum systems...
P7:55:16 <Dave__> why not smf?
P7:55:21 <Dave__> smf is the bomb
P7:55:23 <citricsquid> Wolfram: I agree though, I'll make a topic and see what everyone wants - in public to please vdg - and then work through them.
P7:55:31 <AnnihilatorBeta> smf is okay
P7:55:34 <citricsquid> smf, phpbb etc are too bloated for easy customization, imo.
P7:55:42 <vdgmprgrmr> See, public is goodgood.
P7:55:49 <Dave__> for your own customization yes
P7:55:51 <PuyoDead> what about smurfs?
P7:55:55 <Dave__> but there are a ton of mods
P7:55:59 <Dave__> phpbb sucks now
P7:56:00 <AnnihilatorBeta> is hat the reason it's not being taken in?
P7:56:05 <Dave__> what about ipb?
P7:56:11 <Super-Dot> Easy customization is good for when you're making custom stuff like minecraftskins.net
P7:56:12 <Dave__> it costs money but it IS the best
12P7:56:27 * Arg (chatzilla@d58-104-81-124.dsl.vic.optusnet.com.au) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
P7:56:34 <Dave__> yeah i guess
P7:56:39 <citricsquid> the problem with all the software I know of is it's too bloated. I like fluxbb because it's a simple core I can build around, phpbb etc aren't.
P7:56:50 <Dave__> mhhm
P7:56:54 <LKA> simplemachines
P7:57:00 <Wolfram> citricsquid; there are plenty of things already on the plate that need implementation
P7:57:02 <citricsquid> It's like the difference between flatgrass and standard, flatgrass is easier to build on because you have much more freedom.
P7:57:14 <LKA> simplemachines forums :3c
P7:57:16 <LKA> useee iiiiiit
P7:57:20 <citricsquid> Wolfram: I'll make a topic with what I know of and get working on them. Lan party friday, I'll do it then :D
P7:57:21 <Dave__> but flatgrass is boring
P7:57:25 <Dave__> wheres the challenge
P7:57:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Standard has more building possibilities, I think.
P7:57:35 <Dave__> theres no caves
P7:57:35 <Wolfram> As long as you don't procrastinate further than that!
P7:57:36 <Dave__> :(
P7:57:41 <Dave__> lol
P7:57:47 <Wolfram> This forum changing business was already discussed ON the forum, by the way
P7:57:49 <Akai> Citricsquid?
P7:57:54 <Wolfram> And a decision was reached
P7:57:58 <citricsquid> akai: ?
P7:58:11 <Akai> have you checked your memos lately?
P7:58:14 <Wolfram> citricsquid prefers the current platform, and since he's doing all the work on it, that's definitely his call
P7:58:23 <citricsquid> I'll make a topic with everything I know of and my plan for what to do, then users can add their ideas.
P7:58:50 <Dave__> you have fun with that
P7:58:50 <citricsquid> and I'll add them with levels of urgency etc, my problem is if I don't have a clear structure of work needing to be done I get distracted and do nothing :D
P7:58:56 <Dave__> im going to eat my lasagna
P7:59:14 <Dave__> which has more calories that what squid eats in a day
P7:59:14 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'm going to fire my laserga
P7:59:31 <vdgmprgrmr> srsly, I think even if the public is unaffected, we should be able to see the inner workings of the forum mod-squad. Even if we can't post. Just because I have dedicated hate-spewers for secret things.
P8:00:00 <Dave__> shut up vdgm, the mod should have a place of their own
P8:00:03 <Dave__> *mods
P8:00:04 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr but showing disagreements between the "establishment" is bad...
P8:00:12 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't think so.
P8:00:19 <citricsquid> if we're shown to disagree members can use that to their advantage...
P8:00:23 <PuyoDead> I'm sorry, that's just an absurd idea
P8:00:24 <Super-Dot> I think forum changes should be public, but I can understand sensitive moderation issue being private
P8:00:25 <citricsquid> we should be seen as a unit, not individuals.
P8:00:35 <vdgmprgrmr> I see no reason for people disagreeing being construed as bad.
P8:00:43 <AnnihilatorBeta> like a hivemind?
P8:00:52 <vdgmprgrmr> And, uh, I don't think ANYONE sees the moderators as a single unit.
P8:00:52 <Dave__> i run some forums, if the members suddently told me they want to see everything behind the scenes, i'd tell em to screw off
P8:00:53 <Dave__> lol
P8:00:54 <LKA> vdgm: people will go "BUT MOD X DIDN'T LIKE THIS, IT MEANS IT'S BAD"
P8:00:58 <PuyoDead> there's plenty of (clearly outlined) reason
P8:00:59 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: so what happens when someone sees a topic where me and wolfram disagree then uses that to their advantage?
P8:01:04 <Super-Dot> I'm not sure that disagreements between mods is a bad thing, as long as there's a canonical rulebook
P8:01:09 <PuyoDead> +s
P8:01:10 <Dave__> cuz im a nazi too :D
P8:01:23 <vdgmprgrmr> How would they possibly use that to their advantage?
P8:01:33 <Dave__> im pretty confused and am just trying to keep up with this convo
P8:01:34 <Super-Dot> As long as mods agree that the rulebook is the law, disagreements shouldn't be a problem
P8:01:44 <PuyoDead> there's plenty of (clearly outlined) reasons
P8:02:07 <PuyoDead> the other large forum I'm on has multiple levels of mods, and they all have their boards
P8:02:08 <Dave__> is this a disagreement about forum rules?
P8:02:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Super-Dot makes good point.
P8:02:19 <vdgmprgrmr> No, it's a disagreement about secrety things.
P8:02:23 <Wolfram> No, this is an argument about what moderators can talk about amongst themselves
P8:02:30 <Dave__> oh
P8:02:42 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: user: "This is a picture of my penis!" mod: "Porn is not allowed here, please don't do this again", user: "but I saw wolfram say in the discussion topic he likes it, just because you don't citricsquid!"
P8:02:47 <Super-Dot> It's more an argument about what moderators can hide from other people
P8:03:04 <Wolfram> At the end of the day
P8:03:11 <Dave__> i say: mods a god, they can do what they want
P8:03:11 <PuyoDead> this is my responce to all this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7f/Graham_Chapman_Colonel.jpg
P8:03:16 <vdgmprgrmr> And so Super-Dot's argument comes into play. <Super-Dot>As long as mods agree that the rulebook is the law, disagreements shouldn't be a problem
P8:03:17 <Wolfram> We're going to keep doing it whether or not everyone hates us for it because it's a useful tool
P8:03:18 <Dave__> *mods are god
P8:03:27 <Wolfram> So this entire argument is moot
P8:03:38 <Dave__> you guys can even chat about how awesome i am in your secret board
P8:03:48 <Wolfram> No one is required to agree with it, understand it or anything else
P8:03:56 <PuyoDead> if you don't get the reference: http://www.cslacker.com/images/file/mediums/stop_that.jpg
P8:04:12 <Dave__> a silly looking uniform?
P8:04:12 <Wolfram> Because ultimately, everyone who has something to say about the way the forum works can put in their two cents anywhere they please
P8:04:18 <Dave__> the mods don't uniforms do they?
P8:04:22 <Wolfram> Both before and after something is changed
P8:04:23 <Super-Dot> To be clear, I think a secret forum is a good idea for some things
P8:04:35 <Wolfram> So they do NOT need to eavesdrop in, per se
P8:04:39 <Dave__> you people take things too seriously
P8:04:40 <Dave__> really
P8:04:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Well I say you're asses.
P8:05:01 <Wolfram> You have the right to think so
P8:05:07 <Dave__> suck it vdgm
P8:05:08 <Super-Dot> Oh don't you ad hominem now
P8:05:12 <PuyoDead> hah
P8:05:21 <Dave__> wait... i think i've heard your username before vdgm
P8:05:22 <Wolfram> Don't insult him, Dave__
P8:05:22 <citricsquid> it's like your parents, they don't want you to listen in when they discuss whether or not they think you're a good child, I don't think that's unreasonable. You wouldn't want your friends listening, would you?
P8:05:28 <Dave__> you don't use gamemaker, do you?
P8:05:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I would want me listening to them. Whether it was good or bad.
P8:06:04 <Super-Dot> He prgrms vdgms, that's for sure
P8:06:10 <vdgmprgrmr> Secrety things -> dedicated hate-spewers
P8:06:15 <PuyoDead> I generally like you, vdg... but this is just weird. I wouldn't expect this of you
P8:06:38 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm sorry. :S
P8:06:48 <PuyoDead> not even "oh, this is dumb" more of a general O_O
P8:06:53 <Wolfram> It's his own personal bias that clouds his otherwise open mind
P8:06:58 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr: maybe you were raised differently, but I've also been under the "thinking" that not everything should be public.
P8:07:01 <Wolfram> Not to talk about you as if you weren't here, vdgmprgrmr
P8:07:09 <Dave__> members shouldn't have the power to choose how mods operate, period.
P8:07:24 <PuyoDead> now, back to making ez
P8:07:30 <citricsquid> I don't want to know everything and I regret half the stuff I do know, I wouldn't want my peers to know if I was being considered for a ban :(
P8:07:47 <Super-Dot> vdgmprgrmr: If you don't like secret things, why do you want private messages?
P8:08:03 <Wolfram> So we can read them, I hope
P8:08:06 <vdgmprgrmr> So people can communicate insignificant things.
P8:08:09 <Super-Dot> Ah
P8:08:14 <vdgmprgrmr> That's how I used PMs, anyway.
P8:08:22 <Dave__> this is a truely mind numbing topic
P8:08:28 <Dave__> stop being paranoid vdgm
P8:08:41 <Dave__> they aren't plotting against us
P8:08:45 <Super-Dot> I can understand his point of view
P8:09:01 <Super-Dot> It's very similar to how I hate admincrete
P8:09:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> they're plotting against us? omguh
P8:09:05 <Dave__> were mods talking about him in the secret place of something?
P8:09:16 <vdgmprgrmr> No, I don't like secret places is all.
P8:09:17 <Wolfram> No, in fact and for your own peace of mind
P8:09:24 <Wolfram> He's never been mentioned
P8:09:37 <Dave__> have i?
P8:09:38 <Dave__> :D
P8:09:43 <Wolfram> No, haha
P8:09:44 <PuyoDead> you must hate gamefaqs (although, they do suck, but you'd have a whole lot more reasons)
P8:09:46 <Dave__> how many mods think im awesome?
P8:09:48 <Wolfram> It's rarely a personal mention type of thing
P8:09:52 <mail2345> have been mentioned?
P8:10:09 <Dave__> lmao
P8:10:14 <mail2345> where did my I go.
P8:10:26 <Wolfram> You know, I'm going to decline to comment further on the SECRET forum

P8:11:57 <PuyoDead> obviosuly I haven't, heh
P8:11:59 <Wolfram> That you have such a mode lessens my opinion of you, vdgmprgrmr
P8:12:09 <Super-Dot> vdgmprgrmr can get vicious sometimes :D
P8:12:09 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm sorry, but, uh, I do.
P8:12:10 <citricsquid> flame wars are for people that can't argue their own points properly. this was discussion, not flaming :(
P8:12:11 <Wolfram> A debate is perfectly acceptable and I think you're well-suited for the task
P8:12:13 <Super-Dot> But that is why we love him
P8:12:18 <Wolfram> But a flame war, argument, anything like that
P8:12:22 <PuyoDead> I'm pretty sure I have had that mode to begin with
P8:12:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Usually, I do debate.

P8:17:12 <citricsquid> ANYWAY, in regards to the forum; I do agree it sucks quite a bit, it was only ever thrown together without much planning, I made it in ~30 mins and didn't expect it to last. I'll do some major revamping asap.
P8:17:20 <vdgmprgrmr> (It was Roras, if anyone remembers the guy.)

P8:17:45 <Dave__> yay thanks squid
P8:17:52 <JRCrusher> Hey, I've got a problem, when I try to run "minecraft-server.jar" it tells me that my Main-Class manifest failed to load. Caqn someone help me?
P8:17:57 <Wolfram> How did that argument turn out anyway, vdgmprgrmr
P8:17:57 <citricsquid> I have a test site set up, so any changes can be mulled over by users first - just for you vdgmprgrmr!
P8:18:00 <Wolfram> The words one?
P8:18:13 <citricsquid> JRCrusher: got the latest java installed?
P8:18:19 <JRCrusher> i think so
P8:18:20 <PuyoDead> to those people, I consider them troll or idiots. either way, not worth even acknowledging
P8:18:22 <Dave__> citricsquid: hey do you run minecraft.net too? or is that just notch?
P8:18:31 <vdgmprgrmr> It turned out with me refusing to further communicate with the person due to extreme stupidity.
P8:18:38 <PuyoDead> good call
P8:18:42 <citricsquid> Dave__: that's notch, I'm just a minecraft player that runs lots of community sites.
P8:18:47 <Dave__> oh
P8:18:54 <Dave__> i wondered why they had different domains
P8:18:57 <Wolfram> I think it depends on the situation
P8:19:03 <Wolfram> Roadsigns are a good example of images over words
P8:19:08 <citricsquid> man, I should like, put it in my name or something. I've got lots of emails also :P 
P8:19:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Of course, after the twentieth time he made some ridiculous response, or made one of those absurd things I outlined with the keyboards, I started having to say things like, "NO DAMMIT I AM NOT FUCKING SAYING THAT"
P8:20:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Because actually just CUTTING an argument off feels really bad to me.
P8:20:17 <Dave__> i see minecraftmaps.net is being used, i wonder who that could be
P8:21:39 <GuitarFreak> squid you aren't shutting your servers down, are you?
P8:21:54 <citricsquid> Dave__: :P
P8:22:06 <PuyoDead> it's absolutely necessary sometimes vdg
P8:22:13 <citricsquid> GuitarFreak: most likely, too much hassle. distracts me from productive stuff :D
P8:22:18 <GuitarFreak> aww
P8:22:33 <Wolfram> There's a point where you should be able to acknowledge
10P8:22:37 * Genisi is now known as Raiho
P8:22:42 <GuitarFreak> just when i find a server i like
P8:22:48 <Wolfram> That the only person you can possibly convince to produce a "victory"
P8:22:52 <Wolfram> Simply will not be convinced
P8:23:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I've come to the conclusion that all forms of debate may as well be useless.
P8:23:53 <vdgmprgrmr> Because people actually moving to the other side of an argument happens so rarely, it's negligible.
P8:23:56 <potato> i made a desert map
P8:24:02 <potato> come see, anyone?
P8:24:03 <Wolfram> You're not always after your opponent
P8:24:07 <potato> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=a9ceb955a157feaf49d59e414476d78d
P8:24:09 <PuyoDead> depends on the people taking part
P8:24:11 <Wolfram> Generally, you're after everyone else
P8:24:19 <Dave__> hmm i think minecraftservers.net is free
P8:24:23 <Dave__> i might snatch that on

P8:24:42 <vdgmprgrmr> The best way to perpetuate any idea is to "remove" opposition to the idea.
P8:24:48 <citricsquid> vdgmprgrmr, meh I disagree, I've had quite a few of my opinions changed regarding minecraft, wolfram totally changed my opinion on spawn prisons.
P8:25:02 <PuyoDead> not really to remove, but to educate
P8:25:11 <vdgmprgrmr> That's just it. Education is impossible.
P8:25:15 <Wolfram> Differentiate between people that are worth talking to, and people that will only waste your time and increase your temper
P8:25:16 <PuyoDead> not always
P8:25:18 <Dave__> ...thats hitler talk vdgm
P8:25:24 <vdgmprgrmr> I know it's hitler-talk.
P8:25:30 <Dave__> lol
P8:25:36 <Dave__> but it is the most effective :p
P8:25:39 <citricsquid> The problem is most people only bother arguing if they're sure of the point they're making
P8:25:46 <citricsquid> so you'll always have a hard time changing them.
P8:25:47 <Dave__> well duh...
P8:25:54 <Dave__> why else argue
P8:25:57 <PuyoDead> on the internet?
P8:26:10 <PuyoDead> I think that point doesn't apply to internet "debates" :P
P8:26:15 <Dave__> im going to argue that my hair is purple
P8:26:21 <vdgmprgrmr> I mean, look at communism.
P8:26:21 <Wolfram> A debate is a debate
P8:26:25 <Wolfram> Just pick your battles
P8:26:25 <JRCrusher> the problem is if you find yourself against someone who can't stand "loosing"
P8:26:29 <vdgmprgrmr> I've tried to debate communism.

P8:27:17 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, argue with the standard "communism = slavery/genocide" and tell them what actual communism is intended to be, they still hate it, still think it's slavery/genocide.

P8:27:21 <stupinator> Wolfram
P8:27:23 <Dave__> damn you
P8:27:23 <Wolfram> How many players?
P8:27:32 <stupinator> probably for 3+
P8:27:36 <citricsquid> 3+ needs big
P8:27:38 <stupinator> 2player is just too linear
P8:27:40 <Dave__> projectpickaxe.com
P8:27:45 <Dave__> don't you dare touch that
P8:27:47 <Dave__> looool
P8:27:57 <citricsquid> multi layer with 8 people is fun :D
P8:28:00 <Dave__> how many domains do you have?
P8:28:00 <Wolfram> I don't think a big arena is justified by any fewer than eight people
P8:28:18 <citricsquid> Dave__: 8 minecraft domains, about 80 others ;_
P8:28:19 <Wolfram> Truly SMALL ones could probably house 4 depending on the desired match length
P8:28:25 <Dave__> wooow
P8:28:33 <Wolfram> For quick blitz matches and easy resets, small is the way to go
P8:28:43 <citricsquid> I never found small to be that much fun, they end too quick and it's mainly luck :(
P8:28:48 <UnknownX> citricsquid: which ones?
P8:28:51 <Dave__> good luck with taking over the whole minecraft community
P8:28:57 <Wolfram> My favorite arena is Sudden Death
P8:29:02 <UnknownX> i only know 5
P8:29:05 <Wolfram> Some dude called Named showed it to me

P8:30:02 <citricsquid> I have to compensate for my terrible person with domains :D
P8:30:20 <UnknownX> thats only seven

P10:58:31 <gear> learn python
P10:58:39 <gear> you can never know too many languages
P10:58:58 <PrinceOfFire59> i could never wear contacts.
P10:59:11 <vdgmprgrmr> I tried C++ but gave up due to it being COMPLETELY FREAKIN RIDICULOUS.
P10:59:18 <Super-Dot> Arguably, learning BASIC is counterproductive

P10:59:29 <vdgmprgrmr> I think you're right Super-Dot.
